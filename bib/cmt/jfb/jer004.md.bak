### [Jeremiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 4:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF ADDRESS TO THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL. ([Jer
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001).md). THE PROPHET TURNS AGAIN TO
JUDAH, TO WHOM HE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN SENT (Jer. 4:3-31). (Jer. 4:1-31)

return . . . return--play on words. "If thou wouldest return to thy land
(thou must first), return (by conversion and repentance) to Me."

not remove--no longer be an unsettled wanderer in a strange land. So
Cain ([Gen 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md), [Gen
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 4:2</span></span>

And thou--rather, "And if (carried on from [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001).md) thou shalt swear, 'Jehovah
liveth,' in truth, &c.", that is, if thou shalt worship Him (for we
swear by the God whom we worship; compare [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md); [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md); [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014).md) in sincerity, &c.

and the nations--Rather, this is apodosis to the "if"; then shall the
nations bless themselves in (by) Him" ([Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016).md). The conversion of the nations
will be the consequence of Israel's conversion ([Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), [Psa
102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 4:3</span></span>

Transition to Judah. Supply mentally. All which (the foregoing
declaration as to Israel) applies to Judah.

and Jerusalem--that is, and especially the men of Jerusalem, as being
the most prominent in Judea.

Break . . . fallow ground--that is, Repent of your idolatry, and so be
prepared to serve the Lord in truth ([Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); [Mat
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007).md). The unhumbled heart is like
ground which may be improved, being let out to us for that purpose, but
which is as yet fallow, overgrown with weeds, its natural product.

[Jeremiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 4:4</span></span>

Remove your natural corruption of heart ([Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Deu
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md); [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 4:5</span></span>

cry, gather together--rather, "cry fully" that is, loudly. The Jews are
warned to take measures against the impending Chaldean invasion (compare
[Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 4:6</span></span>

Zion--The standard toward Zion intimated that the people of the
surrounding country were to fly to it, as being the strongest of their
fortresses.

[Jeremiah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 4:7</span></span>

lion--Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans ([Jer
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014).md).

his thicket--lair; Babylon.

destroyer of the Gentiles--rather, "the nations" ([Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009).md).

[Jeremiah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 4:8</span></span>

Nothing is left to the Jews but to bewail their desperate condition.

anger . . . not turned back-- ([Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md), [Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), [Isa
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 4:9</span></span>

heart--The wisdom of the most leading men will be utterly at a loss to
devise means of relief.

[Jeremiah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 4:10</span></span>

thou hast . . . deceived--God, having even the false prophets in His
hands, is here said to do that which for inscrutable purposes He permits
them to do ([Exo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012.md); [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md); compare [Jer
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015.md); which passage shows that the
dupes of error were self-prepared for it, and that God's predestination
did not destroy their moral freedom as voluntary agents). The false
prophets foretold "peace," and the Jews believed them; God overruled
this to His purposes ([Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md); [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md); [Eze
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009).md).

soul--rather, "reacheth to the life."

[Jeremiah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 4:11</span></span>

dry wind--the simoom, terrific and destructive, blowing from the
southeast across the sandy deserts east of Palestine. Image of the
invading Babylonian army ([Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015).md).
Babylon in its turn shall be visited by a similar "destroying wind"
([Jer 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001).md).

of . . . high places--that is, that sweeps over the high places.

daughter--that is, the children of my people.

not to fan--a very different wind from those ordinary winds employed for
fanning the grain in the open air.

[Jeremiah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 4:12</span></span>

full . . . from those places--rather, "a wind fuller (that is, more
impetuous) than those winds" (which fan the corn) ([Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011).md) \[ROSENMULLER\].

unto me--"for Me," as My instrument for executing My purpose.

sentence--judgments against them ([Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 4:13</span></span>

clouds--continuing the metaphor in [Jer
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md). Clouds of sand and dust
accompany the simoom, and after rapid gyrations ascend like a pillar.

eagles-- ([Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md).

Woe unto us--The people are graphically presented before us, without it
being formally so stated, bursting out in these exclamations.

[Jeremiah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 4:14</span></span>

Only one means of deliverance is left to the Jews--a thorough
repentance.

vain thoughts--namely, projects for deliverance, such as enlisting the
Egyptians on their side. GESENIUS translates, "How long wilt thou harbor
vain thoughts?"

[Jeremiah 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 4:15</span></span>

For . . . from Dan--The connection is: There is danger in delay; for the
voice of a messenger announces the approach of the Chaldean enemy from
Dan, the northern frontier of Palestine ([Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md); compare [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md); [Jer
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014).md).

Mount Ephraim--which borders closely on Judah; so that the foe is coming
nearer and nearer. Dan and Beth-el in Ephraim were the two places where
Jeroboam set up the idolatrous calves ([Kg1
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029).md); just retribution.

[Jeremiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 4:16</span></span>

The neighboring foreign "nations" are summoned to witness Jehovah's
judgments on His rebel people ([Jer
6:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018).md).

watchers--that is, besiegers (compare [Sa2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#016).md); observed or watched, that is,
besieged.

their voice--the war shout.

[Jeremiah 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 4:17</span></span>

keepers of a field--metaphor from those who watch a field, to frighten
away the wild beasts.

[Jeremiah 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 4:18</span></span>

([Jer 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017.md), [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); [Psa
107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017).md).

this is thy wickedness--that is, the fruit of thy wickedness.

[Jeremiah 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 4:19</span></span>

The prophet suddenly assumes the language of the Jewish state
personified, lamenting its affliction ([Jer
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019.md); [Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md), [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md); [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md); compare [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041).md).

at my very heart--Hebrew, "at the walls of my heart"; the muscles round
the heart. There is a climax, the "bowels," the pericardium, the "heart"
itself.

maketh . . . noise--moaneth \[HENDERSON\].

alarm--the battle shout.

[Jeremiah 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 4:20</span></span>

Destruction . . . cried--Breach upon breach is announced ([Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); [Eze
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026).md). The war "trumpet" . . . the
battle shout . . . the "destructions" . . . the havoc throughout "the
whole land" . . . the spoiling of the shepherds "tents" ([Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md); or, "tents" means cities, which
should be overthrown as easily as tents \[CALVIN\]), form a gradation.

[Jeremiah 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 4:21</span></span>

Judah in perplexity asks, How long is this state of things to continue?

[Jeremiah 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 4:22</span></span>

Jehovah's reply; they cannot be otherwise than miserable, since they
persevere in sin. The repetition of clauses gives greater force to the
sentiment.

wise . . . evil . . . to do good . . . no knowledge--reversing the rule
([Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019).md) "wise unto . . . good,
simple concerning evil."

[Jeremiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 4:23</span></span>

Graphic picture of the utter desolation about to visit Palestine. "I
beheld, and lo!" four times solemnly repeated, heightens the awful
effect of the scene (compare [Isa
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019.md); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011).md).

without form and void--reduced to the primeval chaos ([Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 4:24</span></span>

mountains-- ([Isa 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025).md).

moved lightly--shook vehemently.

[Jeremiah 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 4:25</span></span>

no man . . . birds--No vestige of the human, or of the feathered
creation, is to be seen ([Eze 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#020.md);
[Zep 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 4:26</span></span>

fruitful place--Hebrew, Carmel.

a wilderness--Hebrew, "the wilderness," in contrast to "the fruitful
place"; the great desert, where Carmel was, there is now the desert of
Arabia \[MAURER\].

cities--in contrast to the fruitful place or field.

[Jeremiah 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 4:27</span></span>

full end--utter destruction: I will leave some hope of restoration ([Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md), [Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md); [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md); [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028.md); compare [Lev
26:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044).md).

[Jeremiah 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 4:28</span></span>

For this--on account of the desolations just described ([Isa
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md); [Hos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003).md).

not repent-- ([Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md).

[Jeremiah 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 4:29</span></span>

whole city--Jerusalem: to it the inhabitants of the country had fled for
refuge; but when it, too, is likely to fall, they flee out of it to hide
in the "thickets." HENDERSON translates, "every city."

noise--The mere noise of the hostile horsemen shall put you to flight.

[Jeremiah 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 4:30</span></span>

when thou art spoiled--rather, "thou, O destroyed one" \[MAURER\].

rentest . . . face with painting--Oriental women paint their eyes with
stibium, or antimony, to make them look full and sparkling, the black
margin causing the white of the eyes to appear the brighter by contrast
([Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md). He uses the term
"distendest" in derision of their effort to make their eyes look large
\[MAURER\]; or else, "rentest," that is, dost lacerate by puncturing the
eyelid in order to make the antimony adhere \[ROSENMULLER\]. So the Jews
use every artifice to secure the aid of Egypt against Babylon.

face--rather, thy eyes ([Eze 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040).md).

[Jeremiah 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 4:31</span></span>

anguish--namely, occasioned by the attack of the enemy.

daughter of Zion--There is peculiar beauty in suppressing the name of
the person in trouble, until that trouble had been fully described
\[HENDERSON\].

bewaileth herself--rather, "draweth her breath short" \[HORSLEY\];
"panteth."

spreadeth . . . hands-- ([Lam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017).md).
