### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 8:1</span></span>

He had been a brother already. Why, then, this prayer here? It refers to
the time after His resurrection, when the previous outward intimacy with
Him was no longer allowed, but it was implied it should be renewed at
the second coming ([Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017).md). For
this the Church here prays; meanwhile she enjoys inward spiritual
communion with Him. The last who ever "kissed" Jesus Christ on earth was
the traitor Judas. The bride's return with the King to her mother's
house answers to [Act 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#025.md), after the
mission to Samaria. The rest spoken of ([Sol
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004).md) answers to [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md).

that sucked . . . mother--a brother born of the same mother; the closest
tie.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 8:2</span></span>

Her desire to bring Him into her home circle ([Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041).md).

who would instruct me--rather, "thou wouldest instruct me," namely, how
I might best please thee ([Isa 11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md);
[Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); [Luk
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#012.md); [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md).

spiced wine--seasoned with aromatic perfumes. Jesus Christ ought to have
our choicest gifts. Spices are never introduced in the song in His
absence; therefore the time of His return from "the mountain of spices"
([Sol 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md) is contemplated. The cup
of betrothal was given by Him at the last supper; the cup or marriage
shall be presented by her at His return ([Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).md). Till then the believer often
cannot feel towards, or speak of, Him as he would wish.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 8:3</span></span>

The "left and right hand," &c., occurred only once actually ([Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006).md), and here optatively. Only at His
first manifestation did the Church palpably embrace Him; at His second
coming there shall be again sensible communion with Him. The rest in
[Sol 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004.md), which is a spiritual
realization of the wish in [Sol 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003.md)
([Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008).md), and the charge not to
disturb it, close the first, second, and fourth canticles; not the
third, as the bridegroom there takes charge Himself; nor the fifth, as,
if repose formed its close, we might mistake the present state for our
rest. The broken, longing close, like that of the whole Bible ([Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020).md), reminds us we are to be
waiting for a Saviour to come. On "daughters of Jerusalem," see on [Sol
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 8:5</span></span>

(CANTICLE V)--FROM THE CALL OF THE GENTILES TO THE CLOSE OF REVELATION.
([Sol 8:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005).md)

Who is this--Words of the daughters of Jerusalem, that is, the churches
of Judea; referring to Paul, on his return from Arabia ("the
wilderness"), whither he had gone after conversion ([Gal
1:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015).md).

I raised thee . . . she . . . bare thee-- ([Act
26:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014).md). The first words of Jesus
Christ to the bride since her going to the garden of nuts ([Sol
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md); so His appearance to Paul is
the only one since His ascension, [Sol
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md) is not an address of Him as
visible: her reply implies He is not visible ([Co1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008).md). Spiritually, she was found in
the moral wilderness ([Eze 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005.md); [Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005).md); but now she is "coming up from"
it ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014).md), especially in the last stage of
her journey, her conscious weakness casting itself the more wholly on
Jesus Christ ([Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009).md). "Raised"
([Eph 2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).md). Found ruined under the
forbidden tree ([Gen 3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md);
restored under the shadow of Jesus Christ crucified, "the green tree"
([Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031).md), fruit-"bearing" by the
cross ([Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md). "Born again by the Holy Ghost"
"there" ([Eze 16:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003).md). In this verse,
her dependence, in the similar verse, [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md), &c., His omnipotence to support
her, are brought out ([Deu 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 8:6</span></span>

Implying approaching absence of the Bridegroom.

seal--having her name and likeness engraven on it. His Holy Priesthood
also in heaven ([Exo 28:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006.md), Exo.
28:15-30; [Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014).md); "his heart"
there answering to "thine heart" here, and "two shoulders" to "arm."
(Compare [Jer 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md), with [Hag
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023).md). But the Holy Ghost ([Eph
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md). As in [Sol
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md), she was "leaning" on Him, that
is, her arm on His arm, her head on His bosom; so she prays now that
before they part, her impression may be engraven both on His heart and
His arm, answering to His love and His power ([Psa
77:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#015.md); see [Gen
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018.md); [Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md).

love is strong as death-- ([Act 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md);
[Rom 8:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md); [Rev
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011).md). This their love unto death
flows from His ([Joh 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md); [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).md).

jealousy . . . the grave--Zealous love, jealous of all that would come
between the soul and Jesus Christ ([Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md); [Psa
106:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030.md); [Luk
9:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060.md); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md); [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022).md).

cruel--rather, "unyielding" hard, as the grave will not let go those
whom it once holds ([Joh 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028).md).

a most vehement flame--literally, "the fire-flame of Jehovah" ([Psa
80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md); [Isa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006).md). Nowhere else is God's name found
in the Song. The zeal that burnt in Jesus Christ ([Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md); [Luk
12:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049).md) kindled in His followers
([Act 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md); [Rom
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030.md); [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 8:7</span></span>

waters--in contrast with the "coals of fire" ([Sol
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md); [Kg1
18:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#033).md). Persecutions ([Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).md) cannot quench love ([Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md); [Rev
12:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015).md). Our many provocations have
not quenched His love ([Rom 8:33-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md).

if . . . give all the substance . . . contemned--Nothing short of Jesus
Christ Himself, not even heaven without Him, can satisfy the saint ([Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008).md). Satan offers the world, as to
Jesus Christ ([Mat 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008).md), so to the
saint, in vain ([Jo1 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md); [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md). Nothing but our love in turn can
satisfy Him ([Co1 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 8:8</span></span>

The Gentile Church ([Eze 16:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#048).md). "We,"
that is, the Hebrew Church, which heretofore admitted Gentiles to
communion, only by becoming Judaic proselytes. Now first idolatrous
Gentiles are admitted directly ([Act
11:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017).md). Generally, the saint's
anxiety for other souls ([Mar 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019.md);
[Joh 4:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028).md).

no breasts--neither faith nor love as yet (see on [Sol
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005).md), which "come by hearing" of Him
who first loved us. Not yet fit to be His bride, and mother of a
spiritual offspring.

what shall we do--the chief question in the early Church at the first
council ([Act 15:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023).md). How shall
"the elder brother" treat the "younger," already received by the Father
([Luk 15:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025).md)? Generally ([Sa2
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#015.md); [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md); [Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md); [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010).md).

In the day . . . spoken for--that is, when she shall be sought in
marriage ([Jdg 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#007).md), namely, by Jesus
Christ, the heavenly bridegroom.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 8:9</span></span>

wall . . . door--the very terms employed as to the Gentile question
([Act 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md). If she be a wall in Zion,
founded on Jesus Christ ([Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011).md),
we will not "withstand God" ([Act
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017.md); [Act
15:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008).md). But if so, we must not
"build" ([Act 15:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014).md) on her "wood,
hay, stubble" ([Co1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012).md), that is,
Jewish rites, &c., but "a palace of silver," that is, all the highest
privileges of church communion ([Gal
2:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md); [Eph
2:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).md). Image from the splendid
turrets "built" on the "walls" of Jerusalem, and flanking the "door," or
gateway. The Gentile Church is the "door," the type of catholic
accessibleness ([Co1 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).md); but it
must be not a mere thoroughfare but furnished with a wooden framework,
so as not merely to admit, but also to safely enclose: cedar is
fragrant, beautiful, and enduring.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 8:10</span></span>

The Gentile Church's joy at its free admission to gospel privileges
([Act 15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#030).md). She is one wall in
the spiritual temple of the Holy Ghost, the Hebrew Church is the other;
Jesus Christ, the common foundation, joins them ([Eph
2:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).md).

breasts . . . towers--alluding to the silver palace, which the bridal
virgins proposed to build on her ([Sol
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009).md). "Breasts" of consolation ([Isa
66:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011).md); faith and love ([Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008).md); opposed to her previous state,
"no breasts" ([Sol 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008.md); [Th2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003).md). Thus [Eze
16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046.md), [Eze
16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061.md) was fulfilled, both Samaria and
the Gentiles being joined to the Jewish gospel Church.

favour--rather, "peace." The Gentile Church too is become the Shulamite
([Sol 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013).md), or peace-enjoying bride
of Solomon, that is, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace ([Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md). Reject not those whom God
accepts ([Num 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028.md); [Luk
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049.md); [Act
15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008).md). Rather, superadd to such
every aid and privilege ([Sol 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#009).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 8:11</span></span>

The joint Church speaks of Jesus Christ's vineyard. Transference of it
from the Jews, who rendered not the fruits, as is implied by the silence
respecting any, to the Gentiles ([Mat
21:33-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md).

Baal-hamon--equivalent to the owner of a multitude; so Israel in
Solomon's day ([Kg1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020).md); so [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), "a very fruitful hill" abounding
in privileges, as in numbers.

thousand pieces--namely, silverlings, or shekels. The vineyard had a
thousand vines probably; a vine at a silverling ([Isa
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023).md), referring to this passage.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 8:12</span></span>

"mine" by grant of the true Solomon. Not merely "let out to keepers," as
in the Jewish dispensation of works, but "mine" by grace. This is
"before me," that is, in my power \[MAURER\]. But though no longer under
constraint of "keeping" the law as a mere letter and covenant of works,
love to Jesus Christ will constrain her the more freely to render all to
Solomon ([Rom 8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md); [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016).md), after having paid what justice
and His will require should be paid to others ([Co1
7:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md); [Co1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014).md). "Before me" may also mean "I
will never lose sight of it" (contrast [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md) \[MOODY STUART\]. She will not
keep it for herself, though so freely given to her, but for His use and
glory ([Luk 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md); [Rom
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015.md); [Rom
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007.md); [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007).md). Or the "two hundred" may mean a
double tithe (two-tenths of the whole paid back by Jesus Christ) as the
reward of grace for our surrender of all (the thousand) to Him ([Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md); [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md); then she and "those that keep"
are the same \[ADELAIDE NEWTON\]. But Jesus Christ pays back not merely
two tithes, but His all for our all ([Co1
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 8:13</span></span>

Jesus Christ's address to her; now no longer visibly present. Once she
"had not kept" her vineyard ([Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md); now she "dwells" in it, not as
its owner, but its superintendent under Jesus Christ, with vinedressers
("companions"), for example, Paul, &c. ([Act
15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025).md), under her ([Sol
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011).md); these ought to obey her when
she obeys Jesus Christ. Her voice in prayer and praise is to be heard
continually by Jesus Christ, if her voice before men is to be effective
([Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md), end; [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md); [Act
13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 8:14</span></span>

(See on [Sol 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md). As she began with
longing for His first coming ([Sol
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002).md), so she ends with praying for His
second coming ([Psa 130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006.md); [Phi
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020).md). MOODY STUART makes the roe
upon spices to be the musk deer. As there are four gardens, so four
mountains, which form not mere images, as Gilead, Carmel, &c., but part
of the structure of the Song: (1) Bether, or division ([Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md), God's justice dividing us from
God. (2) Those "of leopards" ([Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008)), sin, the world, and Satan. (3.md)
That "of myrrh and aloes" ([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md),
[Sol 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#014).md), the sepulchre of Calvary.
(4) Those "of spices," here answering to "the hill of frankincense"
([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006).md), where His soul was for the
three days of His death, and heaven, where He is a High Priest now,
offering incense for us on the fragrant mountain of His own finished
work ([Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md), [Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md); [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md); thus He surmounts the other
three mountains, God's justice, our sin, death. The mountain of spices
is as much greater than our sins, as heaven is higher than earth ([Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011).md). The abrupt, unsatisfied close
with the yearning prayer for His visible coming shows that the marriage
is future, and that to wait eagerly for it is our true attitude ([Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md); [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md); [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012).md).
