### [Isaiah Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 56:1</span></span>

THE PREPARATION NEEDED ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WISH TO BE ADMITTED TO
THE KINGDOM OF GOD. ([Isa 56:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001).md)

judgment--equity. John the Baptist preached similarly a return to
righteousness, as needed to prepare men for Messiah's first coming ([Luk
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md), [Luk
3:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008).md). So it shall be before the
second coming ([Mal 4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004).md).

near to come-- ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md), also as to the second coming
([Isa 62:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md); [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md), [Luk
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#031.md); [Rom
13:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011.md); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025).md).

righteousness--answering to "salvation" in the parallel clause;
therefore it means righteousness which bringeth salvation ([Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md); [Rom
3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md).

[Isaiah 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 56:2</span></span>

([Luk 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043).md).

the man--Hebrew, enosh, "a man in humble life," in contradistinction to
Hebrew, ish, "one of high rank." Even the humblest, as "the stranger"
and "the eunuch" ([Isa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004.md), [Isa
56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006).md), are admissible to these
privileges.

this . . . it--what follows: "keeping the Sabbath," &c. ([Isa
58:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013.md); [Eze
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012).md). A proof that the Sabbath, in
the spirit of its obligation, was to be binding under the Gospel ([Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023).md). That gospel times are referred
to is plain, from the blessing not being pronounced on the man who
observed the sacrificial ritual of the Jewish law.

layeth hold--image from one grasping firmly some precious object which
he is afraid of having forcibly snatched from him. The "Sabbath" here
includes all the ordinances of divine worship under the new gospel law.

keepeth . . . hand . . . from . . . evil--The observance of the second
table of the law; as the "Sabbath" referred to the first table.
Together, they form the whole duty of man, the worship of God and a holy
life.

[Isaiah 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 56:3</span></span>

God welcomes all believers, without distinction of persons, under the
new economy ([Act 10:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034).md).

joined . . . to . . . Lord-- ([Num
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#004.md), [Num
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007).md). "Proselytes."

separated--Proselytes from the Gentiles were not admitted to the same
privileges as native Israelites. This barrier between Jews and Gentiles
was to be broken down ([Eph 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md).

eunuch-- ([Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027), &c..md). Eunuchs
were chamberlains over harems, or court ministers in general.

dry tree--barren (compare [Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031).md);
not admissible into the congregation of Israel ([Deu
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001).md). Under the Gospel the eunuch
and stranger should be released from religious and civil disabilities.

[Isaiah 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 56:4</span></span>

please me--sacrifice their own pleasure to mine.

take hold--so "layeth hold" (see on [Isa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 56:5</span></span>

in mine house--the temple, the emblem of the Church ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md). They shall no longer be
confined as proselytes were, to the outer court, but shall be admitted
"into the holiest" ([Heb 10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md).

a place--literally, "a hand."

than of sons--Though the eunuch is barren of children ([Isa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003).md), I will give him a more lasting
name than that of being father of sons and daughters (regarded as a high
honor among the Hebrews) ([Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md);
[Joh 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md); [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 56:6</span></span>

join . . . Lord-- ([Jer 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006).md).
Conditions of admission to the privileges of adoption.

[Isaiah 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 56:7</span></span>

Even them-- ([Eph 2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).md).

to my holy mountain--Jerusalem, the seat of the Lord's throne in His
coming kingdom ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017).md).

joyful-- ([Rom 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011).md).

burnt offerings . . . sacrifices--spiritual, of which the literal were
types ([Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md).

accepted-- ([Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).md).

altar-- ([Heb 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010).md), spiritually, the
Cross of Christ, which sanctifies our sacrifices of prayer and praise.

house . . . for all people--or rather, "peoples." No longer restricted
to one favored people ([Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md), [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md); [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008).md). To be fully realized at the
second coming ([Isa 2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).md). No longer
literal, but spiritual sacrifice, namely, "prayer" shall be offered
([Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md); [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md); [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 56:8</span></span>

Jehovah will not only restore the scattered outcasts of Israel ([Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Psa
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002).md) to their own land, but "will
gather others ('strangers') to him (Israel), besides those gathered"
(Margin, "to his gathered"; that is, in addition to the Israelites
collected from their dispersion), ([Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md); [Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 56:9</span></span>

beasts--Gentile idolatrous nations hostile to the Jews, summoned by God
to chastise them ([Jer 12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md); [Jer
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); [Eze
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005).md): the Chaldeans and subsequently
the Romans. The mention of the "outcasts of Israel" ([Isa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008).md) brings in view the outcasting,
caused by the sins of their rulers ([Isa
56:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010).md).

to devour--namely, Israel.

[Isaiah 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 56:10</span></span>

His watchmen--Israel's spiritual leaders ([Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md); [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017).md).

dumb dogs--image from bad shepherds' watchdogs, which fail to give
notice, by barking, of the approach of wild beasts.

blind-- ([Mat 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016).md).

sleeping, lying down--rather, "dreamers, sluggards" \[LOWTH\]. Not
merely sleeping inactive, but under visionary delusions.

loving to slumber--not merely slumbering involuntarily, but loving it.

[Isaiah 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 56:11</span></span>

greedy--literally, "strong" (that is, insatiable) in appetite ([Eze
34:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md).

cannot understand--unable to comprehend the wants of the people,
spiritually: so [Isa 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010.md), "cannot
bark."

look to . . . own way--that is, their own selfish interests; not to the
spiritual welfare of the people ([Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md); [Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027).md).

from his quarter--rather, "from the highest to the lowest" \[LOWTH\].
"From his quarter"; that is, from one end to the other of them, one and
all ([Gen 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 56:12</span></span>

fetch wine--language of the national teachers challenging one another to
drink. BARNES translates, "I will take another cup" ([Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md).

to-morrow, &c.--Their self-indulgence was habitual and intentional: not
merely they drink, but they mean to continue so.

In the midst of the excesses of the unfaithful watchmen ([Isa
56:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010).md), most of the few that are
godly perish: partly by vexation at the prevailing ungodliness; partly
by violent death in persecution: prophetical of the persecuting times of
Manasseh, before God's judgments in causing the captivity in Babylon;
and again those in the last age of the Church, before the final
judgments on the apostasy ([Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md);
[Mat 23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md), [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017).md). The Hebrew for "perisheth,"
and "is taken away," expresses a violent death ([Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002).md).
