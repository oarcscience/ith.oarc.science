THE FIRST AND SECOND BOOKS OF KINGS, in the ancient copies of the Hebrew
Bible, constitute one book. Various titles have been given them; in the
Septuagint and the Vulgate they are called the Third and Fourth Books of
Kings. The authorship of these books is unknown; but the prevailing
opinion is that they were compiled by Ezra, or one of the later
prophets, from the ancient documents that are so frequently referred to
in the course of the history as of public and established authority.
Their inspired character was acknowledged by the Jewish Church, which
ranked them in the sacred canon; and, besides, it is attested by our
Lord, who frequently quotes from them (compare [Kg1
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009.md); [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md) with [Luk
4:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#024.md); [Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md) with [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042).md).
