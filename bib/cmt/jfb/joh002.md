Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

FIRST MIRACLE, WATER MADE WINE--BRIEF VISIT TO CAPERNAUM. ([Joh
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001).md)

third day--He would take two days to reach Galilee, and this was the
third.

mother there--it being probably some relative's marriage. John never
names her \[BENGEL\].

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

no wine--evidently expecting some display of His glory, and hinting that
now was His time.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Woman--no term of disrespect in the language of that day ([Joh
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026).md).

what . . . to do with thee--that is, "In my Father's business I have to
do with Him only." It was a gentle rebuke for officious interference,
entering a region from which all creatures were excluded (compare [Act
4:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019).md).

mine hour, &c.--hinting that He would do something, but at His own time;
and so she understood it ([Joh 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005).md).

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

firkins--about seven and a half gallons in Jewish, or nine in Attic
measure; each of these huge water jars, therefore, holding some twenty
or more gallons, for washings at such feasts ([Mar
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004).md).

[John 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 2:7</span></span>

Fill . . . draw . . . bear--directing all, but Himself touching nothing,
to prevent all appearance of collusion.

[John 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 2:9</span></span>

well drunk--"drunk abundantly" (as [Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001).md), speaking of the general
practice.

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

the good wine . . . until now--thus testifying, while ignorant of the
source of supply, not only that it was real wine, but better than any at
the feast.

[John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 2:11</span></span>

manifested forth his glory--Nothing in the least like this is said of
the miracles of prophet or apostle, nor could without manifest blasphemy
be said of any mere creature. Observe, (1) At a marriage Christ made His
first public appearance in any company, and at a marriage He wrought His
first miracle--the noblest sanction that could be given to that
God-given institution. (2) As the miracle did not make bad good, but
good better, so Christianity only redeems, sanctifies, and ennobles the
beneficent but abused institution of marriage; and Christ's whole work
only turns the water of earth into the wine of heaven. Thus "this
beginning of miracles" exhibited the character and "manifested forth the
glory" of His entire Mission. (3) As Christ countenanced our seasons of
festivity, so also that greater fulness which befits such; so far was He
from encouraging that asceticism which has since been so often put for
all religion. (4) The character and authority ascribed by Romanists to
the Virgin is directly in the teeth of this and other scriptures.

[John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 2:12</span></span>

Capernaum--on the Sea of Galilee. (See on [Mat
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001).md).

his mother and his brethren--(See on [Luk
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051.md), and [Mat
13:54-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054).md).

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

CHRIST'S FIRST PASSOVER--FIRST CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE. ([Joh
2:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013).md)

in the temple--not the temple itself, as [Joh
2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md), but the temple-court.

sold oxen, &c.--for the convenience of those who had to offer them in
sacrifice.

changers of money--of Roman into Jewish money, in which the temple dues
(see on [Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024).md) had to be paid.

[John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 2:15</span></span>

small cords--likely some of the rushes spread for bedding, and when
twisted used to tie up the cattle there collected. "Not by this slender
whip but by divine majesty was the ejection accomplished, the whip being
but a sign of the scourge of divine anger" \[GROTIUS\].

poured out . . . overthrew--thus expressing the mingled indignation and
authority of the impulse.

[John 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 2:16</span></span>

my Father's house--How close the resemblance of these remarkable words
to [Luk 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049.md); the same consciousness
of intrinsic relation to the temple--as the seat of His Father's most
august worship, and so the symbol of all that is due to Him on
earth--dictating both speeches. Only, when but a youth, with no
authority, He was simply "a SON IN His own house"; now He was "a SON
OVER His own house" ([Heb 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006).md), the
proper Representative, and in flesh "the Heir," of his Father's rights.

house of merchandise--There was nothing wrong in the merchandise; but to
bring it, for their own and others' convenience, into that most sacred
place, was a high-handed profanation which the eye of Jesus could not
endure.

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

eaten me up--a glorious feature in the predicted character of the
suffering Messiah ([Psa 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009).md), and
rising high even in some not worthy to loose the latchet of His shoes.
([Exo 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019), &c..md).

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these
things?--Though the act and the words of Christ, taken together, were
sign enough, they were unconvinced: yet they were awed, and though at
His very next appearance at Jerusalem they "sought to kill Him" for
speaking of "His Father" just as He did now ([Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018).md), they, at this early stage, only
ask a sign.

[John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 2:19</span></span>

Destroy this temple, &c.--(See on [Mar
14:58-59](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058).md).

[John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 2:20</span></span>

Forty and six years--From the eighteenth year of Herod till then was
just forty-six years \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 15.11.1\].

[John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 2:21</span></span>

temple of his body--in which was enshrined the glory of the eternal
Word. (See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). By its
resurrection the true Temple of God upon earth was reared up, of which
the stone one was but a shadow; so that the allusion is not quite
exclusively to Himself, but takes in that Temple of which He is the
foundation, and all believers are the "lively stones." ([Pe1
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md).

[John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 2:22</span></span>

believed the scripture--on this subject; that is, what was meant, which
was hid from them till then. Mark (1) The act by which Christ signalized
His first public appearance in the Temple. Taking "His fan in His hand,
He purges His floor," not thoroughly indeed, but enough to foreshadow
His last act towards that faithless people--to sweep them out of God's
house. (2) The sign of His authority to do this is the announcement, at
this first outset of His ministry, of that coming death by their hands,
and resurrection by His own, which were to pave the way for their
judicial ejection.

[John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 2:23</span></span>

in the feast day--the foregoing things occurring probably before the
feast began.

many believed--superficially, struck merely by "the miracles He did." Of
these we have no record.

[John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 2:24</span></span>

did not commit--"entrust," or let Himself down familiarly to them, as to
His genuine disciples.

[John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 2:25</span></span>

knew what was in man--It is impossible for language more clearly to
assert of Christ what in [Jer 17:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md),
and elsewhere, is denied of all mere creatures.
