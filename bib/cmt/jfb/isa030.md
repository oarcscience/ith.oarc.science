### [Isaiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 30:1</span></span>

THE THIRTIETH THROUGH THIRTY-SECOND CHAPTERS REFER PROBABLY TO THE
SUMMER OF 714 B.C., AS THE TWENTY-NINTH CHAPTER TO THE PASSOVER OF THAT
YEAR. (Isa. 30:1-32)

take counsel--rather, as [Isa 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004.md),
[Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md) imply, "execute counsels."

cover . . . covering--that is, wrap themselves in reliances disloyal
towards Jehovah. "Cover" thus answers to "seek to hide deeply their
counsel from the Lord" ([Isa 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md).
But the Hebrew is literally, "who pour out libations"; as it was by
these that leagues were made ([Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md); [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011).md), translate, "who make a league."

not of--not suggested by My Spirit" ([Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md); [Jos
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014).md).

that they may add--The consequence is here spoken of as their intention,
so reckless were they of sinning: one sin entails the commission of
another ([Deu 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 30:2</span></span>

walk--are now setting out, namely, their ambassadors ([Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004).md).

Egypt--See on [Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md).

Pharaoh--the generic name of the kings of Egypt, as CÃ&brvbr;sar was at
Rome. The word in Egyptian means "king" \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities,
8.6,2\]. Phra, "the sun," was the hieroglyphic symbol and title of the
king.

shadow--image from shelter against heat: protection ([Psa
121:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 30:3</span></span>

shame--disappointment. Egypt, weakened by its internal dissensions, can
give no solid help.

[Isaiah 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 30:4</span></span>

his--Judah's (compare [Isa 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021).md).

at Zoan--are already arrived there on their errand to Pharaoh (see [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011).md).

came to Hanes--are come there. West of the Nile, in central Egypt:
Egyptian Hnes; the Greek Heracleopolis: perhaps the Anysis of HERODOTUS
(2.137); according to GROTIUS, Tahpanhes contracted ([Jer
43:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007).md); the seat of a reigning prince
at the time, as was Zoan, hence the Jewish ambassadors go to both.

[Isaiah 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 30:5</span></span>

([Jer 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)..md)

[Isaiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 30:6</span></span>

burden--the prophecy as to, &c. \[MAURER\]; so the Septuagint, the fresh
inscription here marks emphatically the prediction that follows. Or,
rather, Isaiah sees in vision, the ambassador's beasts burdened with
rich presents travelling southwards (namely, to Egypt, [Dan
11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005).md), and exclaims, Oh, the burden
of treasure on the beasts! &c. ([Hos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md).

land of trouble--the desert between Palestine and Egypt, destitute of
water and abounding in dangerous animals ([Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md); [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006).md).

flying serpent-- ([Isa 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029).md), a
species which springs like a dart from trees, on its prey.

will carry--rather, present, "carry," namely, as presents to Egypt ([Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019).md).

young asses--rather, "full-grown asses" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 30:7</span></span>

"Egypt is vanity, and to no purpose will they help" \[G. V. SMITH\].

strength--Hebrew, Rabah, a designation for Egypt ([Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md); [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004).md), implying her haughty
fierceness; translate, "Therefore I call her Arrogance that sitteth
still." She who boasted of the help she would give, when it came to the
test, sat still ([Isa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006).md). English
Version agrees with [Isa 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md); [Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 30:8</span></span>

table--a tablet ([Hab 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002).md), which
should be set in public, containing the prophecy in a briefer form, to
be read by all.

a book--namely, a parchment roll, containing the prophecy in full, for
the use of distant posterity. Its truth will be seen hereafter when the
event has come to pass. See on [Isa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md); [Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md).

for ever and ever--rather read, "For a testimony for ever" \[Chaldee,
JEROME, LOWTH\]: "testimony is often joined to the notion of perpetuity
([Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019.md), [Deu
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021.md), [Deu
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 30:9</span></span>

lying--unfaithful to Jehovah, whose covenant they had taken on them as
His adopted children ([Isa 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md); [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 30:10</span></span>

([Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md), [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md); [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005).md).

See not--as you now do, foretelling misfortune.

Prophesy not . . . right things--Not that they avowedly requested this,
but their conduct virtually expressed it. No man, professedly, wished to
be deceived; but many seek a kind of teaching which is deceit; and
which, if they would examine, they might know to be such ([Kg1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#013).md). The Jews desired success to be
foretold as the issue of their league with Egypt, though ill had been
announced by God's prophet as the result; this constituted the
"deceits."

[Isaiah 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 30:11</span></span>

Depart from the true "way" (so in [Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md), [Act
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023).md) of religion.

cause . . . to cease--Let us hear no more of His name. God's holiness is
what troubles sinners most.

[Isaiah 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 30:12</span></span>

Holy One--Isaiah so little yields to their wicked prejudices that he
repeats the very name and truth which they disliked.

this word--Isaiah's exhortation to reliance on Jehovah.

oppression--whereby they levied the treasures to be sent to conciliate
Egypt ([Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006).md).

perverseness--in relying on Egypt, rather than on Jehovah.

[Isaiah 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 30:13</span></span>

Image from a curve swelling out in a wall ([Psa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003).md); when the former gives way, it
causes the downfall of the whole wall; so their policy as to Egypt.

[Isaiah 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 30:14</span></span>

he--the enemy; or rather, God ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md); [Jer
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).md).

It--the Jewish state.

potter's vessel--earthen and fragile.

sherd--a fragment of the vessel large enough to take up a live coal, &c.

pit--cistern or pool. The swell of the wall is at first imperceptible
and gradual, but at last it comes to the crisis; so the decay of the
Jewish state.

[Isaiah 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 30:15</span></span>

returning and rest--turning back from your embassy to Egypt, and ceasing
from warlike preparations.

quietness--answering to "wait for Him (God)" ([Isa
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 30:16</span></span>

flee--not as fugitives, but we will speed our course; namely, against
the Assyrians, by the help of cavalry supplied by Egypt ([Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001).md). This was expressly against the
Mosaic law ([Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md); see on [Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007.md); [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003).md).

shall . . . flee--literally, "before your enemies"; their sin and its
punishment correspond.

[Isaiah 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 30:17</span></span>

One thousand--A thousand at once, or, "As one man" \[MAURER\].

rebuke--the battle cry.

shall ye--at the rebuke of five shall ye, namely, all (in contrast to
the "one thousand") flee so utterly that even two shall not be left
together, but each one shall be as solitary "as a signal staff" \[G. V.
SMITH\], or "a banner on a hill" ([Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md). The signal staff was erected
to rally a nation in war. The remnant of Jews left would be beacons to
warn all men of the justice of God, and the truth of His threatenings.
GESENIUS (from [Lev 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008.md); [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030).md) arbitrarily inserts "ten
thousand." "At the rebuke of five shall ten thousand of you flee."

[Isaiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 30:18</span></span>

therefore--on account of your wicked perverseness ([Isa
30:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md), [Isa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md), [Isa
30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015).md), Jehovah will delay to be
gracious \[HORSLEY\]. Rather, wait or delay in punishing, to give you
time for repentance ([Isa 30:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013.md),
[Isa 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017).md) \[MAURER\]. Or, "Yet
therefore" (namely, because of the distress spoken of in the previous
verses; that distress will lead the Jews to repentance, and so Jehovah
will pity them) \[GESENIUS\].

be exalted--Men will have more elevated views of God's mercy; or else,
"He will rise up to pity you" \[G. V. SMITH\]. Or (taking the previous
clause as MAURER, "Therefore Jehovah will delay" in punishing you, "in
order that He may be gracious to you," if ye repent), He will be far
removed from you (so in [Psa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md), far
above out sight); that is, He will not immediately descend to punish,
"in order that He may have mercy," &c.

judgment--justice; faithfulness to His covenant.

wait--compare [Isa 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md), wait,
namely, for His times of having mercy.

[Isaiah 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 30:19</span></span>

([Isa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009).md). The restoration from
Babylon only typifies the full accomplishment of the prophecy (Isa.
30:18-33).

weep no more-- ([Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).md).

thy cry-- ([Isa 26:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008.md); [Jer
29:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 30:20</span></span>

Rather, "The Lord will give"; the "though" is not in the original.

bread of adversity--He will not deny you food enough to save you in your
adversity ([Kg1 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md); [Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002).md).

be removed--rather, "hide themselves"; they shall no more be forced to
hide themselves from persecution, but shall be openly received with
reverence \[MAURER\]. Contrast with this [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md); [Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 30:21</span></span>

word--conscience, guided by the Holy Spirit ([Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 30:22</span></span>

covering of . . . images--rather, "images" (formed of wood or potter's
clay, and) "covered with silver." Hezekiah, and afterwards Josiah,
defiled them ([Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md), [Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md), [Kg2
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#014.md), [Kg2
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016.md); [Ch2
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md); compare [Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md); [Deu
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025).md).

[Isaiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 30:23</span></span>

rain of--rather, "for thy seed." Physical prosperity accompanies
national piety; especially under the Old Testament. The early rain fell
soon after the seed was sown in October or November; the latter rain in
the spring, before the ripening of the corn. Both were needed for a good
harvest.

increase--the produce.

fat--bread made of the best wheat flour (compare [Gen
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md); [Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 30:24</span></span>

ear--that is, till. Asses were employed in tillage, as well as oxen
([Deu 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010).md).

clean--rather, salted provender \[GESENIUS\]. The Arab proverb is,
"Sweet provender is as bread to camels--salted provender as
confectionery." The very cattle shall share the coming felicity. Or
else, well-fermented maslin, that is, provender formed of a mixture of
various substances: grain, beans, vetches, hay, and salt.

winnowed--not as it is usually given to cattle before it is separated
from the chaff; the grain shall be so abundant that it shall be given
winnowed.

shovel--by which the grain was thrown up in the wind to separate it from
the chaff.

fan--an instrument for winnowing.

[Isaiah 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 30:25</span></span>

Even the otherwise barren hills shall then be well-watered ([Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md).

the day, &c.--when the disobedient among the Jews shall have been slain,
as foretold in [Isa 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016.md) : "towers,"
that is, mighty men ([Isa 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015).md). Or
else, the towers of the Assyrian Sennacherib, or of Babylon, types of
all enemies of God's people.

[Isaiah 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 30:26</span></span>

Image from the heavenly bodies to express the increase of spiritual
light and felicity. "Sevenfold" implies the perfection of that felicity,
seven being the sacred number. It shall also be literally fulfilled
hereafter in the heavenly city ([Isa
60:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md); [Rev
21:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005).md).

breach--the wound, or calamity, sent by God on account of their sins
([Isa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 30:27</span></span>

name of . . . Lord--that is, Jehovah Himself ([Psa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md); [Psa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001).md); represented as a storm
approaching and ready to burst over the Assyrians ([Isa
30:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030).md).

burden . . . is heavy--literally, "grievousness is the flame," that is,
the flame which darts from Him is grievous. Or else (as the Hebrew means
an "uplifting") the uprising cloud is grievous \[G. V. SMITH\]; the
gathering cloud gradually rising till it bursts.

[Isaiah 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 30:28</span></span>

([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md).

reach . . . neck--the most extreme danger; yet as the head, or capital
of Judah, was to be spared ([Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md),
so the head, or sovereign of Assyria, Sennacherib, should escape.

sieve of vanity--Rather, "the winnowing fan of destruction" \[LOWTH\]
([Isa 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016).md).

bridle in . . . jaws--as prisoners are represented in the Assyrian
inscriptions ([Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029).md).

causing . . . to err-- ([Isa 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017).md).
"People," Hebrew, "peoples," namely, the various races composing the
Assyrian armies ([Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 30:29</span></span>

the night . . . solemnity--As in the passover night ye celebrate your
deliverance from Egypt, so shall ye celebrate your rescue from Assyrian
bondage. Translate, "the solemnity" ([Exo
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042).md).

goeth with a pipe--or flute. They used to go up to Jerusalem ("the
mountain of the Lord," Zion) at the three feasts with music and gladness
([Deu 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md); [Ezr
2:65](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#065.md); [Psa
122:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 30:30</span></span>

Jehovah's "glorious voice," raised against the enemy ([Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md), is again mentioned here, in
contrast to the music ([Isa 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029).md)
with which His people shall come to worship Him.

lighting down of . . . arm-- ([Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md); [Psa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002).md). The descent of His arm in
striking.

scattering--namely, a blast that scatters, or an "inundation"
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 30:31</span></span>

The Assyrian rod which beat shall itself be beaten, and that by the mere
voice of the Lord, that is, an unseen divine agency ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">isa 30:32</span></span>

grounded--rather, "decreed," "appointed" \[MAURER\].

staff--the avenging rod.

him--the Assyrian; type of all God's enemies in every age. Margin and

battles of shaking--that is, shock of battles ([Isa

Tophet--literally, "A place of abomination"; the valley of the sons of
Hinnom, southeast of Jerusalem, where Israel offered human sacrifices to
Moloch by fire; hence a place of burning ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md); [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031).md). Latterly Gehinnom or Gehenna,
that is, valley of Hinnom, was the receptacle of the refuse of the city,
to consume which fires were constantly burning. Hence it came to express
hell, the place of torment. In the former sense it was a fit place to
symbolize the funeral pyre of the Assyrian army (not that it actually
perished there); the Hebrews did not burn, but buried their dead, but
the heathen Assyrians are to be burnt as a mark of ignominy. In the
latter sense Tophet is the receptacle "prepared for the devil (antitype
to the king, [Isa 14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012).md) and his
angels," and unbelieving men ([Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md); [Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md); [Mar
9:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043).md).
