### [Job Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001)

[Job 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 17:1</span></span>

JOB'S ANSWER CONTINUED. (Job 17:1-16)

breath . . . corrupt--result of elephantiasis. But UMBREIT, "my strength
(spirit) is spent."

extinct--Life is compared to an expiring light. "The light of my day is
extinguished."

graves--plural, to heighten the force.

[Job 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 17:2</span></span>

UMBREIT, more emphatically, "had I only not to endure mockery, in the
midst of their contentions I (mine eye) would remain quiet."

eye continue--Hebrew, "tarry all night"; a figure taken from sleep at
night, to express undisturbed rest; opposed to ([Job
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020)), when the eye of Job is
represented as pouring out tears to God without rest.

[Job 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 17:3</span></span>

Lay down now--namely, a pledge or security; that is, be my surety; do
Thou attest my innocence, since my friends only mock me ([Job
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002)). Both litigating parties had to
lay down a sum as security before the trial.

put me in a surety--Provide a surety for me (in the trial) with Thee. A
presage of the "surety" ([Heb 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022)),
or "one Mediator between God and man" (see on [Job
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021)).

strike hands--"who else (save God Himself) could strike hands with me?"
that is, be my security ([Psa
119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122)). The Hebrew strikes the hand
of him for whom he goes security ([Pro
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001)).

[Job 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 17:4</span></span>

their heart--The intellect of his friends.

shalt . . . exalt--Rather imperative, "exalt them not"; allow them not
to conquer \[UMBREIT\], ([Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009)).

[Job 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 17:5</span></span>

The Hebrew for "flattery" is "smoothness"; then it came to mean a prey
divided by lot, because a smooth stone was used in casting the lots
([Deu 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008)), "a portion" ([Gen
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024)). Therefore translate, "He that
delivers up his friend as a prey (which the conduct of my friends
implies that they would do), even the eyes," &c. \[NOYES\] ([Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020)). Job says this as to the
sinner's children, retorting upon their reproach as to the cutting off
of his ([Job 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004); [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030)). This accords with the Old
Testament dispensation of legal retribution ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)).

[Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 17:6</span></span>

He--God. The poet reverentially suppresses the name of God when speaking
of calamities inflicted.

by-word-- ([Deu 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037); [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011)). My awful punishment makes my
name execrated everywhere, as if I must have been superlatively bad to
have earned it.

aforetime . . . tabret--as David was honored ([Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006)). Rather from a different Hebrew
root, "I am treated to my face as an object of disgust," literally, "an
object to be spit upon in the face" ([Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014)). So Raca means ([Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)) \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 17:7</span></span>

([Psa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007); [Psa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009); [Deu
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007)).

members--literally, "figures"; all the individual members being peculiar
forms of the body; opposed to "shadow," which looks like a figure
without solidity.

[Job 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 17:8</span></span>

astonied--at my unmerited sufferings.

against the hypocrite--The upright shall feel their sense of justice
wounded ("will be indignant") because of the prosperity of the wicked.
By "hypocrite" or "ungodly," he perhaps glances at his false friends.

[Job 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 17:9</span></span>

The strength of religious principle is heightened by misfortune. The
pious shall take fresh courage to persevere from the example of
suffering Job. The image is from a warrior acquiring new courage in
action ([Isa 40:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030); [Phi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014)).

[Job 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 17:10</span></span>

return--If you have anything to advance really wise, though I doubt it,
recommence your speech. For as yet I cannot find one wise man among you
all.

[Job 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 17:11</span></span>

Only do not vainly speak of the restoration of health to me; for "my
days are past."

broken off--as the threads of the web cut off from the loom ([Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012)).

thoughts--literally, "possessions," that is, all the feelings and fair
hopes which my heart once nourished. These belong to the heart, as
"purposes" to the understanding; the two together here describe the
entire inner man.

[Job 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 17:12</span></span>

They--namely, "my friends."

change the night into day--that is, would try to persuade me of the
change of my misery into joy, which is impossible \[UMBREIT\] ([Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017)); (but) the light of prosperity
(could it be enjoyed) would be short because of the darkness of
adversity. Or better for "short," the Hebrew "near"; "and the light of
new prosperity should be near in the face of (before) the darkness of
death"; that is, they would persuade me that light is near, even though
darkness approaches.

[Job 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 17:13</span></span>

Rather, "if I wait for this grave (Sheol, or the unseen world) as my
house, and make my bed in the darkness ([Job
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014)), and say to corruption,"
rather, "to the pit" or "grave," &c. ([Job
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015)). Where then is my hope?
\[UMBREIT\]. The apodosis is at [Job
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015).

[Job 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 17:14</span></span>

Thou art my father, &c.--expressing most intimate connection ([Pro
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004)). His diseased state made him
closely akin to the grave and worm.

[Job 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 17:15</span></span>

Who shall see it fulfilled? namely, the "hope" ([Job
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018)) which they held out to him of
restoration.

[Job 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 17:16</span></span>

They--namely, my hopes shall be buried with me.

bars-- ([Isa 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010)). Rather, the
wastes or solitudes of the pit (sheol, the unseen world).

rest together--the rest of me and my hope is in, &c. Both expire
together. The word "rest" implies that man's ceaseless hopes only rob
him of rest.
