### [Daniel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 8:1</span></span>

VISION OF THE RAM AND HE-GOAT: THE TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED DAYS OF THE
SANCTUARY BEING TRODDEN DOWN. (Dan. 8:1-27)

vision--a higher kind of revelation than a dream.

after that . . . at the first--that in [Dan
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md).

[Daniel 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 8:2</span></span>

Shushan--Susa. Though then comparatively insignificant, it was destined
to be the capital of Persia after Cyrus' time. Therefore Daniel is
transported into it, as being the capital of the kingdom signified by
the two-horned ram ([Neh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Est
1:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002).md).

Elam--west of Persia proper, east of Babylonia, south of Media. Daniel
was not present there personally, but in vision.

Ulai--called in PLINY Euloeus; by the Greeks, Choaspes. Now Kerah, or
Karasu. So in [Dan 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004.md) he receives a
vision near another river, the Hiddekel. So Ezekiel ([Eze
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001).md) at the Chebar. Perhaps because
synagogues used to be built near rivers, as before praying they washed
their hands in the water \[ROSENMULLER\], ([Psa
137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001).md).

[Daniel 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 8:3</span></span>

two horns--The "two" ought not to be in italics, as if it were not in
the original; for it is expressed by the Hebrew dual. "Horn" in the East
is the symbol of power and royalty.

one . . . higher than . . . other . . . the higher came up last--Persia,
which was of little note till Cyrus' time, became then ascendant over
Media, the more ancient kingdom. Darius was sixty-two years old ([Dan
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031).md) when he began to reign; during
his short reign of two years, being a weak king ([Dan
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001).md), the government was almost
entirely in Cyrus' hands. Hence HERODOTUS does not mention Darius; but
XENOPHON does under the name of Cyaxares II. The "ram" here corresponds
to the "bear" ([Dan 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005).md), symbolizing
clumsy firmness. The king of Persia wore a jewelled ram's head of gold
instead of a diadem, such as are seen on the pillars at Persepolis. Also
the Hebrew for "ram" springs from the same root as "Elam," or Persia
\[NEWTON\]. The "one horn higher than the other" answers to the bear
"raising itself on one side" (compare Note, see on [Dan
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005).md).

[Daniel 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 8:4</span></span>

ram pushing westward--Persia conquered westward Babylon, Mesopotamia,
Syria, Asia Minor.

northward--Colchis, Armenia, Iberia, and the dwellers on the Caspian
Sea.

southward--Judea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya; also India, under Darius. He
does not say eastward, for the Persians themselves came from the east
([Isa 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011).md).

did according to his will-- ([Dan
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md), [Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md); compare [Dan
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019).md).

[Daniel 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 8:5</span></span>

he-goat--GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia.

notable horn--Alexander. "Touched not . . . ground," implies the
incredible swiftness of his conquests; he overran the world in less than
twelve years. The he-goat answers to the leopard ([Dan
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006).md). Caranus, the first king of
Macedonia, was said to have been led by goats to Edessa, which he made
the seat of his kingdom, and called Ã†ge, that is, "goat-city."

[Daniel 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 8:6</span></span>

standing before the river--Ulai. It was at the "river" Granicus that
Alexander fought his first victorious battle against Darius, 334 B.C.

[Daniel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 8:7</span></span>

moved with choler--Alexander represented the concentrated wrath of
Greece against Persia for the Persian invasions of Greece; also for the
Persian cruelties to Greeks, and Darius' attempts to seduce Alexander's
soldiers to treachery \[NEWTON\].

stamped upon him--In 331 B.C. he defeated Darius Codomanus, and in 330
burned Persepolis and completed the conquest of Persia.

none . . . could deliver--Not the immense hosts of Persia could save it
from the small army of Alexander ([Psa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016).md).

[Daniel 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 8:8</span></span>

when he was strong . . . great horn was broken--The empire was in full
strength at Alexander's death by fever at Babylon, and seemed then least
likely to fall. Yet it was then "broken." His natural brother, Philip
Aridoeus, and his two sons, Alexander Ã†gus and Hercules, in fifteen
months were murdered.

four . . . toward . . . four winds--Seleucus, in the east, obtained
Syria, Babylonia, Media, &c.; Cassander, in the west, Macedon Thessaly,
Greece; PTOLEMY, in the south, Egypt, Cyprus, &c.; Lysimachus, in the
north, Thrace, Cappadocia, and the north parts of Asia Minor.

[Daniel 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 8:9</span></span>

little horn--not to be confounded with the little horn of the fourth
kingdom in [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md). The little horn
in [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md) comes as an eleventh horn
after ten preceding horns. In [Dan 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md)
it is not an independent fifth horn, after the four previous ones, but
it arises out of one of the four existing horns. This horn is explained
([Dan 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023).md) to be "a king of fierce
countenance," &c. Antiochus Epiphanes is meant. Greece with all its
refinement produces the first, that is, the Old Testament Antichrist.
Antiochus had an extraordinarly love of art, which expressed itself in
grand temples. He wished to substitute Zeus Olympius for Jehovah at
Jerusalem. Thus first heathen civilization from below, and revealed
religion from above, came into collision. Identifying himself with
Jupiter, his aim was to make his own worship universal (compare [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md) with [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md); so mad was he in this that he
was called Epimanes (maniac) instead of Epiphanes. None of the previous
world rulers, Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan
4:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031).md), Darius ([Dan
6:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#027).md), Cyrus ([Ezr
1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md), Artaxerxes Longimanus ([Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012).md), had systematically opposed the
Jews' religious worship. Hence the need of prophecy to prepare them for
Antiochus. The struggle of the Maccabees was a fruit of Daniel's
prophecy (1 Maccabees 2:59). He is the forerunner of the final
Antichrist, standing in the same relation to the first advent of Christ
that Antichrist does to His second coming. The sins in Israel which gave
rise to the Greek Antichrist were that some Jews adopted Hellenic
customs (compare [Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030.md), [Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032).md), erecting theaters, and
regarding all religions alike, sacrificing to Jehovah, but at the same
time sending money for sacrifices to Hercules. Such shall be the state
of the world when ripe for Antichrist. At [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md) and [Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md) the description passes from the
literal Antiochus to features which, though partially attributed to him,
hold good in their fullest sense only of his antitype, the New Testament
Antichrist. The Mohammedan Antichrist may also be included; answering to
the Euphratean (Turk) horsemen ([Rev
9:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014).md), loosed "an hour, a day, a
month, a year" (391 years, in the year-day theory), to scourge
corrupted, idolatrous Christianity. In A.D. 637 the Saracen Moslem
mosque of Omar was founded on the site of the temple, "treading under
foot the sanctuary" ([Dan 8:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011).md);
and there it still remains.The first conquest of the Turks over
Christians was in A.D. 1281; and 391 years after they reached their
zenith of power and began to decline, Sobieski defeating them at Vienna.
Mohammed II, called "the conqueror," reigned A.D. 1451-1481, in which
period Constantinople fell 391 years after brings us to our own day, in
which Turkey's fall is imminent.

waxed . . . great, toward . . . south-- ([Dan
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025).md). Antiochus fought against
PTOLEMY Philometer and Egypt, that is, the south.

toward the east--He fought against those who attempted a change of
government in Persia.

toward the pleasant land--Judea, "the glorious land" ([Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016.md), [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041.md), [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045.md); compare [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006.md), [Eze
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#015).md). Its chief pleasantness
consists in its being God's chosen land ([Psa
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md); [Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019).md). Into it Antiochus made his
inroad after his return from Egypt.

[Daniel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 8:10</span></span>

great, even to . . . host of heaven--explained in [Dan
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md), "the mighty and holy people,"
that is, the Jews ([Dan 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#021).md) and
their priests (compare [Isa 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021).md).
The Levites' service is called "a warfare" ([Num
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024), Margin.md). Great civil and
religious powers are symbolized by "stars" ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md). See 1 Maccabees 1:25, &c.; 1
Maccabees 2:35, &c.; 1 Maccabees 5:2, 12, 13. TREGELLES refers "stars"
to those Jews whose portion from God is heavenly glory ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003).md), being believers in Him who is
above at God's right hand: not the blinded Jews.

cast . . . stars to the ground--So Babel, as type of Antichrist, is
described ([Isa 14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md), "I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God." Compare [Rev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004.md); 2 Maccabees 9:10, as to
Antiochus.

[Daniel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 8:11</span></span>

to the prince of the host--that is, God Himself, the Lord of Sabaoth,
the hosts in heaven and earth, stars, angels, and earthly ministers. So
[Dan 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md), "he shall stand up against
the Prince of princes"; "against the God of gods" ([Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md); compare [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md). He not only opposes God's
ancient people, but also God Himself.

daily sacrifice--offered morning and evening ([Exo
29:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038).md).

taken away--by Antiochus (1 Maccabees 1:20-50).

sanctuary . . . cast down--Though robbed of its treasures, it was not
strictly cast down" by Antiochus. So that a fuller accomplishment is
future. Antiochus took away the daily sacrifice for a few years; the
Romans, for many ages, and "cast down" the temple; and Antichrist, in
connection with Rome, the fourth kingdom, shall do so again after the
Jews in their own land, still unbelieving, shall have rebuilt the
temple, and restored the Mosaic ritual: God giving them up to him "by
reason of transgression" ([Dan 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012).md),
that is, not owning the worship so rendered \[TREGELLES\]; and then the
opposition of the horn to the "truth" is especially mentioned.

[Daniel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 8:12</span></span>

an host--rather, "the host was given up to him," that is, the holy
people were given into his hands. So in [Dan
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md) "the host" is used; and again in
[Dan 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md), where also "give" is used
as here for "giving up" for destruction (compare [Dan
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006).md) \[MAURER\].

against . . . daily sacrifice--rather (the host was given up for him to
tread upon), "together with the daily sacrifice" (compare [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013).md).

by reason of transgression--1 Maccabees 1:11-16 traces all the
calamities suffered under Antiochus to the transgression of certain Jews
who introduced heathen customs into Jerusalem just before. But
transgression was not at the full ([Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023).md) under Antiochus; for Onias the
high priest administered the laws in godliness at the time (2 Maccabees
3:1). Therefore the "transgression" must refer to that of the Jews
hereafter restored to Palestine in unbelief.

the truth--the worship of the true God. [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md), "Truth is fallen in the
street."

practised, and prospered--Whatever he undertook succeeded ([Dan
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md); [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md), [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md).

[Daniel 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 8:13</span></span>

that certain saint--Daniel did not know the names of these two holy
angels, but saw only that one was speaking to the other.

How long shall be the vision concerning . . . daily sacrifice--How long
shall the daily sacrifice be suspended?

transgression of desolation--literally, "making desolate," that is,
Antiochus desolating profanation of the temple ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md); [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md). Compare as to Rome and the
last Antichrist, [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md).

[Daniel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 8:14</span></span>

unto me--The answer is to Daniel, not to the inquirer, for the latter
had asked in Daniel's name; as vice versa the saint or angel ([Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md); [Psa
89:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006).md) speaks of the vision granted
to Daniel, as if it had been granted to himself. For holy men are in
Scripture represented as having attendant angels, with whom they are in
a way identified in interests. If the conversation had been limited to
the angels, it could have been of no use to us. But God conveys it to
prophetical men, for our good, through the ministry of angels.

two thousand . . . three hundred days--literally, "mornings and
evenings," specified in connection with the morning and evening
sacrifice. Compare [Gen 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md). Six years
and a hundred ten days. This includes not only the three and a half
years during which the daily sacrifice was forbidden by Antiochus
\[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 1:1.1\], but the whole series of events
whereby it was practically interrupted: beginning with the "little horn
waxing great toward the pleasant land," and "casting down some of the
host" ([Dan 8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009).md); namely, when in
171 B.C., or the month Sivan in the year 142 of the era of the
SeleucidÃ&brvbr;, the sacrifices began to be neglected, owing to the
high priest Jason introducing at Jerusalem Grecian customs and
amusements, the palÃ&brvbr;stra and gymnasium; ending with the death of
Antiochus, 165 B.C., or the month Shebath, in the year 148 of the
Seleucid era. Compare 1 Maccabees 1:11-15; 2 Maccabees 4:9, &c. The
reason for the greater minuteness of historical facts and dates, given
in Daniel's prophecies, than in those of the New Testament, is that
Israel, not having yet the clear views which Christians have of
immortality and the heavenly inheritance, could only be directed to the
earthly future: for it was on earth the looked-for Messiah was to
appear, and the sum and subject of Old Testament prophecy was the
kingdom of God upon earth. The minuteness of the revelation of Israel's
earthly destiny was to compensate for the absence, in the Old Testament,
of views of heavenly glory. Thus, in [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), the times of Messiah are
foretold to the very year; in [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) the times of Antiochus, even to
the day; and in Dan. 11:5-20 the Syro-Egyptian struggles in most minute
detail. TREGELLES thinks the twenty-three hundred "days" answer to the
week of years ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md), during
which the destroying prince ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md) makes a covenant, which he
breaks in the midst of the week (namely, at the end of three and a half
years). The seven years exceed the twenty-three hundred days by
considerably more than a half year. This period of the seven years'
excess above the twenty-three hundred days may be allotted to the
preparations needed for setting up the temple-worship, with Antichrist's
permission to the restored Jews, according to his "covenant" with them;
and the twenty-three hundred days may date from the actual setting up of
the worship. But, says AUBERLEN, the more accurate to a day the dates as
to Antiochus are given, the less should we say the 1290, or 1335 days
([Dan 12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md) correspond to the half
week (roughly), and the twenty-three hundred to the whole. The event,
however, may, in the case of Antichrist, show a correspondence between
the days here given and [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md),
such as is not yet discernible. The term of twenty-three hundred days
cannot refer twenty-three hundred years of the treading down of
Christianity by Mohammedanism, as this would leave the greater portion
of the time yet future; whereas, Mohammedanism is fast waning. If the
twenty-three hundred days mean years, dating from Alexander's conquests,
334 B.C. to 323, we should arrive at about the close of the sixth
thousand years of the world, just as the 1260 years ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md) from Justinian's decree arrive
at the same terminus. The Jews' tradition represents the seventh
thousand as the millennium. CUMMING remarks, 480 B.C. is the date of the
waning of the Persian empire before Greece; deducting 480 from 2300, we
have 1820; and in 1821, Turkey, the successor of the Greek empire, began
to wane, and Greece became a separate kingdom. See on [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md).

cleansed--literally, "justified," vindicated from profanation. Judas
Maccabeus celebrated the feast of dedication after the cleansing, on the
twenty-fifth of the ninth month, Kisleu (1 Maccabees 4:51-58; 2
Maccabees 10:1-7; [Joh 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022).md). As to
the antitypical dedication of the new temple, see Eze. 43:1-27, &c.;
also [Amo 9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md).

[Daniel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 8:16</span></span>

Gabriel--meaning, "the strength of God."

[Daniel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 8:17</span></span>

the time of the end--so [Dan 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md);
[Dan 11:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040.md). The event being to take place
at "the time of the end" makes it likely that the Antichrist ultimately
referred to (besides the immediate reference to Antiochus) in this
chapter, and the one in [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), are
one and the same. The objection that the one in the seventh chapter
springs out of the ten divisions of the Roman earth, the fourth kingdom,
the one in the eighth chapter and the eleventh chapter from one of the
four divisions of the third kingdom, Greece, is answered thus: The four
divisions of the Grecian empire, having become parts of the Roman
empire, shall at the end form four of its ten final divisions
\[TREGELLES\]. However, the origin from one of the four parts of the
third kingdom may be limited to Antiochus, the immediate subject of the
eighth and eleventh chapter, while the ulterior typical reference of
these chapters (namely, Antichrist) may belong to one of the ten Roman
divisions, not necessarily one formerly of the four of the third
kingdom. The event will tell. "Time of the end" may apply to the time of
Antiochus. For it is the prophetic phrase for the time of fulfilment,
seen always at the end of the prophetic horizon ([Gen
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md); [Num
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014).md).

[Daniel 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 8:19</span></span>

the last end of the indignation--God's displeasure against the Jews for
their sins. For their comfort they are told, the calamities about to
come are not to be for ever. The "time" is limited ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md); [Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027.md), [Dan
11:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md); [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md).

[Daniel 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 8:21</span></span>

the first king--Philip was king of Macedon before Alexander, but the
latter was the first who, as a generalissimo of Greece, subdued the
Persian empire.

[Daniel 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 8:22</span></span>

not in his power--not with the power which Alexander possessed
\[MAURER\]. An empire united, as under Alexander, is more powerful than
one divided, as under the four Diadochi.

transgressors are come to the full--This does not hold good of the times
of Antiochus, but of the closing times of the Christian era. Compare
[Luk 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008.md), and [Ti2
3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001.md), as to the wickedness of the
world in general just before Christ's second coming. Israel's guilt,
too, shall then be at the full, when they who rejected Christ shall
receive Antichrist; fulfilling Jesus words, "I am come in My Father's
name, and ye receive Me not; if another shall come in his own name, him
ye will receive" (compare [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md);
[Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md); [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016).md).

of fierce countenance-- ([Deu 28:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#050).md);
one who will spare neither old nor young.

understanding dark sentences--rather, "artifices" \[GESENIUS\].
Antiochus made himself master of Egypt and Jerusalem successively by
craft (1 Maccabees 1:30, &c.; 2 Maccabees 5:24, &c.).

[Daniel 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 8:24</span></span>

not by his own power--which in the beginning was "little" ([Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md); [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md); but by gaining over others
through craft, the once little horn became "mighty" (compare [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md); [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023).md). To be fully realized by
Antichrist. He shall act by the power of Satan, who shall then be
permitted to work through him in unrestricted license, such as he has
not now ([Rev 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002).md); hence the ten
kingdoms shall give the beast their power ([Th2
2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009.md); [Rev
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013).md).

prosper and practise--prosper in all that he attempts ([Dan
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012).md).

holy people--His persecutions are especially directed against the Jews.

[Daniel 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 8:25</span></span>

by peace--by pretending "peace" and friendship; in the midst of security
\[GESENIUS\], suddenly striking his blow (compare Note, see on [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).md). "A spoiler at noon-day."

also . . . against the Prince of princes--not merely against the Jews
([Dan 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md); [Dan
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md).

broken without hand--by God's special visitation. The stone "cut out of
the mountain without hands," that is, Christ is to smite the world power
image on his feet ([Dan 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034).md), that
is, in its last development (compare [Dan
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011).md). Antiochus horrible death by
worms and ulcers, when on his way to Judea, intending to take vengeance
for the defeat of his armies by the Maccabees, was a primary fulfilment,
foreshadowing God's judgment on the last enemy of the Jewish Church.

[Daniel 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 8:26</span></span>

shut . . . up . . . vision--implying the vision was not to be understood
for the present. In [Rev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md) it is
said, "Seal not the vision, for the time is at hand." What in Daniel's
time was hidden was more fully explained in Revelation, and as the time
draws nearer, it will be clearer still.

it shall be for many days--It refers to remote times ([Eze
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027).md).

[Daniel 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 8:27</span></span>

I . . . was sick--through grief at the calamities coming on my people
and the Church of God (compare [Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014).md).

afterward I . . . did the king's business--He who holds nearest
communion with heaven can best discharge the duties of common life.

none understood it--He had heard of kings, but knew not their names; He
foresaw the events, but not the time when they were to take place;
thereupon he could only feel "astonished," and leave all with the
omniscient God \[JEROME\].

The world powers here recede from view; Israel, and the salvation by
Messiah promised to it, are the subject of revelation. Israel had
naturally expected salvation at the end of the captivity. Daniel is
therefore told, that, after the seventy years of the captivity, seventy
times seven must elapse, and that even then Messiah would not come in
glory as the Jews might through misunderstanding expect from the earlier
prophets, but by dying would put away sin. This ninth chapter (Messianic
prophecy) stands between the two visions of the Old Testament
Antichrist, to comfort "the wise." In the interval between Antiochus and
Christ, no further revelation was needed; therefore, as in the first
part of the book, so in the second, Christ and Antichrist in connection
are the theme.
