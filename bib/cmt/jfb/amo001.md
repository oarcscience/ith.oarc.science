### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON SYRIA, PHILISTIA, TYRE, EDOM, AND AMMON. ([Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001))

The words of Amos--that is, Amos' oracular communications. A heading
found only in [Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001).

among the herdmen--rather, "shepherds"; both owning and tending sheep;
from an Arabic root, "to mark with pricks," namely, to select the best
among a species of sheep and goats ill-shapen and short-footed (as
others explain the name from an Arabic root), but distinguished by their
wool \[MAURER\]. God chooses "the weak things of the world to confound
the mighty," and makes a humble shepherd reprove the arrogance of Israel
and her king arising from prosperity (compare [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040)).

which he saw--in supernatural vision ([Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)).

two years before the earthquake--mentioned in [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005). The earthquake occurred in
Uzziah's reign, at the time of his being stricken with leprosy for
usurping the priest's functions \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 9:10.4\]. This
clause must have been inserted by Ezra and the compilers of the Jewish
canon.

[Amos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 1:2</span></span>

will roar--as a lion ([Joe 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016)).
Whereas Jehovah is there represented roaring in Israel's behalf, here He
roars against her (compare [Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013);
[Jer 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030)).

from Zion . . . Jerusalem--the seat of the theocracy, from which ye have
revolted; not from Dan and Beth-el, the seat of your idolatrous worship
of the calves.

habitations . . . mourn--poetical personification. Their inhabitants
shall mourn, imparting a sadness to the very habitations.

Carmel--the mountain promontory north of Israel, in Asher, abounding in
rich pastures, olives, and vines. The name is the symbol of fertility.
When Carmel itself "withers," how utter the desolation! ([Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005); [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009); [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002); [Jer
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019); [Nah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004)).

[Amos 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 1:3</span></span>

Here begins a series of threatenings of vengeance against six other
states, followed by one against Judah, and ending with one against
Israel, with whom the rest of the prophecy is occupied. The eight
predictions are in symmetrical stanzas, each prefaced by "Thus saith the
Lord." Beginning with the sin of others, which Israel would be ready
enough to recognize, he proceeds to bring home to Israel her own guilt.
Israel must not think hereafter, because she sees others visited
similarly to herself, that such judgments are matters of chance; nay,
they are divinely foreseen and foreordered, and are confirmations of the
truth that God will not clear the guilty. If God spares not the nations
that know not the truth, how much less Israel that sins wilfully ([Luk
12:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047); [Jam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017))!

for three transgressions . . . and for four--If Damascus had only sinned
once or twice, I would have spared them, but since, after having been so
often pardoned, they still persevere so continually, I will no longer
"turn away" their punishment. The Hebrew is simply, "I will not reverse
it," namely, the sentence of punishment which follows; the negative
expression implies more than it expresses; that is, "I will most surely
execute it"; God's fulfilment of His threats being more awful than human
language can express. "Three and four" imply sin multiplied on sin
(compare [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005); [Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015), [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018), [Pro
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021); "six and seven," [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019); "once and twice," [Job
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014); "twice and thrice," Margin;
"oftentimes," English Version, [Job
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029); "seven and also eight," [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)). There may be also a reference
to seven, the product of three and four added; seven expressing the full
completion of the measure of their guilt ([Lev
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018), [Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024); compare [Mat
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032)).

threshed--the very term used of the Syrian king Hazael's oppression of
Israel under Jehu and Jehoahaz ([Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032); [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007)). The victims were thrown before
the threshing sledges, the teeth of which tore their bodies. So David to
Ammon ([Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031); compare [Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027)).

[Amos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 1:4</span></span>

Hazael . . . Ben-hadad--A black marble obelisk found in the central
palace of Nimroud, and now in the British Museum, is inscribed with the
names of Hazael and Ben-hadad of Syria, as well as Jehu of Israel,
mentioned as tributaries of "Shalmanubar," king of Assyria. The kind of
tribute from Jehu is mentioned: gold, pearls, precious oil, &c. \[G. V.
SMITH\]. The Ben-hadad here is the son of Hazael ([Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003)), not the Ben-hadad supplanted
and slain by Hazael ([Kg2 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007), [Kg2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015)). The phrase, "I will send a
fire," that is, the flame of war ([Psa
78:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#063)), occurs also in [Amo
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007), [Amo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010), [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012), [Amo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014), and [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002), [Amo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005); [Jer
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027); [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014).

[Amos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 1:5</span></span>

bar of Damascus--that is, the bar of its gates (compare [Jer
51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030)).

the inhabitant--singular for plural, "inhabitants." HENDERSON, because
of the parallel, "him that holdeth the scepter," translates, "the
ruler." But the parallelism is that of one clause complementing the
other, "the inhabitant" or subject here answering to "him that holdeth
the scepter" or ruler there, both ruler and subject alike being cut off.

Aven--the same as Oon or Un, a delightful valley, four hours' journey
from Damascus, towards the desert. Proverbial in the East as a place of
delight \[JOSEPHUS ABASSUS\]. It is here parallel to "Eden," which also
means "pleasantness"; situated at Lebanon. As JOSEPHUS ABASSUS is a
doubtful authority, perhaps the reference may be rather to the valley
between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, called El-Bekaa, where are the ruins
of the Baal-bek temple of the sun; so the Septuagint renders it On, the
same name as the city in Egypt bears, dedicated to the sun-worship ([Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045); Heliopolis, "the city of the
sun," [Eze 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017), Margin). It is
termed by Amos "the valley of Aven," or "vanity," from the worship of
idols in it.

Kir--a region subject to Assyria ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006)) in Iberia, the same as that
called now in Armenian Kur, lying by the river Cyrus which empties
itself into the Caspian Sea. Tiglath-pileser fulfilled this prophecy
when Ahaz applied for help to him against Rezin king of Syria, and the
Assyrian king took Damascus, slew Rezin, and carried away its people
captive to Kir.

[Amos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 1:6</span></span>

Gaza--the southernmost of the five capitals of the five divisions of
Philistia, and the key to Palestine on the south: hence put for the
whole Philistine nation. Uzziah commenced the fulfilment of this
prophecy (see [Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)).

because they carried away . . . the whole captivity--that is, they left
none. Compare with the phrase here, [Jer
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#019), "Judah . . . carried captive
all of it . . . wholly carried away." Under Jehoram already the
Philistines had carried away all the substance of the king of Judah, and
his wives and his sons, "so that there was never a son left to him, save
Jehoahaz"; and after Amos' time (if the reference includes the future,
which to the prophet's eye is as if already done), under Ahaz ([Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018)), they seized on all the cities
and villages of the low country and south of Judah.

to deliver them up to Edom--Judah's bitterest foe; as slaves ([Amo
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009); compare [Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001), [Joe
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003), [Joe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006)). GROTIUS refers it to the fact
([Isa 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004)) that on Sennacherib's
invasion of Judah, many fled for refuge to neighboring countries; the
Philistines, instead of hospitably sheltering the refugees, sold them,
as if captives in war, to their enemies, the Idumeans.

[Amos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 1:7</span></span>

fire--that is, the flame of war ([Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028); [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011)). Hezekiah fulfilled the
prophecy, smiting the Philistines unto Gaza ([Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)). Foretold also by [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029), [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031).

[Amos 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 1:8</span></span>

Ashdod, &c.--Gath alone is not mentioned of the five chief Philistine
cities. It had already been subdued by David; and it, as well as Ashdod,
was taken by Uzziah ([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)). Gath
perhaps had lost its position as one of the five primary cities before
Amos uttered this prophecy, whence arose his omission of it. So [Zep
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004). Compare [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004); [Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016). Subsequently to the subjugation
of the Philistines by Uzziah, and then by Hezekiah, they were reduced by
Psammetichus of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, the Persians, Alexander, and
lastly the Asmoneans.

[Amos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 1:9</span></span>

Tyrus . . . delivered up the . . . captivity to Edom--the same charge as
against the Philistines ([Amo 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006)).

remembered not the brotherly covenant--the league of Hiram of Tyre with
David and Solomon, the former supplying cedars for the building of the
temple and king's house in return for oil and corn ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011); [Kg1
5:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002); [Kg1
9:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011), [Kg1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027); [Kg1
9:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010); [Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001); [Ch2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018); [Ch2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#010)).

[Amos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 1:10</span></span>

fire--(Compare [Amo 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004), [Amo
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007); Isa. 23:1-18; Eze. 26:1-28:26).
Many parts of Tyre were burnt by fiery missiles of the Chaldeans under
Nebuchadnezzar. Alexander of Macedon subsequently overthrew it.

[Amos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 1:11</span></span>

Edom . . . did pursue his brother-- ([Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005)). The chief aggravation to Edom's
violence against Israel was that they both came from the same parents,
Isaac and Rebekah (compare [Gen
25:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#024); [Deu
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007); [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010), [Oba
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012); [Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)).

cast off all pity--literally, "destroy compassions," that is, did
suppress all the natural feeling of pity for a brother in distress.

his wrath for ever--As Esau kept up his grudge against Jacob, for having
twice supplanted him, namely, as to the birthright and the blessing
([Gen 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041)), so Esau's posterity
against Israel ([Num 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014), [Num
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021)). Edom first showed his spite in
not letting Israel pass through his borders when coming from the
wilderness, but threatening to "come out against him with the sword";
next, when the Syrians attacked Jerusalem under Ahaz (compare [Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017), with [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005)); next, when Nebuchadnezzar
assailed Jerusalem ([Psa 137:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007)). In
each case Edom chose the day of Israel's calamity for venting his
grudge. This is the point of Edom's guilt dwelt on in [Oba
1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010). God punishes the children,
not for the sin of their fathers, but for their own filling up the
measure of their fathers' guilt, as children generally follow in the
steps of, and even exceed, their fathers' guilt (compare [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)).

[Amos 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 1:12</span></span>

Teman--a city of Edom, called from a grandson of Esau ([Gen
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011), [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015); [Oba
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008)); situated five miles from
Petra; south of the present Wady Musa. Its people were famed for wisdom
([Jer 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007)).

Bozrah--a city of Edom ([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)).
Selah or Petra is not mentioned, as it had been overthrown by Amaziah
([Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007)).

[Amos 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 1:13</span></span>

Ammon--The Ammonites under Nahash attacked Jabesh-gilead and refused to
accept the offer of the latter to save them, unless the
Jabesh-gileadites would put out all their right eyes ([Sa1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001), &c.). Saul rescued
Jabesh-gilead. The Ammonites joined the Chaldeans in their invasion of
Judea for the sake of plunder.

ripped up . . . women with-child--as Hazael of Syria also did ([Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012); compare [Hos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016)). Ammon's object in this cruel
act was to leave Israel without "heir," so as to seize on Israel's
inheritance ([Jer 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001)).

[Amos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 1:14</span></span>

Rabbah--the capital of Ammon: meaning "the Great." Distinct from Rabbah
of Moab. Called Philadelphia, afterwards, from Ptolemy Philadelphus.

tempest--that is, with an onset swift, sudden, and resistless as a
hurricane.

day of the whirlwind--parallel to "the day of battle"; therefore meaning
"the day of the foe's tumultuous assault."

[Amos 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 1:15</span></span>

their king . . . princes--or else, "their Molech (the idol of Ammon) and
his priests" \[GROTIUS and Septuagint\]. [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028) so uses "princes" for "priests."
So [Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026), "your Molech"; and [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003), Margin. English Version,
however, is perhaps preferable both here and in [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003); see on [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).
