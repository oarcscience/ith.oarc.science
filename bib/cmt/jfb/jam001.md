### [James Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

[James 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 1:1</span></span>

INSCRIPTION: EXHORTATION ON HEARING, SPEAKING, AND WRATH. (Jam. 1:1-27)

James--an apostle of the circumcision, with Peter and John, James in
Jerusalem, Palestine, and Syria; Peter in Babylon and the East; John in
Ephesus and Asia Minor. Peter addresses the dispersed Jews of Pontus,
Galatia, and Cappadocia; James, the Israelites of the twelve tribes
scattered abroad.

servant of God--not that he was not an apostle; for Paul, an apostle,
also calls himself so; but as addressing the Israelites generally,
including even indirectly the unbelieving, he in humility omits the
title "apostle"; so Paul in writing to the Hebrews; similarly Jude, an
apostle, in his General Epistle.

Jesus Christ--not mentioned again save in [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md); not at all in his speeches ([Act
15:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md); [Act
21:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020).md), lest his introducing the
name of Jesus oftener should seem to arise from vanity, as being "the
Lord's brother" \[BENGEL\]. His teaching being practical, rather than
doctrinal, required less frequent mention of Christ's name.

scattered abroad--literally "which are in the dispersion." The
dispersion of the Israelites, and their connection with Jerusalem as a
center of religion, was a divinely ordered means of propagating
Christianity. The pilgrim troops of the law became caravans of the
Gospel \[WORDSWORTH\].

greeting--found in no other Christian letter, but in James and the
Jerusalem Synod's Epistle to the Gentile churches; an undesigned
coincidence and mark or genuineness. In the original Greek (chairein)
for "greeting," there is a connection with the "joy" to which they are
exhorted amidst their existing distresses from poverty and consequent
oppression. Compare [Rom 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md), which
alludes to their poverty.

[James 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 1:2</span></span>

My brethren--a phrase often found in James, marking community of nation
and of faith.

all joy--cause for the highest joy \[GROTIUS\]. Nothing but joy
\[PISCATOR\]. Count all "divers temptations" to be each matter of joy
\[BENGEL\].

fall into--unexpectedly, so as to be encompassed by them (so the
original Greek).

temptations--not in the limited sense of allurements to sin, but trials
or distresses of any kind which test and purify the Christian character.
Compare "tempt," that is, try, [Gen
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md). Some of those to whom James
writes were "sick," or otherwise "afflicted" ([Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013).md). Every possible trial to the
child of God is a masterpiece of strategy of the Captain of his
salvation for his good.

[James 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 1:3</span></span>

the trying--the testing or proving of your faith, namely, by "divers
temptations." Compare [Rom 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md),
tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience (in the original
dokime, akin to dokimion, "trying," here; there it is experience: here
the "trying" or testing, whence experience flows).

patience--The original implies more; persevering endurance and
continuance (compare [Luk 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015).md).

[James 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 1:4</span></span>

Let endurance have a perfect work (taken out of the previous "worketh
patience" or endurance), that is, have its full effect, by showing the
most perfect degree of endurance, namely, "joy in bearing the cross"
\[MENOCHIUS\], and enduring to the end ([Mat
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022).md) \[CALVIN\].

ye may be perfect--fully developed in all the attributes of a Christian
character. For this there is required "joy" \[BENGEL\], as part of the
"perfect work" of probation. The work of God in a man is the man. If
God's teachings by patience have had a perfect work in you, you are
perfect \[ALFORD\].

entire--that which has all its parts complete, wanting no integral part;
[Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md), "your whole (literally,
'entire') spirit, soul, and body"; as "perfect" implies without a
blemish in its parts.

[James 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 1:5</span></span>

English Version omits "But," which the Greek has, and which is
important. "But (as this perfect entireness wanting nothing is no easy
attainment) if any," &c.

lack--rather, as the Greek word is repeated after James's manner, from
[Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md), "wanting nothing,"
translate, "If any of you want wisdom," namely, the wisdom whereby ye
may "count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations," and "let
patience have her perfect work." This "wisdom" is shown in its effects
in detail, [Jam 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007.md). The highest
wisdom, which governs patience alike in poverty and riches, is described
in [Jam 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md).

ask-- ([Jam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002).md).

liberally--So the Greek is rendered by English Version. It is rendered
with simplicity, [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md). God gives
without adding aught which may take off from the graciousness of the
gift \[ALFORD\]. God requires the same "simplicity" in His children
("eye . . . single," [Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md),
literally, "simple").

upbraideth not--an illustration of God's giving simply. He gives to the
humble suppliant without upbraiding him with his past sin and
ingratitude, or his future abuse of God's goodness. The Jews pray, "Let
me not have need of the gifts of men, whose gifts are few, but their
upbraidings manifold; but give me out of Thy large and full hand."
Compare Solomon's prayer for "wisdom," and God's gift above what he
asked, though God foresaw his future abuse of His goodness would deserve
very differently. James has before his eye the Sermon on the Mount (see
my Introduction). God hears every true prayer and grants either the
thing asked, or else something better than it; as a good physician
consults for his patient's good better by denying something which the
latter asks not for his good, than by conceding a temporary
gratification to his hurt.

[James 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 1:6</span></span>

ask in faith--that is, the persuasion that God can and will give. James
begins and ends with faith. In the middle of the Epistle he removes the
hindrances to faith and shows its true character \[BENGEL\].

wavering--between belief and unbelief. Compare the case of the
Israelites, who seemed to partly believe in God's power, but leaned more
to unbelief by "limiting" it. On the other hand, compare [Act
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#020.md); [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md) ("staggered not . . . through
unbelief," literally, as here, "wavered not"); [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md).

like a wave of the sea-- [Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md);
[Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md), where the same Greek word
occurs for "tossed to and fro," as is here translated, "driven with the
wind."

driven with the wind--from without.

tossed--from within, by its own instability \[BENGEL\]. At one time cast
on the shore of faith and hope, at another rolled back into the abyss of
unbelief; at one time raised to the height of worldly pride, at another
tossed in the sands of despair and affliction \[WIESINGER\].

[James 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 1:7</span></span>

For--resumed from "For" in [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md).

that man--such a wavering self-deceiver.

think--Real faith is something more than a mere thinking or surmise.

anything--namely, of the things that he prays for: he does receive many
things from God, food, raiment, &c., but these are the general gifts of
His providence: of the things specially granted in answer to prayer, the
waverer shall not receive "anything," much less wisdom.

[James 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 1:8</span></span>

double-minded--literally, "double-souled," the one soul directed towards
God, the other to something else. The Greek favors ALFORD'S translation,
"He (the waverer, [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006).md) is a man
double-minded, unstable," &c.; or better, BEZA'S. The words in this [Jam
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md) are in apposition with "that man,"
[Jam 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007.md); thus the "us," which is not
in the original, will not need to be supplied, "A man double-minded,
unstable in all his ways!" The word for "double-minded" is found here
and in [Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md), for the first time in
Greek literature. It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle,
"wavering" man, as the context shows. It is opposed to the single eye
([Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022).md).

[James 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 1:9</span></span>

Translate, "But let the brother," &c. that is, the best remedy against
double-mindedness is that Christian simplicity of spirit whereby the
"brother," low in outward circumstances, may "rejoice" (answering to
[Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002).md) "in that he is exalted,"
namely, by being accounted a son and heir of God, his very sufferings
being a pledge of his coming glory and crown ([Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012).md), and the rich may rejoice "in
that he is made low," by being stripped of his goods for Christ's sake
\[MENOCHIUS\]; or in that he is made, by sanctified trials, lowly in
spirit, which is true matter for rejoicing \[GOMARUS\]. The design of
the Epistle is to reduce all things to an equable footing ([Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md); [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013).md). The "low," rather than the
"rich," is here called "the brother" \[BENGEL\].

[James 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 1:10</span></span>

So far as one is merely "rich" in worldly goods, "he shall pass away";
in so far as his predominant character is that of a "brother," he
"abideth for ever" ([Jo1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017).md). This
view meets all ALFORD'S objections to regarding "the rich" here as a
"brother" at all. To avoid making the rich a brother, he translates,
"But the rich glories in his humiliation," namely, in that which is
really his debasement (his rich state, [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md), just as the low is told to
rejoice in what is really his exaltation (his lowly state).

[James 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 1:11</span></span>

Taken from [Isa 40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md).

heat--rather, "the hot wind" from the (east or) south, which scorches
vegetation ([Luk 12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055).md). The "burning
heat" of the sun is not at its rising, but rather at noon; whereas the
scorching Kadim wind is often at sunrise ([Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008).md) \[MIDDLETON, The Doctrine of the
Greek Article\]. [Mat 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md) uses the
Greek word for "heat." [Isa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md),
"bloweth upon it," seems to answer to "the hot wind" here.

grace of the fashion--that is of the external appearance.

in his ways--referring to the burdensome extent of the rich man's
devices \[BENGEL\]. Compare "his ways," that is, his course of life,
[Jam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md).

[James 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 1:12</span></span>

Blessed--Compare the beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount ([Mat
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md), [Mat
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010).md).

endureth temptation--not the "falling into divers temptations" ([Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002).md) is the matter for "joy," but the
enduring of temptation "unto the end." Compare [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md).

when he is tried--literally, "when he has become tested" or "approved,"
when he has passed through the "trying" ([Jam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003).md), his "faith" having finally
gained the victory.

the crown--not in allusion to the crown or garland given to winners in
the games; for this, though a natural allusion for Paul in writing to
the heathen, among whom such games existed, would be less appropriate
for James in addressing the Jewish Christians, who regarded Gentile
usages with aversion.

of life--"life" constitutes the crown, literally, the life, the only
true life, the highest and eternal life. The crown implies a kingdom
([Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003).md).

the Lord--not found in the best manuscripts and versions. The believer's
heart fills up the omission, without the name needing to be mentioned.
The "faithful One who promised" ([Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023).md).

to them that love him--In [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md),
"the crown of righteousness to them that love His appearing." Love
produces patient endurance: none attest their love more than they who
suffer for Him.

[James 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 1:13</span></span>

when . . . tempted--tried by solicitation to evil. Heretofore the
"temptation" meant was that of probation by afflictions. Let no one
fancy that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning. God
does not send trials on you in order to make you worse, but to make you
better ([Jam 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#016).md). Therefore do
not sink under the pressure of evils ([Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013).md).

of God--by agency proceeding from God. The Greek is not "tempted by,"
but, "from," implying indirect agency.

cannot be tempted with evil, &c.--"Neither do any of our sins tempt God
to entice us to worse things, nor does He tempt any of His own accord"
(literally, "of Himself"; compare the antithesis, [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md), "Of His own will He begat us" to
holiness, so far is He from tempting us of His own will) \[BENGEL\]. God
is said in [Gen 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md) to have "tempted
Abraham"; but there the tempting meant is that of trying or proving, not
that of seducement. ALFORD translates according to the ordinary sense of
the Greek, "God is unversed in evil." But as this gives a less likely
sense, English Version probably gives the true sense; for ecclesiastical
Greek often uses words in new senses, as the exigencies of the new
truths to be taught required.

[James 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 1:14</span></span>

Every man, when tempted, is so through being drawn away of (again here,
as in [Jam 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md), the Greek for "of"
expresses the actual source, rather than the agent of temptation) his
own lust. The cause of sin is in ourselves. Even Satan's suggestions do
not endanger us before they are made our own. Each one has his own
peculiar (so the Greek) lust, arising from his own temperament and
habit. Lust flows from the original birth-sin in man, inherited from
Adam.

drawn away--the beginning step in temptation: drawn away from truth and
virtue.

enticed--literally, "taken with a bait," as fish are. The further
progress: the man allowing himself (as the Greek middle voice implies)
to be enticed to evil \[BENGEL\]. "Lust" is here personified as the
harlot that allures the man.

[James 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 1:15</span></span>

The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress.
"Lust," the harlot, then, "brings forth sin," namely, of that kind to
which the temptation inclines. Then the particular sin (so the Greek
implies), "when it is completed, brings forth death," with which it was
all along pregnant \[ALFORD\]. This "death" stands in striking contrast
to the "crown of life" ([Jam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012).md)
which "patience" or endurance ends in, when it has its "perfect work"
([Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004).md). He who will fight Satan
with Satan's own weapons, must not wonder if he finds himself
overmatched. Nip sin in the bud of lust.

[James 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 1:16</span></span>

Do not err in attributing to God temptation to evil; nay (as he proceeds
to show), "every good," all that is good on earth, comes from God.

[James 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 1:17</span></span>

gift . . . gift--not the same words in Greek: the first, the act of
giving, or the gift in its initiatory stage; the second, the thing
given, the boon, when perfected. As the "good gift" stands in contrast
to "sin" in its initiatory stage ([Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015).md), so the "perfect boon" is in
contrast to "sin when it is finished," bringing forth death ([Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).md).

from above--(Compare [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).md).

Father of lights--Creator of the lights in heaven (compare [Job
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028.md) \[ALFORD\]; [Gen
4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#020.md); [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009).md). This accords with the reference
to the changes in the light of the heavenly bodies alluded to in the end
of the verse. Also, Father of the spiritual lights in the kingdom of
grace and glory \[BENGEL\]. These were typified by the supernatural
lights on the breastplate of the high priest, the Urim. As "God is
light, and in Him is no darkness at all" ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md), He cannot in any way be the
Author of sin ([Jam 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md), which is
darkness ([Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md).

no variableness . . . shadow of turning-- ([Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md). None of the alternations of
light and shadow which the physical "lights" undergo, and which even the
spiritual lights are liable to, as compared with God. "Shadow of
turning," literally, the dark "shadow-mark" cast from one of the
heavenly bodies, arising from its "turning" or revolution, for example,
when the moon is eclipsed by the shadow of the earth, and the sun by the
body of the moon. BENGEL makes a climax, "no variation--not even the
shadow of a turning"; the former denoting a change in the understanding;
the latter, in the will.

[James 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 1:18</span></span>

([Joh 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013).md). The believer's
regeneration is the highest example of nothing but good proceeding from
God.

Of his own will--Of his own good pleasure (which shows that it is God's
essential nature to do good, not evil), not induced by any external
cause.

begat he us--spiritually: a once-for-all accomplished act ([Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md). In contrast to "lust when it
hath conceived, bringeth forth sin, and sin . . . death" ([Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015).md). Life follows naturally in
connection with light ([Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md).

word of truth--the Gospel. The objective mean, as faith is the
appropriating mean of regeneration by the Holy Spirit as the efficient
agent.

a kind of first-fruits--Christ is, in respect to the resurrection, "the
first-fruits" ([Co1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023).md): believers, in respect to
regeneration, are, as it were, first-fruits (image from the consecration
of the first-born of man, cattle, and fruits to God; familiar to the
Jews addressed), that is, they are the first of God's regenerated
creatures, and the pledge of the ultimate regeneration of the creation,
[Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md), where also the Spirit, the
divine agent of the believer's regeneration, is termed "the
first-fruits," that is, the earnest that the regeneration now begun in
the soul, shall at last extend to the body too, and to the lower parts
of creation. Of all God's visible creatures, believers are the noblest
part, and like the legal "first-fruits," sanctify the rest; for this
reason they are much tried now.

[James 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 1:19</span></span>

Wherefore--as your evil is of yourselves, but your good from God.
However, the oldest manuscripts and versions read thus: "YE KNOW IT (so
[Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017).md), my beloved brethren; BUT
(consequently) let every man be swift to hear," that is, docile in
receiving "the word of truth" ([Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md), [Jam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021).md). The true method of hearing is
treated in [Jam 1:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md), and Jam.
2:1-26.

slow to speak-- ([Pro 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019.md); [Pro
17:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027.md); [Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002).md). A good way of escaping one kind
of temptation arising from ourselves ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md). Slow to speak authoritatively
as a master or teacher of others (compare [Jam
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001).md): a common Jewish fault: slow also
to speak such hasty things of God, as in [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md). Two ears are given to us, the
rabbis observe, but only one tongue: the ears are open and exposed,
whereas the tongue is walled in behind the teeth.

slow to wrath-- ([Jam 3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md); [Jam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005).md). Slow in becoming heated by
debate: another Jewish fault ([Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008).md), to which much speaking tends.
TITTMANN thinks not so much "wrath" is meant, as an indignant feeling of
fretfulness under the calamities to which the whole of human life is
exposed; this accords with the "divers temptations" in [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md). Hastiness of temper hinders
hearing God's word; so Naaman, [Kg2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011.md); [Luk
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028.md).

[James 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jam 1:20</span></span>

Man's angry zeal in debating, as if jealous for the honor of God's
righteousness, is far from working that which is really righteousness in
God's sight. True "righteousness is sown in peace," not in wrath ([Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018).md). The oldest and best reading
means "worketh," that is, practiceth not: the received reading is
"worketh," produceth not.

[James 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jam 1:21</span></span>

lay apart--"once for all" (so the Greek): as a filthy garment. Compare
Joshua's filthy garments, [Zac 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003.md),
[Zac 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005.md); [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md). "Filthiness" is cleansed away by
hearing the word ([Joh 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003).md).

superfluity of naughtiness--excess (for instance, the intemperate spirit
implied in "wrath," [Jam 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019).md),
which arises from malice (our natural, evil disposition towards one
another). [Pe1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md) has the very same
words in the Greek. So "malice" is the translation, [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md); [Col
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008.md). "Faulty excess" \[BENGEL\] is not
strong enough. Superfluous excess in speaking is also reprobated as
"coming of evil" (the Greek is akin to the word for "naughtiness" here)
in the Sermon on the Mount ([Mat
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037).md), with which James' Epistle is so
connected.

with meekness--in mildness towards one another \[ALFORD\], the opposite
to "wrath" ([Jam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020).md): answering to
"as new-born babes" ([Pe1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002).md).
Meekness, I think, includes also a childlike, docile, humble, as well as
an uncontentious, spirit ([Psa 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md);
[Psa 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004.md); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md); [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md); [Mat
11:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md); [Mat
18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md); contrast [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008).md). On "receive," applied to ground
receiving seed, compare [Mar 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020.md).
Contrast [Act 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011.md); [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md) with [Th2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010.md).

engrafted word--the Gospel word, whose proper attribute is to be
engrafted by the Holy Spirit, so as to be livingly incorporated with the
believer, as the fruitful shoot is with the wild natural stock on which
it is engrafted. The law came to man only from without, and admonished
him of his duty. The Gospel is engrafted inwardly, and so fulfils the
ultimate design of the law ([Deu 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md);
[Deu 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md); [Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011).md). ALFORD translates, "The
implanted word," referring to the parable of the sower (Mat. 13:1-23). I
prefer English Version.

able to save--a strong incentive to correct our dulness in hearing the
word: that word which we hear so carelessly, is able (instrumentally) to
save us \[CALVIN\].

souls--your true selves, for the "body" is now liable to sickness and
death: but the soul being now saved, both soul and body at last shall be
so ([Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md), [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020).md).

[James 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jam 1:22</span></span>

Qualification of the precept, "Be swift to hear": "Be ye doers . . . not
hearers only"; not merely "Do the word," but "Be doers" systematically
and continually, as if this was your regular business. James here again
refers to the Sermon on the Mount ([Mat
7:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021).md).

deceiving your own selves--by the logical fallacy (the Greek implies
this) that the mere hearing is all that is needed.

[James 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 1:23</span></span>

For--the logical self-deceit ([Jam
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022).md) illustrated.

not a doer--more literally, "a notdoer" \[ALFORD\]. The true disciple,
say the rabbis, learns in order that he may do, not in order that he may
merely know or teach.

his natural face--literally, "the countenance of his birth": the face he
was born with. As a man may behold his natural face in a mirror, so the
hearer may perceive his moral visage in God's Word. This faithful
portraiture of man's soul in Scripture, is the strongest proof of the
truth of the latter. In it, too, we see mirrored God's glory, as well as
our natural vileness.

[James 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 1:24</span></span>

beholdeth--more literally, "he contemplated himself and hath gone his
way," that is, no sooner has he contemplated his image than he is gone
his way ([Jam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011).md). "Contemplate"
answers to hearing the word: "goeth his way," to relaxing the attention
after hearing--letting the mind go elsewhere, and the interest of the
thing heard pass away: then forgetfulness follows \[ALFORD\] (Compare
[Eze 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031).md). "Contemplate" here, and
in [Jam 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md), implies that, though
cursory, yet some knowledge of one's self, at least for the time, is
imparted in hearing the word ([Co1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024).md).

and . . . and--The repetition expresses hastiness joined with levity
\[BENGEL\].

forgetteth what manner of man he was--in the mirror. Forgetfulness is no
excuse ([Jam 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md); [Pe2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009).md).

[James 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 1:25</span></span>

looketh into--literally, "stoopeth down to take a close look into."
Peers into: stronger than "beholdeth," or "contemplated," [Jam
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#024.md). A blessed curiosity if it be
efficacious in bearing fruit \[BENGEL\].

perfect law of liberty--the Gospel rule of life, perfect and perfecting
(as shown in the Sermon on the Mount, [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048).md), and making us truly walk at
liberty ([Psa 119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032.md), Church of
England Prayer Book Version). Christians are to aim at a higher standard
of holiness than was generally understood under the law. The principle
of love takes the place of the letter of the law, so that by the Spirit
they are free from the yoke of sin, and free to obey by spontaneous
instinct ([Jam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md), [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md), [Jam
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012.md); [Joh
8:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031.md); [Joh
15:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014.md); compare [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md), [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016).md). The law is thus not made void,
but fulfilled.

continueth therein--contrasted with "goeth his way," [Jam
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#024.md), continues both looking into the
mirror of God's word, and doing its precepts.

doer of the work--rather, "a doer of work" \[ALFORD\], an actual worker.

blessed in his deed--rather, "in his doing"; in the very doing there is
blessedness ([Psa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011).md).

[James 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jam 1:26</span></span>

An example of doing work.

religious . . . religion--The Greek expresses the external service or
exercise of religion, "godliness" being the internal soul of it. "If any
man think himself to be (so the Greek) religious, that is, observant of
the offices of religion, let him know these consist not so much in
outward observances, as in such acts of mercy and humble piety ([Mic
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007).md) as visiting the fatherless,
&c., and keeping one's self unspotted from the world" ([Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).md). James does not mean that these
offices are the great essentials, or sum total of religion; but that,
whereas the law service was merely ceremonial, the very services of the
Gospel consist in acts of mercy and holiness, and it has light for its
garment, its very robe being righteousness \[TRENCH\]. The Greek word is
only found in [Act 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md), "after the
straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee." [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md), "worshipping of angels."

bridleth not . . . tongue--Discretion in speech is better than fluency
of speech (compare [Jam 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).md).
Compare [Psa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md). God alone can
enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices
this sin. For they who are free from grosser sins, and even bear the
outward show of sanctity, will often exalt themselves by detracting
others under the pretense of zeal, while their real motive is love of
evil-speaking \[CALVIN\].

heart--It and the tongue act and react on one another.

[James 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jam 1:27</span></span>

Pure . . . and undefiled--"Pure" is that love which has in it no foreign
admixture, as self-deceit and hypocrisy. "Undefiled" is the means of its
being "pure" \[TITTMANN\]. "Pure" expresses the positive, "undefiled"
the negative side of religious service; just as visiting the fatherless
and widow is the active, keeping himself unspotted from the world, the
passive side of religious duty. This is the nobler shape that our
religious exercises take, instead of the ceremonial offices of the law.

before God and the Father--literally, "before Him who is (our) God and
Father." God is so called to imply that if we would be like our Father,
it is not by fasting, &c., for He does none of these things, but in
being "merciful as our Father is merciful" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

visit--in sympathy and kind offices to alleviate their distresses.

the fatherless--whose "Father" is God ([Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005).md); peculiarly helpless.

and--not in the Greek; so close is the connection between active works
of mercy to others, and the maintenance of personal unworldliness of
spirit, word, and deed; no copula therefore is needed. Religion in its
rise interests us about ourselves in its progress, about our fellow
creatures: in its highest stage, about the honor of God.

keep himself--with jealous watchfulness, at the same time praying and
depending on God as alone able to keep us ([Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md); [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024).md).
