### [Psalms Chapter 94](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 94:1</span></span>

The writer, appealing to God in view of the oppression of enemies,
rebukes them for their wickedness and folly, and encourages himself, in
the confidence that God will punish evildoers, and favor His people.
(Psa. 94:1-23)

God's revenge is His judicial infliction of righteous punishment.

show thyself--(Compare Margin).

[Psalms 94:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 94:2</span></span>

Lift up thyself--or, "Arise," both figures representing God as
heretofore indifferent (compare [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md); [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md), [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 94:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 94:3</span></span>

In an earnest expostulation he expresses his desire that the insolent
triumph of the wicked may be ended.

[Psalms 94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 94:5</span></span>

thy people \[and\] thine heritage--are synonymous, the people being
often called God's heritage. As justice to the weak is a sign of the
best government, their oppression is a sign of the worst ([Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md); [Isa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 94:7</span></span>

Their cruelty is only exceeded by their wicked and absurd presumption
([Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md); [Psa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 94:8</span></span>

ye brutish--(Compare [Psa 73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022.md); [Psa
92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 94:9</span></span>

The evidence of God's providential government is found in His creative
power and omniscience, which also assure us that He can punish the
wicked in regard to all their vain purposes.

[Psalms 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 94:12</span></span>

On the other hand He favors though He chastens, the pious, and will
teach and preserve them till the prosperous wicked are overthrown.

[Psalms 94:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 94:14</span></span>

This results from His abiding love ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md), which is further evinced by
His restoring order in His government, whose right administration will
be approved by the good.

[Psalms 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 94:16</span></span>

These questions imply that none other than God will help ([Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009).md),

[Psalms 94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 94:17</span></span>

a fact fully confirmed by his past experience.

dwelt in silence--as in the grave ([Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 94:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 94:19</span></span>

my thoughts--or, anxious cares.

[Psalms 94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 94:20</span></span>

throne--power, rulers.

iniquity \[and\] mischief--both denote evils done to others, as [Psa
94:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#021.md) explains.

[Psalms 94:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 94:22</span></span>

Yet he is safe in God's care.

defence-- ([Psa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009).md).

rock of . . . refuge-- ([Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 94:23</span></span>

bring . . . iniquity--(Compare [Psa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md); [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016).md).

in their . . . wickedness--while they are engaged in evil doing.
