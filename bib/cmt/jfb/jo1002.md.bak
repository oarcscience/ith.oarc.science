### [1 John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)

[1 John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 2:1</span></span>

THE ADVOCACY OF CHRIST IS OUR ANTIDOTE TO SIN WHILE WALKING IN THE
LIGHT; FOR TO KNOW GOD, WE MUST KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND LOVE THE
BRETHREN, AND NOT LOVE THE WORLD, NOR GIVE HEED TO ANTICHRISTS, AGAINST
WHOM OUR SAFETY IS THROUGH THE INWARD ANOINTING OF GOD TO ABIDE IN GOD:
SO AT CHRIST'S COMING WE SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED. (1Jo. 2:1-29)

([Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018)..md)

My little children--The diminutive expresses the tender affection of an
aged pastor and spiritual father. My own dear children, that is, sons
and daughters (see on [Jo1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012).md).

these things-- ([Jo1 1:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).md). My
purpose in writing what I have just written is not that you should abuse
them as giving a license to sin but, on the contrary, "in order that ye
may not sin at all" (the Greek aorist, implying the absence not only of
the habit, but of single acts of sin \[ALFORD\]). In order to "walk in
the light" ([Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md), [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).md), the first step is confession of
sin ([Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md), the next ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).md) is that we should forsake all
sin. The divine purpose has for its aim, either to prevent the
commission of, or to destroy sin \[BENGEL\].

And, &c.--connected with the former; Furthermore, "if any man sin," let
him, while loathing and condemning it, not fear to go at once to God,
the Judge, confessing it, for "we have an Advocate with Him." He is
speaking of a BELIEVER'S occasional sins of infirmity through Satan's
fraud and malice. The use of "we" immediately afterwards implies that we
all are liable to this, though not necessarily constrained to sin.

we have an advocate--Advocacy is God's family blessing; other blessings
He grants to good and bad alike, but justification, sanctification,
continued intercession, and peace, He grants to His children alone.

advocate--Greek, "paraclete," the same term as is applied to the Holy
Ghost, as the "other Comforter"; showing the unity of the Second and
Third Persons of the Trinity. Christ is the Intercessor for us above;
and, in His absence, here below the Holy Ghost is the other Intercessor
in us. Christ's advocacy is inseparable from the Holy Spirit's comfort
and working in us, as the spirit of intercessory prayer.

righteous--As our "advocate," Christ is not a mere suppliant petitioner.
He pleads for us on the ground of justice, or righteousness, as well as
mercy. Though He can say nothing good of us, He can say much for us. It
is His righteousness, or obedience to the law, and endurance of its full
penalty for us, on which He grounds His claim for our acquittal. The
sense therefore is, "in that He is righteous"; in contrast to our sin
("if any man sin"). The Father, by raising Him from the dead, and
setting Him at His own right, has once for all accepted Christ's claim
for us. Therefore the accuser's charges against God's children are vain.
"The righteousness of Christ stands on our side; for God's righteousness
is, in Jesus Christ, ours" \[LUTHER\].

[1 John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 2:2</span></span>

And he--Greek, "And Himself." He is our all-prevailing Advocate, because
He is Himself "the propitiation"; abstract, as in [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md) : He is to us all that is needed
for propitiation "in behalf of our sins"; the propitiatory sacrifice,
provided by the Father's love, removing the estrangement, and appeasing
the righteous wrath, on God's part, against the sinner. "There is no
incongruity that a father should be offended with that son whom he
loveth, and at that time offended with him when he loveth him" \[BISHOP
PEARSON\]. The only other place in the New Testament where Greek
"propitiation" occurs, is [Jo1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md);
it answers in the Septuagint to Hebrew, "caphar," to effect an atonement
or reconciliation with God; and in [Eze
44:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#029.md), to the sin offering. In [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md), Greek, it is "propitiatory,"
that is, the mercy seat, or lid of the ark whereon God, represented by
the Shekinah glory above it, met His people, represented by the high
priest who sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice on it.

and--Greek, "yet."

ours--believers: not Jews, in contrast to Gentiles; for he is not
writing to Jews ([Jo1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021).md).

also for the sins of the whole world--Christ's "advocacy" is limited to
believers ([Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).md): His propitiation extends as
widely as sin extends: see on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md), "denying the Lord that bought
them." "The whole world" cannot be restricted to the believing portion
of the world (compare [Jo1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md); and
"the whole world," [Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md). "Thou,
too, art part of the world, so that thine heart cannot deceive itself
and think, The Lord died for Peter and Paul, but not for me" \[LUTHER\].

[1 John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 2:3</span></span>

hereby--Greek, "in this." "It is herein," and herein only, that we know
(present tense) that we have knowledge of (perfect tense, once-for-all
obtained and continuing knowledge of) Him" ([Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md), [Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).md). Tokens whereby to discern
grace are frequently given in this Epistle. The Gnostics, by the
Spirit's prescient forewarning, are refuted, who boasted of knowledge,
but set aside obedience. "Know Him," namely, as "the righteous" ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029).md); our "Advocate and Intercessor."

keep--John's favorite word, instead of "do," literally, "watch,"
"guard," and "keep safe" as a precious thing; observing so as to keep.
So Christ Himself. Not faultless conformity, but hearty acceptance of,
and willing subjection to, God's whole revealed will, is meant.

commandments--injunctions of faith, love, and obedience. John never uses
"the law" to express the rule of Christian obedience: he uses it as the
Mosaic law.

[1 John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 2:4</span></span>

I know--Greek, "I have knowledge of (perfect) Him." Compare with this
verse [Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md).

[1 John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 2:5</span></span>

Not merely repeating the proposition, [Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), or asserting the merely opposite
alternative to [Jo1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md), but expanding
the "know Him" of [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), into "in
Him, verily (not as a matter of vain boasting) is the love of (that is
towards) God perfected," and "we are in Him." Love here answers to
knowledge in [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md). In proportion
as we love God, in that same proportion we know Him, and vice versa,
until our love and knowledge shall attain their full maturity of
perfection.

his word--His word is one (see on [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md), and comprises His
"commandments," which are many ([Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003).md).

hereby--in our progressing towards this ideal of perfected love and
obedience. There is a gradation: [Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), "know Him"; [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md), "we are in Him"; [Jo1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006.md), "abideth in Him"; respectively,
knowledge, fellowship, abiding constancy. \[BENGEL\].

[1 John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 2:6</span></span>

abideth--implying a condition lasting, without intermission, and without
end.

He that saith . . . ought--so that his deeds may be consistent with his
words.

even as he--Believers readily supply the name, their hearts being full
of Him (compare [Joh 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015).md). "Even as
He walked" when on earth, especially in respect to love. John delights
in referring to Christ as the model man, with the words, "Even as He,"
&c. "It is not Christ's walking on the sea, but His ordinary walk, that
we are called on to imitate" \[LUTHER\].

[1 John 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 2:7</span></span>

Brethren--The oldest manuscripts and versions read instead, "Beloved,"
appropriate to the subject here, love.

no new commandment--namely, love, the main principle of walking as
Christ walked ([Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).md), and that
commandment, of which one exemplification is presently given, [Jo1
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009.md), the love of brethren.

ye had from the beginning--from the time that ye first heard the Gospel
word preached.

[1 John 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 2:8</span></span>

a new commandment--It was "old," in that Christians as such had heard it
from the first; but "new" (Greek, "kaine," not "nea": new and different
from the old legal precept) in that it was first clearly promulgated
with Christianity; though the inner spirit of the law was love even to
enemies, yet it was enveloped in some bitter precepts which caused it to
be temporarily almost unrecognized, till the Gospel came. Christianity
first put love to brethren on the new and highest MOTIVE, instinctive
love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even
enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies.
So Jesus calls it "new," [Joh
13:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md), "Love one another as I have
loved you" (the new motive); [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md).

which thing is true in him and in you--"In Christ all things are always
true, and were so from the beginning; but in Christ and in us conjointly
the commandment \[the love of brethren\] is then true when we
acknowledge the truth which is in Him, and have the same flourishing in
us" \[BENGEL\]. ALFORD explains, "Which thing (the fact that the
commandment is a new one) is true in Him and in you because the darkness
is passing away, and the true light is now shining; that is, the
commandment is a new one, and this is true both in the case of Christ
and in the case of you; because in you the darkness is passing away, and
in Him the true light is shining; therefore, on both accounts, the
command is a new one: new as regards you, because you are newly come
from darkness into light; new as regards Him, because He uttered it when
He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that shining
which even now continues." I prefer, as BENGEL, to explain, The new
commandment finds its truth in its practical realization in the walk of
Christians in union with Christ. Compare the use of "verily," [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md). [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042.md), "indeed"; [Joh
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md). The repetition of "in" before
"you," "in Him and in you," not "in Him and you" implies that the love
commandment finds its realization separately: first it did so "in Him,"
and then it does so "in us," in so far as we now "also walk even as He
walked"; and yet it finds its realization also conjointly, by the two
being united in one sentence, even as it is by virtue of the love
commandment having been first fulfilled in Him, that it is also now
fulfilled in us, through His Spirit in us: compare a similar case, [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md), "My Father and your Father"; by
virtue of His being "My Father," He is also your Father.

darkness is past--rather, as in [Jo1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017.md), "is passing away." It shall not
be wholly "past" until "the Sun of righteousness" shall arise visibly;
"the light is now shining" already, though but partially until the day
bursts forth.

[1 John 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 2:9</span></span>

There is no mean between light and darkness, love and hatred, life and
death, God and the world: wherever spiritual life is, however weak,
there darkness and death no longer reign, and love supplants hatred; and
[Luk 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#050.md) holds good: wherever life is
not, there death, darkness, the flesh, the world, and hatred, however
glossed over and hidden from man's observation, prevail; and [Luk
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023.md) holds good. "Where love is not,
there hatred is; for the heart cannot remain a void" \[BENGEL\].

in the light--as his proper element.

his brother--his neighbor, and especially those of the Christian
brotherhood. The very title "brother" is a reason why love should be
exercised.

even until now--notwithstanding that "the true light already has begun
to shine" ([Jo1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008).md).

[1 John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 2:10</span></span>

Abiding in love is abiding in the light; for the Gospel light not only
illumines the understanding, but warms the heart into love.

none occasion of stumbling--In contrast to, "He that hateth his brother
is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he
goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes." "In him who loves
there is neither blindness nor occasion of stumbling \[to himself\]: in
him who does not love, there is both blindness and occasion of
stumbling. He who hates his brother, is both a stumbling-block to
himself, and stumbles against himself and everything within and without;
he who loves has an unimpeded path" \[BENGEL\]. John has in mind Jesus'
words, [Joh 11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009.md). ALFORD well says,
"The light and the darkness are within ourselves; admitted into us by
the eye, whose singleness fills the whole body with light."

[1 John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 2:11</span></span>

is in darkness . . . walketh--"is" marks his continuing STATE: he has
never come out of "the darkness" (so Greek); "walketh" marks his OUTWARD
WALK and acts.

whither--Greek, "where"; including not only the destination to which,
but the way whereby.

hath blinded--rather, as Greek aorist, "blinded" of old. Darkness not
only surrounds, but blinds him, and that a blindness of long standing.

[1 John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 2:12</span></span>

little children--Greek, "little sons," or "dear sons and daughters"; not
the same Greek as in [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md),
"little children," "infants" (in age and standing). He calls ALL to whom
he writes, "little sons" ([Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md),
Greek; [Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028.md); [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021).md); but only in [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md) he uses the term "little
children," or "infants." Our Lord, whose Spirit John so deeply drank
into, used to His disciples ([Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033).md) the term "little sons," or dear
sons and daughters; but in [Joh 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005.md),
"little children." It is an undesigned coincidence with the Epistle
here, that in John's Gospel somewhat similarly the classification,
"lambs, sheep, sheep," occurs.

are forgiven--"have been, and are forgiven you": ALL God's sons and
daughters alike enjoy this privilege.

[1 John 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 2:13</span></span>

All three classes are first addressed in the present. "I write"; then in
the past (aorist) tense, "I wrote" (not "I have written"; moreover, in
the oldest manuscripts and versions, in the end of [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), it is past, "I wrote," not as
English Version, "I write"). Two classes, "fathers" and "young men," are
addressed with the same words each time (except that the address to the
young men has an addition expressing the source and means of their
victory); but the "little sons" and "little children" are differently
addressed.

have known--and do know: so the Greek perfect means. The "I wrote"
refers not to a former Epistle, but to this Epistle. It was an idiom to
put the past tense, regarding the time from the reader's point of view;
when he should receive the Epistle the writing would be past. When he
uses "I write," he speaks from his own point of view.

him that is from the beginning--Christ: "that which was from the
beginning."

overcome--The fathers, appropriately to their age, are characterized by
knowledge. The young men, appropriately to theirs, by activity in
conflict. The fathers, too, have conquered; but now their active service
is past, and they and the children alike are characterized by knowing
(the fathers know Christ, "Him that was from the beginning"; the
children know the Father). The first thing that the little children
realize is that God is their Father; answering in the parallel clause to
"little sons . . . your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake," the
universal first privilege of all those really-dear sons of God. Thus
this latter clause includes all, whereas the former clause refers to
those more especially who are in the first stage of spiritual life,
"little children." Of course, these can only know the Father as theirs
through the Son ([Mat 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027).md). It is
beautiful to see how the fathers are characterized as reverting back to
the first great truths of spiritual childhood, and the sum and ripest
fruit of advanced experience, the knowledge of Him that was from the
beginning (twice repeated, [Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).md). Many of them had probably
known Jesus in person, as well as by faith.

[1 John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 2:14</span></span>

young men . . . strong--made so out of natural weakness, hence enabled
to overcome "the strong man armed" through Him that is "stronger." Faith
is the victory that overcomes the world. This term "overcome" is
peculiarly John's, adopted from his loved Lord. It occurs sixteen times
in the Apocalypse, six times in the First Epistle, only thrice in the
rest of the New Testament. In order to overcome the world on the ground,
and in the strength, of the blood of the Saviour, we must be willing,
like Christ, to part with whatever of the world belongs to us: whence
immediately after "ye have overcome the wicked one (the prince of the
world)," it is added, "Love not the world, neither the things . . . in
the world."

and, &c.--the secret of the young men's strength: the Gospel word,
clothed with living power by the Spirit who abideth permanently in them;
this is "the sword of the Spirit" wielded in prayerful waiting on God.
Contrast the mere physical strength of young men, [Isa
40:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030.md). Oral teaching prepared these
youths for the profitable use of the word when written. "Antichrist
cannot endanger you ([Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018).md), nor
Satan tear from you the word of God."

the wicked one--who, as "prince of this world," enthrals "the world"
([Jo1 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019), Greek, "the wicked one".md),
especially the young. Christ came to destroy this "prince of the world."
Believers achieve the first grand conquest over him when they pass from
darkness to light, but afterwards they need to maintain a continual
keeping of themselves from his assaults, looking to God by whom alone
they are kept safe. BENGEL thinks John refers specially to the
remarkable constancy exhibited by youths in Domitian's persecution. Also
to the young man whom John, after his return from Patmos, led with
gentle, loving persuasion to repentance. This youth had been commended
to the overseers of the Church by John, in one of his tours of
superintendency, as a promising disciple; he had been, therefore,
carefully watched up to baptism. But afterwards relying too much on
baptismal grace, he joined evil associates, and fell from step to step
down, till he became a captain of robbers. When John, some years after,
revisited that Church and heard of the youth's sad fall, he hastened to
the retreat of the robbers, suffered himself to be seized and taken into
the captain's presence. The youth, stung by conscience and the
remembrance of former years, fled away from the venerable apostle. Full
of love the aged father ran after him, called on him to take courage,
and announced to him forgiveness of his sins in the name of Christ. The
youth was recovered to the paths of Christianity, and was the means of
inducing many of his bad associates to repent and believe \[CLEMENT OF
ALEXANDRIA, Who Is the Rich Man Who Shall Be Saved? 4.2; EUSEBIUS,
Ecclesiastical History, 3.20; CHRYSOSTOM, First Exhortation to Theodore,
11\].

[1 John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 2:15</span></span>

Love not the world--that lieth in the wicked one ([Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md), whom ye young men have
overcome. Having once for all, through faith, overcome the world ([Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md), carry forward the conquest by
not loving it. "The world" here means "man, and man's world" \[ALFORD\],
in his and its state as fallen from God. "God loved \[with the love of
compassion\] the world," and we should feel the same kind of love for
the fallen world; but we are not to love the world with congeniality and
sympathy in its alienation from God; we cannot have this latter kind of
love for the God-estranged world, and yet have also "the love of the
Father in" us.

neither--Greek, "nor yet." A man might deny in general that he loved the
world, while keenly following some one of THE THINGS IN IT: its riches,
honors, or pleasures; this clause prevents him escaping from conviction.

any man--therefore the warning, though primarily addressed to the young,
applies to all.

love of--that is, towards "the Father." The two, God and the (sinful)
world, are so opposed, that both cannot be congenially loved at once.

[1 John 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 2:16</span></span>

all that is in the world--can be classed under one or other of the
three; the world contains these and no more.

lust of the flesh--that is, the lust which has its seat and source in
our lower animal nature. Satan tried this temptation the first on
Christ: [Luk 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#003.md), "Command this stone
that it be made bread." Youth is especially liable to fleshly lusts.

lust of the eyes--the avenue through which outward things of the world,
riches, pomp, and beauty, inflame us. Satan tried this temptation on
Christ when he showed Him the kingdoms of the world in a moment. By the
lust of the eyes David ([Sa2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002).md) and
Achan fell ([Jos 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021).md). Compare
David's prayer, [Psa 119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037.md); Job's
resolve, [Psa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md); [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md). The only good of worldly riches
to the possessor is the beholding them with the eyes. Compare [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md), "I must go and SEE it."

pride of life--literally, "arrogant assumption": vainglorious display.
Pride was Satan's sin whereby he fell and forms the link between the two
foes of man, the world (answering to "the lust of the eyes") and the
devil (as "the lust of the flesh" is the third foe). Satan tried this
temptation on Christ in setting Him on the temple pinnacle that, in
spiritual pride and presumption, on the ground of His Father's care, He
should cast Himself down. The same three foes appear in the three
classes of soil on which the divine seed falls: the wayside hearers, the
devil; the thorns, the world; the rocky undersoil, the flesh ([Mat
13:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018.md); [Mar
4:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#003).md). The world's awful antitrinity,
the "lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,"
similarly is presented in Satan's temptation of Eve: "When she saw that
the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
desired to make one wise," [Gen 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006.md)
(one manifestation of "the pride of life," the desire to know above what
God has revealed, [Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), the pride
of unsanctified knowledge).

of--does not spring from "the Father" (used in relation to the preceding
"little children," [Jo1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md), or
"little sons"). He who is born of God alone turns to God; he who is of
the world turns to the world; the sources of love to God and love to the
world, are irreconcilably distinct.

[1 John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 2:17</span></span>

the world--with all who are of the world worldly.

passeth away--Greek, "is passing away" even now.

the lust thereof--in its threefold manifestation ([Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md).

he that doeth the will of God--not his own fleshly will, or the will of
the world, but that of God ([Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md),
[Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).md), especially in respect to
love.

abideth for ever--"even as God also abideth for ever" (with whom the
godly is one; compare [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md),
"God, even He that abideth of old): a true comment, which CYPRIAN and
LUCIFER have added to the text without support of Greek manuscripts. In
contrast to the three passing lusts of the world, the doer of God's will
has three abiding goods, "riches, honor, and life" ([Pro
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004).md).

[1 John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 2:18</span></span>

Little children--same Greek as [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); children in age. After the
fathers and young men were gone, "the last time" with its "many
Antichrists" was about to come suddenly on the children. "In this last
hour we all even still live" \[BENGEL\]. Each successive age has had in
it some of the signs of "the last time" which precedes Christ's coming,
in order to keep the Church in continual waiting for the Lord. The
connection with [Jo1 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md) is: There
are coming those seducers who are of the world ([Jo1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005).md), and would tempt you to go out
from us ([Jo1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).md) and deny Christ
([Jo1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022).md).

as ye have heard--from the apostles, preachers of the Gospel (for
example, [Th2 2:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md); and in the
region of Ephesus, [Act 20:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029).md).

shall come--Greek, "cometh," namely, out of his own place. Antichrist is
interpreted in two ways: a false Christ ([Mat
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005.md), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024).md), literally, "instead of
Christ"; or an adversary of Christ, literally, "against Christ." As John
never uses pseudo-Christ, or "false Christ," for Antichrist, it is plain
he means an adversary of Christ, claiming to himself what belongs to
Christ, and wishing to substitute himself for Christ as the supreme
object of worship. He denies the Son, not merely, like the pope, acts in
the name of the Son, [Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md), "Who
opposeth himself (Greek, " ANTI-keimenos") \[to\] all that is called
God," decides this. For God's great truth, "God is man," he would
substitute his own lie, "man is God" \[TRENCH\].

are there--Greek, "there have begun to be"; there have arisen. These
"many Antichrists" answer to "the spirit of lawlessness (Greek) doth
already work." The Antichristian principle appeared then, as now, in
evil men and evil teachings and writings; but still "THE Antichrist"
means a hostile person, even as "THE Christ" is a personal Saviour. As
"cometh" is used of Christ, so here of Antichrist, the embodiment in his
own person of all the Antichristian features and spirit of those "many
Antichrists" which have been, and are, his forerunners. John uses the
singular of him. No other New Testament writer uses the term. He
probably answers to "the little horn having the eyes of a man, and
speaking great things" ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020).md); "the man of sin, son of
perdition" ([Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).md); "the beast
ascending out of the bottomless pit" ([Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md); [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008).md), or rather, "the false prophet,"
the same as "the second beast coming up out of the earth" ([Rev
13:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md); [Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013).md).

[1 John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 2:19</span></span>

out from us--from our Christian communion. Not necessarily a formal
secession or going out: thus Rome has spiritually gone out, though
formally still of the Christian Church.

not of us--by spiritual fellowship ([Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003).md). "They are like bad humors in the
body of Christ, the Church: when they are vomited out, then the body is
relieved; the body of Christ is now still under treatment, and has not
yet attained the perfect soundness which it shall have only at the
resurrection" \[AUGUSTINE, Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John,
Homily 3.4\].

they would . . . have continued--implying the indefectibility of grace
in the elect. "Where God's call is effectual, there will be sure
perseverance" \[CALVIN\]. Still, it is no fatal necessity, but a
"voluntary necessity" \[DIDYMUS\], which causes men to remain, or else
go from the body of Christ. "We are either among the members, or else
among the bad humors. It is of his own will that each is either an
Antichrist, or in Christ" \[AUGUSTINE\]. Still God's actings in eternal
election harmonize in a way inexplicable to us, with man's free agency
and responsibility. It is men's own evil will that chooses the way to
hell; it is God's free and sovereign grace that draws any to Himself and
to heaven. To God the latter shall ascribe wholly their salvation from
first to last: the former shall reproach themselves alone, and not God's
decree, with their condemnation ([Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md).

that they were not all of us--This translation would imply that some of
the Antichrists are of us! Translate, therefore, "that all (who are for
a time among us) are not of us." Compare [Co1
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019.md), "There must be heresies among
you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you." For
"were" some of the oldest manuscripts read "are." Such occasions test
who are, and who are not, the Lord's people.

[1 John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 2:20</span></span>

But--Greek, "And." He here states the means which they as believers have
wherewith to withstand. Antichrists ([Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018).md), namely, the chrism (so the
Greek: a play upon similar sounds), or "anointing unguent," namely, the
Holy Spirit (more plainly mentioned further on, as in John's style, [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md); [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013.md); [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006).md), which they ("ye" is emphatical
in contrast to those apostates, [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).md) have "from the Holy One, Christ"
([Joh 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034.md); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014).md): "the righteous" ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).md), "pure" ([Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md), "the Holy One" ([Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014).md) "of God"; [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md). Those anointed of God in Christ
alone can resist those anointed with the spirit of Satan, Antichrists,
who would sever them from the Father and from the Son. Believers have
the anointing Spirit from the Father also, as well as from the Son; even
as the Son is anointed therewith by the Father. Hence the Spirit is the
token that we are in the Father and in the Son; without it a man is none
of Christ. The material unguent of costliest ingredients, poured on the
head of priests and kings, typified this spiritual unguent, derived from
Christ, the Head, to us, His members. We can have no share in Him as
Jesus, except we become truly Christians, and so be in Him as Christ,
anointed with that unction from the Holy One. The Spirit poured on
Christ, the Head, is by Him diffused through all the members. "It
appears that we all are the body of Christ, because we all are anointed:
and we all in Him are both Christ's and Christ, because in some measure
the whole Christ is Head and body."

and--therefore.

ye know all things--needful for acting aright against Antichrist's
seductions, and for Christian life and godliness. In the same measure as
one hath the Spirit, in that measure (no more and no less) he knows all
these things.

[1 John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 2:21</span></span>

but because ye know it, and that, &c.--Ye not only know what is the
truth (concerning the Son and the Father, [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).md), but also are able to detect a
lie as a thing opposed to the truth. For right (a straight line) is the
index of itself and of what is crooked \[ESTIUS\]. The Greek is
susceptible of ALFORD'S translation, "Because ye know it, and because no
lie is of the truth" (literally, "every lie is excluded from being of
the truth"). I therefore wrote (in this Epistle) to point out what the
lie is, and who the liars are.

[1 John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jo1 2:22</span></span>

a liar--Greek, "Who is the liar?" namely, guilty of the lie just
mentioned ([Jo1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021).md).

that Jesus is the Christ--the grand central truth.

He is Antichrist--Greek, "the Antichrist"; not however here personal,
but in the abstract; the ideal of Antichrist is "he that denieth the
Father and the Son." To deny the latter is virtually to deny the former.
Again, the truth as to the Son must be held in its integrity; to deny
that Jesus is the Christ, or that He is the Son of God, or that He came
in the flesh, invalidates the whole ([Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027).md).

[1 John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jo1 2:23</span></span>

Greek, "Every one who denieth the Son, hath not the Father either" ([Jo1
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002).md): "inasmuch as God hath given
Himself to us wholly to be enjoyed in Christ" \[CALVIN\].

he--that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. These words ought
not to be in italics, as though they were not in the original: for the
oldest Greek manuscripts have them.

hath--namely, in his abiding possession as his "portion"; by living
personal "fellowship."

acknowledgeth--by open confession of Christ.

[1 John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jo1 2:24</span></span>

Let that--truth respecting the Father and the Son, regarded as a seed
not merely dropped in, but having taken root ([Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009).md).

ye--in the Greek standing emphatically at the beginning of the sentence.
YE, therefore, acknowledge the Son, and so shall ye have the Father also
([Jo1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023).md).

from the beginning--from the time of your first hearing the Gospel.

remain--Translate as before, "abide."

ye also--in your turn, as distinguished from "that which ye have heard,"
the seed abiding in you. Compare [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md), "the anointing abideth in you .
. . ye shall abide in Him." Having taken into us the living seed of the
truth concerning the Father and the Son, we become transformed into the
likeness of Him whose seed we have taken into us.

[1 John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jo1 2:25</span></span>

this is the promise--Eternal life shall be the permanent consummation of
thus abiding in the Son and in the Father ([Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024).md).

he--Greek, "Himself," Christ, "the Son" (compare [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md).

promised-- ([Joh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015.md), [Joh

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jo1 2:27</span></span>

But--Greek, "And you (contrasting the believing readers with the
seducers; the words 'and you' stand prominent, the construction of the
sentence following being altered, and no verb agreeing with 'and you'
until 'need not') . . . the anointing," &c. (resumed from [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020).md).

received of him-- ([Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016).md). So we
"are unto God a sweet savor of Christ."

abideth in you--He tacitly thus admonishes them to say, when tempted by
seducers, "The anointing abideth in us; we do not need a teacher \[for
we have the Holy Spirit as our teacher, [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md); [Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)\]; it teaches us the truth; in
that teaching we will abide" \[BENGEL\].

and--and therefore. God is sufficient for them who are taught of Him;
they are independent of all others, though, of course, not declining the
Christian counsel of faithful ministers. "Mutual communication is not
set aside, but approved of, in the case of those who are partakers of
the anointing in one body" \[BENGEL\].

the same anointing--which ye once for all received, and which now still
abides in you.

of--"concerning."

all things--essential to salvation; the point under discussion. Not that
the believer is made infallible, for no believer here receives the
Spirit in all its fulness, but only the measure needful for keeping him
from soul-destroying error. So the Church, though having the Spirit in
her, is not infallible (for many fallible members can never make an
infallible whole), but is kept from ever wholly losing the saving truth.

no lie--as Antichristian teaching.

ye shall abide in him-- ([Jo1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024.md),

read the imperative, "abide in Him."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jo1 2:28</span></span>

little children--Greek, "little sons," as in [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md); believers of every stage and
age.

appellation, as a father addressing dear children.

when--literally, "if"; the uncertainty is not as to the fact, but the
time.

we--both writer and readers.

ashamed before him--literally, "from Him"; shrink back from Him ashamed.
Contrast "boldness in the day of judgment," [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md); compare [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md); [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). In the Apocalypse (written,
therefore, BENGEL thinks, subsequently), Christ's coming is represented
as put off to a greater distance.

[1 John 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jo1 2:29</span></span>

The heading of the second division of the Epistle: "God is righteous;
therefore, every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him." Love is
the grand feature and principle of "righteousness" selected for
discussion, 1Jo. 2:29-3:3.

If ye know . . . ye know--distinct Greek verbs: "if ye are aware (are in
possession of the knowledge) . . . ye discern or apprehend also that,"
&c. Ye are already aware that God ("He" includes both "the Father," of
whom the believer is born (end of this verse, and [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md), and "the Son," [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023).md) is righteous, ye must
necessarily, thereby, perceive also the consequence of that truth,
namely, "that everyone that doeth righteousness (and he alone;
literally, the righteousness such as the righteous God approves) is born
of Him." The righteous produceth the righteous. We are never said to be
born again of Christ, but of God, with whom Christ is one. HOLLAZ in
ALFORD defines the righteousness of God, "It is the divine energy by
whose power God wills and does all things which are conformable to His
eternal law, prescribes suitable laws to His creatures, fulfils His
promises to men, rewards the good, and punishes the ungodly."

doeth--"For the graces (virtues) are practical, and have their being in
being produced (in being exercised); for when they have ceased to act,
or are only about to act, they have not even being" \[Å“CUMENIUS\]. "God
is righteous, and therefore the source of righteousness; when then a man
doeth righteousness, we know that the source of his righteousness is
God, that consequently he has acquired by new birth from God that
righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his doing
righteousness, to his being born of God. The error of Pelagians is to
conclude that doing righteousness is a condition of becoming a child of
God" \[ALFORD most truly\]. Compare [Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047.md), [Luk
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050.md) : Her much love evinced that her
sins were already forgiven; not, were the condition of her sins being
forgiven.
