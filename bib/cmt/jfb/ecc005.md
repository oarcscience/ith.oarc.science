### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 5:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 5:1-20)

From vanity connected with kings, he passes to vanities ([Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007).md) which may be fallen into in
serving the King of kings, even by those who, convinced of the vanity of
the creature, wish to worship the Creator.

Keep thy foot--In going to worship, go with considerate, circumspect,
reverent feeling. The allusion is to the taking off the shoes, or
sandals, in entering a temple ([Exo
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005.md); [Jos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#015.md), which passages perhaps gave rise
to the custom). WEISS needlessly reads, "Keep thy feast days" ([Exo
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md), [Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017); the three great feasts.md).

hear--rather, "To be ready (to draw nigh with the desire) to hear (obey)
is a better sacrifice than the offering of fools" \[HOLDEN\]. (Vulgate;
Syriac). ([Psa 51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md); [Pro
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003.md); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md); [Jer
7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md); [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012.md); [Amo
5:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).md). The warning is against mere
ceremonial self-righteousness, as in [Ecc
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md). Obedience is the spirit of the
law's requirements ([Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012).md).
Solomon sorrowfully looks back on his own neglect of this (compare [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md) with [Ecc
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md), [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006).md). Positive precepts of God must
be kept, but will not stand instead of obedience to His moral precepts.
The last provided no sacrifice for wilful sin ([Num
15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md); [Heb
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 5:2</span></span>

rash--opposed to the considerate reverence ("keep thy foot," [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001).md). This verse illustrates [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md), as to prayer in the house of God
("before God," [Isa 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012).md); so [Ecc
5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md) as to vows. The remedy to such
vanities is stated ([Ecc 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006).md). "Fear
thou God."

God is in heaven--Therefore He ought to be approached with carefully
weighed words, by thee, a frail creature of earth.

[Ecclesiastes 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 5:3</span></span>

As much "business," engrossing the mind, gives birth to incoherent
"dreams," so many words, uttered inconsiderately in prayer, give birth
to and betray "a fool's speech" ([Ecc
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014).md), \[HOLDEN and WEISS\]. But [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md) implies that the "dream" is not a
comparison, but the vain thoughts of the fool (sinner, [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020).md), arising from multiplicity of
(worldly) "business." His "dream" is that God hears him for his much
speaking ([Mat 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007).md), independently of
the frame of mind \[English Version and MAURER\].

fool's voice--answers to "dream" in the parallel; it comes by the many
"words" flowing from the fool's "dream."

[Ecclesiastes 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 5:4</span></span>

When thou vowest a vow unto God--Hasty words in prayer ([Ecc
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002).md) suggest the subject of hasty
vows. A vow should not be hastily made ([Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035.md); [Sa1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024).md). When made, it must be kept
([Psa 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011).md), even as God keeps His
word to us ([Exo 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md), [Exo
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051.md); [Jos
21:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#045).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 5:5</span></span>

([Deu 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md), [Deu
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 5:6</span></span>

thy flesh--Vow not with "thy mouth" a vow (for example, fasting), which
the lusts of the flesh ("body," [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003), Margin.md) may tempt thee to break
([Pro 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025).md).

angel--the "messenger" of God ([Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md); minister ([Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020).md); that is, the priest ([Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md) "before" whom a breach of a vow
was to be confessed ([Lev 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004).md). We,
Christians, in our vows (for example, at baptism, the Lord's Supper,
&c.) vow in the presence of Jesus Christ, "the angel of the covenant"
([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md), and of ministering angels
as witnesses ([Co1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md); [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021).md). Extenuate not any breach of
them as a slight error.

[Ecclesiastes 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 5:7</span></span>

(See on [Ecc 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003).md). God's service,
which ought to be our chief good, becomes by "dreams" (foolish fancies
as of God's requirements of us in worship), and random "words," positive
"vanity." The remedy is, whatever fools may do, "Fear thou God" ([Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 5:8</span></span>

As in [Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md), so here the
difficulty suggests itself. If God is so exact in even punishing hasty
words ([Ecc 5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001).md), why does He allow
gross injustice? In the remote "provinces," the "poor" often had to put
themselves for protection from the inroads of Philistines, &c., under
chieftains, who oppressed them even in Solomon's reign ([Kg1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004).md).

the matter--literally, "the pleasure," or purpose ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). Marvel not at this
dispensation of God's will, as if He had abandoned the world. Nay, there
is coming a capital judgment at last, and an earnest of it in partial
punishments of sinners meanwhile.

higher than the highest-- ([Dan 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018).md).

regardeth-- ([Ch2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009).md).

there be higher--plural, that is, the three persons of the Godhead, or
else, "regardeth not only the 'highest' kings, than whom He 'is higher,'
but even the petty tyrants of the provinces, namely, the high ones who
are above them" (the poor) \[WEISS\].

[Ecclesiastes 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 5:9</span></span>

"The profit (produce) of the earth is (ordained) for (the common good
of) all: even the king himself is served by (the fruits of) the field"
([Ch2 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010).md). Therefore the common
Lord of all, high and low, will punish at last those who rob the "poor"
of their share in it ([Pro 22:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md);
[Amo 8:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 5:10</span></span>

Not only will God punish at last, but meanwhile the oppressive gainers
of "silver" find no solid "satisfaction" in it.

shall not be satisfied--so the oppressor "eateth his own flesh" (see on
[Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md) and [Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005).md).

with increase--is not satisfied with the gain that he makes.

[Ecclesiastes 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 5:11</span></span>

they . . . that eat them--the rich man's dependents ([Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 5:12</span></span>

Another argument against anxiety to gain riches. "Sleep . . . sweet"
answers to "quietness" ([Ecc 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006).md);
"not suffer . . . sleep," to "vexation of spirit." Fears for his wealth,
and an overloaded stomach without "laboring" (compare [Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005).md), will not suffer the rich
oppressor to sleep.

[Ecclesiastes 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 5:13</span></span>

Proofs of God's judgments even in this world ([Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031).md). The rich oppressor's wealth
provokes enemies, robbers, &c. Then, after having kept it for an
expected son, he loses it beforehand by misfortune ("by evil travail"),
and the son is born to be heir of poverty. [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md), [Ecc
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md) gives another aspect of the same
subject.

[Ecclesiastes 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 5:16</span></span>

Even supposing that he loses not his wealth before death, then at least
he must go stripped of it all ([Psa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017).md).

laboured for the wind-- ([Hos 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md);
[Co1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 5:17</span></span>

eateth--appropriately put for "liveth" in general, as connected with
[Ecc 5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md), [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md).

darkness--opposed to "light (joy) of countenance" ([Ecc
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md); [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015).md).

wrath--fretfulness, literally, "His sorrow is much, and his infirmity
(of body) and wrath."

[Ecclesiastes 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 5:18</span></span>

Returns to the sentiment ([Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022).md); translate: "Behold the good
which I have seen, and which is becoming" (in a man).

which God giveth--namely, both the good of his labor and his life.

his portion--legitimately. It is God's gift that makes it so when
regarded as such. Such a one will use, not abuse, earthly things ([Co1
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031).md). Opposed to the anxious life of
the covetous ([Ecc 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010.md), [Ecc
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017).md).

[Ecclesiastes 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 5:19</span></span>

As [Ecc 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md) refers to the "laboring"
man ([Ecc 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012).md), so [Ecc
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md) to the "rich" man, who gets
wealth not by "oppression" ([Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008).md),
but by "God's gift." He is distinguished also from the "rich" man ([Ecc
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002).md) in having received by God's gift
not only "wealth," but also "power to eat thereof," which that one has
not.

to take his portion--limits him to the lawful use of wealth, not keeping
back from God His portion while enjoying his own.

[Ecclesiastes 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 5:20</span></span>

He will not remember much, looking back with disappointment, as the
ungodly do ([Ecc 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011).md), on the days of
his life.

answereth . . . in the joy--God answers his prayers in giving him
"power" to enjoy his blessings. GESENIUS and Vulgate translate, "For God
(so) occupies him with joy," &c., that he thinks not much of the
shortness and sorrows of life. HOLDEN, "Though God gives not much (as to
real enjoyment), yet he remembers (with thankfulness) the days; for (he
knows) God exercises him by the joy," &c. (tries him by prosperity), so
Margin, but English Version is simplest.
