### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md)

CHAMBERS OF THE PRIESTS: MEASUREMENTS OF THE TEMPLE. (Eze. 42:1-20)

Before the length of an hundred cubits--that is before "the separate
place," which was that length ([Eze
41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013).md). He had before spoken of
chambers for the officiating priests on the north and south gates of the
inner court ([Eze 40:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044).md). He now
returns to take a more exact view of them.

[Ezekiel 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md)

shorter--that is, the building became narrower as it rose in height. The
chambers were many: so "in My Father's house are many mansions" ([Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002).md); and besides these there was
much "room" still left (compare [Luk
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#022).md). The chambers, though private,
were near the temple. Prayer in our chambers is to prepare us for public
devotions, and to help us in improving them.

[Ezekiel 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 42:16</span></span>

five hundred reeds--the Septuagint substitutes "cubits" for "reeds," to
escape the immense compass assigned to the whole, namely, a square of
five hundred rods or three thousand cubits (two feet each; [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005).md), in all a square of one and
one-seventh miles, that is, more than all ancient Jerusalem; also, there
is much space thus left unappropriated. FAIRBAIRN rightly supports
English Version, which agrees with the Hebrew. The vast extent is
another feature marking the ideal character of the temple. It symbolizes
the great enlargement of the kingdom of God, when Jehovah-Messiah shall
reign at Jerusalem, and from thence to the ends of the earth ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

[Ezekiel 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 42:20</span></span>

wall . . . separation between . . . sanctuary and . . . profane--No
longer shall the wall of partition be to separate the Jew and the
Gentile ([Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md), but to separate
the sacred from the profane. The lowness of it renders it unfit for the
purpose of defense (the object of the wall, [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012).md). But its square form (as in the
city, [Rev 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016).md) is the emblem of the
kingdom that cannot be shaken ([Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028).md), resting on prophets and
apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief corner-stone.

Everything was now ready for His reception. As the Shekinah glory was
the peculiar distinction of the old temple, so it was to be in the new
in a degree as much more transcendent as the proportions of the new
exceeded those of the old. The fact that the Shekinah glory was not in
the second temple proves that it cannot be that temple which is meant in
the prophecy.
