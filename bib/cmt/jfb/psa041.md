### [Psalms Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 41:1</span></span>

The Psalmist celebrates the blessedness of those who compassionate the
poor, conduct strongly contrasted with the spite of his enemies and
neglect of his friends in his calamity. He prays for God's mercy in view
of his ill desert, and, in confidence of relief, and that God will
vindicate his cause, he closes with a doxology. ([Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001).md)

God rewards kindness to the poor ([Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017).md). From [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md), [Psa
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011.md) it may be inferred that the
Psalmist describes his own conduct.

poor--in person, position, and possessions.

[Psalms 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 41:2</span></span>

shall be blessed--literally, "led aright," or "safely," prospered ([Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003).md).

upon the earth--or land of promise ([Psa
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013.md); [Psa
27:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003), &c..md).

[Psalms 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 41:3</span></span>

The figures of [Psa 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md) are drawn
from the acts of a kind nurse.

[Psalms 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 41:4</span></span>

I said--I asked the mercy I show.

heal my soul--(Compare [Psa 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002).md).
"Sin and suffering are united," is one of the great teachings of the
Psalms.

[Psalms 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 41:5</span></span>

A graphic picture of the conduct of a malignant enemy.

[Psalms 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 41:6</span></span>

to see me--as if to spy out my case.

he speaketh . . . itself--or, "he speaketh vanity as to his heart"--that
is, does not speak candidly, "he gathereth iniquity to him," collects
elements for mischief, and then divulges the gains of his hypocrisy.

[Psalms 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 41:7</span></span>

So of others, all act alike.

[Psalms 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 41:8</span></span>

An evil disease--literally, "a word of Belial," some slander.

cleaveth--literally, "poured on him."

that he lieth--who has now laid down, "he is utterly undone and our
victory is sure."

[Psalms 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 41:9</span></span>

mine . . . friend--literally, "the man of my peace."

eat . . . bread--who depended on me or was well treated by me.

hath lifted up heel--in scornful violence. As David and his fortunes
typified Christ and His (compare Introduction), so these words expressed
the treatment he received, and also that of his Son and Lord; hence,
though not distinctly prophetical, our Saviour ([Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018).md) applies them to Judas, "that
the Scripture may be fulfilled." This last phrase has a wide use in the
New Testament, and is not restricted to denote special prophecies.

[Psalms 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 41:10</span></span>

A lawful punishment of criminals is not revenge, nor inconsistent with
their final good (compare [Psa
40:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014).md).

[Psalms 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 41:11</span></span>

favourest--or tenderly lovest me ([Gen
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#019).md), evinced by relief from his
enemies, and, farther, God recognizes his innocence by upholding him.

[Psalms 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 41:12</span></span>

settest . . . before thy face--under thy watch and care, as God before
man's face ([Psa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).md) is an object of
trust and love.

[Psalms 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 41:13</span></span>

Blessed--praised, usually applied to God. The word usually applied to
men denotes happiness ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md); [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md). With this doxology the first
book closes.
