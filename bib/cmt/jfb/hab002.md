### [Habakkuk Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 2:1</span></span>

THE PROPHET, WAITING EARNESTLY FOR AN ANSWER TO HIS COMPLAINTS (FIRST
CHAPTER), RECEIVES A REVELATION, WHICH IS TO BE FULFILLED, NOT
IMMEDIATELY, YET IN DUE TIME, AND IS THEREFORE TO BE WAITED FOR IN
FAITH: THE CHALDEANS SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR CRUEL RAPACITY, NOR CAN
THEIR FALSE GODS AVERT THE JUDGMENT OF JEHOVAH, THE ONLY TRUE GOD. (Hab.
2:1-20)

stand upon . . . watch--that is, watch-post. The prophets often compare
themselves, awaiting the revelations of Jehovah with earnest patience,
to watchmen on an eminence watching with intent eye all that comes
within their view ([Isa 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#008.md), [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md); [Jer
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md); [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md); [Eze
33:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#002.md); compare [Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md); [Psa
85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008).md). The "watch-post" is the
withdrawal of the whole soul from earthly, and fixing it on heavenly,
things. The accumulation of synonyms, "stand open . . . watch . . . set
me upon . . . tower . . . watch to see" implies persevering fixity of
attention.

what he will say unto me--in answer to my complaints ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md). Literally, "in me," God
speaking, not to the prophet's outward ear, but inwardly. When we have
prayed to God, we must observe what answers God gives by His word, His
Spirit, and His providences.

what I shall answer when I am reproved--what answer I am to make to the
reproof which I anticipate from God on account of the liberty of my
expostulation with Him. MAURER translates, "What I am to answer in
respect to my complaint against Jehovah" ([Hab
1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md).

[Habakkuk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 2:2</span></span>

Write the vision--which I am about to reveal to thee.

make it plain-- ([Deu 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008).md). In large
legible characters.

upon tables--boxwood tables covered with wax, on which national affairs
were engraved with an iron pen, and then hung up in public, at the
prophets own houses, or at the temple, that those who passed might read
them. Compare [Luk 1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063.md), "writing
table," that is, tablet.

that he may run that readeth it--commonly explained, "so intelligible as
to be easily read by any one running past"; but then it would be, that
he that runneth may read it. The true sense is, "so legible that whoever
readeth it, may run to tell all whom he can the good news of the foe's
coming doom, and Judah's deliverance." Compare [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), "many shall run to and fro,"
namely, with the explanation of the prophecy, then unsealed; also, [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md), "let him that heareth (the good
news) say (to every one within his reach), Come." "Run" is equivalent to
announce the divine revelation ([Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021).md); as everyone who becomes
informed of a divine message is bound to run, that is, use all despatch
to make it known to others \[HENDERSON\]. GROTIUS, LUDOVICUS DE DIEU,
and MAURER interpret it: "Run" is not literal running, but "that he who
reads it may run through it," that is, read it at once without
difficulty.

[Habakkuk 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 2:3</span></span>

for--assigning the cause why it ought to be committed to writing:
because its fulfilment belongs to the future.

the vision is yet for an appointed time-- ([Dan
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014.md); [Dan
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#027.md), [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035).md). Though the time appointed by
God for the fulfilment be yet future, it should be enough for your faith
that God hath spoken it ([Lam 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026).md).

at the end it shall speak--MAURER translates, "it pants for the end."
But the antithesis between, "it shall speak," and "not be silent," makes
English Version the better rendering. So the Hebrew is translated in
[Pro 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#017.md). Literally, "breathe out
words," "break forth as a blast."

though it tarry, wait for it-- ([Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018).md).

[Habakkuk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 2:4</span></span>

his soul which is lifted up--the Chaldean's \[MAURER\]. The unbelieving
Jew's \[HENDERSON\].

is not upright in him--that is, is not accounted upright in God's sight;
in antithesis to "shall live." So [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md), which with inspired authority
applies the general sense to the particular case which Paul had in view,
"If any man draw back (one result of being 'lifted up' with overweening
arrogancy), my soul shall have no pleasure in him."

the just shall live by his faith--the Jewish nation, as opposed to the
unbelieving Chaldean (compare [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), &c.; [Hab
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md), &c.; [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md) \[MAURER\]. HENDERSON'S view is
that the believing Jew is meant, as opposed to the unbelieving Jew
(compare [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011).md). The believing Jew, though God's
promise tarry, will wait for it; the unbelieving "draws back," as [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md) expresses it. The sense, in
MAURER'S view, which accords better with the context ([Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005), &c..md). is: the Chaldean, though
for a time seeming to prosper, yet being lifted up with haughty unbelief
([Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md), [Hab
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016).md), is not upright; that is, has no
right stability of soul resting on God, to ensure permanence of
prosperity; hence, though for a time executing God's judgments, he at
last becomes "lifted up" so as to attribute to his own power what is the
work of God, and in this sense "draws back" ([Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038).md), becoming thereby a type of all
backsliders who thereby incur God's displeasure; as the believing Jew is
of all who wait for God's promises with patient faith, and so "live"
(stand accepted) before God. The Hebrew accents induce BENGEL to
translate, "he who is just by his faith shall live." Other manuscripts
read the accents as English Version, which agrees better with Hebrew
syntax.

[Habakkuk 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 2:5</span></span>

Yea also, because--additional reason why the Jews may look for God
punishing their Chaldean foe, namely, because . . . he is

a proud man--rather, this clause continues the reason for the Jews
expecting the punishment of the Chaldeans, "because he transgresseth by
wine (a besetting sin of Babylon, compare Dan. 5:1-31, and CURTIUS
\[5.1\]), being a proud man." Love of wine often begets a proud contempt
of divine things, as in Belshazzar's case, which was the immediate cause
of the fall of Babylon ([Dan 5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002.md),
[Dan 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md); compare [Pro
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md); [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md); [Pro
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#005).md).

enlargeth his desire as hell--the grave, or the unseen world, which is
"never full" ([Pro 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md); [Pro
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016.md); [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md). The Chaldeans under
Nebuchadnezzar were filled with an insatiable desire of conquest.
Another reason for their punishment.

[Habakkuk 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 2:6</span></span>

Shall not all these--the "nations" and "peoples" ([Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005).md) "heaped unto him" by the
Chaldean.

take up a parable--a derisive song. Habakkuk follows Isaiah ([Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004).md) and Micah ([Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004).md) in the phraseology.

against him--when dislodged from his former eminence.

Woe--The "derisive song" here begins, and continues to the end of the
chapter. It is a symmetrical whole, and consists of five stanzas, the
first three consisting of three verses each, the fourth of four verses,
and the last of two. Each stanza has its own subject, and all except the
last begin with "Woe"; and all have a closing verse introduced with
"for," "because," or "but."

how long?--how long destined to retain his ill-gotten gains? But for a
short time, as his fall now proves \[MAURER\]. "Covetousness is the
greatest bane to men. For they who invade others' goods, often lose even
their own" \[MENANDER\]. CALVIN makes "how long?" to be the cry of those
groaning under the Chaldean oppression while it still lasted: How long
shall such oppression be permitted to continue? But it is plainly part
of the derisive song, after the Chaldean tyranny had passed away.

ladeth himself with thick clay--namely, gold and silver dug out of the
"clay," of which they are a part. The covetous man in heaping them
together is only lading himself with a clay burden, as he dares not
enjoy them, and is always anxious about them. LEE and FULLER translate
the Hebrew as a reduplicated single noun, and not two words, "an
accumulation of pledges" ([Deu
24:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010).md). The Chaldean is compared to
a harsh usurer, and his ill-gotten treasures to heaps of pledges in the
hands of a usurer.

[Habakkuk 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 2:7</span></span>

suddenly--the answer to the question, "How long?" ([Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md).

bite--often used of usury; so favoring LEE'S rendering ([Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md). As the Chaldean, like a usurer,
oppressed others, so other nations shall, like usurers, take pledges of,
that is, spoil, him.

[Habakkuk 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 2:8</span></span>

the remnant of the people--Those remaining of the peoples spoiled by
thee, though but a remnant, will suffice to inflict vengeance on thee.

the violence of the land . . . city--that is, on account of thy violent
oppression of the lands and cities of the earth \[GROTIUS\] (compare
[Hab 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), [Hab
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012).md). The same phrase occurs in [Hab
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md), where the "land" and "city" are
Judea and Jerusalem.

[Habakkuk 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 2:9</span></span>

coveteth an evil covetousness--that is, a covetousness so surpassingly
evil as to be fatal to himself.

to his house--greedily seizing enormous wealth, not merely for himself,
but for his family, to which it is destined to be fatal. The very same
"evil covetousness" that was the cause of Jehoiakim's being given up to
the Chaldean oppressor ([Jer 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md)
shall be the cause of the Chaldean's own destruction.

set his nest on high-- ([Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md);
[Jer 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md); [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004).md). The image is from an eagle ([Job
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027).md). The royal citadel is meant.
The Chaldean built high towers, like the Babel founders, to "be
delivered from the power of evil" ([Gen
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004).md).

[Habakkuk 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 2:10</span></span>

Thou hast consulted shame . . . by cutting off many--MAURER, more
literally, "Thou hast consulted shame . . . to destroy many," that is,
in consulting (determining) to cut off many, thou hast consulted shame
to thy house.

sinned against thy soul--that is, against thyself; thou art the guilty
cause of thine own ruin ([Pro 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md);
[Pro 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002).md). They who wrong their
neighbors, do much greater wrong to their own souls.

[Habakkuk 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 2:11</span></span>

stone . . . cry out--personification. The very stones of thy palace
built by rapine shall testify against thee ([Luk
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040).md).

the beam out of the timber--the crossbeam or main rafter connecting the
timbers in the walls.

shall answer it--namely, the stone. The stone shall begin and the
crossbeam continue the cry against thy rapine.

[Habakkuk 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 2:12</span></span>

buildeth a town with blood--namely, Babylon rebuilt and enlarged by
blood-bought spoils (compare [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030).md).

[Habakkuk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 2:13</span></span>

is it not of the Lord of hosts--JEHOVAH, who has at His command all the
hosts of heaven and earth, is the righteous author of Babylon's
destruction. "Shall not God have His turn, when cruel rapacious men have
triumphed so long, though He seem now to be still?" \[CALVIN\].

people . . . labour in the . . . fire . . . weary themselves for . . .
vanity--The Chaldeans labor at what is to be food for the fire, namely,
their city and fortresses which shall be burnt. [Jer
51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058.md) adopts the same phraseology to
express the vanity of the Chaldean's labor on Babylon, as doomed to the
flames.

[Habakkuk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 2:14</span></span>

Adapted from [Isa 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md). Here the sense
is, "The Jews shall be restored and the temple rebuilt, so that God's
glory in saving His people, and punishing their Chaldean foe, shall be
manifested throughout the world," of which the Babylonian empire formed
the greatest part; a type of the ultimate full manifestation of His
glory in the final salvation of Israel and His Church, and the
destruction of all their foes.

waters cover the sea--namely, the bottom of the sea; the sea-bed.

[Habakkuk 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 2:15</span></span>

giveth . . . neighbour drink . . . puttest . . . bottle to
him--literally, "skin," as the Easterns use "bottles" of skin for wine.
MAURER, from a different Hebrew root, translates, "that pourest in thy
wrath." English Version keeps up the metaphor better. It is not enough
for thee to be "drunken" thyself, unless thou canst lead others into the
same state. The thing meant is, that the Chaldean king, with his
insatiable desires (a kind of intoxication), allured neighboring states
into the same mad thirst for war to obtain booty, and then at last
exposed them to loss and shame (compare [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); [Oba
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016).md). An appropriate image of
Babylon, which at last fell during a drunken revel (Dan. 5:1-31).

that thou mayest look on their nakedness!--with light, like Ham of old
([Gen 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022).md).

[Habakkuk 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 2:16</span></span>

art filled--now that thou art fallen. "Thou art filled" indeed (though
so insatiable), but it is "with shame."

shame for glory--instead of thy former glory ([Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007).md).

drink thou also--The cup of sorrow is now in thy turn to pass to thee
([Jer 25:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md); [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021).md).

thy foreskin--expressing in Hebrew feeling the most utter contempt. So
of Goliath ([Sa1 17:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#036).md). It is not
merely thy "nakedness," as in [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md), that shall be "uncovered," but
the foreskin, the badge of thy being an uncircumcised alien from God.
The same shall be done to thee, as thou didst to others, and worse.

cup . . . shall be turned unto thee--literally, "shall turn itself,"
namely, from the nations whom thou hast made to drink it. "Thou shalt
drink it all, so that it may be turned as being drained" \[GROTIUS\].

shameful spewing--that is, vomiting; namely, that of the king of
Babylon, compelled to disgorge the spoil he had swallowed. It expresses
also the ignominious state of Babylon in its calamity ([Jer
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027).md). "Be drunken, spew, and fall."
Less appropriately it is explained of the foe spewing in the face of the
Babylonian king.

[Habakkuk 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 2:17</span></span>

the violence of Lebanon--thy "violence" against "Lebanon," that is,
Jerusalem ([Isa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md); [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md); [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md), [Eze
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012.md); for Lebanon's cedars were used
in building the temple and houses of Jerusalem; and its beauty made it a
fit type of the metropolis), shall fall on thine own head.

cover--that is, completely overwhelm.

the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid--MAURER explains, "the
spoiling inflicted on the beasts of Lebanon (that is, on the people of
Jerusalem, of which city 'Lebanon' is the type), which made them afraid
(shall cover thee)." But it seems inappropriate to compare the elect
people to "beasts." I therefore prefer explaining, "the spoiling of
beasts," that is, such as is inflicted on beasts caught in a net, and
"which makes them afraid (shall cover thee)." Thus the Babylonians are
compared to wild beasts terrified at being caught suddenly in a net. In
cruel rapacity they resembled wild beasts. The ancients read, "the
spoiling of wild beasts shall make THEE afraid." Or else explain, "the
spoiling of beasts (the Medes and Persians) which (inflicted by thee)
made them afraid (shall in turn cover thyself--revert on thyself from
them)." This accords better with the parallel clause, "the violence of
Lebanon," that is, inflicted by thee on Lebanon. As thou didst hunt men
as wild beasts, so shalt thou be hunted thyself as a wild beast, which
thou resemblest in cruelty.

because of men's blood--shed by thee; repeated from [Hab
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md). But here the "land" and "city"
are used of Judea and Jerusalem: not of the earth and cities generally,
as in [Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md).

the violence of the land, &c.--that is, inflicted on the land by thee.

[Habakkuk 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hab 2:18</span></span>

The powerlessness of the idols to save Babylon from its doom is a
fitting introduction to the last stanza ([Hab
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019).md), which, as the former four,
begins with "Woe."

teacher of lies--its priests and prophets uttering lying oracles, as if
from it.

make dumb idols--Though men can "make" idols, they cannot make them
speak.

[Habakkuk 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hab 2:19</span></span>

Awake--Arise to my help.

it shall teach!--rather, An exclamation of the prophet, implying an
ironical question to which a negative answer must be given. What! "It
teach?" Certainly not \[MAURER\]. Or, "It (the idol itself) shall (that
is, ought to) teach you that it is deaf, and therefore no God"
\[CALVIN\]. Compare "they are their own witnesses" ([Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).md).

Behold--The Hebrew is nominative, "There it is" \[HENDERSON\].

it is laid over with gold . . . no breath . . . in the midst--Outside it
has some splendor, within none.

[Habakkuk 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hab 2:20</span></span>

But the Lord--JEHOVAH; in striking contrast with the idols.

in his holy temple--"His place" ([Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md); heaven ([Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md); [Jon
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007.md); [Mic
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002).md). The temple at Jerusalem is a
type of it, and there God is to be worshipped. He does not lie hid under
gold and silver, as the idols of Babylon, but reigns in heaven and fills
heaven, and thence succors His people.

keep silence--in token of reverent submission and subjection to His
judgments ([Job 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004.md); [Psa
76:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md); [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md); [Zac
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013).md).

This sublime ode begins with an exordium ([Hab
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001).md), then follows the main subject,
then the peroration ([Hab 3:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016).md), a
summary of the practical truth, which the whole is designed to teach.
([Deu 33:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); [Psa
77:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013) are parallel odes.md). This was
probably designed by the Spirit to be a fit formula of prayer for the
people, first in their Babylonian exile, and now in their dispersion,
especially towards the close of it, just before the great Deliverer is
to interpose for them. It was used in public worship, as the musical
term, "Selah!" ([Hab 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md), [Hab
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md), [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md), implies.
