### [1 Corinthians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 1:1</span></span>

THE INSCRIPTION; THANKSGIVING FOR THE SPIRITUAL STATE OF THE CORINTHIAN
CHURCH; REPROOF OF PARTY DIVISIONS: HIS OWN METHOD OF PREACHING ONLY
CHRIST. (1Co. 1:1-31)

called to be--Found in some, not in others, of the oldest manuscripts
Possibly inserted from [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); but
as likely to be genuine. Translate, literally, "a called apostle"
\[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

through the will of God--not because of my own merit. Thus Paul's call
as "an apostle by the will of God," while constituting the ground of the
authority he claims in the Corinthian Church (compare [Gal
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001).md), is a reason for humility on his
own part ([Co1 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008.md), [Co1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010).md) \[BENGEL\]. In assuming the
ministerial office a man should see he does so not of his own impulse,
but by the will of God ([Jer 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021).md);
Paul if left to his own will would never have been an apostle ([Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016).md).

Sosthenes--See my Introduction. Associated by Paul with himself in the
inscription, either in modesty, Sosthenes being his inferior
\[CHRYSOSTOM\], or in order that the name of a "brother" of note in
Corinth ([Act 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017).md) might give weight
to his Epistle and might show, in opposition to his detractors that he
was supported by leading brethren. Gallio had driven the Jews who
accused Paul from the judgment-seat. The Greek mob, who disliked Jews,
took the opportunity then of beating Sosthenes the ruler of the Jewish
synagogue, while Gallio looked on and refused to interfere, being
secretly pleased that the mob should second his own contempt for the
Jews. Paul probably at this time had showed sympathy for an adversary in
distress, which issued in the conversion of the latter. So Crispus also,
the previous chief ruler of the synagogue had been converted. Saul the
persecutor turned into Paul the apostle, and Sosthenes the leader in
persecution against that apostle, were two trophies of divine grace
that, side by side, would appeal with double power to the Church at
Corinth \[BIRKS\].

[1 Corinthians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 1:2</span></span>

the church of God--He calls it so notwithstanding its many blots.
Fanatics and sectaries vainly think to anticipate the final sifting of
the wheat and tares ([Mat 13:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#027).md).
It is a dangerous temptation to think there is no church where there is
not apparent perfect purity. He who thinks so, must at last separate
from all others and think himself the only holy man in the world, or
establish a peculiar sect with a few hypocrites. It was enough for Paul
in recognizing the Corinthians as a church, that he saw among them
evangelical doctrine, baptism, and the Lord's Supper" \[CALVIN\]. It was
the Church of God, not of this or of that favorite leader
\[CHRYSOSTOM\].

at Corinth--a church at dissolute Corinth--what a paradox of grace!

sanctified--consecrated, or set apart as holy to God in (by union with)
Christ Jesus. In the Greek there are no words "to them that are";
translate simply, "men sanctified."

called to be saints--rather, "called saints"; saints by calling: applied
by Paul to all professing members of the Church. As "sanctified in
Christ" implies the fountain sources of holiness, the believer's
original sanctification in Christ ([Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md); [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md) in the purposes of God's grace,
so "called saints" refers to their actual call ([Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030).md), and the end of that call that
they should be holy ([Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md).

with all that in every place call upon . . . Christ--The Epistle is
intended for these also, as well as for the Corinthians. The true
CATHOLIC CHURCH (a term first used by IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the
SmyrÃ&brvbr;ans, 8\]): not consisting of those who call themselves from
Paul, Cephas, or any other eminent leader ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).md), but of all, wherever they be,
who call on Jesus as their Saviour in sincerity (compare [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022).md). Still a general unity of
discipline and doctrine in the several churches is implied in [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md); [Co1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md); 11-16; 14-33, 36. The worship
due to God is here attributed to Jesus (compare [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md); [Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md); [Act
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014).md).

both theirs and ours--"in every place which is their home . . . and our
home also"; this is added to include the Christians throughout Achaia,
not residing in Corinth, the capital ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001).md). Paul feels the home of his
converts to be also his own. Compare a similar phrase in [Rom
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md) \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\]. "Ours"
refers to Paul and Sosthenes, and the Corinthians' home \[ALFORD\]. BEZA
better explains, "Both their Lord and our Lord." All believers have one
and the same Lord ([Co1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md); [Eph
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005).md); a virtual reproof of the
divisions of the Corinthians, as if Christ were divided ([Co1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 1:3</span></span>

peace--peculiarly needed in the Corinthian church, on account of its
dissensions. On this verse see on [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).

[1 Corinthians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 1:4</span></span>

He puts the causes for praise and hope among them in the foreground, not
to discourage them by the succeeding reproof, and in order to appeal to
their better selves.

my God-- ([Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003).md).

always--(Compare [Phi 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004).md).

the grace . . . given you--(Compare [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007).md).

by . . . Christ--literally, "IN Jesus Christ" given you as members in
Christ.

[1 Corinthians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 1:5</span></span>

utterance--ALFORD from MENOCHIUS translates, "doctrine." Ye are rich in
preachers or the preaching of the word, and rich in knowledge or
apprehension of it: literally "(the) word (preached)." English Version
(as in [Co2 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007).md) is better: for Paul,
purposing presently to dwell on the abuse of the two gifts on which the
Corinthians most prided themselves, utterance (speech) and knowledge
([Co1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md); [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md); [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019); 1Co. 13:1-14:40.md), previously
gains their goodwill by congratulating them on having those gifts.

[1 Corinthians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 1:6</span></span>

According as the testimony of (of, and concerning) Christ (who is both
the object and author of this testimony \[BENGEL\]; [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md); [Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008).md) was confirmed among \[ALFORD\]
you; that is, by God, through my preaching and through the miracles
accompanying it ([Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md); [Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020.md); [Co2
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021.md); [Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md), [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md); [Eph
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007.md); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004).md). God confirmed (compare [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003).md), or gave effect to the Gospel
among (or better as English Version, "in") the Corinthians by their
accepting it and setting their seal to its truth, through the inward
power of His Spirit, and the outward gifts and miracles accompanying it
\[CALVIN\].

[1 Corinthians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 1:7</span></span>

ye come behind--are inferior to other Christians elsewhere \[GROTIUS\].

in no gift--not that all had all gifts, but different persons among them
had different gifts ([Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004), &c..md).

waiting for . . . coming of . . . Christ--The crowning proof of their
"coming behind in no gift." Faith, hope, and love, are all exercised
herein (compare [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).md). "Leaving to others their
MEMENTO MORI (remember death), do thou earnestly cherish this joyous
expectation of the Lord's coming" \[BENGEL\]. The Greek verb implies,
"to expect constantly, not only for a certain time, but even to the end
till the expected event happens" ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), \[TITTMANN, Greek Synonyms of
the New Testament\]).

[1 Corinthians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 1:8</span></span>

Who--God, [Co1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md) (not Jesus Christ,
[Co1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md), in which case it would be
"in His day").

unto the end--namely, "the coming of Christ."

blameless in the day of . . . Christ-- ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023).md). After that day there is no
danger ([Eph 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md). Now is our day to work, and the
day of our enemies to try us: then will be the day of Christ, and of His
glory in the saints \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 1:9</span></span>

faithful--to His promises ([Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md);
[Th1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024).md).

called--according to His purpose ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md).

unto . . . fellowship of . . . Jesus--to be fellow heirs with Christ
([Rom 8:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).md), like Him sons of God
and heirs of glory ([Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md); [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md); [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md); [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003).md). CHRYSOSTOM remarks that the name
of Christ is oftener mentioned in this than in any other Epistle, the
apostle designing thereby to draw them away from their party admiration
of particular teachers to Christ alone.

[1 Corinthians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 1:10</span></span>

Now--Ye already have knowledge, utterance, and hope, maintain also love.

brethren--The very title is an argument for love.

by . . . Christ--whom Paul wishes to be all in all to the Corinthians,
and therefore names Him so often in this chapter.

speak . . . same thing--not speaking different things as ye do ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).md), in a spirit of variance.

divisions--literally, "splits," "breaches."

but--"but rather."

perfectly joined together--the opposite word to "divisions." It is
applied to healing a wound, or making whole a rent.

mind . . . judgment--the view taken by the understanding, and the
practical decision arrived at \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\], as to what is to
be done. The mind, within, refers to things to be believed: the judgment
is displayed outwardly in things to be done \[BENGEL\].
Disposition--opinion \[ALFORD\].

[1 Corinthians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 1:11</span></span>

([Co1 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018).md).

by them . . . of . . . house of Chloe--They seem to have been alike in
the confidence of Paul and of the Corinthians. The Corinthians "wrote"
to the apostle ([Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md), consulting
him concerning certain points; marriage, the eating of things offered to
idols, the decorum to be observed by women in religious assemblies. But
they said not a syllable about the enormities and disorders that had
crept in among them. That information reached Paul by other quarters.
Hence his language about those evils is, "It hath been declared unto
me," &c.; "It is reported commonly" ([Co1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001).md). All this he says before he
refers to their letter, which shows that the latter did not give him any
intimation of those evils. An undesigned proof of genuineness \[PALEY,
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. Observe his prudence: He names the family,
to let it be seen that he made his allegation not without authority: he
does not name the individuals, not to excite odium against them. He
tacitly implies that the information ought rather to have come to him
directly from their presbyters, as they had consulted him about matters
of less moment.

contentions--not so severe a word as "divisions," literally, "schisms"
([Co1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010), Margin.md).

[1 Corinthians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 1:12</span></span>

this I say--this is what I mean in saying "contentions" ([Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011).md).

every one of you saith--Ye say severally, "glorying in men" ([Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031.md); [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021).md), one, I am of Paul; another,
I am of Apollos, &c. Not that they formed definite parties, but they
individually betrayed the spirit of party in contentions under the name
of different favorite teachers. Paul will not allow himself to be
flattered even by those who made his name their party cry, so as to
connive at the dishonor thereby done to Christ. These probably were
converted under his ministry. Those alleging the name of Apollos, Paul's
successor at Corinth ([Act 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024.md),
&c.), were persons attracted by his rhetorical style (probably acquired
in Alexandria, [Co1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006).md), as
contrasted with the "weak bodily presence" and "contemptible speech" of
the apostle. Apollos, doubtless, did not willingly foster this spirit of
undue preference ([Co1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md), [Co1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008).md); nay, to discourage it, he would
not repeat his visit just then ([Co1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012).md).

I of Cephas--probably Judaizers, who sheltered themselves under the name
of Peter, the apostle of the circumcision ("Cephas" is the Hebrew,
"Peter" the Greek name; [Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md);
[Gal 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011), &c..md): the subjects handled
in the seventh through ninth chapters were probably suggested as matters
of doubt by them. The church there began from the Jewish synagogue,
Crispus the chief ruler, and Sosthenes his successor (probably), being
converts. Hence some Jewish leaven, though not so much as elsewhere, is
traceable ([Co2 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022).md). Petrism
afterwards sprang up much more rankly at Rome. If it be wrong to boast
"I am of Peter," how much more so to boast I am of the Pope!"
\[BENGEL\].

I of Christ--A fair pretext used to slight the ministry of Paul and
their other teachers ([Co1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md); [Co2
10:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 1:13</span></span>

Is Christ divided?--into various parts (one under one leader, another
under another) \[ALFORD\]. The unity of His body is not to be cut in
pieces, as if all did not belong to Him, the One Head.

was Paul crucified for you?--In the Greek the interrogation implies that
a strong negative answer is expected: "Was it Paul (surely you will not
say so) that was crucified for you?" In the former question the majesty
of "CHRIST" (the Anointed One of God) implies the impossibility of His
being "divided." in the latter, Paul's insignificance implies the
impossibility of his being the head of redemption, "crucified for" them,
and giving his name to the redeemed. This, which is true of Paul the
founder of the Church of Corinth, holds equally good of Cephas and
Apollos, who had not such a claim as Paul in the Corinthian Church.

crucified . . . baptized--The cross claims us for Christ, as redeemed by
Him; baptism, as dedicated to Him.

in the name--rather, "into the name" ([Gal
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027).md), implying the incorporation
involved in the idea of baptism.

[1 Corinthians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 1:14</span></span>

I thank God's providence now, who so ordered it that I baptized none of
you but Crispus (the former ruler of the synagogue, [Act
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008).md) and Gaius (written by the Romans
Caius, the host of Paul at Corinth, and of the church, [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md); a person therefore in good
circumstances). Baptizing was the office of the deacons ([Act
10:48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#048).md) rather than of the apostles,
whose office was that of establishing and superintending generally the
churches. The deacons had a better opportunity of giving the necessary
course of instruction preparatory to baptism. Crispus and Gaius were
probably among the first converts, and hence were baptized by Paul
himself, who founded the church.

[1 Corinthians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 1:15</span></span>

Lest--not that Paul had this reason at the time, but God so arranged it
that none might say \[ALFORD\].

[1 Corinthians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 1:16</span></span>

household of Stephanas--"The first-fruits of Achaia," that is, among the
first converted there ([Co1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md),
[Co1 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017).md). It is likely that such
"households" included infants ([Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033).md). The history of the Church
favors this view, as infant baptism was the usage from the earliest
ages.

[1 Corinthians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 1:17</span></span>

Paul says this not to depreciate baptism; for he exalts it most highly
([Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003).md). He baptized some first
converts; and would have baptized more, but that his and the apostles'
peculiar work was to preach the Gospel, to found by their autoptic
testimony particular churches, and then to superintend the churches in
general.

sent me--literally, "as an apostle."

not to baptize--even in Christ's name, much less in my own.

not with wisdom of words--or speech; philosophical reasoning set off
with oratorical language and secular learning, which the Corinthians set
so undue a value upon ([Co1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005.md); [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004).md) in Apollos, and the want of which
in Paul they were dissatisfied with ([Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010).md).

cross of Christ--the sum and substance of the Gospel ([Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md); [Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002).md), Christ crucified.

be made of none effect--literally, "be made void" ([Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014).md); namely, by men thinking more of
the human reasonings and eloquence in which the Gospel was set forth,
than of the Gospel itself of Christ crucified, the sinner's only remedy,
and God's highest exhibition of love.

[1 Corinthians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 1:18</span></span>

preaching, &c.--literally, "the word," or speech as to the cross; in
contrast to the "wisdom of words" (so called), [Co1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md).

them that perish--rather, "them that are perishing," namely, by
preferring human "wisdom of words" to the doctrine of the "cross of
Christ." It is not the final state that is referred to; but, "them that
are in the way of perishing." So also in [Co2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md).

us which are saved--In the Greek the collocation is more modest, "to
them that are being saved (that are in the way of salvation) as," that
is, to which class we belong.

power of God--which includes in it that it is the wisdom of God" ([Co1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024).md). God's powerful instrument of
salvation; the highest exhibition of God's power ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md). What seems to the world
"weakness" in God's plan of salvation ([Co1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025).md), and in its mode of delivery by
His apostle ([Co1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003).md) is really His
mighty "power." What seems "foolishness" because wanting man's "wisdom
of words" ([Co1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017).md), is really the
highest "wisdom of God" ([Co1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 1:19</span></span>

I will destroy--slightly altered from the Septuagint, [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md). The Hebrew is, "The wisdom of
the wise shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall
be hid." Paul by inspiration gives the sense of the Spirit, by making
GOD the cause of their wisdom perishing, &c., "I will destroy," &c.

understanding of the prudent--literally, "of the understanding ones."

[1 Corinthians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 1:20</span></span>

Where--nowhere; for God "brings them to naught" ([Co1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019).md).

the wise--generally.

the scribe--Jewish \[ALFORD\].

the disputer--Greek \[ALFORD\]. Compare the Jew and Greek of this world
contrasted with the godly wise, [Co1
1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md). VITRINGA thinks the reference
is to the Jewish discourses in the synagogue, daraschoth, from a Hebrew
root "to dispute." Compare "questions," [Act
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003.md); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md). If so, "wise" refers to Greek
wisdom (compare [Co1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022).md). Paul
applies [Isa 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md) here in a higher
sense; there the primary reference was to temporal deliverance, here to
external; [Co1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md), which is in
threefold opposition to [Co1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018.md)
there, sanctions this higher application; the Lord in the threefold
character being the sole ground of glorying to His people.

of this world . . . of this world--rather, "dispensation (or age) . . .
world"; the Greek words are distinct. The former is here this age or
worldly order of things in a moral point of view, as opposed to the
Christian dispensation or order of things. The latter is the world
viewed externally and cosmically.

made foolish--shown the world's philosophy to be folly, because it lacks
faith in Christ crucified \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Has treated it as folly, and
not used its help in converting and saving men ([Co1
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md) \[ESTIUS\].

[1 Corinthians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 1:21</span></span>

after that--rather, "whereas."

in the wisdom of God--in the wise arrangement of God.

world by wisdom--rather, "by its wisdom," or "its philosophy" ([Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md); [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md).

knew not God--whatever other knowledge it attained ([Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md), [Act
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027).md). The deistic theory that man
can by the light of nature discover his duty to God, is disproved by the
fact that man has never discovered it without revelation. All the stars
and moon cannot make it day; that is the prerogative of the sun. Nor can
nature's highest gifts make the moral day arise; that is the office of
Christ. Even the Jew missed this knowledge, in so far as he followed
after mere carnal world wisdom.

it pleased God--Paul refers to Jesus' words ([Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021).md).

by the foolishness of preaching--by that preaching which the world
(unbelieving Jews and Gentiles alike) deem foolishness.

save them that believe-- ([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 1:22</span></span>

For--literally, "Since," seeing that. This verse illustrates how the
"preaching" of Christ crucified came to be deemed "foolishness" ([Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021).md).

a sign--The oldest manuscripts read "signs." The singular was a later
correction from [Mat 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md); [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md); [Joh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md). The signs the Jews craved for
were not mere miracles, but direct tokens from heaven that Jesus was
Messiah ([Luk 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016).md).

Greeks seek . . . wisdom--namely, a philosophic demonstration of
Christianity. Whereas Christ, instead of demonstrative proof, demands
faith on the ground of His word, and of a reasonable amount of evidence
that the alleged revelation is His word. Christianity begins not with
solving intellectual difficulties, but with satisfying the heart that
longs for forgiveness. Hence not the refined Greeks, but the theocratic
Jews were the chosen organ for propagating revelation. Again,
intellectual Athens ([Act 17:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md),
&c.) received the Gospel less readily than commercial Corinth.

[1 Corinthians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 1:23</span></span>

we--Paul and Apollos.

Christ crucified--The Greek expresses not the mere fact of His
crucifixion, but the permanent character acquired by the transaction,
whereby He is now a Saviour ([Gal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001).md)
crucified was the stone on which the Jews stumbled ([Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044).md). The opposition of Jew and
Gentile alike shows that a religion so seemingly contemptible in its
origin could not have succeeded if it had not been divine.

unto the Greeks--the oldest manuscripts read "unto the Gentiles."

[1 Corinthians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 1:24</span></span>

called--(compare [Co1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md). The same
class as the "us which are (being) saved" ([Co1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018).md); the elect, who have obeyed the
call; called effectually ([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md),
[Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030).md).

Christ--"Crucified" is not here added, because when the offense of the
cross is overcome, "Christ" is received in all His relations, not only
in His cross, but in His life and His future kingdom.

power--so meeting all the reasonable requirements of the Jews who sought
"a sign." The cross (the death of a slave), which to the Jews (looking
for a temporal Messiah) was a "stumbling-block," is really "the power of
God" to the salvation of all who believe.

wisdom of God--so really exhibiting, and in the highest degree (if they
would but see it), that which the Greeks sought after--wisdom ([Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 1:25</span></span>

foolishness of God--that is, God's plan of salvation which men deem
"foolishness."

weakness of God--Christ "crucified through weakness" ([Co2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004.md), the great stumbling-block of the
Jews), yet "living by the power of God." So He perfects strength out of
the weakness of His servants ([Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md); [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 1:26</span></span>

ye see--rather, from the prominence of the verb in the Greek, "see" or
"consider" (imperative) \[ALFORD from Vulgate and IRENÃ†US\].

your calling . . . are called--Instead of the words in italics, supplied
by English Version, supply, "were your callers." What Paul is dwelling
on (compare [Co1 1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md) is the
weakness of the instrumentality which the Lord employed to convert the
world \[HINDS and WHATELY; so ANSELM\]. However, English Version accords
well with [Co1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024.md). "The whole
history of the expansion of the Church is a progressive victory of the
ignorant over the learned, the lowly over the lofty, until the emperor
himself laid down his crown before the cross of Christ" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

wise . . . after the flesh--the wisdom of this world acquired by human
study without the Spirit. (Contrast [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 1:27</span></span>

the foolish things--a general phrase for all persons and things foolish.
Even things (and those, too, foolish things) are chosen by God to
confound persons, (and those too persons who are wise). This seems to me
the force of the change from neuter to masculine.

to confound--The Greek is stronger, "that He might confound (or put to
shame)." God confounds the wise by effecting through His instruments,
without human wisdom, that the worldly wise, with it, cannot effect,
namely, to bring men to salvation.

chosen . . . chosen--The repetition indicates the gracious
deliberateness of God's purpose ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md).

[1 Corinthians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 1:28</span></span>

yea, and things which are not--Yea is not in the Greek. Also some of the
oldest manuscripts omit "and." Thus the clause, "things which are not"
(are regarded as naught), is in apposition with "foolish . . . weak . .
. base (that is, lowborn) and despised things." God has chosen all four,
though regarded as things that are not, to bring to naught things that
are.

[1 Corinthians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 1:29</span></span>

no flesh . . . glory--For they who try to glory (boast) because of human
greatness and wisdom, are "confounded" or put to shame ([Co1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md). Flesh, like "the flower of the
field," is beautiful, but frail ([Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006).md).

in his presence--We are to glory not before Him, but in Him \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 1:30</span></span>

But . . . ye--in contrast to them that "glory" in worldly wisdom and
greatness.

of him are--not of yourselves ([Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md), but of Him ([Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036).md). From Him ye are (that is, have
spiritual life, who once were spiritually among the "things which are
not." [Co1 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md).

in Christ--by living union with Him. Not "in the flesh" ([Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md), [Co1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029).md).

of God--from God; emanating from Him and sent by Him.

is made unto us--has been made to us, to our eternal gain.

wisdom--unattainable by the worldly mode of seeking it ([Co1
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019.md); contrast [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md); Pro. 8:1-36; [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md). By it we become "wise unto
salvation," owing to His wisdom in originating and executing the plan,
whereas once we were "fools."

righteousness--the ground of our justification ([Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md); whereas once we were "weak"
([Rom 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006).md). [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md).

sanctification--by His Spirit; whereas formerly we were "base."
Hereafter our righteousness and sanctification alike shall be both
perfect and inherent. Now the righteousness wherewith we are justified
is perfect, but not inherent; that wherewith we are sanctified is
inherent, but not perfect \[HOOKER\]. Now sanctification is perfect in
principle, but not in attainment. These two are joined in the Greek as
forming essentially but one thing, as distinguished from the "wisdom" in
devising and executing the plan for us ("abounded toward us in all
wisdom," [Eph 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).md), and "redemption,"
the final completion of the scheme in the deliverance of the body (the
position of "redemption" last shows that this limited sense is the one
intended here). [Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md); [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md).

redemption--whereas once we were "despised."

[1 Corinthians 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 1:31</span></span>

glory in . . . Lord-- ([Jer 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023).md)
--in opposition to "flesh glorying in His presence" ([Co1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029).md). In contrast to morbid slavish
self-abasement, Paul joins with humility the elevating consciousness of
our true dignity in Christ. He who glories is to glory in the Lord, not
in the flesh, nor in the world.
