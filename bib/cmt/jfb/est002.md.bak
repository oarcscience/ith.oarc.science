ESTHER CHOSEN TO BE QUEEN. (Est. 2:1-20)

After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased--On
recovering from the violent excitement of his revelry and rage, the king
was pierced with poignant regret for the unmerited treatment he had
given to his beautiful and dignified queen. But, according to the law,
which made the word of a Persian king irrevocable, she could not be
restored. His counsellors, for their own sake, were solicitous to remove
his disquietude, and hastened to recommend the adoption of all suitable
means for gratifying their royal master with another consort of equal or
superior attractions to those of his divorced queen. In the despotic
countries of the East the custom obtains that when an order is sent to a
family for a young damsel to repair to the royal palace, the parents,
however unwilling, dare not refuse the honor for their daughter; and
although they know that when she is once in the royal harem, they will
never see her again, they are obliged to yield a silent and passive
compliance. On the occasion referred to, a general search was commanded
to be made for the greatest beauties throughout the empire, in the hope
that, from their ranks, the disconsolate monarch might select one for
the honor of succeeding to the royal honors of Vashti. The damsels, on
arrival at the palace, were placed under the custody of "Hege, the
king's chamberlain, keeper of the women," that is, the chief eunuch,
usually a repulsive old man, on whom the court ladies are very
dependent, and whose favor they are always desirous to secure.

[Esther 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md)

Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew--Mordecai held some
office about the court. But his "sitting at the king's gate" ([Est
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021).md) does not necessarily imply that
he was in the humble condition of a porter; for, according to an
institute of Cyrus, all state officers were required to wait in the
outer courts till they were summoned into the presence chamber. He
might, therefore, have been a person of some official dignity. This man
had an orphan cousin, born during the exile, under his care, who being
distinguished by great personal beauty, was one of the young damsels
taken into the royal harem on this occasion. She had the good fortune at
once to gain the good will of the chief eunuch \[[Est
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009.md)\]. Her sweet and amiable
appearance made her a favorite with all who looked upon her ([Est
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015), last clause.md). Her Hebrew name
([Est 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007).md) was Hadassah, that is,
"myrtle," which, on her introduction into the royal harem, was changed
to Esther, that is, the star Venus, indicating beauty and good fortune
\[GESENIUS\].

[Esther 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 2:11</span></span>

Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house--The
harem is an inviolable sanctuary, and what is transacted within its
walls is as much a secret to those without as if they were thousands of
miles away. But hints were given him through the eunuchs.

[Esther 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 2:12</span></span>

Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus--A whole
year was spent in preparation for the intended honor. Considering that
this took place in a palace, the long period prescribed, together with
the profusion of costly and fragrant cosmetics employed, was probably
required by state etiquette.

[Esther 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">est 2:17</span></span>

the king loved Esther above all the women--The choice fell on Esther,
who found favor in the eyes of Ahasuerus. He elevated her to the dignity
of chief wife, or queen. The other competitors had apartments assigned
them in the royal harem, and were retained in the rank of secondary
wives, of whom Oriental princes have a great number.

he set the royal crown upon her head--This consisted only of a purple
ribbon, streaked with white, bound round the forehead. The nuptials were
celebrated by a magnificent entertainment, and, in honor of the
auspicious occasion, "he made a release to the provinces, and gave
gifts, according to the state of the king." The dotation of Persian
queens consisted in consigning to them the revenue of certain cities, in
various parts of the kingdom, for defraying their personal and domestic
expenditure. Some of these imposts the king remitted or lessened at this
time.

[Esther 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md)

MORDECAI, DISCOVERING A TREASON, IS RECORDED IN THE CHRONICLES. ([Est
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021).md)

In those days . . . two of the king's chamberlains . . . were wroth and
sought to lay hand on the king, &c.--This secret conspiracy against the
king's life probably arose out of revenge for the divorce of Vashti, in
whose interest, and at whose instigation, these eunuchs may have acted.
Through the vigilance of Mordecai, whose fidelity, however, passed
unnoticed, the design was frustrated, while the conspirators were
condemned to be executed and as the matter was recorded in the court
annals, it became the occasion afterwards of Mordecai's preferment to
the place of power and influence for which, in furtherance of the
national interests of the Jews, divine providence intended him.
