### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 4:1</span></span>

MIRACULOUS CHANGE OF THE ROD, &c. (Exo. 4:1-31)

But, behold--Hebrew, "If," "perhaps," "they will not believe me."--What
evidence can I produce of my divine mission? There was still a want of
full confidence, not in the character and divine power of his employer,
but in His presence and power always accompanying him. He insinuated
that his communication might be rejected and he himself treated as an
impostor.

[Exodus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 4:2</span></span>

the Lord said, . . . What is that in thine hand?--The question was put
not to elicit information which God required, but to draw the particular
attention of Moses.

A rod--probably the shepherd's crook--among the Arabs, a long staff,
with a curved head, varying from three to six feet in length.

[Exodus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 4:6</span></span>

Put now thine hand into thy bosom--the open part of his outer robe, worn
about the girdle.

[Exodus 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 4:9</span></span>

take of the water of the river--Nile. Those miracles, two of which were
wrought then, and the third to be performed on his arrival in Goshen,
were at first designed to encourage him as satisfactory proofs of his
divine mission, and to be repeated for the special confirmation of his
embassy before the Israelites.

[Exodus 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 4:10</span></span>

I am not eloquent--It is supposed that Moses labored under a natural
defect of utterance or had a difficulty in the free and fluent
expression of his ideas in the Egyptian language, which he had long
disused. This new objection was also overruled, but still Moses, who
foresaw the manifold difficulties of the undertaking, was anxious to be
freed from the responsibility.

[Exodus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 4:14</span></span>

the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses--The Divine Being is not
subject to ebullitions of passion; but His displeasure was manifested by
transferring the honor of the priesthood, which would otherwise have
been bestowed on Moses, to Aaron, who was from this time destined to be
the head of the house of Levi ([Ch1
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013).md). Marvellous had been His
condescension and patience in dealing with Moses; and now every
remaining scruple was removed by the unexpected and welcome intelligence
that his brother Aaron was to be his colleague. God knew from the
beginning what Moses would do, but He reserves this motive to the last
as the strongest to rouse his languid heart, and Moses now fully and
cordially complied with the call. If we are surprised at his
backwardness amidst all the signs and promises that were given him, we
must admire his candor and honesty in recording it.

[Exodus 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 4:18</span></span>

Moses . . . returned to Jethro--Being in his service, it was right to
obtain his consent, but Moses evinced piety, humility, and prudence, in
not divulging the special object of his journey.

[Exodus 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 4:19</span></span>

all the men are dead which sought thy life--The death of the Egyptian
monarch took place in the four hundred and twenty-ninth year of the
Hebrew sojourn in that land, and that event, according to the law of
Egypt, took off his proscription of Moses, if it had been publicly
issued.

[Exodus 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 4:20</span></span>

Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass--Septuagint,
"asses." Those animals are not now used in the desert of Sinai except by
the Arabs for short distances.

returned--entered on his journey towards Egypt.

he took the rod of God--so called from its being appropriated to His
service, and because whatever miracles it might be employed in
performing would be wrought not by its inherent properties, but by a
divine power following on its use. (Compare [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012).md).

[Exodus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 4:24</span></span>

inn--Hebrew, "a halting place for the night."

the Lord met him, and sought to kill him--that is, he was either
overwhelmed with mental distress or overtaken by a sudden and dangerous
malady. The narrative is obscure, but the meaning seems to be, that, led
during his illness to a strict self-examination, he was deeply pained
and grieved at the thought of having, to please his wife, postponed or
neglected the circumcision of one of his sons, probably the younger. To
dishonor that sign and seal of the covenant was criminal in any Hebrew,
peculiarly so in one destined to be the leader and deliverer of the
Hebrews; and he seems to have felt his sickness as a merited
chastisement for his sinful omission. Concerned for her husband's
safety, Zipporah overcomes her maternal feelings of aversion to the
painful rite, performs herself, by means of one of the sharp flints with
which that part of the desert abounds, an operation which her husband,
on whom the duty devolved, was unable to do, and having brought the
bloody evidence, exclaimed in the painful excitement of her feelings
that from love to him she had risked the life of her child \[CALVIN,
BULLINGER, ROSENMULLER\].

[Exodus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 4:26</span></span>

So he let him go--Moses recovered; but the remembrance of this critical
period in his life would stimulate the Hebrew legislator to enforce a
faithful attention to the rite of circumcision when it was established
as a divine ordinance in Israel, and made their peculiar distinction as
a people.

[Exodus 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 4:27</span></span>

Aaron met him in the mount of God, and kissed him--After a separation of
forty years, their meeting would be mutually happy. Similar are the
salutations of Arab friends when they meet in the desert still;
conspicuous is the kiss on each side of the head.

[Exodus 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 4:29</span></span>

Moses and Aaron went--towards Egypt, Zipporah and her sons having been
sent back. (Compare [Exo 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#002).md).

gathered . . . all the elders--Aaron was spokesman, and Moses performed
the appointed miracles--through which "the people" (that is, the elders)
believed ([Kg1 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md); [Jos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002).md) and received the joyful tidings
of the errand on which Moses had come with devout thanksgiving. Formerly
they had slighted the message and rejected the messenger. Formerly Moses
had gone in his own strength; now he goes leaning on God, and strong
only through faith in Him who had sent him. Israel also had been taught
a useful lesson, and it was good for both that they had been afflicted.
