[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 18:1</span></span>

HEZEKIAH'S GOOD REIGN. ([Kg2 18:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001).md)

Hezekiah . . . began to reign. Twenty and five years old--According to
this statement (compare [Kg2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002).md), he
must have been born when his father Ahaz was no more than eleven years
old. Paternity at an age so early is not unprecedented in the warm
climates of the south, where the human frame is matured sooner than in
our northern regions. But the case admits of solution in a different
way. It was customary for the later kings of Israel to assume their son
and heir into partnership in the government during their lives; and as
Hezekiah began to reign in the third year of Hoshea ([Kg2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001).md), and Hoshea in the twelfth year
of Ahaz ([Kg2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001).md), it is evident
that Hezekiah began to reign in the fourteenth year of Ahaz his father,
and so reigned two or three years before his father's death. So that, at
the beginning of his reign in conjunction with his father, he might be
only twenty-two or twenty-three, and Ahaz a few years older than the
common calculation makes him. Or the case may be solved thus: As the
ancient writers, in the computation of time, take notice of the year
they mention, whether finished or newly begun, so Ahaz might be near
twenty-one years old at the beginning of his reign, and near seventeen
years older at his death; while, on the other hand, Hezekiah, when he
began to reign, might be just entering into his twenty-fifth year, and
so Ahaz would be near fourteen years old when his son Hezekiah was
born--no uncommon age for a young man to become a father in southern
latitudes \[PATRICK\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 18:4</span></span>

HE DESTROYS IDOLATRY. (2Ki. 18:4-37)

He removed the high places and brake the images, &c.--The methods
adopted by this good king for extirpating idolatry, and accomplishing a
thorough reformation in religion, are fully detailed ([Ch2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md); [Ch2
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#019).md). But they are indicated very
briefly, and in a sort of passing allusion.

brake in pieces the brazen serpent--The preservation of this remarkable
relic of antiquity ([Num 21:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005).md)
might, like the pot of manna and Aaron's rod, have remained an
interesting and instructive monument of the divine goodness and mercy to
the Israelites in the wilderness: and it must have required the exercise
of no small courage and resolution to destroy it. But in the progress of
degeneracy it had become an object of idolatrous worship and as the
interests of true religion rendered its demolition necessary, Hezekiah,
by taking this bold step, consulted both the glory of God and the good
of his country.

unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it--It is not
to be supposed that this superstitious reverence had been paid to it
ever since the time of Moses, for such idolatry would not have been
tolerated either by David or by Solomon in the early part of his reign,
by Asa or Jehoshaphat had they been aware of such a folly. But the
probability is, that the introduction of this superstition does not date
earlier than the time when the family of Ahab, by their alliance with
the throne of Judah, exercised a pernicious influence in paving the way
for all kinds of idolatry. It is possible, however, as some think, that
its origin may have arisen out of a misapprehension of Moses' language
([Num 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008).md). Serpent-worship, how
revolting soever it may appear, was an extensively diffused form of
idolatry; and it would obtain an easier reception in Israel because many
of the neighboring nations, such as the Egyptians and PhÅ“nicians,
adored idol gods in the form of serpents as the emblems of health and
immortality.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 18:5</span></span>

He trusted in the Lord God of Israel--without invoking the aid or
purchasing the succor of foreign auxiliaries like Asa ([Kg1
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018).md) and Ahaz ([Kg2
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017); Isa. 7:1-25.md).

so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah--Of
course David and Solomon are excepted, they having had the sovereignty
of the whole country. In the petty kingdom of Judah, Josiah alone had a
similar testimony borne to him ([Kg2
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025).md). But even he was surpassed by
Hezekiah, who set about a national reformation at the beginning of his
reign, which Josiah did not. The pious character and the excellent
course of Hezekiah was prompted, among other secondary influences, by a
sense of the calamities his father's wicked career had brought on the
country, as well as by the counsels of Isaiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 18:7</span></span>

he rebelled against the king of Assyria--that is, the yearly tribute his
father had stipulated to pay, he, with imprudent haste, withdrew.
Pursuing the policy of a truly theocratic sovereign, he was, through the
divine blessing which rested on his government, raised to a position of
great public and national strength. Shalmaneser had withdrawn from
Palestine, being engaged perhaps in a war with Tyre, or probably he was
dead. Assuming, consequently, that full independent sovereignty which
God had settled on the house of David, he both shook off the Assyrian
yoke, and, by an energetic movement against the Philistines, recovered
from that people the territory which they had taken from his father Ahaz
([Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 18:13</span></span>

Sennacherib--the son and successor of Shalmaneser.

all the fenced cities of Judah--not absolutely all of them; for, besides
the capital, some strong fortresses held out against the invader ([Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); [Kg2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008).md). The following account of
Sennacherib's invasion of Judah and the remarkable destruction of his
army, is repeated almost verbatim in 2Ch. 32:1-33 and Isa. 36:1-37:38.
The expedition seems to have been directed against Egypt, the conquest
of which was long a leading object of ambition with the Assyrian
monarchs. But the invasion of Judah necessarily preceded, that country
being the key to Egypt, the highway through which the conquerors from
Upper Asia had to pass. Judah had also at this time formed a league of
mutual defense with Egypt ([Kg2
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#024).md). Moreover, it was now laid
completely open by the transplantation of Israel to Assyria. Overrunning
Palestine, Sennacherib laid siege to the fortress of Lachish, which lay
seven Roman miles from Eleutheropolis, and therefore southwest of
Jerusalem on the way to Egypt \[ROBINSON\]. Among the interesting
illustrations of sacred history furnished by the recent Assyrian
excavations, is a series of bas-reliefs, representing the siege of a
town, which the inscription on the sculpture shows to be Lachish, and
the figure of a king, whose name is given, on the same inscription, as
Sennacherib. The legend, sculptured over the head of the king, runs
thus: "Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria,
sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish
\[Lakhisha\], I give permission for its slaughter" \[Nineveh and
Babylon\]. This minute confirmation of the truth of the Bible narrative
is given not only by the name Lachish, which is contained in the
inscription, but from the physiognomy of the captives brought before the
king, which is unmistakably Jewish.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 18:14</span></span>

Hezekiah . . . sent to Lachish, saying, . . . that which thou puttest on
me will I bear--Disappointed in his expectations of aid from Egypt, and
feeling himself unable to resist so mighty a conqueror who was menacing
Jerusalem itself, Hezekiah made his submission. The payment of 300
talents of silver, and 30 talents of gold--Â£351,000--brought a
temporary respite; but, in raising the imposed tribute, he was obliged
not only to drain all the treasures of the palace and the temple, but
even to strip the doors and pillars of the sacred edifice of the gold
that adorned them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 18:17</span></span>

SENNACHERIB BESIEGES JERUSALEM. (2Ki. 18:17-37)

king of Assyria sent Tartan--general ([Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md).

Rab-saris--chief of the eunuchs.

Rab-shakeh--chief cupbearer. These were the great officers employed in
delivering Sennacherib's insulting message to Hezekiah. On the walls of
the palace of Sennacherib, at Khorsabad, certain figures have been
identified with the officers of that sovereign mentioned in Scripture.
In particular, the figures, Rab-shakeh, Rab-saris, and Tartan, appear as
full-length portraits of the persons holding those offices in the reign
of Sennacherib. Probably they represent the very individuals sent on
this embassy.

with a great host to Jerusalem--Engaged in a campaign of three years in
Egypt, Sennacherib was forced by the king of Ethiopia to retreat, and
discharging his rage against Jerusalem, he sent an immense army to
summon it to surrender. (See on [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md).

the conduit of the upper pool--the conduit which went from the reservoir
of the Upper Gihon (Birket et Mamilla) to the lower pool, the Birket es
Sultan.

the highway of the fuller's field--the public road which passed by that
district, which had been assigned them for carrying on their business
without the city, on account of the unpleasant smell \[KEIL\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 18:18</span></span>

when they had called to the king--Hezekiah did not make a personal
appearance, but commissioned his three principal ministers to meet the
Assyrian deputies at a conference outside the city walls.

Eliakim--lately promoted to be master of the royal household ([Isa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020).md).

Shebna--removed for his pride and presumption ([Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015).md) from that office, though still
royal secretary.

Joah . . . the recorder--that is, the keeper of the chronicles, an
important office in Eastern countries.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 18:19</span></span>

Rab-shakeh said--The insolent tone he assumed appears surprising. But
this boasting \[[Kg2 18:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019.md)\], both
as to matter and manner, his highly colored picture of his master's
powers and resources, and the impossibility of Hezekiah making any
effective resistance, heightened by all the arguments and figures which
an Oriental imagination could suggest, has been paralleled in all,
except the blasphemy, by other messages of defiance sent on similar
occasions in the history of the East.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 18:27</span></span>

that they may eat, &c.--This was designed to show the dreadful
extremities to which, in the threatened siege, the people of Jerusalem
would be reduced.
