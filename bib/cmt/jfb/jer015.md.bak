### [Jeremiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 15:1</span></span>

GOD'S REPLY TO JEREMIAH'S INTERCESSORY PRAYER. (Jer. 15:1-21)

Moses . . . Samuel--eminent in intercessions ([Exo
32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md); [Sa1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009.md); [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006).md).

be toward--could not be favorably inclined toward them.

out of my sight--God speaks as if the people were present before Him,
along with Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 15:2</span></span>

death--deadly plague ([Jer 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md); [Jer
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011.md); [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md), [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md); [Zac
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#009).md).

[Jeremiah 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 15:3</span></span>

appoint-- ([Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016).md).

kinds--of punishments.

[Jeremiah 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 15:4</span></span>

cause . . . to be removed-- ([Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025.md); [Eze
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#046).md). Rather, "I will give them up
to vexation," I will cause them to wander so as nowhere to have repose
\[CALVIN\]; ([Ch2 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md), "trouble;"
Margin, "commotion").

because of Manasseh--He was now dead, but the effects of his sins still
remained. How much evil one bad man can cause! The evil fruits remain
even after he himself has received repentance and forgiveness. The
people had followed his wicked example ever since; and it is implied
that it was only through the long-suffering of God that the penal
consequences had been suspended up to the present time (compare [Kg1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#016.md); [Kg2
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#011.md); [Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md); [Kg2
24:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 15:5</span></span>

go aside . . . how thou doest--Who will turn aside (in passing by) to
salute thee (to wish thee "peace")?

[Jeremiah 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 15:6</span></span>

weary with repenting-- ([Hos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md);
[Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md). I have so often repented
of the evil that I threatened ([Jer
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019.md); [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014.md); [Ch1
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#015).md), and have spared them, without
My forbearance moving them to repentance, that I will not again change
My purpose (God speaking in condescension to human modes of thought),
but will take vengeance on them now.

[Jeremiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 15:7</span></span>

fan--tribulation--from tribulum, a threshing instrument, which separates
the chaff from the wheat ([Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md).

gates of the land--that is, the extreme bounds of the land through which
the entrance to and exit from it lie. MAURER translates, "I will fan,"
that is, cast them forth "to the gates of the land" ([Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013).md). "In the gates"; English Version
draws the image from a man cleaning corn with a fan; he stands at the
gate of the threshing-floor in the open air, to remove the wheat from
the chaff by means of the wind; so God threatens to remove Israel out of
the bounds of the land \[HOUBIGANT\].

[Jeremiah 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 15:8</span></span>

Their widows--My people's ([Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007).md).

have brought--prophetical past: I will bring.

mother of the young men--"mother" is collective; after the "widows," He
naturally mentions bereavement of their sons ("young men"), brought on
the "mothers" by "the spoiler"; it was owing to the number of men slain
that the "widows" were so many \[CALVIN\]. Others take "mother," as in
[Sa2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019.md), of Jerusalem, the
metropolis; "I have brought on them, against the 'mother,' a young
spoiler," namely, Nebuchadnezzar, sent by his father, Nabopolassar, to
repulse the Egyptian invaders ([Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md); [Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md), and occupy Judea. But [Jer
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007.md) shows the future, not the past,
is referred to; and "widows" being literal, "mother" is probably so,
too.

at noonday--the hottest part of the day, when military operations were
usually suspended; thus it means unexpectedly, answering to the
parallel, "suddenly"; openly, as others explain it, will not suit the
parallelism (compare [Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006).md).

it--English Version seems to understand by "it" the mother city, and by
"him" the "spoiler"; thus "it" will be parallel to "city." Rather, "I
will cause to fall upon them (the 'mothers' about to be bereft of their
sons) suddenly anguish and terrors."

the city--rather, from a root "heat," anguish, or consternation. So the
Septuagint.

[Jeremiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 15:9</span></span>

borne seven-- ([Sa1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005).md). Seven being
the perfect number indicates full fruitfulness.

languisheth--because not even one is left of all her sons ([Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).md).

sun is gone down while . . . yet day--Fortune deserts her at the very
height of her prosperity ([Amo 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009).md).

she . . . ashamed--The mothers (she being collective) are put to the
shame of disappointed hopes through the loss of all their children.

[Jeremiah 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 15:10</span></span>

([Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md); [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001), &c..md). Jeremiah seems to have been
of a peculiarly sensitive temperament; yet the Holy Spirit enabled him
to deliver his message at the certain cost of having his sensitiveness
wounded by the enmities of those whom his words offended.

man of strife--exposed to strifes on the part of "the whole earth" ([Psa
80:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#006).md).

I have neither lent, &c.--proverbial for, "I have given no cause for
strife against me."

[Jeremiah 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 15:11</span></span>

Verily--literally, "Shall it not be?" that is, "Surely it shall be."

thy remnant--the final issue of thy life; thy life, which now seems to
thee so sad, shall eventuate in prosperity \[CALVIN\]. They who think
that they shall be the surviving remnant, whereas thou shalt perish,
shall themselves fall, whereas thou shalt remain and be favored by the
conquerors \[JUNIUS\], ([Jer 40:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#004.md);
[Jer 39:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011).md). The Keri reads, "I
will set thee free (or as MAURER, 'I will establish thee') for good"
([Jer 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md); [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022.md); [Psa
119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122).md).

to entreat thee well--literally, "to meet thee"; so "to be placable,
nay, of their own accord to anticipate in meeting thee with kindness"
\[CALVIN\]. I prefer this translation as according with the event ([Jer
39:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md); [Jer
40:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#004).md). GESENIUS, from [Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md); [Jer
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018.md); [Job
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015.md), translates (not only will I
relieve thee from the enemy's vexations, but) "I will make thine enemy
(that now vexeth thee) apply to thee with prayers" ([Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md); [Jer
42:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 15:12</span></span>

steel--rather, brass or copper, which mixed with "iron" (by the Chalybes
near the Euxine Pontus, far north of Palestine), formed the hardest
metal, like our steel. Can the Jews, hardy like common iron though they
be, break the still hardier Chaldees of the north ([Jer
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014).md), who resemble the Chalybian iron
hardened with copper? Certainly not \[CALVIN\]. HENDERSON translates.
"Can one break iron, (even) the northern iron, and brass," on the ground
that English Version makes ordinary iron not so hard as brass. But it is
not brass, but a particular mixture of iron and brass, which is
represented as harder than common iron, which was probably then of
inferior texture, owing to ignorance of modern modes of preparation.

[Jeremiah 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 15:13</span></span>

Thy substance . . . sins--Judea's, not Jeremiah's.

without price--God casts His people away as a thing worth naught ([Psa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012).md). So, on the contrary, Jehovah,
when about to restore His people, says, He will give Egypt, &c., for
their "ransom" ([Isa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003).md).

even in all thy borders--joined with "Thy substance . . . treasures, as
also with "all thy sins," their sin and punishment being commensurate
([Jer 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 15:14</span></span>

thee--MAURER supplies "them," namely, "thy treasures." EICHORN,
needlessly, from Syriac and the Septuagint, reads, "I will make thee to
serve thine enemies"; a reading doubtless interpolated from [Jer
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004.md).

fire-- ([Deu 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 15:15</span></span>

thou knowest--namely, my case; what wrongs my adversaries have done me
([Jer 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003).md).

revenge me--(See on [Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020).md). The
prophet in this had regard to, not his own personal feelings of revenge,
but the cause of God; he speaks by inspiration God's will against the
ungodly. Contrast in this the law with the gospel ([Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034.md); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060).md).

take me not away in thy long-suffering--By Thy long-suffering towards
them, suffer them not meanwhile to take away my life.

for thy sake I have suffered rebuke--the very words of the antitype,
Jesus Christ ([Psa 69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007.md), [Psa
69:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022).md), which last compare with
Jeremiah's prayer in the beginning of this verse.

[Jeremiah 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 15:16</span></span>

eat-- ([Eze 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md); [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md), [Eze
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md); [Rev
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009).md). As soon as Thy words were
found by me, I eagerly laid hold of and appropriated them. The Keri
reads, "Thy word."

thy word . . . joy-- ([Job 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md); [Psa
119:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#072.md), [Psa
119:111](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#111.md); compare [Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md).

called by thy name--I am Thine, Thy minister. So the antitype, Jesus
Christ ([Exo 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 15:17</span></span>

My "rejoicing" ([Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md) was not
that of the profane mockers ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md);
[Psa 26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004).md) at feasts. So far from
having fellowship with these, he was expelled from society, and made to
sit "alone," because of his faithful prophecies.

because of thy hand--that is, Thine inspiration ([Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md); [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014).md).

filled me with indignation--So [Jer
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md), "full of the fury of the Lord";
so full was he of the subject (God's "indignation" against the ungodly)
with which God had inspired him, as not to be able to contain himself
from expressing it. The same comparison by contrast between the effect
of inspiration, and that of wine, both taking a man out of himself,
occurs ([Act 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md), [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md), [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 15:18</span></span>

([Jer 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#015).md). "Pain," namely, the
perpetual persecution to which he was exposed, and his being left by God
without consolation and "alone." Contrast his feeling here with that in
[Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md), when he enjoyed the full
presence of God, and was inspired by His words. Therefore he utters
words of his natural "infirmity" (so David, [Psa
77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010).md) here; as before he spoke under
the higher spiritual nature given him.

as a liar, and as--rather, "as a deceiving (river) . . . waters that are
not sure (lasting)"; opposed to "tiring (perennial) waters" ([Job
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015).md). Streams that the thirsty
traveller had calculated on being full in winter, but which disappoint
him in his sorest need, having run dry in the heat of summer. Jehovah
had promised Jeremiah protection from his enemies ([Jer
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018).md); his infirmity suggests that
God had failed to do so.

[Jeremiah 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 15:19</span></span>

God's reply to Jeremiah.

return . . . bring . . . again--Jeremiah, by his impatient language, had
left his proper posture towards God; God saith, "If thou wilt return (to
thy former patient discharge of thy prophetic function) I will bring
thee back" to thy former position: in the Hebrew there is a play of
words, "return . . . turn again" ([Jer
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004.md); [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001).md).

stand before me--minister acceptably to Me ([Deu
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md); [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md); [Kg1
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#015).md).

take . . . precious from . . . vile--image from metals: "If thou wilt
separate what is precious in thee (the divine graces imparted) from what
is vile (thy natural corruptions, impatience, and hasty words), thou
shall be as My mouth": my mouthpiece ([Exo
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016).md).

return not thou unto them--Let not them lead you into their profane ways
(as Jeremiah had spoken irreverently, [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018).md), but lead thou them to the ways
of godliness ([Jer 15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md). [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026.md) accords with the other
interpretation, which, however, does not so well suit the context, "If
thou wilt separate from the promiscuous mass the better ones, and lead
them to conversion by faithful warnings," &c.

[Jeremiah 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 15:20</span></span>

The promise of [Jer 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md), in almost
the same words, but with the addition, adapted to the present attacks of
Jeremiah's formidable enemies, "I will deliver thee out of . . . wicked
. . . redeem . . . terrible"; the repetition is in order to assure
Jeremiah that God is the same now as when He first made the promise, in
opposition to the prophet's irreverent accusation of unfaithfulness
([Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018).md).
