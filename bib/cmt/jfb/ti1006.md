### [1 Timothy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 6:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS AS TO DISTINCTIONS OF CIVIL RANK; THE DUTY OF SLAVES, IN
OPPOSITION TO THE FALSE TEACHINGS OF GAIN-SEEKERS; TIMOTHY'S PURSUIT IS
TO BE GODLINESS, WHICH IS AN EVERLASTING POSSESSION: SOLEMN ADJURATION
TO DO SO AGAINST CHRIST'S COMING; CHARGE TO BE GIVEN TO THE RICH.
CONCLUDING EXHORTATION. (1Ti. 6:1-21)

servants--to be taken as predicated thus, "Let as many as are under the
yoke (as) slaves" ([Tit 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009)). The
exhortation is natural as there was a danger of Christian slaves
inwardly feeling above their heathen masters.

their own masters--The phrase "their own," is an argument for
submissiveness; it is not strangers, but their own masters whom they are
required to respect.

all honour--all possible and fitting honor; not merely outward
subjection, but that inward honor from which will flow spontaneously
right outward conduct (see on [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)).

that the name of God--by which Christians are called.

blasphemed--Heathen masters would say, What kind of a God must be the
God of the Christians, when such are the fruits of His worship ([Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005), [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010))?

[1 Timothy 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 6:2</span></span>

And--rather, "But." The opposition is between those Christian slaves
under the yoke of heathen, and those that have believing masters (he
does not use the phrase "under the yoke" in the latter case, for service
under believers is not a yoke). Connect the following words thus, "Let
them (the slaves) not, because they (the masters) are brethren (and so
equals, masters and slaves alike being Christians), despise them (the
masters)."

but rather, &c.--"but all the more (so much the more: with the greater
good will) do them service because they (the masters) are faithful (that
is, believers) and beloved who receive (in the mutual interchange of
relative duties between master and servant; so the Greek) the benefit"
(English Version violates Greek grammar). This latter clause is parallel
to, "because they are brethren"; which proves that "they" refers to the
masters, not the servants, as TITTMANN takes it, explaining the verb in
the common sense ([Luk 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054); [Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035)), "who sedulously labor for
their (masters') benefit." The very term "benefit" delicately implies
service done with the right motive, Christian "good will" ([Eph
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007)). If the common sense of the Greek
verb be urged, the sense must be, "Because they (the masters) are
faithful and beloved who are sedulously intent on the benefiting" of
their servants. But PORPHYRY \[On Abstinence, 1.46\] justifies the sense
of the Greek verb given above, which also better accords with the
context; for otherwise, the article "the," will have nothing in the
preceding words to explain it, whereas in my explanation above "the
benefit" will be that of the slaves' service.

These things teach-- ([Ti1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#011); [Tit
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015)).

[1 Timothy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 6:3</span></span>

teach otherwise--than I desire thee to "teach" ([Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002)). The Greek indicative implies, he
puts not a merely supposed case, but one actually existing, [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003), "Every one who teaches
otherwise," that is, who teaches heterodoxy.

consent not--Greek, "accede not to."

wholesome--"sound" ([Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010)):
opposed to the false teachers' words, unsound through profitless science
and immorality.

words of our Lord Jesus Christ--Paul's inspired words are not merely his
own, but are also Christ's words.

[1 Timothy 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 6:4</span></span>

He is proud--literally, "wrapt in smoke"; filled with the fumes of
self-conceit ([Ti1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006)) while "knowing
nothing," namely, of the doctrine which is according to godliness ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003)), though arrogating pre-eminent
knowledge ([Ti1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007)).

doting about--literally, "sick about"; the opposite of "wholesome" ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003)). Truth is not the center about
which his investigations move, but mere word-strifes.

questions--of controversy.

strifes of words--rather than about realities ([Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014)). These stand with them instead
of "godliness" and "wholesome words" ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003); [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009)).

evil surmisings--as to those who are of a different party from
themselves.

[1 Timothy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 6:5</span></span>

Perverse disputings--useless disputings. The oldest manuscripts read,
"lasting contests" \[WIESINGER\]; "incessant collisions" \[ALFORD\].
"Strifes of words" had already been mentioned so that he would not be
likely to repeat the same idea (as in the English Version reading)
again.

corrupt minds--Greek, "of men corrupted (depraved) in mind." The inmost
source of the evil is in the perverted mind ([Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)).

destitute of the truth-- ([Tit 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)).
They had had the truth, but through want of moral integrity and of love
of the truth, they were misled by a pretended deeper gnosis (knowledge)
and higher ascetical holiness, of which they made a trade \[WIESINGER\].

supposing, &c.--The Greek requires, "supposing (regarding the matter in
this point of view) that piety (so translated for 'godliness') is a
means of gain (that is, a way of advancing one's worldly interests: a
different Greek form, poriswa, expresses the thing gained, gain)"; not
"that gain is godliness," as English Version.

from such withdraw thyself--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The
connection with [Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006) favors the
omission of these words, which interrupt the connection.

[1 Timothy 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 6:6</span></span>

But--Though they err in this, there is a sense in which "piety is" not
merely gain, but "great means of gain": not the gaining which they
pursue, and which makes men to be discontented with their present
possessions, and to use religion as "a cloak of covetousness" ([Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005)) and means of earthly gain, but
the present and eternal gain which piety, whose accompaniment is
contentment, secures to the soul. WIESINGER remarks that Paul observed
in Timothy a tendency to indolence and shrinking from the conflict,
whence he felt ([Ti1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011)) that
Timothy needed cautioning against such temptation; compare also the
second Epistle. Not merely contentment is great gain (a sentiment of the
heathen CICERO \[Paradox 6\], "the greatest and surest riches"), but
"piety with contentment"; for piety not only feels no need of what it
has not, but also has that which exalts it above what it has not
\[WIESINGER\]. The Greek for contentment is translated "sufficiency"
([Co2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008)). But the adjective ([Phi
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011)) "content"; literally, "having a
sufficiency in one's self" independent of others. "The Lord always
supplies His people with what is necessary for them. True happiness lies
in piety, but this sufficiency \[supplied by God, with which moreover
His people are content\] is thrown into the scale as a kind of
overweight" \[CALVIN\] (1Ki. 17:1-16; [Psa
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019); [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006), [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016); [Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021)).

[1 Timothy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 6:7</span></span>

For--confirming the reasonableness of "contentment."

and it is certain--Vulgate and other old versions support this reading.
The oldest manuscripts, however, omit "and it is certain"; then the
translation will be, "We brought nothing into the world (to teach us to
remember) that neither can we carry anything out" ([Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021); [Ecc
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015)). Therefore, we should have no
gain-seeking anxiety, the breeder of discontent ([Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)).

[1 Timothy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 6:8</span></span>

And--Greek, "But." In contrast to the greedy gain-seekers ([Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005)).

having--so long as we have food. (The Greek expresses "food sufficient
in each case for our continually recurring wants" \[ALFORD\]). It is
implied that we, as believers, shall have this ([Isa
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016)).

raiment--Greek, "covering"; according to some including a roof to cover
us, that is, a dwelling, as well as clothing.

let us be therewith content--literally, "we shall be sufficiently
provided"; "we shall be sufficed" \[ALFORD\].

[1 Timothy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 6:9</span></span>

will be rich--have more than "food and raiment." Greek, "wish to be
rich"; not merely are willing, but are resolved, and earnestly desire to
have riches at any cost ([Pro 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020),
[Pro 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022)). This wishing (not the
riches themselves) is fatal to "contentment" ([Ti1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006)). Rich men are not told to cast
away their riches, but not to "trust" in them, and to "do good" with
them ([Ti1 6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017); [Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)).

fall into temptation--not merely "are exposed to temptation," but
actually "fall into" it. The falling into it is what we are to pray
against, "Lead us not into temptation" ([Jam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014)); such a one is already in a
sinful state, even before any overt act of sin. The Greek for
"temptation" and "gain" contains a play on sounds--porasmus, peirasmus.

snare--a further step downwards ([Ti1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007)). He falls into "the snare of the
devil."

foolish--irrational.

hurtful--to those who fall into the snare. Compare [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022), "deceitful lusts" which deceive
to one's deadly hurt.

lusts--With the one evil lust ("wish to be rich") many others join
themselves: the one is the "root of all evils" ([Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)).

which--Greek, "whatever (lusts)."

drown--an awful descending climax from "fall into"; this is the last
step in the terrible descent ([Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015)); translated "sink," [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007).

destruction . . . perdition--destruction in general (temporal or
eternal), and perdition in particular, namely, that of body and soul in
hell.

[1 Timothy 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 6:10</span></span>

the love of money--not the money itself, but the love of it--the wishing
to be rich ([Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)) --"is a root
(ELLICOTT and MIDDLETON: not as English Version, 'the root') of all
evils." (So the Greek plural). The wealthiest may be rich not in a bad
sense; the poorest may covet to be so ([Psa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)). Love of money is not the sole
root of evils, but it is a leading "root of bitterness" ([Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)), for "it destroys faith, the
root of all that is good" \[BENGEL\]; its offshoots are "temptation, a
snare, lusts, destruction, perdition."

coveted after--lusted after.

erred from--literally, "have been made to err from the faith" ([Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)).

pierced-- ([Luk 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035)).

with . . . sorrows--"pains": "thorns" of the parable ([Mat
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022)) which choke the word of
"faith." "The prosperity of fools destroys them" ([Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032)). BENGEL and WIESINGER make them
the gnawings of conscience, producing remorse for wealth badly acquired;
the harbingers of the future "perdition" ([Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)).

[1 Timothy 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 6:11</span></span>

But thou--in contrast to the "some" ([Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)).

man of God--who hast God as thy true riches ([Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005); [Lam
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024)). Applying primarily to Timothy
as a minister (compare [Pe2 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)),
just as the term was used of Moses ([Deu
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)), Samuel ([Sa1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006)), Elijah, and Elisha; but, as the
exhortation is as to duties incumbent also on all Christians, the term
applies secondarily to him (so [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017)) as a Christian man born of God
([Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001)), no longer a man of the world
raised above earthly things; therefore, God's property, not his own,
bought with a price, and so having parted with all right in himself:
Christ's work is to be his great work: he is to be Christ's living
representative.

flee these things--namely, "the love of money" with its evil results
([Ti1 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)).

follow after righteousness-- ([Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022)).

godliness--"piety." Righteousness is more in relation to our fellow man;
piety ("godliness") to God"; faith is the root of both (see on [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012)).

love--by which "faith worketh."

patience--enduring perseverance amidst trials.

meekness--The oldest manuscripts read, "meek-spiritedness," namely,
towards the opponents of the Gospel.

[1 Timothy 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 6:12</span></span>

Fight the good fight--BIRKS thinks this Epistle was written from
Corinth, where contests in the national games recurred at stated
seasons, which will account for the allusion here as in [Co1
9:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024). Contrast "strifes of words"
([Ti1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004)). Compare [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007). The "good profession" is
connected with the good fight ([Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004)).

lay hold on eternal life--the crown, or garland, the prize of victory,
laid hold of by the winner in the "good fight" ([Ti2
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007); [Phi
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012)). "Fight (literally, 'strive')
with such striving earnestness as to lay hold on the prize, eternal
life."

also--not in the oldest manuscripts.

professed a good profession--Greek, "didst confess THE good confession,"
namely, the Christian confession (as the Greek word is the same in this
verse as that for "confession" in [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013), probably the profession here is
the confession that Christ's kingdom is the kingdom of the truth, [Joh
18:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)), at thy being set apart to
thy ministerial function (whether in general, or as overseer at
Ephesus): the same occasion as is referred to in [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014); [Ti2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004).

before many witnesses--who would testify against thee if thou shouldest
fall away \[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 6:13</span></span>

quickeneth all things--that is, "maketh alive." But the oldest
manuscripts read, "preserveth alive"; as the same Greek means in [Act
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019); compare [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006). He urges Timothy to faithfulness
here by the present manifestation of God's power in preserving all
things, as in [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014), by the future
manifestation of God's power at the appearing of Christ. The assurance
that "eternal life," [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012), will
be the result of "fighting the good fight," rests on the fulness and
power of Him who is the God of all life, present and to come.

witnessed--It was the Lord's part to witness, Timothy's part to confess
(or "profess," [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012)) "the good
confession" \[BENGEL\]. The confession was His testimony that He was
King, and His kingdom that of the truth (see on [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012); [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015); [Mat
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#011)). Christ, in attesting, or
bearing witness to this truth, attested the truth of the whole of
Christianity. Timothy's profession, or confession, included therefore
the whole of the Christian truth.

[1 Timothy 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 6:14</span></span>

keep this commandment--Greek, "the commandment," that is, the Gospel
rule of life ([Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005); [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034); [Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021); [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002)).

without spot, unrebukeable--agreeing with "thou." Keep the commandment
and so be without spot," &c. "Pure" ([Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022); [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027); [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014)).

until the appearing of . . . Christ--His coming in person ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)). Believers then used in their
practice to set before themselves the day of Christ as near at hand; we,
the hour of death \[BENGEL\]. The fact has in all ages of the Church
been certain, the time as uncertain to Paul, as it is to us; hence, [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015), he says, "in HIS times": the
Church's true attitude is that of continual expectation of her Lord's
return ([Co1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006), [Phi
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010)).

[1 Timothy 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 6:15</span></span>

in his times--Greek, "His own \[fitting\] times" ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)). The plural implies successive
stages in the manifestation of the kingdom of God, each having its own
appropriate time, the regulating principle and knowledge of which rests
with the Father ([Ti1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003); [Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)).

he shall show--"display": an expression appropriate in reference to His
"APPEARING," which is stronger than His "coming," and implies its
visibility; "manifest": make visible (compare [Act
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020)): "He" is the Father ([Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)).

blessed--in Himself: so about to be the source of blessing to His people
at Christ appearing, whence flows their "blessed hope" ([Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)).

only-- ([Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003); [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027); [Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004)).

King of kings--elsewhere applied also to Jesus ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014); [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016)).

[1 Timothy 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 6:16</span></span>

Who only hath immortality--in His own essence, not merely at the will of
another, as all other immortal beings \[JUSTIN MARTYR, QuÃ&brvbr;st. ad
Orthod., 61\]. As He hath immortality, so will He give it to us who
believe; to be out of Him is death. It is mere heathen philosophy that
attributes to the soul indestructibility in itself, which is to be
attributed solely to God's gift. As He hath life in Himself, so hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself ([Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026)). The term used in the New
Testament for "immortal," which does not occur, is "incorruptible."
"Immortality" is found in [Co1
15:53-54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053).

dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto--After life comes
mention of light, as in [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004). That
light is unapproachable to creatures, except in so far as they are
admitted by Him, and as He goes forth to them \[BENGEL\]. It is
unapproachable on account of its exceeding brightness \[THEOPHYLACT\].
If one cannot gaze steadfastly at the sun, which is but a small part of
creation, by reason of its exceeding heat and power, how much less can
mortal man gaze at the inexpressible glory of God \[THEOPHYLACT, To
Autolycus\] ([Psa 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002); [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)).

no man hath seen-- ([Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012)). Perhaps even in the perfect
state no creature shall fully see God. Still the saints shall, in some
sense, have the blessedness of seeing Him, which is denied to mere man
([Mat 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004)).

[1 Timothy 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 6:17</span></span>

Resuming the subject from above, [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005), [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010). The immortality of God, alone
rich in glory, and of His people through Him, is opposed to the lust of
money (compare [Ti1 6:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014)). From
speaking of the desire to be rich, he here passes to those who are rich:
(1) What ought to be their disposition; (2) What use they ought to make
of their riches, and, (3) The consequences of their so using them.

rich in this world--contrasted with the riches of the future kingdom to
be the portion of believers at Christ's "appearing," [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014).

high-minded--often the character of the rich (see [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016)).

trust--Greek, "to have their trust resting."

in . . . in--rather, "upon . . . upon," as the oldest manuscripts.

uncertain riches--rather as Greek, "the uncertainty of riches." They who
rest their trust on riches, rest trust on uncertainty itself ([Pro
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005)). Now they belong to one person,
now to another, and that which has many masters is possessed by none
\[THEODORET\].

living God--The best manuscripts and versions omit "living." He who
trusts in riches transfers to them the duty he owes to God \[CALVIN\].

who giveth--Greek, "affordeth."

all things richly--temporal and eternal, for the body and for the soul.
In order to be truly rich, seek to be blessed of, and in, God ([Pro
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022); [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003)).

to enjoy--Greek, "for enjoyment." Not that the heart may cleave to them
as its idol and trust ([Ti1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)).
Enjoyment consists in giving, not in holding fast. Non-employment should
be far removed, as from man, so from his resources ([Jam
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002)) \[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 6:18</span></span>

do good--like God Himself ([Psa
119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068); [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017)) and Christ ([Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038)). TITTMANN translates, "to do,"
or "act well"; as the Greek for "to be beneficent" is a distinct word,
agathopoiein.

rich in good works--so "rich in faith," which produces good works ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005)). Contrasted with "rich in this
world," [Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017). Literally, it is
"rich in honorable (right) works." Greek, "kalois," "ergois," are works
good or right in themselves: "agathois," good to another.

ready to distribute--free givers \[ALFORD\]; the heart not cleaving to
possessions, but ready to impart to others.

willing to communicate--ready contributors \[ALFORD\]: liberal in
admitting others to share our goods in common with ourselves ([Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016)).

[1 Timothy 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti1 6:19</span></span>

Laying up in store--"therefrom (that is, by this means \[ALFORD\]; but
BENGEL makes the Greek "apo" mean laying apart against a future time),
laying up for themselves as a treasure" \[ALFORD\] ([Mat
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019)). This is a treasure which we
act wisely in laying up in store, whereas the wisest thing we can do
with earthly treasures is "to distribute" them and give others a share
of them ([Ti1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018)).

good foundation--(See on [Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013);
[Luk 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#048); [Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011)). The sure reversion of the
future heavenly inheritance: earthly riches scattered in faith lay up in
store a sure increase of heavenly riches. We gather by scattering ([Pro
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024); [Pro
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#007); [Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009)).

that . . . eternal life--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "that
which is really life," its joys being solid and enduring ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)). The life that now is cannot be
called so, its goods being unsubstantial, and itself a vapor ([Jam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014)). "In order that ('with their
feet so to speak on this foundation' \[DE WETTE\]) they may lay hold on
that which is life indeed."

[1 Timothy 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 6:20</span></span>

Recapitulatory conclusion: the main aim of the whole Epistle being here
summarily stated.

O Timothy--a personal appeal, marking at once his affection for Timothy,
and his prescience of the coming heresies.

keep--from spiritual thieves, and from enemies who will, while men
sleep, sow tares amidst the good seed sown by the Son of man.

that which is committed to thy trust--Greek, "the deposit" ([Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012), [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)). "The true" or "sound doctrine"
to be taught, as opposed to "the science falsely so called," which leads
to "error concerning the faith" ([Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021)). "It is not thine: it is
another's property with which thou hast been entrusted: Diminish it not
at all" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. "That which was entrusted to thee, not found by
thee; which thou hast received, not invented; a matter not of genius,
but of teaching; not of private usurpation, but of public tradition; a
matter brought to thee, not put forth by thee, in which thou oughtest to
be not an enlarger, but a guardian; not an originator, but a disciple;
not leading, but following. 'Keep,' saith he, 'the deposit,'; preserve
intact and inviolate the talent of the catholic faith. What has been
entrusted to thee, let that same remain with thee; let that same be
handed down by thee. Gold thou hast received, gold return. I should be
sorry thou shouldest substitute aught else. I should be sorry that for
gold thou shouldest substitute lead impudently, or brass fraudulently. I
do not want the mere appearance of gold, but its actual reality. Not
that there is to be no progress in religion in Christ's Church. Let
there be so by all means, and the greatest progress; but then let it be
real progress, not a change of the faith. Let the intelligence of the
whole Church and its individual members increase exceedingly, provided
it be only in its own kind, the doctrine being still the same. Let the
religion of the soul resemble the growth of the body,which, though it
develops its several parts in the progress of years, yet remains the
same as it was essentially" \[VINCENTIUS LIRINENSIS, A.D. 434\].

avoiding--"turning away from" (compare [Ti2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004)). Even as they have "turned away
from the truth" ([Ti1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006); [Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004)).

profane-- ([Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016)).

vain--Greek, "empty": mere "strifes of words," [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004), producing no moral fruit.

oppositions--dialectic antithesis of the false teachers \[ALFORD\].
WIESINGER, not so probably, "oppositions to the sound doctrine." I think
it likely germs existed already of the heresy of dualistic oppositions,
namely, between the good and evil principle, afterwards fully developed
in Gnosticism. Contrast Paul's just antithesis ([Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Ti1
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005); [Ti2
2:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015)).

science falsely so called--where there is not faith, there is not
knowledge \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. There was true "knowledge," a special gift of
the Spirit, which was abused by some ([Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001); [Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008); [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006)). This gift was soon
counterfeited by false teachers arrogating to themselves pre-eminently
the gift ([Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)). Hence arose the creeds of the
Church, called symbols, that is, in Greek, "watchwords," or a test
whereby the orthodox might distinguish one another in opposition to the
heretical. Perhaps here, [Ti1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020),
and [Ti2 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013), imply the existence
of some such brief formula of doctrine then existing in the Church; if
so, we see a good reason for its not being written in Scripture, which
is designed not to give dogmatic formularies, but to be the fountain
whence all such formularies are to be drawn according to the exigencies
of the several churches and ages. Probably thus a portion of the
so-called apostle's creed may have had their sanction, and been
preserved solely by tradition on this account. "The creed, handed down
from the apostles, is not written on paper and with ink, but on fleshy
tables of the heart" JEROME \[Against John of Jerusalem, 9\]. Thus, in
the creed, contrary to the "oppositions" (the germs of which probably
existed in the Church in Paul's latter days) whereby the aeons were set
off in pairs, God is stated to be "the Father Almighty," or
all-governing "maker of heaven and earth" \[BISHOP HINDS\].

[1 Timothy 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti1 6:21</span></span>

Which some professing--namely, professing these oppositions of science
falsely so called.

erred--(See on [Ti1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006); [Ti1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)) --literally, "missed the mark"
([Ti2 3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007)). True sagacity is
inseparable from faith.

Grace--Greek, "the grace," namely, of God, for which we Christians look,
and in which we stand \[ALFORD\].

be with thee--He restricts the salutation to Timothy, as the Epistle was
not to be read in public \[BENGEL\]. But the oldest manuscripts read,
"be with you"; and the "thee" may be a transcriber's alteration to
harmonize with [Ti2 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022); [Tit
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015).

Amen--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.
