### [Nahum Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md)

[Nahum 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 2:1</span></span>

THE ADVANCE OF THE DESTROYING FORCES AGAINST NINEVEH, AFTER IT WAS USED
AS GOD'S ROD FOR A TIME TO CHASTISE HIS PEOPLE: THE CAPTURE OF THAT
LION'S DWELLING, ACCORDING TO THE SURE WORD OF JEHOVAH. ([Nah
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001).md)

He that dasheth in pieces--God's "battle axe," wherewith He "breaks in
pieces" His enemies. [Jer 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020.md)
applies the same Hebrew term to Nebuchadnezzar (compare [Pro
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018.md); [Jer
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md), "the hammer of the whole
earth"). Here the Medo-Babylonian army under Cyaxares and Nabopolassar,
that destroyed Nineveh, is prophetically meant.

before thy face--before Nineveh. Openly, so that the work of God may be
manifest.

watch the way--by which the foe will attack, so as to be ready to meet
him. Ironical advice; equivalent to a prophecy, Thou shalt have need to
use all possible means of defense; but use what thou wilt, all will be
in vain.

make thy loins strong--The loins are the seat of strength; to gird them
up is to prepare all one's strength for conflict ([Job
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007).md). Also gird on thy sword ([Sa2
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008.md); [Kg2
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029).md).

[Nahum 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 2:2</span></span>

For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob--that is, the time
for Nineveh's overthrow is ripe, because Jacob (Judah) and Israel (the
ten tribes) have been sufficiently chastised. The Assyrian rod of
chastisement, having done its work, is to be thrown into the fire. If
God chastised Jacob and Israel with all their "excellency" (Jerusalem
and the temple, which was their pre-eminent excellency above all nations
in God's eyes, [Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md); [Psa
87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md); [Eze
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md); see on [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008).md), how much more will He punish
fatally Nineveh, an alien to Him, and idolatrous? MAURER, not so well,
translates, "restores," or "will restore the excellency of Jacob."

emptiers--the Assyrian spoilers.

have emptied them out--have spoiled the Israelites and Jews ([Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001).md). Compare [Psa
80:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md), on "vine branches," as
applied to Israel.

[Nahum 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 2:3</span></span>

his mighty men--the Medo-Babylonian generals mighty men attacking
Nineveh.

made red--The ancients dyed their bull's-hide shields red, partly to
strike terror into the enemy, chiefly lest the blood from wounds which
they might receive should be perceived and give confidence to the foe
\[CALVIN\]. G. V. SMITH conjectures that the reference is to the red
reflection of the sun's rays from shields of bronze or copper, such as
are found among the Assyrian remains.

in scarlet--or crimson military tunics (compare [Mat
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028).md). XENOPHON mentions that the
Medes were fond of this color. The Lydians and Tyrians extracted the dye
from a particular worm.

chariots . . . with flaming torches--that is, the chariots shall be like
flaming torches, their wheels in lightning-like rapidity of rotation
flashing light and striking sparks from the stones over which they pass
(compare [Isa 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028).md). English Version
supposes a transposition of the Hebrew letters. It is better to
translate the Hebrew as it is, "the chariots (shall be furnished) with
fire-flashing scythes" (literally, "with the fire," or glitter, of iron
weapons). Iron scythes were fixed at right angles to the axles and
turned down, or parallel to it, inserted into the felly of the wheel.
The Medes, perhaps, had such chariots, though no traces of them are
found in Assyrian remains. On account of the latter fact, it may be
better to translate, "the chariots (shall come) with the glitter of
steel weapons" \[MAURER and G. V. SMITH\].

in the day of his preparation--JEHOVAH'S ([Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md). Or, "Medo-Babylonian
commander's day of preparation for the attack" ([Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001).md). "He" confirms this, and "his" in
this verse.

the fir trees--their fir-tree lances.

terribly shaken--branded so as to strike terror. Or, "shall be tremulous
with being brandished" \[MAURER\].

[Nahum 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 2:4</span></span>

rage--are driven in furious haste ([Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009).md).

justle one against another--run to and fro \[MAURER\].

in the broad ways-- ([Ch2 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006).md). Large
open spaces in the suburbs of Nineveh.

they shall seem like torches--literally, "their (feminine in Hebrew)
appearance (is)": namely, the appearance of the broad places is like
that of torches, through the numbers of chariots in them flashing in the
sun ([Pro 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#026), Margin.md).

run like the lightnings--with rapid violence ([Mat
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md); [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).md).

[Nahum 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">nah 2:5</span></span>

The Assyrian king. The Assyrian preparations for defense.

shall recount his worthies-- ([Nah
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018).md). Review, or count over in his
mind, his nobles, choosing out the bravest to hasten to the walls and
repel the attack. But in vain; for

they shall stumble in their walk--"they shall stumble in their advance"
through fear and hurry.

the defence shall be prepared--rather, the covering machine used by
besiegers to protect themselves in advancing to the wall. Such sudden
transitions, as here from the besieged to the besiegers, are frequent
(compare [Eze 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002).md), \[MAURER\]. Or,
used by the besieged Assyrians \[CALVIN\].

[Nahum 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">nah 2:6</span></span>

The gates of the rivers . . . opened--The river wall on the Tigris (the
west defense of Nineveh) was 4,530 yards long. On the north, south, and
east sides, there were large moats, capable of being easily filled with
water from the Khosru. Traces of dams ("gates," or sluices) for
regulating the supply are still visible, so that the whole city could be
surrounded with a water barrier ([Nah
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008).md). Besides, on the east, the
weakest side, it was further protected by a lofty double rampart with a
moat two hundred feet wide between its two parts, cut in the rocky
ground. The moats or canals, flooded by the Ninevites before the siege
to repel the foe, were made a dry bed to march into the city, by the foe
turning the waters into a different channel: as Cyrus did in the siege
of Babylon \[MAURER\]. In the earlier capture of Nineveh by Arbaces the
Mede, and Belesis the Babylonian, DIODORUS SICULUS, \[1.2.80\], states
that there was an old prophecy that it should not be taken till the
river became its enemy; so in the third year of the siege, the river by
a flood broke down the walls twenty furlongs, and the king thereupon
burnt himself and his palace and all his concubines and wealth together,
and the enemy entered by the breach in the wall. Fire and water were
doubtless the means of the second destruction here foretold, as of the
first.

dissolved--by the inundation \[HENDERSON\]. Or, those in the palace
shall melt with fear, namely, the king and his nobles \[GROTIUS\].

[Nahum 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 2:7</span></span>

Huzzab--the name of the queen of Nineveh, from a Hebrew root implying
that she stood by the king ([Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md), \[VATABLUS\]. Rather, Nineveh
personified as a queen. She who had long stood in the most supreme
prosperity. Similarly CALVIN. MAURER makes it not a proper name, and
translates, "It is established," or "determined" (compare [Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032).md). English Version is more
supported by the parallelism.

led away captive--The Hebrew requires rather, "she is laid bare";
brought forth from the apartments where Eastern women remained secluded,
and is stripped of her ornamental attire. Compare [Isa
47:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md), where the same image of a
woman with face and legs exposed is used of a city captive and
dismantled (compare [Nah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005).md),
\[MAURER\].

brought up--Her people shall be made to go up to Babylon. Compare the
use of "go up" for moving from a place in [Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md).

her maids . . . as . . . doves--As Nineveh is compared to a queen
dethroned and dishonored, so she has here assigned to her in the image
handmaids attending her with dove-like plaints ([Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md); [Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md). The image implies helplessness
and grief suppressed, but at times breaking out). The minor cities and
dependencies of Nineveh may be meant, or her captive women \[JEROME\].
GROTIUS and MAURER translate, for "lead her," "moan," or "sigh."

tabering--beating on their breasts as on a tambourine.

[Nahum 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 2:8</span></span>

But--rather, "Though" \[G. V. SMITH\].

of old--rather, "from the days that she hath been"; from the earliest
period of her existence. Alluding to Nineveh's antiquity ([Gen
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#011).md). "Though Nineveh has been of
old defended by water surrounding her, yet her inhabitants shall flee
away." GROTIUS, less probably (compare [Nah
3:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md), interprets, the "waters" of
her numerous population ([Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md);
[Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015).md).

Stand, stand, shall they cry--that is, the few patriotic citizens shall
cry to their fleeing countrymen; "but none looketh back," much less
stops in flight, so panic-stricken are they.

[Nahum 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 2:9</span></span>

silver . . . gold--The conquerors are summoned to plunder the city.
Nineveh's riches arose from the annual tribute paid by so many subject
states, as well as from its extensive merchandise ([Nah
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016.md); [Eze
27:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023).md).

store--accumulated by the plunder of subject nations. It is remarkable,
that while small articles of value (bronze inlaid with gold, gems,
seals, and alabaster vases) are found in the ruins of Nineveh, there are
is none of gold and silver. These, as here foretold, were "taken for
spoil" before the palaces were set on fire.

glory out of all the pleasant furniture--or, "there is abundance of
precious vessels of every kind" \[MAURER\].

[Nahum 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">nah 2:10</span></span>

Literally, "emptiness, and emptiedness, and devastation." The
accumulation of substantives without a verb (as in [Nah
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002).md), the two first of the three being
derivatives of the same root, and like in sound, and the number of
syllables in them increasing in a kind of climax, intensify the gloomy
effectiveness of the expression. Hebrew, Bukah, Mebukah, Mebullakah
(compare [Isa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md), [Isa
24:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003.md); [Zep
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015).md).

faces of all gather blackness--(See on [Joe
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006).md). CALVIN translates, "withdraw
(literally, 'gather up') their glow," or flush, that is grow pale. This
is probably the better rendering. So MAURER.

[Nahum 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 2:11</span></span>

dwelling of . . . lions--Nineveh, the seat of empire of the rapacious
and destructive warriors of various ranks, typified by the "lions,"
"young lions," "old lion" (or lioness \[MAURER\]), "the lion's whelp."
The image is peculiarly appropriate, as lions of every form, winged, and
sometimes with the head of a man, are frequent in the Assyrian
sepulchres. It was as full of spoils of all nations as a lion's den is
of remains of its prey. The question, "Where," &c., implies that Jehovah
"would make an utter end of the place," so that its very site could not
be found ([Nah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008).md). It is a question
expressing wonder, so incredible did it then seem.

[Nahum 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 2:12</span></span>

prey . . . ravin--different kinds of prey. Compare [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md), "the stay and the staff."

[Nahum 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">nah 2:13</span></span>

burn . . . in the smoke--or (so as to pass) "into smoke," that is,
"entirely" \[MAURER\], ([Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md);
[Psa 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009).md). CALVIN, like English
Version, explains, As soon as the flame catches, and the fire smokes, by
the mere smoke I will burn her chariots.

cut off thy prey from the earth--Thou shalt no more carry off prey from
the nations of the earth.

the voice of thy messengers . . . no more . . . heard--No more shall thy
emissaries be heard throughout thy provinces conveying thy king's
commands, and exacting tribute of subject nations.
