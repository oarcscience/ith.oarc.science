### [Isaiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 10:1</span></span>

Fourth strophe. ([Isa 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001).md)

them that decree--namely, unrighteous judges.

write grievousness, &c.--not the scribes, but the magistrates who caused
unjust decisions (literally, "injustice" or "grievousness") to be
recorded by them ([Isa 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006).md)
\[MAURER\], ([Isa 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md), [Isa
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 10:2</span></span>

To turn aside, &c.--The effect of their conduct is to pervert the cause
of the needy \[HORSLEY\]. In English Version "from judgment" means "from
obtaining justice."

take away the right--"make plunder of the right" (rightful claim)
\[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 10:3</span></span>

what will ye do--what way of escape will there be for you?

visitation--of God's wrath ([Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md); [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md); [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md).

from far--from Assyria.

leave . . . glory--rather, "deposit (for safekeeping) your wealth"
\[LOWTH\]. So [Psa 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md).

[Isaiah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 10:4</span></span>

Without me--not having Me to "flee to" ([Isa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003).md).

bow down--Bereft of strength they shall fall; or else, they shall lie
down fettered.

under . . . under--rather, "among" (literally, "in the place of")
\[HORSLEY\]. The "under" may be, however, explained, "trodden under the
(feet of the) prisoners going into captivity," and "overwhelmed under
the heaps of slain on the battlefield" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 10:5</span></span>

It was written when Assyria proposed (a design which it soon after tried
to carry out under Sennacherib) to destroy Judah and Jerusalem, as it
had destroyed Samaria. This is the first part of Isaiah's prophecies
under Hezekiah. Probably between 722 and 715 B.C. (see [Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027).md). ([Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md), [Isa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011.md) show that Samaria was destroyed
before this prophecy)

O Assyrian, &c.--rather, "What, ho (but MAURER, Woe to the) Assyrian! He
is the rod and staff of Mine anger (My instrument in punishing, [Jer
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020.md); [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013).md). In their hands is Mine
indignation" \[HORSLEY, after JEROME\]. I have put into the Assyrians'
hands the execution of Mine indignation against My people.

[Isaiah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 10:6</span></span>

send him--"Kings' hearts are in the hand of the Lord" ([Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001).md).

hypocritical--polluted \[HORSLEY\].

nation--Judah, against whom Sennacherib was forming designs.

of my wrath--objects of My wrath.

give . . . charge-- ([Jer 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022).md).

and to tread, &c.--HORSLEY translates: "And then to make him (the
Assyrian) a trampling under foot like the mire of the streets" (so [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md); [Zac
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005).md). But see [Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md).

[Isaiah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 10:7</span></span>

meaneth not so--He is only thinking of his own schemes, while God is
overruling them to His purposes.

think--intend. Sinners' plans are no less culpable, though they by them
unconsciously fulfil God's designs ([Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md); [Mic
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012).md). So Joseph's brethren ([Gen
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020.md); [Pro
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004).md). The sinner's motive, not the
result (which depends on God), will be the test in judgment.

heart to destroy . . . not a few--Sennacherib's ambition was not
confined to Judea. His plan was also to conquer Egypt and Ethiopia ([Isa
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md); [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 10:8</span></span>

Vauntings of the Assyrians. Illustrated by the self-laudatory
inscriptions of Assyria deciphered by HINCKS.

princes . . . kings--Eastern satraps and governors of provinces often
had the title and diadem of kings. Hence the title, "King of kings,"
implying the greatness of Him who was over them ([Eze
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md); [Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 10:9</span></span>

Is not . . . as--Was there any one of these cities able to withstand me?
Not one. So Rab-shakeh vaunts ([Isa
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019).md).

Calno--Calneh, built by Nimrod ([Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010).md), once his capital, on the
Tigris.

Carchemish--Circesium, on the Euphrates. Taken afterwards by Necho, king
of Egypt; and retaken by Nebuchadnezzar: by the Euphrates ([Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002).md).

Hamath--in Syria, north of Canaan ([Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).md). Taken by Assyria about 753
B.C. From it colonists were planted by Assyria in Samaria.

Arpad--near Hamath.

Samaria--now overthrown.

Damascus-- ([Isa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md), [Isa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 10:10</span></span>

found--unable to resist me: hath overcome (so [Psa
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008).md).

and whose--rather, "and their." This clause, down to "Samaria," is
parenthetical.

excel--were more powerful. He regards Jerusalem as idolatrous, an
opinion which it often had given too much ground for: Jehovah was in his
view the mere local god of Judea, as Baal of the countries where it was
adored, nay, inferior in power to some national gods ([Isa
36:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019.md); [Isa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012).md). See in opposition, [Isa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#020.md); [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md).

As my hand . . . shall I not, as I have--a double protasis. Agitation
makes one accumulate sentences.

[Isaiah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 10:12</span></span>

whole work--His entire plan is regard to the punishment of the Jews
([Isa 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

Zion--the royal residence, the court, princes and nobles; as
distinguished from "Jerusalem," the people in general.

fruit--the result of, that is, the plants emanating from.

stout--Hebrew, "greatness of," that is, pride of.

glory--haughtiness.

[Isaiah 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 10:13</span></span>

I am prudent--He ascribes his success to his own prudence, not to God's
providence.

removed the bounds--set aside old, and substituted new boundaries of
kingdoms at will. A criminal act, as Jehovah Himself had appointed the
boundaries of the nations ([Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008).md).

treasures--"hoarded treasures" \[HORSLEY\].

put down . . . inhabitants like, &c.--rather, "as a valiant man, I have
brought down (from their seats) those seated" (namely, "on thrones"; as
in [Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md); [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md); [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md). The Hebrew for "He that
abideth," is He that sitteth on a throne); otherwise, "I have brought
down (as captives into Assyria, which lay lower than Judea; therefore
'brought down,' compare [Isa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md),
[Isa 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010).md), the inhabitants"
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 10:14</span></span>

nest--implying the ease with which he carried off all before him.

left--by the parent bird.

none . . . moved . . . wing--image from an angry bird resisting the
robbery of its "nest."

peeped--chirped even low ([Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md).
No resistance was offered me, of deed, or even word.

[Isaiah 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 10:15</span></span>

Shall the instrument boast against Him who uses it? Through free in a
sense, and carrying out his own plans, the Assyrian was unconsciously
carrying out God's purposes.

shaketh it--moves it back and forward.

staff . . . lift . . . itself . . . no wood--rather, "as if the staff
(man, the instrument of God's judgments on his fellow man) should set
aside (Him who is) not wood" (not a mere instrument, as man). On "no
wood" compare [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), "that which
is not God;" [Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md) shows that God
is meant here by "not wood" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 10:16</span></span>

fat ones-- ([Isa 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017).md). The robust and
choice soldiers of Assyria ([Psa
78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031.md), where "fattest" answers in the
parallelism to "chosen," or "young men," Margin).

leanness--carrying out the image on "fat ones." Destruction ([Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015).md). Fulfilled ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md).

his glory--Assyria's nobles. So in [Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md), Margin; [Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md).

kindle--a new image from fire consuming quickly dry materials ([Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 10:17</span></span>

light of Israel--carrying out the image in the end of [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md). Jehovah, who is a light to
Israel, shall be the "fire" ([Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Heb
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029).md) that shall ignite the "thorns,"
(the Assyrians, like dry fuel, a ready prey to flame).

[Isaiah 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 10:18</span></span>

glory of his forest--The common soldiers, the princes, officers, &c.,
all alike together, shall be consumed (see on [Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018).md).

in one day-- ([Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md).

fruitful field--literally, "Carmel," a rich mountain in the tribe of
Asher. Figurative for Sennacherib's mighty army. Perhaps alluding to his
own boasting words about to be uttered ([Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024).md), "I will enter the forest of
his Carmel."

soul and body--proverbial for utterly; the entire man is made up of soul
and body.

as when a standard bearer fainteth--rather, "they shall be as when a
sick man" (from a Syriac root) wastes away." Compare "leanness," that
is, wasting destruction ([Isa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016).md)
\[MAURER\]. Or, "there shall be an entire dissipation, like a perfect
melting" (namely, of the Assyrian army) \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 10:19</span></span>

rest--those who shall survive the destruction of the host.

his forest--same image as in [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md), for the once dense army.

child . . . write--so few that a child might count them.

[Isaiah 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 10:20</span></span>

The effect on the "remnant" (contrasted with the Assyrian remnant, [Isa
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#019).md); namely, those who shall be
left after the invasion of Sennacherib, will be a return from dependence
on external idolatrous nations, as Assyria and Egypt ([Kg2
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md); [Kg2
16:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md), to the God of the theocracy;
fulfilled in part in the pious Hezekiah's days; but from the future
aspect under which Paul, in [Rom
9:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md) (compare "short work" with
"whole work," [Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012), here.md),
regards the whole prophecy, the "remnant," "who stay upon the Lord,"
probably will receive their fullest realization in the portion of Jews
left after that Antichrist shall have been overthrown, who shall
"return" unto the Lord ([Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md);
[Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md); [Zac
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009.md); [Zac
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md); [Zep
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 10:21</span></span>

mighty God-- ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md) the God who
shall have evinced such might in destroying Israel's enemies. As the
Assyrians in Sennacherib's reign did not carry off Judah captive, the
returning "remnant" cannot mainly refer to this time.

[Isaiah 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 10:22</span></span>

yet--rather in the sense in which Paul quotes it ([Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027).md), "Though Israel be now numerous
as the sand, a remnant only of them shall return"--the great majority
shall perish. The reason is added, Because "the consumption (fully
completed destruction) is decreed (literally, decided on, brought to an
issue), it overfloweth ([Isa 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028.md);
[Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md) with justice"; that is, the
infliction of just punishment ([Isa
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#016).md) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 10:23</span></span>

even determined--"A consumption, and whatever is determined," or decreed
\[MAURER\].

midst--Zion, the central point of the earth as to Jehovah's presence.

land--Israel. But the Septuagint, "in the whole habitable world." So
English Version ([Rom 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028).md), "upon the
earth."

[Isaiah 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 10:24</span></span>

Therefore--Return to the main proposition, Assyria's ultimate
punishment, though employed as God's "rod" to chastise Judea for a time.

O my people--God's tenderness towards His elect nation.

after the manner of Egypt--as Egypt and Pharaoh oppressed thee.
Implying, too, as Israel was nevertheless delivered from them, so now it
would be from the Assyrian Sennacherib. The antithesis in [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md) requires this interpretation
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 10:25</span></span>

For--Be not afraid ([Isa 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024).md), for,
&c.

indignation . . . cease--The punishments of God against Israel shall be
consummated and ended ([Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md);
[Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036).md). "Till the indignation be
accomplished," &c.

mine anger--shall turn to their (the Assyrians') destruction.

[Isaiah 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 10:26</span></span>

slaughter of--"stroke upon."

Midian-- ([Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md); [Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025).md).

as his rod was upon the sea--rather, understanding "stroke" from the
previous clause, "according to the stroke of His rod upon the Red Sea"
([Exo 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md), [Exo
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#026).md). His "rod" on the Assyrian
([Isa 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md), [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026).md) stands in bold contrast to the
Assyrian used as a "rod" to strike others ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

after the manner of Egypt--as He lifted it up against Egypt at the Red
Sea.

[Isaiah 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 10:27</span></span>

his burden--the Assyrians' oppression ([Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md). Judah was still tributary to
Assyria; Hezekiah had not yet revolted, as he did in the beginning of
Sennacherib's reign.

because of-- ([Hos 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md).

the anointing--namely, "Messiah" ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md). Just as in [Isa
9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md), the "breaking of the yoke of"
the enemies' "burden and staff" is attributed to Messiah, "For unto us a
child is born," &c., so it is here. MAURER not so well translates,
"Because of the fatness"; an image of the Assyrians fierce and wanton
pride drawn from a well-fed bull tossing off the yoke ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md). So [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md) above, and [Isa
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md), "fat ones."

[Isaiah 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 10:28</span></span>

Onward gradual march of Sennacherib's army towards Jerusalem, and the
panic of the inhabitants vividly pictured before the eyes.

come to--come upon as a sudden invader ([Gen
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#027).md).

Aiath--same as Ai ([Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md); [Neh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#032).md). In the north of Benjamin; so
the other towns also; all on the line of march to Jerusalem.

Michmash--nine miles northeast of Jerusalem.

laid up . . . carriages--He has left his heavier baggage (so "carriages"
for the things carried, [Act 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015).md) at
Michmash, so as to be more lightly equipped for the siege of Jerusalem.
So [Sa1 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022.md); [Sa1

14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004).md).

lodging--their quarters for the night, after having passed the defile
which might have been easily guarded against them.

Ramah--near Geba; seven miles from Jerusalem.

Gibeah of Saul--his birthplace and residence, in Benjamin ([Sa1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004).md), distinct from Gibeah of Judah
([Jos 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#057).md).

1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md); [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021).md). "Cry aloud in consternation."

Laish--not the town in Dan ([Jdg
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007).md), but one of the same name near
Jerusalem (1 Maccabees 9:9).

Anathoth--three miles from Jerusalem in Benjamin; the birthplace of
Jeremiah. "Poor" is applied to it in pity, on account of the impending
calamity. Others translate, Answer her, O Anathoth.

that day--literally, "As yet this (one only) day (is allowed to the
soldiers) for remaining (halting for rest) at Nob"; northeast of
Jerusalem on Olivet; a town of the priests ([Neh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#032).md).

This verse and [Isa 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md) describe the
sudden arrest and overthrow of Sennacherib in the height of his success;
[Isa 10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md); [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md), [Eze
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md), &c., contain the same image;
"Lebanon" and its forest are the Assyrian army; the "iron" axe that
fells the forest refers to the stroke which destroyed the one hundred
and eighty-five thousand Assyrians ([Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md). The "Mighty One" is Jehovah
([Isa 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

From the local and temporary national deliverance the prophet passes by
the law of suggestion in an easy transition to the end of all
prophecy--the everlasting deliverance under Messiah's reign, not merely
His first coming, but chiefly His second coming. The language and
illustrations are still drawn from the temporary national subject, with
which he began, but the glories described pertain to Messiah's reign.
Hezekiah cannot, as some think, be the subject; for he was already come,
whereas the "stem of Jesse" was yet future ("shall come") (compare [Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md), &c.; [Mic
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md); [Rom
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012).md).
