### [Habakkuk Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 3:1</span></span>

HABAKKUK'S PRAYER TO GOD: GOD'S GLORIOUS REVELATION OF HIMSELF AT SINAI
AND AT GIBEON, A PLEDGE OF HIS INTERPOSING AGAIN IN BEHALF OF ISRAEL
AGAINST BABYLON, AND ALL OTHER FOES; HENCE THE PROPHET'S CONFIDENCE AMID
CALAMITIES. (Hab. 3:1-19)

prayer--the only strictly called prayers are in [Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md). But all devotional addresses to
God are called "prayers" ([Psa 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020).md).
The Hebrew is from a root "to apply to a judge for a favorable
decision." Prayers in which praises to God for deliverance, anticipated
in the sure confidence of faith, are especially calculated to enlist
Jehovah on His people's side ([Ch2
20:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), [Ch2
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026).md).

upon Shigionoth--a musical phrase, "after the manner of elegies," or
mournful odes, from an Arabic root \[LEE\]; the phrase is singular in
[Psa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md), title. More simply, from a
Hebrew root to "err," "on account of sins of ignorance." Habakkuk thus
teaches his countrymen to confess not only their more grievous sins, but
also their errors and negligences, into which they were especially
likely to fall when in exile away from the Holy Land \[CALVIN\]. So
Vulgate and AQUILA, and SYMMACHUS. "For voluntary transgressors"
\[JEROME\]. Probably the subject would regulate the kind of music.
DELITZSCH and HENDERSON translate, "With triumphal music," from the same
root "to err," implying its enthusiastic irregularity.

[Habakkuk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 3:2</span></span>

I have heard thy speech--Thy revelation to me concerning the coming
chastisement of the Jews \[CALVIN\], and the destruction of their
oppressors. This is Habakkuk's reply to God's communication \[GROTIUS\].
MAURER translates, "the report of Thy coming," literally, "Thy report."

and was afraid--reverential fear of God's judgments ([Hab
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016).md).

revive thy work--Perfect the work of delivering Thy people, and do not
let Thy promise lie as if it were dead, but give it new life by
performing it \[MENOCHIUS\]. CALVIN explains "thy work" to be Israel;
called "the work of My hands" ([Isa
45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011).md). God's elect people are
peculiarly His work ([Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md),
pre-eminently illustrating His power, wisdom, and goodness. "Though we
seem, as it were, dead nationally, revive us" ([Psa
85:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006).md). However ([Psa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009).md), where "the work of God" refers
to His judgment on their enemies, favors the former view ([Psa
90:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016.md); [Isa
51:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md).

in the midst of the years--namely, of calamity in which we live. Now
that our calamities are at their height; during our seventy years'
captivity. CALVIN more fancifully explains it, in the midst of the years
of Thy people, extending from Abraham to Messiah; if they be cut off
before His coming, they will be cut off as it were in the midst of their
years, before attaining their maturity. So BENGEL makes the midst of the
years to be the middle point of the years of the world. There is a
strikingly similar phrase ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).md),
In the midst of the week. The parallel clause, "in wrath" (that is, in
the midst of wrath), however, shows that "in the midst of the years"
means "in the years of our present exile and calamity."

make known--Made it (Thy work) known by experimental proof; show in very
deed, that this is Thy work.

[Habakkuk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 3:3</span></span>

God--singular in the Hebrew, "Eloah," instead of "Elohim," plural,
usually employed. The singular is not found in any other of the minor
prophets, or Jeremiah, or Ezekiel; but it is in Isaiah, Daniel, Job, and
Deuteronomy.

from Teman--the country south of Judea and near Edom, in which latter
country Mount Paran was situated \[HENDERSON\]. "Paran" is the desert
region, extending from the south of Judah to Sinai. Seir, Sinai, and
Paran are adjacent to one another, and are hence associated together, in
respect to God's giving of the law ([Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002).md). Teman is so identified with
Seir or Edom, as here to be substituted for it. Habakkuk appeals to
God's glorious manifestations to His people at Sinai, as the ground for
praying that God will "revive His work" ([Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002).md) now. For He is the same God now
as ever.

Selah--a musical sign, put at the close of sections and strophes, always
at the end of a verse, except thrice; namely, here, and [Hab
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md), and [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md); [Psa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md), where, however, it closes the
hemistich. It implies a change of the modulation. It comes from a root
to "rest" or "pause" \[GESENIUS\]; implying a cessation of the chant,
during an instrumental interlude. The solemn pause here prepares the
mind for contemplating the glorious description of Jehovah's
manifestation which follows.

earth . . . full of his praise--that is, of His glories which were
calculated to call forth universal praise; the parallelism to "glory"
proves this to be the sense.

[Habakkuk 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 3:4</span></span>

as the light--namely, of the sun ([Job
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md); [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md).

horns--the emblem of power wielded by "His hand" \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].
"Rays" emanating from "His hand," compared by the Arabs to the horns of
the gazelle (compare "hind of the morning," [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001), title, Margin.md). The Hebrew verb
for to "emit rays," is from the root meaning "horns" ([Exo
34:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029.md), [Exo
34:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035).md) \[GROTIUS\]. The rays are His
lightnings ([Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008).md), \[MAURER\].

there--in that "brightness." In it, notwithstanding its brilliancy,
there was but the veil "(the hiding) of His power." Even "light," God's
"garment," covers, instead of revealing fully, His surpassing glory
([Psa 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md) \[HENDERSON\]. Or, on
Mount Sinai \[DRUSIUS\]. (Compare [Exo
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017).md). The Septuagint and Syriac
versions read for "there," He made a hiding, &c.; He hid Himself with
clouds. English Version is better, which CALVIN explains, there is said
to be "a hiding of God's power," because God did not reveal it
indiscriminately to all, but specially to His people ([Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020).md). The contrast seems to me to be
between the "horns" or emanations out of His power ("hand"), and that
"power" itself. The latter was hidden, whereas the "horns" or emanations
alone were manifested. If the mere scintillations were so awfully
overwhelming, how much more so the hidden power itself! This was
especially true of His manifestation at Sinai ([Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); compare [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md), [Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017).md).

[Habakkuk 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 3:5</span></span>

pestilence--to destroy His people's foes ([Sa1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#009.md), [Sa1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011).md). As Jehovah's advent is glorious
to His people, so it is terrible to His foes.

burning coals-- [Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md) favors
English Version. But the parallelism requires, as the Margin translates,
"burning disease" (compare [Deu 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024.md);
[Psa 91:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#006).md).

went . . . at his feet--that is, after Him, as His attendants ([Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010).md).

[Habakkuk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 3:6</span></span>

He stood, and measured the earth--Jehovah, in His advance, is
represented as stopping suddenly, and measuring the earth with His
all-seeing glance, whereat there is universal consternation. MAURER,
from a different root, translates, "rocked the earth"; which answers
better to the parallel "drove asunder"; the Hebrew for which latter,
however, may be better translated, "made to tremble."

everlasting mountains--which have ever been remembered as retaining the
same place and form from the foundation of the world.

did bow--as it were, in reverent submission.

his ways are everlasting--His marvellous ways of working for the
salvation of His people mark His everlasting character: such as He was
in His workings for them formerly, such shall He be now.

[Habakkuk 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 3:7</span></span>

the tents--that is, the dwellers.

Cushan--the same as Cush; made "Cush-an" to harmonize with "Midi-an" in
the parallel clause. So Lotan is found in the Hebrew of Genesis for Lot.
BOCHART therefore considers it equivalent to Midian, or a part of
Arabia. So in [Num 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md), Moses'
Midianite wife is called an Ethiopian (Hebrew, Cushite). MAURER thinks
the dwellers on both sides of the Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea, are meant;
for in [Hab 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md) God's everlasting or
ancient ways of delivering His people are mentioned; and in [Hab
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008.md), the dividing of the Red Sea for
them. Compare Miriam's song as to the fear of Israel's foes far and near
caused thereby ([Exo 15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014).md). Hebrew
expositors refer it to Chushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, or
Syria, the first oppressor of Israel ([Jdg
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md), [Jdg
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010).md), from whom Othniel delivered
them. Thus the second hemistich of the verse will refer to the
deliverance of Israel from Midian by Gideon (Jdg. 6:1-7:25) to which
[Hab 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md) plainly refers. Whichever of
these views be correct, the general reference is to God's interpositions
against Israel's foes of old.

in affliction--rather, "under affliction" (regarded) as a heavy burden.
Literally, "vanity" or "iniquity," hence the punishment of it (compare
[Num 25:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#017).md).

curtains--the coverings of their tents; the shifting habitations of the
nomad tribes, which resembled the modern Bedouins.

tremble--namely, at Jehovah's terrible interposition for Israel against
them.

[Habakkuk 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 3:8</span></span>

Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?--"Was the cause of His
dividing the Red Sea and Jordan His displeasure against these waters?"
The answer to this is tacitly implied in "Thy chariots of salvation."
"Nay; it was not displeasure against the waters, but His pleasure in
interposing for His people's salvation" (compare [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010).md).

thy chariots--in antithesis to Thy foe, Pharaoh's chariots," which,
notwithstanding their power and numbers, were engulfed in the waters of
destruction. God can make the most unlikely means work for His people's
salvation ([Exo 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md), [Exo
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009.md), [Exo
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023.md), [Exo
14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md); [Exo
15:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md), [Exo
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#019).md). Jehovah's chariots are His
angels ([Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017).md), or the cherubim,
or the ark ([Jos 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#013.md); [Jos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#007.md); compare [Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009).md).

[Habakkuk 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 3:9</span></span>

bow . . . made . . . naked--that is, was drawn forth from its cover, in
which bows usually were cased when not in use. Compare [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md), "Kir uncovered the shield."

according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word--that is, Thy oaths
of promise to the tribes of Israel ([Psa
77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008.md); [Luk
1:73-74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#073).md). Habakkuk shows that God's
miraculous interpositions for His people were not limited to one time,
but that God's oaths to His people are sure ground for their always
expecting them. The mention of the tribes, rather than Abraham or Moses,
is in order that they may not doubt that to them belongs this grace of
which Abraham was the depository \[CALVIN and JEROME\]. MAURER
translates, "The spears were glutted with blood, the triumphal song!"
that is, no sooner did Jehovah begin the battle by baring His bow, than
the spears were glutted with blood and the triumphal song sung.

Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers--the result of the earthquake
caused by God's approach \[MAURER\]. GROTIUS refers it to the bringing
forth water from the rock ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md);
[Num 20:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md); [Psa
78:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md); [Psa
105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004).md). But the context implies not
the giving of water to His people to drink, but the fearful physical
phenomena attending Jehovah's attack on Israel's foes.

[Habakkuk 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 3:10</span></span>

The mountains--repetition with increased emphasis of some of the
tremendous phenomena mentioned in [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md).

overflowing of the water passed by--namely, of the Red Sea; and again,
of the Jordan. God marked His favor to His people in all the elements,
causing every obstacle, whether mountains or waters, which impeded their
progress, to "pass away" \[CALVIN\]. MAURER, not so well, translates,
"torrents (rains) of water rush down."

lifted . . . hands on high--namely, its billows lifted on high by the
tempest. Personification. As men signify by voice or gesture of hand
that they will do what they are commanded, so these parts of nature
testified their obedience to God's will ([Exo
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022.md); [Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md); [Psa
77:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017.md); [Psa
114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004).md).

[Habakkuk 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 3:11</span></span>

sun . . . moon stood still--at Joshua's command ([Jos
10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md). MAURER wrongly translates,
"stand" (withdrawn, or hidden from view, by the clouds which covered the
sky during the thunders).

light of thine arrows--hail mixed with lightnings ([Jos
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010).md).

they went--The sun and moon "went," not as always heretofore, but
according to the light and direction of Jehovah's arrows, namely, His
lightnings hurled in defense of His people; astonished at these they
stood still \[CALVIN\]. MAURER translates, "At the light of Thine arrows
(which) went" or flew.

[Habakkuk 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 3:12</span></span>

march--implying Jehovah's majestic and irresistible progress before His
people ([Jdg 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md); [Psa
68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007).md). Israel would not have dared to
attack the nations, unless Jehovah had gone before.

thresh-- ([Mic 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013).md).

[Habakkuk 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 3:13</span></span>

with thine anointed--with Messiah; of whom Moses, Joshua, and David,
God's anointed leaders of Israel, were the types ([Psa
89:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019.md), [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038).md). God from the beginning
delivered His people in person, or by the hand of a Mediator ([Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011).md). Thus Habakkuk confirms
believers in the hope of their deliverance, as well because God is
always the same, as also because the same anointed Mediator is ready now
to fulfil God's will and interpose for Israel, as of old \[CALVIN\].
MAURER translates to suit the parallelism, "for salvation to Thine
anointed," namely, Israel's king in the abstract, answering to the
"people" in the former clause (compare [Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md); [Lam
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020).md). Or Israel is meant, the
anointed, that is, consecrated people of Jehovah ([Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015).md).

woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked--probably an allusion
to [Psa 68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md). Each head person sprung
from and belonging to the house of Israel's wicked foes; such as Jabin,
whose city Hazor was "the head of all the kingdoms" of Canaan ([Jos
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#010.md); compare [Jdg
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md), [Jdg
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#013).md).

discovering the foundation--Thou destroyedst high and low. As "the head
of the house" means the prince, so the "foundation" means the general
host of the enemy.

unto the neck--image from a flood reaching to the neck ([Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md); [Isa
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028).md). So God, by His wrath
overflowing on the foe, caused their princes' necks to be trodden under
foot by Israel's leaders ([Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md);
[Jos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md), [Jos
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#012).md).

[Habakkuk 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 3:14</span></span>

strike . . . with his staves--with the "wicked" ([Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md) foe's own sword (MAURER
translates, "spears") ([Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022).md).

head of his villages--Not only kings were overthrown by God's hand, but
His vengeance passed through the foe's villages and dependencies. A just
retribution, as the foe had made "the inhabitants of Israel's villages
to cease" ([Jdg 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007).md). GROTIUS
translates, "of his warriors"; GESENIUS, "the chief of his captains."

to scatter me--Israel, with whom Habakkuk identifies himself (compare
[Hab 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md).

rejoicing . . . to devour the poor secretly--"The poor" means the
Israelites, for whom in their helpless state the foe lurks in his lair,
like a wild beast, to pounce on and devour ([Psa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009.md); [Psa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012).md).

[Habakkuk 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 3:15</span></span>

Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses-- ([Hab
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008).md). No obstacle could prevent Thy
progress when leading Thy people in safety to their inheritance, whether
the Red Sea, Jordan, or the figurative waves of foes raging against
Israel ([Psa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007.md); [Psa
77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019).md).

[Habakkuk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 3:16</span></span>

When I heard . . . trembled--namely, at the judgments which God had
declared (Hab. 1:1-17) were to be inflicted on Judea by the Chaldeans.

belly--The bowels were thought by the Hebrews to be the seat of yearning
compassion ([Jer 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md). Or "heard"
may refer to [Hab 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md), "When I heard
as to Jehovah's coming interposition for Israel against the Chaldeans
being still at some distance" ([Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md); so also the voice" \[MAURER\].

at the voice--of the divine threatenings ([Hab
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006).md). The faithful tremble at the
voice alone of God before He inflicts punishment. Habakkuk speaks in the
person of all the faithful in Israel.

trembled in myself--that is, I trembled all over \[GROTIUS\].

that I might rest in the day of trouble--The true and only path to rest
is through such fear. Whoever is securely torpid and hardened towards
God, will be tumultuously agitated in the day of affliction, and so will
bring on himself a worse destruction; but he who in time meets God's
wrath and trembles at His threats, prepares the best rest for himself in
the day of affliction \[CALVIN\]. HENDERSON translates, "Yet I shall
have rest." Habakkuk thus consoling his mind, Though trembling at the
calamity coming, yet I shall have rest in God ([Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003).md). But that sentiment does not
seem to be directly asserted till [Hab
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md), as the words following at the
close of this verse imply.

when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade--rather (as English
Version is a mere truism), connected with the preceding clause, "that I
might rest . . . when he (the Chaldean foe) cometh up unto the people
(the Jews), that he may cut them off" \[CALVIN\]. The Hebrew for
"invade" means, to rush upon, or to attack and cut off with congregated

[Habakkuk 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 3:17</span></span>

Destroy the "vines" and "fig trees" of the carnal heart, and his mirth
ceases. But those who when full enjoyed God in all, when emptied can
enjoy all in God. They can sit down upon the heap of ruined creature
comforts, and rejoice in Him as the "God of their salvation." Running in
the way of His commandments, we outrun our troubles. Thus Habakkuk,
beginning his prayer with trembling, ends it with a song of triumph
([Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md); [Psa
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md); [Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md), [Psa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005).md).

labour of the olive--that is, the fruit expected from the olive.

fail--literally, "lie," that is, disappoint the hope ([Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011), Margin.md).

fields--from a Hebrew root meaning "to be yellow"; as they look at
harvest-time.

meat--food, grain.

cut off--that is, cease.

[Habakkuk 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hab 3:18</span></span>

yet I will rejoice--The prophet speaks in the name of his people.

[Habakkuk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hab 3:19</span></span>

hinds' feet . . . walk upon . . . high places--Habakkuk has here before
his mind [Psa 18:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md); [Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013). "Hinds' (gazelles'.md) feet" imply
the swiftness with which God enables him (the prophet and his people) to
escape from his enemies, and return to his native land. The "high
places" are called "mine," to imply that Israel shall be restored to his
own land, a land of hills which are places of safety and of eminence
(compare [Gen 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md); [Mat
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016).md). Probably not only the safety,
but the moral elevation, of Israel above all the lands of the earth is
implied ([Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md).

on my stringed instruments--neginoth. This is the prophet's direction to
the precentor ("chief singer") as to how the preceding ode (Hab. 3:1-19)
is to be performed (compare [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md);
[Psa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001), titles.md). The prophet had in
mind a certain form of stringed instrument adapted to certain numbers
and measures. This formula at the end of the ode, directing the kind of
instrument to be used, agrees with that in the beginning of it, which
directs the kind of melody (compare [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020).md).
