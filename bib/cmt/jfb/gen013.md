### [Genesis Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 13:1</span></span>

RETURN FROM EGYPT. (Gen. 13:1-18)

went up . . . south--Palestine being a highland country, the entrance
from Egypt by its southern boundary is a continual ascent.

[Genesis 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 13:2</span></span>

very rich--compared with the pastoral tribes to which Abraham belonged.
An Arab sheik is considered rich who has a hundred or two hundred tents,
from sixty to a hundred camels, a thousand sheep and goats respectively.
And Abram being very rich, must have far exceeded that amount of
pastoral property. "Gold and silver" being rare among these peoples, his
probably arose from the sale of his produce in Egypt.

[Genesis 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 13:3</span></span>

went on his journeys--His progress would be by slow marches and frequent
encampments as Abram had to regulate his movements by the prospect of
water and pasturage.

unto the place . . . between Beth-el and Hai--"a conspicuous hill--its
topmost summit resting on the rocky slopes below, and distinguished by
its olive groves--offering a natural base for the altar and a fitting
shade for the tent of the patriarch" \[STANLEY\].

[Genesis 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 13:4</span></span>

there Abram called on the name of the Lord--He felt a strong desire to
reanimate his faith and piety on the scene of his former worship: it
might be to express humility and penitence for his misconduct in Egypt
or thankfulness for deliverance from perils--to embrace the first
opportunity on returning to Canaan of leading his family to renew
allegiance to God and offer the typical sacrifices which pointed to the
blessings of the promise.

[Genesis 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 13:7</span></span>

And there was a strife--Abraham's character appears here in a most
amiable light. Having a strong sense of religion, he was afraid of doing
anything that might tend to injure its character or bring discredit on
its name, and he rightly judged that such unhappy effects would be
produced if two persons whom nature and grace had so closely connected
should come to a rupture \[[Gen
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#008.md)\]. Waiving his right to dictate,
he gave the freedom of choice to Lot. The conduct of Abraham was not
only disinterested and peaceable, but generous and condescending in an
extraordinary degree, exemplifying the Scripture precepts ([Mat
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032.md); [Rom
12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004).md).

[Genesis 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 13:10</span></span>

Lot lifted up his eyes--Travellers say that from the top of this hill, a
little "to the east of Beth-el" \[[Gen
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)\], they can see the Jordan, the
broad meadows on either bank, and the waving line of verdure which marks
the course of the stream.

[Genesis 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 13:11</span></span>

Then Lot chose him all the plain--a choice excellent from a worldly
point of view, but most inexpedient for his best interests. He seems,
though a good man, to have been too much under the influence of a
selfish and covetous spirit: and how many, alas! imperil the good of
their souls for the prospect of worldly advantage.

[Genesis 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 13:14</span></span>

Lift up now thine eyes . . . all the land which thou seest--So extensive
a survey of the country, in all directions, can be obtained from no
other point in the neighborhood; and those plains and hills, then lying
desolate before the eyes of the solitary patriarch, were to be peopled
with a mighty nation "like the dust of the earth in number," as they
were in Solomon's time ([Kg1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020).md).

[Genesis 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 13:18</span></span>

the plain of Mamre . . . built . . . an altar--the renewal of the
promise was acknowledged by Abram by a fresh tribute of devout
gratitude.
