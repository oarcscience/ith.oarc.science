Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 64:1</span></span>

TRANSITION FROM COMPLAINT TO PRAYER. ([Isa
64:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001).md)

rend . . . heavens--bursting forth to execute vengeance, suddenly
descending on Thy people's foe ([Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md); [Psa
144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md); [Hab
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005).md).

flow down-- ([Jdg 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 64:2</span></span>

Oh, that Thy wrath would consume Thy foes as the fire. Rather, "as the
fire burneth the dry brushwood" \[GESENIUS\].

[Isaiah 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 64:3</span></span>

When--Supply from [Isa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md), "As
when."

terrible things-- ([Psa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md).

we looked not for--far exceeding the expectation of any of our nation;
unparalleled before ([Exo 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010.md); [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008).md).

camest down--on Mount Sinai.

mountains flowed--Repeated from [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md); they pray God to do the very
same things for Israel now as in former ages. GESENIUS, instead of
"flowed" here, and "flow" in [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md), translates from a different
Hebrew root, "quake . . . quaked"; but "fire" melts and causes to flow,
rather than to quake ([Isa 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 64:4</span></span>

perceived by the ear--Paul ([Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md)
has for this, "nor have entered into the heart of man"; the virtual
sense, sanctioned by his inspired authority; men might hear with the
outward ear, but they could only by the Spirit "perceive" with the
"heart" the spiritual significancy of God's acts, both those in relation
to Israel, primarily referred to here, and those relating to the Gospel
secondarily, which Paul refers to.

O God . . . what he . . . prepared--rather, "nor hath eye seen a god
beside thee who doeth such things." They refer to God's past marvellous
acts in behalf of Israel as a plea for His now interposing for His
people; but the Spirit, as Paul by inspiration shows, contemplated
further God's revelation in the Gospel, which abounds in marvellous
paradoxes never before heard of by carnal ear, not to be understood by
mere human sagacity, and when foretold by the prophets not fully
perceived or credited; and even after the manifestation of Christ not to
be understood save through the inward teaching of the Holy Ghost. These
are partly past and present, and partly future; therefore Paul
substitutes "prepared" for "doeth," though his context shows he includes
all three. For "waiteth" he has "love Him"; godly waiting on Him must
flow from love, and not mere fear.

[Isaiah 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 64:5</span></span>

meetest--that is, Thou makest peace, or enterest into covenant with him
(see on [Isa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003).md).

rejoiceth and worketh--that is, who with joyful willingness worketh
\[GESENIUS\] ([Act 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md).

those--Thou meetest "those," in apposition to "him" who represents a
class whose characteristics "those that," &c., more fully describes.

remember thee in thy ways-- ([Isa
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008).md).

sinned--literally, "tripped," carrying on the figure in "ways."

in those is continuance--a plea to deprecate the continuance of God's
wrath; it is not in Thy wrath that there is continuance ([Isa
54:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md); [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md); [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009)), but in Thy ways ("those".md),
namely, of covenant mercy to Thy people ([Mic
7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md); on the strength of the
everlasting continuance of His covenant they infer by faith, "we shall
be saved." God "remembered" for them His covenant ([Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045).md), though they often "remembered
not" Him ([Psa 78:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#042).md). CASTELLIO
translates, "we have sinned for long in them ('thy ways'), and could we
then be saved?" But they hardly would use such a plea when their very
object was to be saved.

[Isaiah 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 64:6</span></span>

unclean thing--legally unclean, as a leper. True of Israel, everywhere
now cut off by unbelief and by God's judgments from the congregation of
the saints.

righteousness--plural, "uncleanness" extended to every particular act of
theirs, even to their prayers and praises. True of the best doings of
the unregenerate ([Phi 3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md); [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006).md).

filthy rags--literally, a "menstruous rag" ([Lev
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#033.md); [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018.md); [Lam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017).md).

fade . . . leaf-- ([Psa 90:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 64:7</span></span>

stirreth--rouseth himself from spiritual drowsiness.

take hold-- ([Isa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 64:8</span></span>

father-- ([Isa 63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016).md).

clay . . . potter-- ([Isa 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md); [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md). Unable to mould themselves
aright, they beg the sovereign will of God to mould them unto salvation,
even as He made them at the first, and is their "Father."

[Isaiah 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 64:9</span></span>

([Psa 74:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md).

we are . . . thy people-- ([Jer 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md),
[Jer 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 64:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 64:10</span></span>

holy cities--No city but Jerusalem is called "the holy city" ([Isa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md); the plural, therefore, refers
to the upper and the lower parts of the same city Jerusalem
\[VITRINGA\]; or all Judea was holy to God, so its cities were deemed
"holy" \[MAURER\]. But the parallelism favors VITRINGA. Zion and
Jerusalem (the one city) answering to "holy cities."

[Isaiah 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 64:11</span></span>

house--the temple.

beautiful--includes the idea of glorious ([Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md); [Act
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002).md).

burned-- ([Psa 74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md); [Lam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md); [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019).md). Its destruction under
Nebuchadnezzar prefigured that under Titus.

pleasant things--Hebrew, "objects of desire"; our homes, our city, and
all its dear associations.

[Isaiah 64:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 64:12</span></span>

for these things--Wilt Thou, notwithstanding these calamities of Thy
people, still refuse Thy aid ([Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014).md)?

In [Isa 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md), their plea was, "we are
all Thy people." In answer, God declares that others (Gentiles) would be
taken into covenant with Him, while His ancient people would be
rejected. The Jews were slow to believe this; hence Paul says ([Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020).md) that Isaiah was "very bold" in
advancing so unpopular a sentiment; he implies what Paul states ([Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Rom
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006); Rom. 11:1-31.md), that "they are
not all (in opposition to the Jews' plea, [Isa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009).md) Israel which are of Israel."
God's reason for so severely dealing with Israel is not changeableness
in Him, but sin in them ([Isa 65:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002).md).
Yet the whole nation shall not be destroyed, but only the wicked; a
remnant shall be saved ([Isa 65:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008).md).
There shall be, finally, universal blessedness to Israel, such as they
had prayed for ([Isa 65:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).md).
