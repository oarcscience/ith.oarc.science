[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 1:1</span></span>

MOAB REBELS. ([Kg2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001).md)

Then Moab rebelled--Subdued by David ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002).md), they had, in the partition of
Israel and Judah, fallen to the share of the former kingdom. But they
took advantage of the death of Ahab to shake off the yoke (see on [Kg2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006).md). The casualty that befell Ahaziah
\[[Kg2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md)\] prevented his taking
active measures for suppressing this revolt, which was accomplished as a
providential judgment on the house of Ahab for all these crimes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 1:2</span></span>

AHAZIAH'S JUDGMENT BY ELIJAH. ([Kg2
1:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002).md)

Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber--This lattice
was either a part of the wooden parapet, or fence, which surrounds the
flat roofs of houses, and over which the king was carelessly leaning
when it gave way; or it might be an opening like a skylight in the roof
itself, done over with lattice-work, which, being slender or rotten, the
king stepped on and slipped through. This latter supposition is most
probably the true one, as Ahaziah did not fall either into the street or
the court, but "in his upper chamber."

inquire of Baalzebub--Anxious to learn whether he should recover from
the effects of this severe fall, he sent to consult Baalzebub, that is,
the god of flies, who was considered the patron deity of medicine. A
temple to that idol was erected at Ekron, which was resorted to far and
wide, though it afterwards led to the destruction of the place ([Zac
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md); [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md); [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004).md). "After visiting Ekron, 'the god
of flies' is a name that gives me no surprise. The flies there swarmed,
in fact so innumerably, that I could hardly get any food without these
troublesome insects getting into it" \[VAN DE VELDE\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 1:3</span></span>

the angel of the Lord--not an angel, but the angel, who carried on all
communications between the invisible God and His chosen people
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. This angel commissioned Elijah to meet the king's
messengers, to stop them peremptorily on the idolatrous errand, and
convey by them to the king information of his approaching death. This
consultation of an idol, being a breach of the fundamental law of the
kingdom ([Exo 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md); [Deu
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#007).md), was a daring and deliberate
rejection of the national religion. The Lord, in making this
announcement of his death, designed that he should see in that event a
judgment for his idolatry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 1:4</span></span>

Thou shalt not come down from that bed--On being taken up, he had
probably been laid on the divan--a raised frame, about three feet broad,
extended along the sides of a room, covered with cushions and
mattresses--serving, in short, as a sofa by day and a bed by night, and
ascended by steps.

Elijah departed--to his ordinary abode, which was then at Mount Carmel
([Kg2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#025.md); [Kg1
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 1:5</span></span>

the messengers turned back--They did not know the stranger; but his
authoritative tone, commanding attitude, and affecting message
determined them at once to return.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 1:8</span></span>

an hairy man--This was the description not of his person, as in the case
of Esau, but of his dress, which consisted either of unwrought sheep or
goatskins ([Heb 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037).md), or of camel's
haircloth--the coarser manufacture of this material like our rough
haircloth. The Dervishes and Bedouins are attired in this wild, uncouth
manner, while their hair flows loose on the head, their shaggy cloak is
thrown over their shoulders and tied in front on the breast, naked,
except at the waist, round which is a skin girdle--a broad, rough
leathern belt. Similar to this was the girdle of the prophets, as in
keeping with their coarse garments and their stern, uncompromising
office.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 1:9</span></span>

ELIJAH BRINGS FIRE FROM HEAVEN ON AHAZIAH'S MESSENGERS. ([Kg2
1:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009).md)

Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty--Any appearance of
cruelty that there is in the fate of the two captains and their men will
be removed, on a full consideration of the circumstances. God being the
King of Israel, Ahaziah was bound to govern the kingdom according to the
divine law; to apprehend the Lord's prophet, for discharging a commanded
duty, was that of an impious and notorious rebel. The captains abetted
the king in his rebellion; and they exceeded their military duty by
contemptuous insults.

man of God--In using this term, they either spoke derisively, believing
him to be no true prophet; or, if they regarded him as a true prophet,
the summons to him to surrender himself bound to the king was a still
more flagrant insult; the language of the second captain being worse
than that of the first.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 1:10</span></span>

let fire come down--rather, "fire shall come down." Not to avenge a
personal insult of Elijah, but an insult upon God in the person of His
prophet; and the punishment was inflicted, not by the prophet, but by
the direct hand of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 1:15</span></span>

he arose, and went down with him--a marvellous instance of faith and
obedience. Though he well knew how obnoxious his presence was to the
king, yet, on receiving God's command, he goes unhesitatingly, and
repeats, with his own lips, the unwelcome tidings conveyed by the
messengers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 1:17</span></span>

AHAZIAH DIES, AND IS SUCCEEDED BY JEHORAM. ([Kg2
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017).md)

Jehoram--The brother of Ahaziah (see on [Kg2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001).md).
