Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 18:2</span></span>

GOD, AS THE SOLE SOVEREIGN, HAS AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DEAL WITH NATIONS
ACCORDING TO THEIR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM; ILLUSTRATED IN A TANGIBLE FORM
BY THE POTTER'S MOULDING OF VESSELS FROM CLAY. (Jer. 18:1-23)

go down--namely, from the high ground on which the temple stood, near
which Jeremiah exercised his prophetic office, to the low ground, where
some well-known (this is the force of "the") potter had his workshop.

[Jeremiah 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 18:3</span></span>

wheels--literally, "on both stones." The potter's horizontal lathe
consisted of two round plates, the lower one larger, the upper smaller;
of stone originally, but afterwards of wood. On the upper the potter
moulded the clay into what shapes he pleased. They are found represented
in Egyptian remains. In [Exo 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016)
alone is the Hebrew word found elsewhere, but in a different sense.

[Jeremiah 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 18:4</span></span>

marred--spoiled. "Of clay" is the true reading, which was corrupted into
"as clay" (Margin), through the similarity of the two Hebrew letters,
and from [Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006), "as the clay."

[Jeremiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 18:6</span></span>

Refuting the Jews' reliance on their external privileges as God's elect
people, as if God could never cast them off. But if the potter, a mere
creature, has power to throw away a marred vessel and raise up other
clay from the ground, a fortiori God, the Creator, can east away the
people who prove unfaithful to His election and can raise others in
their stead (compare [Isa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009); [Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008); [Rom
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)). It is curious that the
potter's field should have been the purchase made with the price of
Judas' treachery ([Mat 27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009) : a
potter's vessel dashed to pieces, compare [Psa
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027)), because of its failing to
answer the maker's design, being the very image to depict God's
sovereign power to give reprobates to destruction, not by caprice, but
in the exercise of His righteous judgment. Matthew quotes Zechariah's
words ([Zac 11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012)) as Jeremiah's
because the latter (Jer. 18:1-19:15) was the source from which the
former derived his summary in [Zac
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012) \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Jeremiah 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 18:7</span></span>

At what instant--in a moment, when the nation least expects it. Hereby
he reminds the Jews how marvellously God had delivered them from their
original degradation, that is, In one and the same day ye were the most
wretched, and then the most favored of all people \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 18:8</span></span>

their evil--in antithesis to, "the evil that I thought to do."

repent--God herein adapts Himself to human conceptions. The change is
not in God, but in the circumstances which regulate God's dealings: just
as we say the land recedes from us when we sail forth, whereas it is we
who recede from the land ([Eze 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021);
[Eze 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011)). God's unchangeable
principle is to do the best that can be done under all circumstances; if
then He did not take into account the moral change in His people (their
prayers, &c.), He would not be acting according to His own unchanging
principle ([Jer 18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009)). This is
applied practically to the Jews' case ([Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011); see [Jer
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003); [Jon
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 18:11</span></span>

frame evil--alluding to the preceding image of "the potter," that is, I,
Jehovah, am now as it were the potter framing evil against you; but in
the event of your repenting, it is in My power to frame anew My course
of dealing towards you.

return, &c.-- ([Kg2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 18:12</span></span>

no hope--Thy threats and exhortations are all thrown away ([Jer
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025)). Our case is desperate; we are
hopelessly abandoned to our sins and their penalty. In this and the
following clauses, "We will walk after our own devices," Jeremiah makes
them express the real state of the case, rather than the hypocritical
subterfuges which they would have been inclined to put forth. So [Isa
30:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010).

[Jeremiah 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 18:13</span></span>

([Jer 2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010)). Even among the heathen
it was a thing unheard of, that a nation should lay aside its gods for
foreign gods, though their gods are false gods. But Israel forsook the
true God for foreign false gods.

virgin of Israel-- ([Kg2 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021)). It
enhances their guilt, that Israel was the virgin whom God had specially
betrothed to Him.

horrible thing-- ([Jer 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030)).

[Jeremiah 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 18:14</span></span>

Is there any man (living near it) who would leave the snow of Lebanon
(that is, the cool melted snow water of Lebanon, as he presently
explains), which cometh from the rock of the field (a poetical name for
Lebanon, which towers aloft above the surrounding field, or
comparatively plain country)? None. Yet Israel forsakes Jehovah, the
living fountain close at hand, for foreign broken cisterns. [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013); [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013), accord with English Version
here. MAURER translates, "Shall the snow of Lebanon cease from the rock
to water (literally, 'forsake') My fields" (the whole land around being
peculiarly Jehovah's)? Lebanon means the "white mountain"; so called
from the perpetual snow which covers that part called Hermon, stretching
northeast of Palestine.

that come from another place--that come from far, namely, from the
distant lofty rocks of Lebanon. HENDERSON translates, "the compressed
waters," namely, contracted within a narrow channel while descending
through the gorges of the rocks; "flowing" may in this view be rather
"flowing down" ([Sol 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015)). But the
parallelism in English Version is better, "which cometh from the rock,"
"that cometh from another place."

be forsaken--answering to the parallel, "Will a man leave," &c. MAURER
translates, "dry up," or "fail" ([Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005)); the sense thus being, Will
nature ever turn aside from its fixed course? The "cold waters" (compare
[Pro 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025)) refer to the perennial
streams, fed from the partial melting of the snow in the hot weather.

[Jeremiah 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 18:15</span></span>

Because--rather, "And yet"; in defiance of the natural order of things.

forgotten me-- ([Jer 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032)). This
implies a previous knowledge of God, whereas He was unknown to the
Gentiles; the Jews' forgetting of God, therefore, arose from determined
perversity.

they have caused . . . to stumble--namely the false prophets and
idolatrous priests have.

ancient paths-- ([Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016)): the paths
which their pious ancestors trod. Not antiquity indiscriminately, but
the example of the fathers who trod the right way, is here commended.

them--the Jews.

not cast up--not duly prepared: referring to the raised center of the
road. CALVIN translates, "not trodden." They had no precedent of former
saints to induce them to devise for themselves a new worship.

[Jeremiah 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 18:16</span></span>

hissing-- ([Kg1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)). In sign of
contempt. That which was to be only the event is ascribed to the purpose
of the people, although altogether different from what they would have
been likely to hope for. Their purpose is represented as being the
destruction of their country, because it was the inevitable result of
their course of acting.

wag . . . head--in mockery ([Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021); [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039)). As "wag . . . head" answers to
"hissing," so "astonished" answers to "desolate," for which, therefore,
MUNSTER and others rather translate, "an object of wonder" ([Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 18:17</span></span>

as with an east wind--literally, "I will scatter them, as an east wind
(scatters all before it)": a most violent wind ([Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021); [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007); [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008)). Thirty-two manuscripts read
(without as), "with an east wind."

I will show them the back . . . not . . . face--just retribution: as
"they turned their back unto Me . . . not their face" ([Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027)).

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

([Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019)). Let us bring a capital
charge against him, as a false prophet; "for (whereas he foretells that
this land shall be left without priests to teach the law, [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007); without scribes to explain its
difficulties; and without prophets to reveal God's will), the law shall
not perish from the prophet," &c.; since God has made these a lasting
institution in His church, and the law declares they shall never perish
([Lev 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018); [Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011); compare [Jer
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)) \[GROTIUS\].

the wise--scribes and elders joined to the priests. Perhaps they mean to
say, we must have right on our side, in spite of Jeremiah's words
against us and our prophets ([Jer
28:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025), [Jer
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032); [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031)); "for the law shall not perish,"
&c. I prefer GROTIUS' explanation.

with . . . tongue--by a false accusation ([Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004); [Psa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003); [Psa
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004); [Psa
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#019)). "For the tongue" (Margin),
that is, for his speaking against us. "In the tongue," that is, let us
kill him, that he may speak no more against us \[CASTALIO\].

[Jeremiah 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 18:19</span></span>

Give heed--contrasted with, "let us not give heed" ([Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018)). As they give no heed to me, do
Thou, O Lord, give heed to me, and let my words at least have their
weight with Thee.

[Jeremiah 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 18:20</span></span>

In the particulars here specified, Jeremiah was a type of Jesus Christ
([Psa 109:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004); [Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025)).

my soul--my life; me ([Psa 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007)).

I stood before thee . . . to turn away thy wrath--so Moses ([Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023); compare [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030)). So Jesus Christ, the antitype
of previous partial intercessors ([Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 18:21</span></span>

pour out their blood by the force of the sword--literally, "by the hands
of the sword." So [Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005). MAURER
with JEROME translates, "deliver them over to the power of the sword."
But compare [Psa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010), Margin; [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012). In this prayer he does not
indulge in personal revenge, as if it were his own cause that was at
stake; but he speaks under the dictation of the Spirit, ceasing to
intercede, and speaking prophetically, knowing they were doomed to
destruction as reprobates; for those not so, he doubtless ceased not to
intercede. We are not to draw an example from this, which is a special
case.

put to death--or, as in [Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002),
"perish by the death plague" \[MAURER\].

men . . . young men--HORSLEY distinguishes the former as married men
past middle age; the latter, the flower of unmarried youth.

[Jeremiah 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 18:22</span></span>

cry--by reason of the enemy bursting in: let their houses be no shelter
to them in their calamities \[CALVIN\].

digged . . . pit-- ([Jer 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020); [Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006); [Psa
119:85](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#085)).

[Jeremiah 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 18:23</span></span>

forgive not-- ([Psa 109:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#009), [Psa
109:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#014)).

blot out--image from an account-book ([Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)).

before thee--Hypocrites suppose God is not near, so long as they escape
punishment; but when He punishes, they are said to stand before Him,
because they can no longer flatter themselves they can escape His eye
(compare [Psa 90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008)).

deal thus--exert Thy power against them \[MAURER\].

time of thine anger--Though He seems to tarry, His time shall come at
last ([Ecc 8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011); [Pe2
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009)).

Referred by MAURER, &c., to the beginning of Zedekiah's reign.
