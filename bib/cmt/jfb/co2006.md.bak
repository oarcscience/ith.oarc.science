### [2 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 6:1</span></span>

HIS APOSTOLIC MINISTRY IS APPROVED BY FAITHFULNESS IN EXHORTATION, IN
SUFFERINGS, IN EXHIBITION OF THE FRUITS OF THE HOLY GHOST: HIS LARGENESS
OF HEART TO THEM CALLS FOR ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR HEART TO HIM.
EXHORTATIONS TO SEPARATION FROM POLLUTION. (2Co. 6:1-18)

workers together--with God ([Act 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004.md);
[Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009).md). Not only as "ambassadors."

beseech--entreat ([Co2 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020).md). He is
describing his ministry, not exhorting directly.

you also--rather, "WE ALSO (as well as God, [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020).md) beseech" or "entreat you": [Co2
6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md), on to [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md), is part of this entreaty or
exhortation.

in vain--by making the grace of God a ground for continuance in sin
([Co2 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003).md). By a life of sin, showing
that the word of reconciliation has been in vain, so far as you are
concerned ([Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).md). "The grace of God" here, is "the
reconciliation" provided by God's love ([Co2
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md); compare [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 6:2</span></span>

For--God's own promise is the ground of our exhortation.

he saith--God the Father saith to God the Son, and so to all believers
who are regarded as one with Him.

heard thee--In the eternal purposes of my love I have hearkened to thy
prayer for the salvation of thy people (compare [Joh
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009.md), [Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md), [Joh
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md).

accepted . . . accepted--The Greek of the latter is more emphatic,
"well-accepted." What was "an accepted time" in the prophecy ([Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md), Hebrew, "in the season of
grace") becomes "the well-accepted time" in the fulfilment (compare [Psa
69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013).md). As it is God's time of
receiving sinners, receive ye His grace: accept ([Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001).md) the word of reconciliation in His
accepted time.

in the day of salvation--"in a day of salvation" ([Luk
4:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), [Luk
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021.md); [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md); [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 6:3</span></span>

Resuming the connection with [Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md),
interrupted by the parenthetical [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md). "Giving no offense" (compare [Co1
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033).md), "approving ourselves," and all
the other participles down to [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md), are nominatives to "we also
entreat you" ([Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001).md), to show the
pains he took to enforce his exhortation by example, as well as precept
\[ALFORD\]. "Offense" would be given, if we were without "patience" and
the other qualifications which he therefore subjoins (compare [Rom
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#013).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 6:4</span></span>

Translate, to mark the true order of the Greek words, "in everything, as
God's ministers recommending ourselves," that is, that our hearers may
give our message a favorable hearing, through our consistency in every
respect, not that they may glorify us. Alluding to [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md), he implies, We commend ourselves,
not like them by word, but by deed.

patience-- ([Co2 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012).md). Put first.
"Pure-minded" follows ([Co2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006).md).
Three triplets of trials exercising the "patience" (patient endurance)
follow: Afflictions (or "tribulations"), necessities, distresses (or
"straits"); stripes, imprisonments, tumults; labors, watchings,
fastings. The first triplet expresses afflictions generally; the second,
those in particular arising from the violence of men; the third, those
which he brought on himself directly or indirectly.

[2 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 6:5</span></span>

stripes-- ([Co2 11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md); [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023).md).

imprisonments-- ([Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023).md). He had
been, doubtless, elsewhere imprisoned besides at Philippi when he wrote
this Epistle.

tumults-- ([Act 13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050.md); [Act
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005.md), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md); [Act
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022); and recently Acts 19:23-41.md).

labours--in the cause of Christ ([Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md); [Rom
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012).md).

watchings-- ([Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027).md). Sleepless
nights.

fastings--The context here refers to his trials, rather than devotional
exercises (compare [Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027).md). Thus
"foodlessness" would seem to be the sense (compare [Co1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011.md); [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012).md). But the usual sense of the
Greek is fasts, in the strict sense; and in [Co2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027.md) it is spoken of independently of
"hunger and thirst." (Compare [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md); [Act
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030.md); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023).md). However, [Mat
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md); [Mar
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003.md), justify the sense, more favored
by the context, foodlessness, though a rare use of the word. GAUSSEN
remarks "The apostles combine the highest offices with the humblest
exterior: as everything in the Church was to be cast in the mould of
death and resurrection, the cardinal principle throughout Christianity."

[2 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 6:6</span></span>

By . . . by, &c.--rather, as Greek, "In . . . in," implying not the
instrument, but the sphere or element in which his ministry moved.

knowledge--spiritual: in Gospel mysteries, unattainable by mere reason
([Co1 2:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md), [Co2
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md).

long-suffering . . . kindness--associated with "charity" or "love" ([Co1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004).md), as here.

by the Holy Ghost--in virtue of His influences which produce these
graces, and other gifts, "love unfeigned" being the foremost of them.

[2 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 6:7</span></span>

By the word of truth, by the power of God--rather, "IN . . . in," &c. As
to "the word of truth" (compare [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005)), and "the (miraculous.md) power of
God" ([Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007).md); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md), "in demonstration of the Spirit
and of power."

by the armour--Greek, "through" or "by means of the armor."
"Righteousness," which is the breastplate alone in [Eph
6:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013.md), here is made the whole
Christian panoply (compare [Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md).

on . . . right . . . and . . . left--that is, guarding on every side.

[2 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 6:8</span></span>

Translate, "Through glory and dishonor (disgrace)," namely, from those
in authority, and accruing to us present. "By," or "through evil report
and good report," from the multitude, and affecting us absent
\[BENGEL\]. Regarded "as deceivers" by those who, not knowing ([Co2
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009).md), dishonor and give us an evil
report; "as true," by those who "know" ([Co2
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009).md) us in the real "glory" of our
ministry. In proportion as one has more or less of glory and good
report, in that degree has he more or less of dishonor and evil report.

[2 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 6:9</span></span>

unknown . . . yet well known--"unknown" in our true character to those
who "evil report" of us, "well known" to those who hold us in "good
report" ([Co2 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008).md). CONYBEARE
explains, "Unknown by men, yet acknowledged by God" ([Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md). Perhaps both God and men
(believers) are intended as knowing him ([Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md); [Co2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006).md).

dying . . . live-- ([Co2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md); [Co2
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023).md). Compare GAUSSEN'S remark, see
on [Co2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md). "Behold" calls attention
to the fact as something beyond all expectation.

chastened . . . not killed--realizing [Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 6:10</span></span>

The "as" no longer is used to express the opinion of his adversaries,
but the real state of him and his fellow laborers.

making many rich--Spiritually ([Co1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005).md), after the example of our Lord,
who "by His poverty made many rich" ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md).

having nothing--Whatever of earthly goods we have, and these are few, we
have as though we had not; as tenants removable at will, not owners
([Co1 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030).md).

possessing all things--The Greek implies firm possession, holding fast
in possession (compare [Co1 3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021).md).
The things both of the present and of the future are, in the truest
sense, the believer's in possession, for he possesses them all in
Christ, his lasting possession, though the full fruition of them is
reserved for the future eternity.

[2 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 6:11</span></span>

mouth . . . open unto you--I use no concealment, such as some at Corinth
have insinuated ([Co2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002).md). I use all
freedom and openness of speech to you as to beloved friends. Hence he
introduces here, "O Corinthians" (compare [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015).md). The enlargement of his heart
towards them ([Co2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003).md) produced his
openness of mouth, that is, his unreserved expression of his inmost
feelings. As an unloving man is narrow in heart, so the apostle's heart
is enlarged by love, so as to take in his converts at Corinth, not only
with their graces, but with their many shortcomings (compare [Kg1
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md); [Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032.md); [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 6:12</span></span>

Any constraint ye feel towards me, or narrowness of heart, is not from
want of largeness of heart on my part towards you, but from want of it
on your part towards me.

bowels--that is, affections (compare [Co2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015).md).

not straitened in us--that is, for want of room in our hearts to take
you in.

[2 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 6:13</span></span>

Translate, "As a recompense in the same kind . . . be enlarged also
yourselves" \[ELLICOTT\]. "In the same way" as my heart is enlarged
towards you ([Co2 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011).md), and "as a
recompense" for it ([Gal 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012).md).

I speak as unto my children--as children would naturally be expected to
recompense their parents' love with similar love.

[2 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 6:14</span></span>

Be not--Greek, "Become not."

unequally yoked--"yoked with one alien in spirit." The image is from the
symbolical precept of the law ([Lev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019).md), "Thou shalt not let thy cattle
gender with a diverse kind"; or the precept ([Deu
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010).md), "Thou shalt not plough with an
ox and an ass together." Compare [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003.md), forbidding marriages with the
heathen; also [Co1 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md). The believer
and unbeliever are utterly heterogeneous. Too close intercourse with
unbelievers in other relations also is included ([Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md); [Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014).md).

fellowship--literally, "share," or "participation."

righteousness--the state of the believer, justified by faith.

unrighteousness--rather, as always translated elsewhere, "iniquity"; the
state of the unbeliever, the fruit of unbelief.

light--of which believers are the children ([Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 6:15</span></span>

Belial--Hebrew, "worthlessness, unprofitableness, wickedness." As Satan
is opposed to God, and Antichrist to Christ; Belial being here opposed
to Christ, must denounce all manner of Antichristian uncleanness
\[BENGEL\].

he that believeth with an infidel--Translate, "a believer with an
unbeliever."

[2 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 6:16</span></span>

agreement--accordance of sentiments (compare [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md); [Eph
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md), [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011).md).

the temple of God--that is, you believers ([Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md).

with idols--Compare Dagon before the ark ([Sa1
5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002).md).

as--"even as God said." Quotation from [Lev
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012.md); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); [Jer
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#038.md); [Eze
37:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md); compare [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md); [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md).

walk in them--rather, "among them." As "dwell" implies the divine
presence, so "walk," the divine operation. God's dwelling in the body
and soul of saints may be illustrated by its opposite, demoniacal
possession of body and soul.

my people--rather, "they shall be to me a people."

[2 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 6:17</span></span>

Quoted from [Isa 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md), with the
freedom of one inspired, who gives variations sanctioned by the Holy
Spirit.

be ye separate--"be separated" ([Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md).

touch not the unclean thing--rather, "anything unclean" ([Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010).md). Touching is more polluting, as
implying participation, than seeing.

receive you--The Greek implies, "to myself"; as persons heretofore out
of doors, but now admitted within ([Co2
5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).md). With this accords the clause,
"Come out from among them," namely, so as to be received to me. So [Eze
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041.md), "I will accept you"; and [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md), "gather her that was driven
out." "The intercourse of believers with the world should resemble that
of angels, who, when they have been sent a message from heaven,
discharge their office with the utmost promptness, and joyfully fly back
home to the presence of God" ([Co1
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md); [Co1
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009).md).

[2 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 6:18</span></span>

Translate, "I will be to you in the relation of a Father, and ye shall
be to me in the relation of sons and daughters." This is a still more
endearing relation than ([Co2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md),
"I will be their God, and they . . . My people." Compare the promise to
Solomon ([Ch1 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006.md); [Isa
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md), [Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007.md); [Jer
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md), [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009).md).

Lord Almighty--The Lord the Universal Ruler: nowhere else found but in
Revelation. The greatness of the Promiser enhances the greatness of the
promises.
