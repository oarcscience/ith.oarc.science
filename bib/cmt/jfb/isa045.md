### [Isaiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001)

[Isaiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 45:1</span></span>

These seven verses should have been appended to previous chapter, and
the new chapter should begin with [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008), "Drop down," &c. \[HORSLEY\].
Reference to the deliverance by Messiah often breaks out from amidst the
local and temporary details of the deliverance from Babylon, as the
great ultimate end of the prophecy. ([Isa
45:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001))

his anointed--Cyrus is so called as being set apart as king, by God's
providence, to fulfil His special purpose. Though kings were not
anointed in Persia, the expression is applied to him in reference to the
Jewish custom of setting apart kings to the regal office by anointing.

right hand . . . holden--image from sustaining a feeble person by
holding his right hand ([Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006)).

subdue nations--namely, the Cilicians, Syrians, Babylonians, Lydians,
Bactrians, &c.; his empire extended from Egypt and the Mediterranean to
the Indian Ocean, and from Ethiopia to the Euxine Sea.

loose . . . girdle loins--that is, the girdle off the loins; and so
enfeeble them. The loose outer robe of the Orientals, when girt fast
round the loins, was the emblem of strength and preparedness for action;
ungirt, was indicative of feebleness ([Job
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003); [Job
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021)); "weakeneth the strength of the
mighty" (Margin), "looseth the girdle of the strong." The joints of
(Belshazzar's) loins, we read in [Dan
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006), were loosed during the siege by
Cyrus, at the sight of the mysterious handwriting on the palace walls.
His being taken by surprise, unaccoutred, is here foretold.

to open . . . gates--In the revelry in Babylon on the night of its
capture, the inner gates, leading from the streets to the river, were
left open; for there were walls along each side of the Euphrates with
gates, which, had they been kept shut, would have hemmed the invading
hosts in the bed of the river, where the Babylonians could have easily
destroyed them. Also, the gates of the palace were left open, so that
there was access to every part of the city; and such was its extent,
that they who lived in the extremities were taken prisoners before the
alarm reached the center of the palace. \[HERODOTUS, 1.191\].

[Isaiah 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 45:2</span></span>

crooked . . . straight-- ([Isa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004)),
rather, "maketh mountains plain" \[LOWTH\], that is, clear out of thy
way all opposing persons and things. The Keri reads as in [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013), "make straight" (Margin).

gates of brass-- ([Psa 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016)).
HERODOTUS (1.179) says, Babylon had a hundred massive gates, twenty-five
on each of the four sides of the city, all, as well as their posts, of
brass.

bars of iron--with which the gates were fastened.

[Isaiah 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 45:3</span></span>

treasures of darkness--that is, hidden in subterranean places; a common
Oriental practice. Sorcerers pretended to be able to show where such
treasures were to be found; in opposition to their pretensions, God
says, He will really give hidden treasures to Cyrus ([Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037); [Jer
51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013)). PLINY (Natural History,, 33:3)
says that Cyrus obtained from the conquest of Asia thirty-four thousand
pounds weight of gold, besides golden vases, and five hundred thousand
talents of silver, and the goblet of Semiramis, weighing fifteen
talents.

that thou mayest know--namely, not merely that He was "the God of
Israel," but that He was Jehovah, the true God. [Ezr
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001) shows that the correspondence of
the event with the prediction had the desired effect on Cyrus.

which call . . . thy name--so long before designate thee by name ([Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 45:4</span></span>

(See on [Isa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008); [Isa
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014)).

surnamed--that is, designated to carry out My design of restoring Judah
(see on [Isa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005); [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001)). MAURER here, as in [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005), translates, "I have addressed
thee by an honorable name."

hast not known me--previous to My calling thee to this office; after
God's call, Cyrus did know Him in some degree ([Ezr
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)).

[Isaiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 45:5</span></span>

([Isa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008); [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003), [Isa
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011); [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008); [Isa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009)).

girded thee--whereas "I will loose (the girdle off) the loins of kings"
([Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001)), strengthening thee, but
enfeebling them before thee.

though . . . not known me-- ([Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004)). God knows His elect before they
are made to know Him ([Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009); [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 45:6</span></span>

From the rising to the setting of the sun, that is, from east to west,
the whole habitable world. It is not said, "from north to south," for
that would not imply the habitable world, as, "from east to west" does
([Ezr 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001), &c.). The conquest of
Jerusalem by Babylon, the capital of the world, and the overthrow of
Babylon and restoration of the Jews by Cyrus, who expressly acknowledged
himself to be but the instrument in God's hands, were admirably suited
to secure, throughout the world, the acknowledgment of Jehovah as the
only true God.

[Isaiah 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 45:7</span></span>

form . . . create--yatzar, to give "form" to previously existing matter.
Bara, to "create" from nothing the chaotic dark material.

light . . . darkness--literally ([Gen
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)), emblematical also, prosperity
to Cyrus, calamity to Babylon and the nations to be vanquished
\[GROTIUS\] . . . Isaiah refers also to the Oriental belief in two
coexistent, eternal principles, ever struggling with each other, light
or good, and darkness or evil, Oromasden and Ahrimanen. God, here, in
opposition, asserts His sovereignty over both \[VITRINGA\].

create evil--not moral evil ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)), but in contrast to "peace" in
the parallel clause, war, disaster (compare [Psa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007); [Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 45:8</span></span>

Drop--namely, the fertilizing rain ([Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012)).

skies--clouds; lower than the "heavens."

righteousness--that is, the dews of the Holy Spirit, whereby
"righteousness" shall "spring up." (See latter end of the verse).

earth--figuratively for the hearts of men on it, opened for receiving
the truth by the Holy Ghost ([Act
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)).

them--the earth and the heavens. HORSLEY prefers: "Let the earth open,
and let salvation and justice grow forth; let it bring them forth
together; I the Lord have created him" ([Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013)). MAURER translates, "Let all
kinds of salvation (prosperity) be fruitful" ([Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003), [Psa
72:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)). The revival of religion after
the return from Babylon suggests to the prophet the diffusion of
Messiah's Gospel, especially in days still future; hence the elevation
of the language to a pitch above what is applicable to the state of
religion after the return.

[Isaiah 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 45:9</span></span>

Anticipating the objections which the Jews might raise as to why God
permitted their captivity, and when He did restore them, why He did so
by a foreign prince, Cyrus, not a Jew ([Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027), &c.), but mainly and
ultimately, the objections about to be raised by the Jews against God's
sovereign act in adopting the whole Gentile world as His spiritual
Israel ([Isa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008), referring to this
catholic diffusion of the Gospel), as if it were an infringement of
their nation's privileges; so Paul expressly quotes it ([Rom
9:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004), [Rom
9:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011)).

Let . . . strive--Not in the Hebrew; rather, in apposition with "him,"
"A potsherd among the potsherds of the earth!" A creature fragile and
worthless as the fragment of an earthen vessel, among others equally so,
and yet presuming to strive with his Maker! English Version implies, it
is appropriate for man to strive with man, in opposition to [Ti2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024) \[GESENIUS\].

thy . . . He--shall thy work say of thee, He . . . ?

[Isaiah 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 45:10</span></span>

If it be wrong for a child, born in less favorable circumstances, to
upbraid his parents with having given him birth, a fortiori, it is, to
upbraid God for His dealings with us. Rather translate, "a father . . .
a woman." The Jews considered themselves exclusively God's children and
were angry that God should adopt the Gentiles besides. Woe to him who
says to one already a father, Why dost thou beget other children?
\[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 45:11</span></span>

Ask . . . command--Instead of striving with Me in regard to My purposes,
your wisdom is in prayer to ask, and even command Me, in so far as it is
for My glory, and for your real good ([Mar
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024); [Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023), [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013), latter part of the verse; [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022)).

sons-- ([Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013); [Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026)).

work of my hands--spiritually ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)); also literal Israel ([Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021)). MAURER translates, instead of
"command," Leave it to Me, in My dealings concerning My sons and
concerning the work of My hands, to do what I will with My own. LOWTH
reads it interrogatively, Do ye presume to question Me and dictate to Me
(see [Isa 45:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009))? The same sense is
given, if the words be taken in irony. But English Version is best.

[Isaiah 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 45:12</span></span>

The same argument for prayer, drawn from God's omnipotence and
consequent power, to grant any request, occurs in [Isa
40:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).

I, even my hands--so Hebrew ([Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002)), "Thou . . . thy hand" (both
nominatives, in apposition).

[Isaiah 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 45:13</span></span>

him--Cyrus, type of Messiah, who redeems the captives of Satan "without
money and without price" ([Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)),
"freely" (gratuitously) ([Isa 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003);
[Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001); [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011); [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)).

in righteousness--to fulfil My righteous purpose (see on [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 45:14</span></span>

The language but cursorily alludes to Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba, being
given to Cyrus as a ransom in lieu of Israel whom he restored ([Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003)), but mainly and fully describes
the gathering in of the Gentiles to Israel ([Act
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010); [Act
8:27-38](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)), especially at Israel's
future restoration ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Isa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001); [Isa
19:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018); [Isa
60:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023); [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Psa
72:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)).

labour--wealth acquired by labor ([Jer
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024)).

Sabeans . . . of stature--the men of Meroe, in Upper Egypt. HERODOTUS
(3.30) calls the Ethiopians "the tallest of men" (see on [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002); [Ch1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#023)).

thee--Jerusalem ("my city," [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013)).

in chains-- ([Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008)). "The saints
shall judge the world" ([Co1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002)) and
"rule the nations with a rod of iron" ([Zac
14:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012); [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026)). The "chains," in the case of
the obedient, shall be the easy yoke of Messiah; as "the sword of the
Spirit" also is saving to the believer, condemnatory to the unbeliever
([Joh 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015)).

God is in thee-- ([Jer 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 45:15</span></span>

God that hidest thyself--HORSLEY, after JEROME, explains this as the
confession of Egypt, &c., that God is concealed in human form in the
person of Jesus. Rather, connected with [Isa
45:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009), the prophet, contemplating
the wonderful issue of the seemingly dark counsels of God, implies a
censure on those who presume to question God's dealings ([Isa
55:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008); [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029)). Faith still discerns, even
under the veil, the covenant-keeping "God of Israel, the Saviour" ([Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 45:16</span></span>

ashamed--"disappointed" in their expectation of help from their idols
(see on [Isa 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017); [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 45:17</span></span>

in the Lord-- ([Isa 45:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024)),
contrasted with the idols which cannot give even temporary help ([Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016)); in Jehovah there is
everlasting salvation ([Isa 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004)).

not . . . ashamed--opposed to the doom of the idolaters, who, in the
hour of need, shall be "ashamed" (see on [Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 45:18</span></span>

(See on [Isa 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012)).

not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited--Therefore, Judah, lying waste
during the Babylonish captivity, shall be peopled again by the exiles.
The Jews, from this passage, infer that, after the resurrection, the
earth shall be inhabited, for there can be no reason why the earth
should then exist in vain any more than now ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 45:19</span></span>

not . . . secret--not like the heathen oracles which gave their
responses from dark caverns, with studied obscurity ([Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016)). Christ plainly quotes these
words, thereby identifying Himself with Jehovah ([Joh
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020)).

I said not . . . Seek . . . in vain--When I commanded you to seek Me
(Jehovah did so, [Isa 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011), "Ask Me,"
&c.), it was not in order that ye might be sent empty away ([Deu
32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047)). Especially in Israel's time of
trial, God's interposition, in behalf of Zion hereafter, is expressly
stated as about to be the answer to prayer ([Isa
62:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Psa
102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013), [Psa
102:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019)). So in the case of all
believers, the spiritual Israel.

righteousness--that which is veracious: not in the equivocal terms of
heathen responses, fitly symbolized by the "dark places" from which they
were uttered.

right--true (see on [Isa 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 45:20</span></span>

escaped of the nations--those of the nations who shall have escaped the
slaughter inflicted by Cyrus. Now, at last, ye shall see the folly of
"praying to a god that cannot save" ([Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016)). Ultimately, those that shall
be "left of all the nations which shall come against Jerusalem" are
meant ([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)). They shall then
all be converted to the Lord ([Isa
66:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017); [Zac
8:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 45:21</span></span>

Challenge the worshippers of idols ([Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)).

take counsel together--as to the best arguments wherewith to defend the
cause of idolatry.

who . . . from that time-- ([Isa
41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022); see on [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008)). Which of the idols has done
what God hath, namely, foretold, primarily as to Cyrus; ultimately as to
the final restoration of Israel hereafter? The idolatry of Israel before
Cyrus' time will have its counterpart in the Antichrist and the
apostasy, which shall precede Christ's manifestation.

just . . . and . . . Saviour--righteous in keeping His promises, and
therefore a Saviour to His people. Not only is it not inconsistent with,
but it is the result of, His righteousness, or justice, that He should
save His redeemed ([Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006), [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021); [Psa
85:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010); [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 45:22</span></span>

Look . . . and be ye saved--The second imperative expresses the result
which will follow obedience to the first ([Gen
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018)); ye shall be saved ([Joh
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014)). [Num
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009) : "If a serpent had bitten any
man, when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived." What so simple as a
look? Not do something, but look to the Saviour ([Act
16:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#030)). Believers look by faith,
the eye of the soul. The look is that of one turning (see Margin) to
God, as at once "Just and the Saviour" ([Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021)), that is, the look of
conversion ([Psa 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 45:23</span></span>

sworn by myself--equivalent to, "As I live," as [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011) quotes it. So [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021). God could swear by no greater,
therefore He swears by Himself ([Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013), [Heb
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016)).

word . . . in righteousness--rather, "the truth (see on [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019)) is gone forth from My mouth,
the word (of promise), and it shall not return (that is, which shall not

King (see on [Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018); [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016)). Yet to be fulfilled ([Zac

Rather, "Only in Jehovah shall men say of me (this clause is
parenthetical), is there righteousness" (which includes salvation, [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021), "a just God and a Saviour,"
[Isa 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013)), &c. \[MAURER\].

2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)) and the literal Israel, that is,
the final remnant which shall all be saved ([Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017); [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

justified--treated as if they were just, through Christ's righteousness
and death ([Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)).

glory--literally, "sing" in His praise ([Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024); [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)).
