### [Psalms Chapter 120](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 120:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 120:2</span></span>

This is the first of fifteen Psalms (Psalms 120-134) entitled "A Song of
Degrees" ([Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md) --literally, "A
song for the degrees"), or ascents. It seems most probable they were
designed for the use of the people when going up (compare [Kg1
12:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027).md) to Jerusalem on the festival
occasions ([Deu 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md), three times a
year. David appears as the author of four, Solomon of one ([Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001).md), and the other ten are
anonymous, probably composed after the captivity. In this Psalm the
writer acknowledges God's mercy, prays for relief from a malicious foe,
whose punishment he anticipates, and then repeats his complaint. ([Psa
120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001).md)

Slander and deceit charged on his foes implies his innocence.

tongue--as in [Psa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002.md), [Psa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 120:4</span></span>

Sharp arrows of the mighty--destructive inflictions.

coals of juniper--which retain heat long. This verse may be read as a
description of the wicked, but better as their punishment, in reply to
the question of [Psa 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 120:5</span></span>

A residence in these remote lands pictures his miserable condition.

[Psalms 120:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 120:6</span></span>

While those who surrounded him were maliciously hostile, he was disposed
to peace. This Psalm may well begin such a series as this, as a contrast
to the promised joys of God's worship.
