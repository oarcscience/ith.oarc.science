### [Isaiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 44:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER. (Isa. 44:1-28)

Yet--Though thou hast sinned, yet hear God's gracious promise as to thy
deliverance.

chosen-- ([Isa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 44:2</span></span>

([Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md), [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007).md).

formed . . . from . . . womb--(So [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md); [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md), [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005).md). The sense is similar to that in
[Isa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md), "I have nourished and
brought up children."

Jesurun--A diminutive term of endearment applied to Israel. The full
title of affection was Israelun; contracted it became Jeshurun, with an
allusion to the Hebrew root, jashar, "upright," "perfect" (see on [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019), note on "He that is perfect".md)
\[GESENIUS\], ([Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 44:3</span></span>

([Isa 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md).

him . . . thirsty--rather, "the land" ([Isa
35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006).md), figuratively for man
thirsting after righteousness ([Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).md).

floods--the abundant influences of the Holy Spirit, stronger than
"water."

spirit--including all spiritual and temporal gifts, as the parallel,
"blessing," proves ([Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md); [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015).md).

seed-- ([Isa 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 44:4</span></span>

they--thy "seed" and "offspring" ([Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md).

as among--needlessly inserted in English Version. Rather, "The seed
shall spring up as willows among the grass beside canals of water"
\[HORSLEY\]. Or, "They shall spring up among the grass (that is,
luxuriantly; for what grows in the midst of grass grows luxuriantly) as
willows by the water-courses," which makes the parallel clauses better
balanced \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 44:5</span></span>

The third clause answers in parallelism to the first, the fourth to the
second.

I am the Lord's-- ([Jer 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md); [Co1
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md); [Co2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005).md).

call himself by the name of Jacob--The Gentiles (as the result of the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Israel, the Lord's "seed," first) shall
join themselves to the children of Jacob, in order to worship their God
(compare [Isa 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md); [Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011).md). Or, "calls," that is, invokes
and celebrates the name of Jacob, attaches himself to his nation and
religion \[MAURER\], ([Psa 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006).md).

subscribe . . . hand unto . . . Lord--in solemn and public covenant,
pledging himself to God's service (compare [Neh
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038).md), before "witnesses" ([Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md), after the manner of a civil
contract ([Jer 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010.md), [Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012.md), [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044).md). So the Christian in the
sacraments \[BARNES\]. Literally, "shall fill his hand with letters
([Exo 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md); [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010).md) in honor of Jehovah"; or "shall
write upon his hand, I am Jehovah's" (compare [Isa
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016.md); [Rev
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016).md); alluding to the puncture with
ink on the hand, whereby a soldier marked himself as bound to his
commander; and whereby the Christians used to mark themselves with the
name of Christ \[LOWTH\]. The former view is simpler.

surname himself . . . Israel--MAURER and GESENIUS interpret this as the
Hebrew sanctions, answering to their rendering of the parallel second
clause, "calls blandly (speaks in honorable terms of) the name of
Israel." Retaining English Version, we must, from the Hebrew understand
it thus, "Surname himself by the honorable name of Israel" ([Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 44:6</span></span>

Here follows an argument for Jehovah, as the only God, and against the
idols, as vanity (see on [Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md);
[Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md); [Isa
43:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 44:7</span></span>

Who but God can predict future events and declare also the order and
time of each (see on [Isa 41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md);
[Isa 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021).md)?

call--"openly proclaim" ([Isa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006).md)
things to come \[MAURER\]. Or, "call forth" the event; command that it
happen ([Isa 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md); [Isa
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015).md), \[BARNES\].

set . . . in order--There is no chance or confusion; all events occur in
the order best fitted to subserve God's plans.

for me--It is FOR GOD that all things exist and take place ([Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011).md). But MAURER translates, "Let him
set it forth ([Job 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019).md) to me."

since . . . ancient people--I have given the Jews predictions of the
future ever since I appointed them as My people in ancient times;
therefore they were qualified to be His witnesses ([Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md). As to their being God's
"ancient (everlasting) people," see [Deu
32:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007.md); [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md); the type of the redeemed Church
([Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 44:8</span></span>

be afraid--literally, "be astounded," or "distracted with fear."

from that time--namely, from the time that "I appointed the ancient
people" ([Isa 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md). From the time of
Abraham's call, his family were the depositories of the predictions of
the Redeemer, whereas the promise of Cyrus was not heard of till
Isaiah's time; therefore, the event to the prediction and accomplishment
of which God appeals in proof of His sole Godhead, is the redemption of
man by a descendant of Abraham, in whose person "the ancient people" was
first formally "appointed." The deliverance of the Jews, by Cyrus, is
mentioned afterwards only as an earnest of that greater mercy
\[HORSLEY\].

no God--Hebrew, tsur, "rock" ([Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md); that is, a stronghold to take
refuge in, and a solid foundation to build on.

[Isaiah 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 44:9</span></span>

([Isa 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md), [Isa
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020.md); [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029).md).

delectable things--the idols in which they take such pride and delight.

not profit-- ([Hab 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018).md).

they are their own witnesses--contrasted with, "Ye are My witnesses"
([Isa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md). "They," that is, both the
makers and the idols, are witnesses against themselves, for the idols
palpably see and know nothing ([Psa
115:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004).md).

that they may be ashamed--the consequence deducible from the whole
previous argument, not merely from the words immediately preceding, as
in [Isa 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md); [Isa
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#012.md). I say all this to show that
they are doomed to perish with shame, which is their only fitting end.

[Isaiah 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 44:10</span></span>

Who . . . ?--Sarcastic question: "How debased the man must be who forms
a god!" It is a contradiction in terms. A made god, worshipped by its
maker ([Co1 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md)!

[Isaiah 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 44:11</span></span>

his fellows--the associates of him who makes an idol; or of the idol
(see [Deu 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026.md); [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008.md); [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md).

they are of men--They are mortal men themselves; what better, then, can
the idol be than its maker?

gathered together . . . stand up--as in a court of justice, to try the
issue between God and them (see on [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md); [Isa
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021).md).

yet--wrongly inserted in English Version. The issue of the trial shall
be, "they shall fear," &c.

[Isaiah 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 44:12</span></span>

tongs--rather, "prepareth (to be supplied) an axe," namely, with which
to cut down the tree designed as the material of the idol. The "smith"
(Hebrew, "workman in iron") here answers to the "carpenter" (Hebrew,
"workman in wood"). "He worketh it (the axe, not the idol, which was
wood, not metal) in the coals," &c. The axe was wrought, not cast. The
smith makes the axe for the carpenter.

hungry . . . drinketh no water--so eager is he to expedite his work
while the iron is hot. If the god were worth anything, it would not let
him grow "faint" with hunger and thirst. Williams, the missionary,
states that the South Sea islanders when they make an idol abstain from
food and drink.

[Isaiah 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 44:13</span></span>

After the smith's work in preparing the instruments comes the
carpenter's work in forming the idol.

rule--rather, "line" \[BARNES\].

with a line--rather, a "pencil," \[HORSLEY\]. Literally, "red ochre,"
which he uses to mark on the wood the outline of the figure \[LOWTH\].
Or best, the stylus or graver, with which the incision of the outline is
made \[GESENIUS\].

planes--rather, "chisels" or "carving tools," for a plane would not
answer for carving.

compass--from a Hebrew root, "to make a circle"; by it, symmetry of form
is secured.

according to . . . beauty of a man--irony. The highest idea the heathen
could form of a god was one of a form like their own. JEROME says, "The
more handsome the statue the more august the god was thought." The
incarnation of the Son of God condescends to this anthropomorphic
feeling so natural to man, but in such a way as to raise man's thoughts
up to the infinite God who "is a spirit."

that it may remain in . . . house--the only thing it was good for; it
could not hear nor save (compare Wisdom 13:15).

[Isaiah 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 44:14</span></span>

Description of the material out of which the idol is formed.

cypress--rather, from Hebrew root, "to be hard," the holm oak," an
evergreen abundant in Palestine \[GESENIUS\].

strengtheneth--literally, "and he getteth strength to himself in the
trees of the forest;" that is, he layeth in a great store of timber
\[LOWTH\]. Or, "chooseth," as "madest strong for thyself," that is, hast
chosen ([Psa 80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015.md), [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017).md) \[GESENIUS\]. But English
Version gives a good sense: "strengtheneth"; that is, rears to maturity;
a meaning suitable also to the context of [Psa
80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015.md), [Psa
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md), where Israel is compared to a
vine planted by Jehovah \[MAURER\].

rain doth nourish it--Though the man planted the tree, yet he could not
make it grow. In preparing to make an idol, he has to depend on the true
God for rain from heaven ([Jer 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 44:15</span></span>

The same tree that furnishes the material for the god is in part used as
fuel for a fire to cook his meals and warm himself!

thereto--rather, "he falleth down before them," that is, such images
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 44:16</span></span>

part . . . part--not distinct parts, but the same part of the wood
(compare [Isa 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#017).md).

eateth--that is, cooks so as to eat ([Isa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019).md).

I have seen--I feel its power.

[Isaiah 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 44:18</span></span>

he, &c.--God hath given them over to judicial blindness; not His direct
physical, but His providential agency in administering His moral
government, is meant ([Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md).
"Shut," literally, "daubed," plastered up; it is an Eastern custom in
some cases to seal up the eyes of offenders.

[Isaiah 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 44:19</span></span>

considereth--literally, "layeth it to heart," ([Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025.md); [Jer
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#011).md).

abomination--the scriptural term for an idol, not merely abominable, but
the essence of what is so, in the eyes of a jealous God ([Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 44:20</span></span>

feedeth on ashes--figuratively, for the idolater delights in what is
vain ([Pro 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md). "Feedeth on wind." There is an
allusion, perhaps, also, to the god being made of a tree, the half of
which was reduced to ashes by fire ([Isa
44:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015).md); the idol, it is implied,
was no better, and could, and ought, to have been reduced to ashes like
the other half.

deceived heart--The heart and will first go astray, then the intellect
and life ([Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018).md).

lie in . . . right hand--Is not my handiwork (the idol) a self-deceit?

[Isaiah 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 44:21</span></span>

Remember--"Be not like the idolaters who consider not in their heart"
([Isa 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019).md).

these--things just said as to the folly of idol-worship.

my servant--not like the idolaters, slaves to the stock of a tree ([Isa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019).md). See [Isa
44:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md).

thou . . . not . . . forgotten of me--Therefore thou oughtest to
"remember" Me.

[Isaiah 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 44:22</span></span>

blotted out--the debt of thy sin from the account-book in which it was
entered ([Exo 32:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012).md).

as a thick cloud--scattered away by the wind ([Psa
103:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012).md).

as a cloud--a descending gradation. Not only the "thick cloud" of the
heavier "transgressions," but the "cloud" ("vapor" \[LOWTH\], not so
dense, but covering the sky as a mist) of the countless "sins." These
latter, though not thought much of by man, need, as much as the former,
to be cleared away by the Sun of righteousness; else they will be a mist
separating us from heaven ([Psa
19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md); [Jo1
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).md).

return . . . for--The antecedent redemption is the ground of, and motive
to, repentance. We do not repent in order that He may redeem us, but
because He hath redeemed us ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md); [Act
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018).md). He who believes in his being
forgiven cannot but love ([Luk 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043.md),
[Luk 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047).md).

[Isaiah 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 44:23</span></span>

Call to inanimate nature to praise God; for it also shall share in the
coming deliverance from "the bondage of corruption" ([Rom
8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md).

done it--effected redemption for both the literal and spiritual Israel.

lower parts, &c.--antithetical to "heavens"; "mountains," "forest," and
"tree," are the intermediate objects in a descending gradation (see [Psa
96:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 44:24</span></span>

Confirmation of His promises to the Church and Israel, by various
instances of His omnipotence; among these the restoration of the Jews by
Cyrus.

alone--literally, "Who was with Me?" namely, when I did it; answering to
"by Myself," in the parallel clause (compare similar phrases, [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md); [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030).md) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 44:25</span></span>

tokens--prognostics; the pretended miracles whiten they gave as proofs
of their supernatural powers.

liars-- ([Jer 50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036).md). Conjurers; or,
astrologers; men leading a retired contemplative life in order to study
divination by the signs of the stars \[VITRINGA\].

backward--with shame at their predictions not being verified. "To turn
away the face" is to frustrate defeat ([Isa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009.md); [Kg1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015).md). The "wise men" are the diviners
who, when Babylon was attacked by Cyrus, predicted his overthrow.

[Isaiah 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 44:26</span></span>

servant--in a collective sense, for the prophets in general, who
foretold the return from Babylon; answering to "His messengers" (plural,
in the parallel clause) \[MAURER\]. Antitypically, and ultimately,
Messiah, who is the consummating embodiment of all the prophets and
messengers of God ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Mat
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md), [Mat
21:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#036.md); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036).md); hence the singular, "His
servant."

counsel--predictions; prophets' counsels concern the future (compare
"counsellor," [Isa 41:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#028).md).

Jerusalem--regarded prophetically, as lying in ruins.

[Isaiah 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 44:27</span></span>

Referring to the Euphrates, which was turned into a different channel,
close to Babylon, by Cyrus, who thereby took the city. "The deep" is
applied to Euphrates as "sea" ([Jer
51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md), [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036).md). "Rivers" refers to the
artificial canals from the Euphrates made to irrigate the country; when
it was turned off into a different bed (namely, a lake, forty miles
square, which was originally formed to receive the superfluous water in
an inundation), the canals became dry.

my shepherd--type of Messiah ([Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md); [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md).

all my pleasure--so Messiah ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). This is the first time Cyrus
is named expressly; and that, a hundred fifty years before the time when
in 550 B.C. he began his reign. The name comes from the Persian
khorschid, "the sun"; kings often taking their names from the gods; the
sun was worshipped as a god in Persia.

saying--rather, "and that saith"; construed with God, not with Cyrus.
God's word is instantaneously efficient in accomplishing His will.

to . . . to--or, "of Jerusalem . . . of the temple," as previously, the
same Hebrew word is translated, "of Cyrus" \[BARNES\]. English Version
is more graphic. Cyrus, according to JOSEPHUS, heard of this prophecy of
Isaiah delivered so long before; hence he was induced to do that which
was so contrary to Oriental policy, to aid in restoring the captive Jews
and rebuilding their temple and city.
