### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

I--emphatical. I personally, for my part. On Gaius or Caius, see my
Introduction before Second Epistle.

love in the truth-- ([Jo2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001).md).
"Beloved" is repeated often in this Epistle, indicating strong affection
([Jo3 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md), [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md), [Jo3
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011).md).

[3 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo3 1:2</span></span>

above all things--Greek, "concerning all things": so ALFORD: in all
respects. But WAHL justifies English Version (compare [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008).md). Of course, since his soul's
prosperity is presupposed, "above all things" does not imply that John
wishes Gaius' bodily health above that of his soul, but as the first
object to be desired next after spiritual health. I know you are
prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you similar prosperity
in your body. Perhaps John had heard from the brethren ([Jo3
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003).md) that Gaius was in bad health, and
was tried in other ways ([Jo3 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010).md),
to which the wish, [Jo3 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md), refers.

prosper--in general.

be in health--in particular.

[3 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo3 1:3</span></span>

testified of the truth that is in thee--Greek, "of" (or 'to') thy
truth": thy share of that truth in which thou walkest \[ALFORD\].

even as thou--in contrast to Diotrephes ([Jo3
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009).md).

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

my children--members of the Church: confirming the view that the "elect
lady" is a Church.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

faithfully--an act becoming a faithful man.

whatsoever thou doest--a distinct Greek word from the former "doest":
translate, "workest": whatsoever work, or labor of love, thou dost
perform. So [Mat 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010.md), "She hath
wrought a good work upon me."

and to strangers--The oldest manuscripts, "and that (that is, and those
brethren) strangers." The fact of the brethren whom thou didst entertain
being "strangers," enhances the love manifested in the act.

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

borne witness of thy charity before the church--to stimulate others by
the good example. The brethren so entertained by Gaius were missionary
evangelists ([Jo3 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007).md); and, probably,
in the course of narrating their missionary labors for the edification
of the Church where John then was, incidentally mentioned the loving
hospitality shown them by Gaius.

bring forward on their journey--"If thou (continue to) forward on their
journey" by giving them provisions for the way.

after a godly sort--Greek, "in a manner worthy of God," whose
ambassadors they are, and whose servant thou art. He who honors God's
missionary servants ([Jo3 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007).md), honors
God.

[3 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo3 1:7</span></span>

his name's sake--Christ's.

went forth--as missionaries.

taking nothing--refusing to receive aught by way of pay, or maintenance,
though justly entitled to it, as Paul at Corinth and at Thessalonica.

Gentiles--the Christians just gathered out by their labors from among
the heathen. As Gaius himself was a Gentile convert, "the Gentiles" here
must mean the converts just made from the heathen, the Gentiles to whom
they had gone forth. It would have been inexpedient to have taken aught
(the Greek "meden" implies, not that they got nothing, though they had
desired it, but that it was of their own choice they took nothing) from
the infant churches among the heathen: the case was different in
receiving hospitality from Gaius.

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

We--in contradistinction to "the Gentiles" or "heathen" referred to,
[Jo3 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md).

therefore--as they take nothing from the Gentiles or heathen.

receive--The oldest manuscripts read, "take up." As they "take" nothing
from the Gentiles, we ought to take them up so as to support them.

fellow helpers--with them.

to the truth--that is, to promote the truth.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

I wrote--The oldest manuscripts add "something": a communication,
probably, on the subject of receiving the brethren with brotherly love
([Jo3 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md), [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010).md). That Epistle was not designed
by the Spirit for the universal Church, or else it would have been
preserved.

unto the church--of which Gaius is a member.

loveth . . . pre-eminence--through ambition. Evidently occupying a high
place in the Church where Gaius was ([Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010).md).

among them--over the members of the Church.

receiveth us not--virtually, namely, by not receiving with love the
brethren whom we recommended to be received ([Jo3
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md), [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md); compare [Mat
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040).md).

[3 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo3 1:10</span></span>

if I come-- ([Jo3 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014).md).

I will remember--literally, "I will bring to mind" before all by
stigmatizing and punishing.

prating--with mere silly tattle.

neither doth he . . . receive the brethren--with hospitality. "The
brethren" are the missionaries on their journey.

forbiddeth them that would--receive them.

casteth them--those that would receive the brethren, by excommunication
from the Church, which his influence, as a leading man ([Jo3
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009).md) in it, enabled him to do. NEANDER
thinks that the missionaries were JEWS by birth, whence it is said in
their praise they took nothing from THE GENTILES: in contrast to other
Jewish missionaries who abused ministers' right of maintenance
elsewhere, as Paul tells us, [Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md); [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md), [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md), [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md). Now in the Gentile churches
there existed an ultra-Pauline party of anti-Jewish tendency, the
forerunners of Marcion: Diotrephes possibly stood at the head of this
party, which fact, as well as this domineering spirit, may account for
his hostility to the missionaries, and to the apostle John, who had, by
the power of love, tried to harmonize the various elements in the
Asiatic churches. At a later period, Marcion, we know, attached himself
to Paul alone, and paid no deference to the authority of John.

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

follow not that which is evil--as manifested in Diotrephes ([Jo3
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009).md).

but . . . good--as manifested in Demetrius ([Jo3
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012).md).

is of God--is born of God, who is good.

hath not seen God--spiritually, not literally.

[3 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo3 1:12</span></span>

of all men--who have had opportunity of knowing his character.

of the truth itself--The Gospel standard of truth bears witness to him
that he walks conformably to it, in acts of real love, hospitality to
the brethren (in contrast to Diotrephes), &c. Compare [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md) "He that doeth truth cometh to
the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in
God."

we also--besides the testimony of "all men," and "of the truth itself."

ye know--The oldest manuscripts read, "thou knowest."

[3 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo3 1:13</span></span>

I will not--rather as Greek, "I wish not . . . to write" more.

[3 John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo3 1:14</span></span>

face to face--Greek, "mouth to mouth."

Peace--peace inward of conscience, peace fraternal of friendship, peace
supernal of glory \[LYRA\].

friends--a title seldom used in the New Testament, as it is absorbed in
the higher titles of "brother, brethren." Still Christ recognizes the
relation of friend also, based on the highest grounds, obedience to Him
from love, and entailing the highest privileges, admission to the
intimacy of the holy and glorious God, and sympathizing Saviour; so
Christians have "friends" in Christ. Here in a friendly letter, mention
of "friends" appropriately occurs.

by name--not less than if their names were written \[BENGEL\].
