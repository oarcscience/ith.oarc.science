### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 8:1</span></span>

DAVID SUBDUES THE PHILISTINES, AND MAKES THE MOABITES TRIBUTARY. ([Sa2
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001).md)

David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines--that is,
Gath and her suburban towns ([Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md). That town had been "a bridle"
by which the Philistines kept the people of Judah in check. David used
it now as a barrier to repress that restless enemy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 8:2</span></span>

he smote Moab, and measured them with a line--This refers to a
well-known practice of Eastern kings, to command their prisoners of war,
particularly those who, notorious for the atrocity of their crimes or
distinguished by the indomitable spirit of their resistance, had greatly
incensed the victors, to lie down on the ground. Then a certain portion
of them, which was determined by lot, but most commonly by a
measuring-line, were put to death. Our version makes him put two-thirds
to death, and spare one-third. The Septuagint and Vulgate make one-half.
This war usage was not, perhaps, usually practised by the people of God;
but Jewish writers assert that the cause of this particular severity
against this people was their having massacred David's parents and
family, whom he had, during his exile, committed to the king of Moab.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 8:3</span></span>

HE SMITES HADADEZER AND THE SYRIANS. ([Sa2
8:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).md)

Zobah-- ([Ch1 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003).md). This kingdom was
bounded on the east by the Euphrates, and it extended westward from that
river, perhaps as far north as Aleppo. It was long the chief among the
petty kingdoms of Syria, and its king bore the hereditary title of
"Hadadezer" or "Hadarezer" ("Hadad," that is, "helped").

as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates--in accordance
with the promises God made to Israel that He would give them all the
country as far as the Euphrates ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md). In the first campaign David
signally defeated Hadadezer. Besides a great number of foot prisoners,
he took from him an immense amount of booty in chariots and horses.
Reserving only a small number of the latter, he hamstrung the rest. The
horses were thus mutilated because they were forbidden to the Hebrews,
both in war and agriculture. So it was of no use to keep them. Besides,
their neighbors placed much dependence on cavalry, but having, for want
of a native breed, to procure them by purchase, the greatest damage that
could be done to such enemies was to render their horses unserviceable
in war. (See also [Gen 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#006.md); [Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md), [Jos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#009).md). A king of Damascene-Syria came
to Hadadezer's succor; but David routed those auxiliary forces also,
took possession of their country, put garrisons into their fortified
towns, and made them tributary.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 8:9</span></span>

Toi king of Hamath--CÅ“le-Syria; northwards, it extended to the city
Hamath on the Orontes, which was the capital of the country. The Syrian
prince, being delivered from the dread of a dangerous neighbor, sent his
son with valuable presents to David to congratulate him on his
victories, and solicit his alliance and protection.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 8:10</span></span>

Joram--or Hadoram ([Ch1 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#010).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 8:11</span></span>

Which also king David did dedicate unto the Lord--Eastern princes have
always been accustomed to hoard up vast quantities of gold. This is the
first instance of a practice uniformly followed by David of reserving,
after defraying expenses and bestowing suitable rewards upon his
soldiers, the remainder of the spoil taken in war, to accumulate for the
grand project of his life--the erection of a national temple at
Jerusalem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 8:13</span></span>

David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
Syrians--Instead of Syrians, the Septuagint version reads "Edomites,"
which is the true reading, as is evident from [Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md). This conquest, made by the army
of David, was due to the skilful generalship and gallantry of Abishai
and Joab. ([Ch1 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md); compare [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001), title..md) The valley was the
ravine of salt (the Ghor), adjoining the Salt Mountain, at the
southwestern extremity of the Dead Sea, separating the ancient
territories of Judah and Edom \[ROBINSON\].

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 8:15</span></span>

HIS REIGN. ([Sa2 8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015).md)

David executed judgment and justice unto all his people--Though involved
in foreign wars, he maintained an excellent system of government at
home, the most eminent men of the age composing his cabinet of
ministers.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 8:16</span></span>

Joab . . . was over the host--by virtue of a special promise ([Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008).md).

recorder--historiographer or daily annalist, an office of great trust
and importance in Eastern countries.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 8:17</span></span>

Zadok . . . and Ahimelech . . . were the priests--On the massacre of the
priests at Nob, \[[Sa1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019.md)\], Saul
conferred the priesthood on Zadok, of the family of Eleazar ([Ch1
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050).md), while David acknowledged
Ahimelech, of Ithamar's family, who fled to him. The two high priests
exercised their office under the respective princes to whom they were
attached. But, on David's obtaining the kingdom over all Israel, they
both retained their dignity; Ahimelech officiating at Jerusalem, and
Zadok at Gibeon ([Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 8:18</span></span>

Cherethites--that is, Philistines ([Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005).md).

Pelethites--from Pelet ([Ch1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#003).md).
They were the valiant men who, having accompanied David during his exile
among the Philistines, were made his bodyguard.
