Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

[Luke 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 11:1</span></span>

THE DISCIPLES TAUGHT TO PRAY. ([Luk
11:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001))

one, &c.--struck with either the matter or the manner of our Lord's
prayers.

as John, &c.--From this reference to John, it is possible that disciple
had not heard the Sermon on the Mount. Nothing of John's inner teaching
(to his own disciples) has been preserved to us, but we may be sure he
never taught his disciples to say, "Our Father."

[Luke 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 11:2</span></span>

(See on [Mat 6:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)).

[Luke 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 11:3</span></span>

day by day, &c.--an extension of the petition in Matthew for "this
day's" supply, to every successive day's necessities. The closing
doxology, wanting here, is wanting also in all the best and most ancient
copies of Matthew's Gospel. Perhaps our Lord purposely left that part
open: and as the grand Jewish doxologies were ever resounding, and
passed immediately and naturally, in all their hallowed familiarity into
the Christian Church, probably this prayer was never used in the
Christian assemblies but in its present form, as we find it in Matthew,
while in Luke it has been allowed to stand as originally uttered.

[Luke 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 11:5</span></span>

at midnight . . . for a friend is come--The heat in warm countries makes
evening preferable to-day for travelling; but "midnight" is everywhere a
most unseasonable hour of call, and for that very reason it is here
selected.

[Luke 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 11:7</span></span>

Trouble me not--the trouble making him insensible both to the urgency of
the case and the claims of friendship.

I cannot--without exertion which he would not make.

[Luke 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 11:8</span></span>

importunity--The word is a strong one--"shamelessness"; persisting in
the face of all that seemed reasonable, and refusing to take a denial.

as many, &c.--His reluctance once overcome, all the claims of friendship
and necessity are felt to the full. The sense is obvious: If the
churlish and self-indulgent--deaf both to friendship and necessity--can
after a positive refusal, be won over, by sheer persistency, to do all
that is needed, how much more may the same determined perseverance in
prayer be expected to prevail with Him whose very nature is "rich unto
all that call upon Him" ([Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012)).

[Luke 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 11:9</span></span>

(See on [Mat 7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007).)

[Luke 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 11:13</span></span>

the Holy Spirit--in Matthew ([Mat
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011)), "good gifts"; the former, the
Gift of gifts descending on the Church through Christ, and comprehending
the latter.

[Luke 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 11:14</span></span>

BLIND AND DUMB DEMONIAC HEALED--CHARGE OF BEING IN LEAGUE WITH HELL, AND
REPLY--DEMAND OF A SIGN, AND REPLY. (Luke 11:14-36)

dumb--blind also ([Mat 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022)).

[Luke 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 11:20</span></span>

the finger of God--"the Spirit of God" ([Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028)); the former figuratively
denoting the power of God, the latter the living Personal Agent in every
exercise of it.

[Luke 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 11:21</span></span>

strong man--meaning Satan.

armed--pointing to all the subtle and varied methods by which he wields
his dark power over men.

keepeth--"guardeth."

his palace--man whether viewed more largely or in individual souls--how
significant of what men are to Satan!

in peace--undisturbed, secure in his possession.

[Luke 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 11:22</span></span>

a stronger than he--Christ: Glorious title, in relation to Satan!

come upon him and overcome him--sublimely expressing the Redeemer's
approach, as the Seed of the woman, to bruise the Serpent's head.

taketh from him all his armour--"his panoply," "his complete armor."
Vain would be the victory, were not the means of regaining his lost
power wrested from him. It is this that completes the triumph and
ensures the final overthrow of his kingdom. The parable that immediately
follows ([Luk 11:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024)) is just the
reverse of this. (See on [Mat
12:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043).) In the one case, Satan is
dislodged by Christ, and so finds, in all future assaults, the house
preoccupied; in the other, he merely goes out and comes in again,
finding the house "EMPTY" ([Mat 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#044))
of any rival, and all ready to welcome him back. This explains the
important saying that comes in between the two parables ([Luk
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023)). Neutrality in religion there
is none. The absence of positive attachment to Christ involves hostility
to Him.

[Luke 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 11:23</span></span>

gathereth . . . scattereth--referring probably to gleaners. The meaning
seems to be, Whatever in religion is disconnected from Christ comes to
nothing.

[Luke 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 11:27</span></span>

as he spake these things, a . . . woman of the company--of the
multitude, the crowd. A charming little incident and profoundly
instructive. With true womanly feeling, she envies the mother of such a
wonderful Teacher. Well, and higher and better than she had said as much
before her ([Luk 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028), [Luk
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042)); and our Lord is far from
condemning it. He only holds up--as "blessed rather"--the hearers and
keepers of God's word; in other words, the humblest real saint of God.
(See on [Mat 12:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049).) How utterly
alien is this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which
would excommunicate any one of its members who dared to talk in the
spirit of this glorious saying! (Also see on [Mat
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043).)

[Luke 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 11:29</span></span>

(See on [Mat 12:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039).)

[Luke 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 11:33</span></span>

(See on [Mat 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014); [Mat
6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022).) But [Luk
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036) here is peculiarly vivid,
expressing what pure, beautiful, broad perceptions the clarity of the
inward eye imparts.

[Luke 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 11:38</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF THE PHARISEES. (Luke 11:37-54)

marvelled, &c.--(See [Mar 7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002)).

[Luke 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 11:39</span></span>

cup and platter--remarkable example of our Lord's way of drawing the
most striking illustrations of great truths from the most familiar
objects and incidents of life.

ravening--rapacity.

[Luke 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 11:40</span></span>

that which is without, &c.--that is, He to whom belongs the outer life,
and right to demand its subjection to Himself--is the inner man less
His?

[Luke 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 11:41</span></span>

give alms . . . and . . . all . . . clean--a principle of immense value.
As the greed of these hypocrites was one of the most prominent features
of their character ([Luk 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014); [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014)), our Lord bids them exemplify
the opposite character, and then their outside, ruled by this, would be
beautiful in the eye of God, and their meals would be eaten with clean
hands, though never so fouled with the business of this worky world.
(See [Ecc 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007)).

[Luke 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 11:42</span></span>

mint . . . rue, &c.--rounding on [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030), which they interpreted rigidly.
Our Lord purposely names the most trifling products of the earth, as
examples of what they punctiliously exacted the tenth of.

judgment and the love of God--in [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025), "judgment, mercy, and faith."
The reference is to [Mic 6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006), whose
third element of all acceptable religion, "walking humbly with God,"
comprehends both "love" and "faith." (See on [Mar
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029); [Mar
12:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032)). The same tendency to merge
greater duties in less besets us still, but it is the characteristic of
hypocrites.

these ought ye, &c.--There is no need for one set of duties to jostle
out another; but of the greater, our Lord says, "Ye ought to have done"
them; of the lesser, only "ye ought not to leave them undone."

[Luke 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 11:43</span></span>

uppermost seats--(See on [Luk
14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007)).

greetings--(See on [Mat 23:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007)).

[Luke 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 11:44</span></span>

appear not, &c.--As one might unconsciously walk over a grave concealed
from view, and thus contract ceremonial defilement, so the plausible
exterior of the Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution they
contracted from coming in contact with such corrupt characters. (See
[Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009); [Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013); a different illustration from
[Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027)).

[Luke 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 11:46</span></span>

burdens grievous, &c.--referring not so much to the irksomeness of the
legal rites (though they were irksome, [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010)), as to the heartless rigor with
which they were enforced, and by men of shameless inconsistency.

[Luke 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 11:47</span></span>

ye build, &c.--Out of pretended respect and honor, they repaired and
beautified the sepulchres of the prophets, and with whining hypocrisy
said, "If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have
been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets," while all the
time they "were witnesses to themselves that they were the children of
them that killed the prophets" ([Mat
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029)); convicting themselves daily
of as exact a resemblance in spirit and character to the very classes
over whose deeds they pretended to mourn, as child to parent.

[Luke 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 11:49</span></span>

said the wisdom, &c.--a remarkable variation of the words in [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034), "Behold I SEND." As there seems
plainly an allusion to ancient warnings of what God would do with so
incorrigible a people, so here Christ, stepping majestically into the
place of God, so to speak, says, "Now I am going to carry all that out."
Could this be other than the Lord of Israel in the flesh?

[Luke 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 11:50</span></span>

all . . . required of this generation--As it was only in the last
generation of them that "the iniquity of the Amorites was full" ([Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016)), and then the abominations of
ages were at once completely and awfully avenged, so the iniquity of
Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age till in that generation
it came to the full, and the whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke
at once over its devoted head. In the first French Revolution the same
awful principle was exemplified, and Christendom has not done with it
yet.

prophets--in the New Testament sense ([Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034); see [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)).

[Luke 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 11:51</span></span>

blood of Zacharias--Probably the allusion is not to any recent murder,
but to [Ch2 24:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020), as the last
recorded and most suitable case for illustration. And as Zacharias' last
words were, "The Lord require it," so they are warned that "of that
generation it should be required."

[Luke 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 11:52</span></span>

key of knowledge--not the key to open knowledge, but knowledge, the only
key to open heaven. In [Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013),
they are accused of shutting heaven; here of taking away the key, which
was worse. A right knowledge of God's Word is eternal life ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)); but this they took away from
the people, substituting for it their wretched traditions.

[Luke 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 11:53</span></span>

Exceedingly vivid and affecting. They were stung to the quick--and can
we wonder?--yet had not materials for the charge they were preparing
against Him.

provoke him, &c.--"to harass Him with questions."
