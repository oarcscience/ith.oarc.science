### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

To praise for God's favor to His people is added a prayer for its
continued manifestation. ([Psa
126:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001))

When the Lord, &c.--The joy of those returned from Babylon was ecstatic,
and elicited the admiration even of the heathen, as illustrating God's
great power and goodness.

turned again the captivity--that is, restored from it ([Job
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#012); [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007); [Pro
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#014)). HENGSTENBERG translates: "When
the Lord turned Himself to the turning of Zion" (see Margin), God
returns to His people when they return to Him ([Deu
30:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#002)).

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

All did not return at once; hence the prayer for repeated favors.

as the streams in the south--or, the torrents in the desert south of
Judea, dependent on rain ([Jos 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009)),
reappearing after dry seasons (compare [Job
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015); [Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009)). The point of comparison is joy
at the reappearing of what has been so painfully missed.

[Psalms 126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 126:5</span></span>

As in husbandry the sower may cast his seed in a dry and parched soil
with desponding fears, so those shall reap abundant fruit who toil in
tears with the prayer of faith. (Compare the history, [Ezr
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#016), [Ezr
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022)).

[Psalms 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 126:6</span></span>

He that goeth forth--literally, better, "He goes--he comes, he comes,"
&c. The repetition implies there is no end of weeping here, as there
shall be no end of joy hereafter ([Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010)).

precious seed--rather, seed to be drawn from the seed box for sowing;
literally, "seed-draught." Compare on this Psalm, [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009), &c.
