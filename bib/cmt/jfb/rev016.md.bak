### [Revelation Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 16:1</span></span>

THE SEVEN VIALS AND THE CONSEQUENT PLAGUES. (Rev. 16:1-21)

a great voice--namely, God's. These seven vials (the detailed expansion
of the vintage, [Rev 14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018).md) being
called "the last," must belong to the period just when the term of the
beast's power has expired (whence reference is made in them all to the
worshippers of the beast as the objects of the judgments), close to the
end or coming of the Son of man. The first four are distinguished from
the last three, just as in the case of the seven seals and the seven
trumpets. The first four are more general, affecting the earth, the sea,
springs, and the sun, not merely a portion of these natural bodies, as
in the case of the trumpets, but the whole of them; the last three are
more particular, affecting the throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and
the grand consummation. Some of these particular judgments are set forth
in detail in the seventeenth through twentieth chapters.

out of the temple--B and Syriac omit. But A, C, Vulgate, and ANDREAS
support the words.

the vials--so Syriac and Coptic. But A, B, C, Vulgate, and ANDREAS read,
"the seven vials."

upon--Greek, "into."

[Revelation 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 16:2</span></span>

went--Greek, "went away."

poured out--So the angel cast fire into the earth previous to the series
of trumpets ([Rev 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005).md).

upon--so Coptic. But A, B, C, Vulgate, and Syriac read, "into."

noisome--literally, "evil" (compare [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), [Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035).md). The very same Greek word is
used in the Septuagint as here, Greek, "helkos." The reason why the
sixth Egyptian plague is the first here is because it was directed
against the Egyptian magicians, Jannes and Jambres, so that they could
not stand before Moses; and so here the plague is sent upon those who in
the beast worship had practiced sorcery. As they submitted to the mark
of the beast, so they must bear the mark of the avenging God. Contrast
[Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md); [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md), [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md).

grievous--distressing to the sufferers.

sore upon the men--antitype to the sixth Egyptian plague.

which had the mark of the beast--Therefore this first vial is subsequent
to the period of the beast's rule.

[Revelation 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 16:3</span></span>

angel--So B and ANDREAS. But A, C, and Vulgate omit it.

upon--Greek, "into."

became as . . . blood--answering to another Egyptian plague.

of a dead man--putrefying.

living soul--So B and ANDREAS. But A, C, and Syriac, "soul of life"
(compare [Gen 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030.md); [Gen
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021).md).

in the sea--So B and ANDREAS. But A, C, and Syriac read, "(as respects)
the things in the sea."

[Revelation 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 16:4</span></span>

([Exo 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020)..md)

angel--so Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS. But A, B, C, and Vulgate omit it.

[Revelation 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 16:5</span></span>

angel of the waters--that is, presiding over the waters.

O Lord--omitted by A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS.

and shalt be--A, B, C, Vulgate, and ANDREAS for this clause read,
"(which art and wast) holy." The Lord is now no longer He that shall
come, for He is come in vengeance and therefore the third of the three
clauses found in [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md); [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md) is here and in [Rev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017.md) omitted.

judged thus--literally, "these things." "Thou didst inflict this
judgment."

[Revelation 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 16:6</span></span>

([Rev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md), end; [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md); [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026)..md) An anticipation of [Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md), [Rev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#024.md); compare [Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md).

For--A, B, C, and ANDREAS omit.

[Revelation 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 16:7</span></span>

another out of--omitted in A, C, Syriac, and Coptic. Translate then, "I
heard the altar \[personified\] saying." On it the prayers of saints are
presented before God: beneath it are the souls of the martyrs crying for
vengeance on the foes of God.

[Revelation 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 16:8</span></span>

angel--so Coptic and ANDREAS. But A, B, C, Vulgate, and Syriac omit it.

upon--not as in [Rev 16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md), "into."

sun--Whereas by the fourth trumpet the sun is darkened ([Rev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#012).md) in a third part, here by the
fourth vial the sun's bright scorching power is intensified.

power was given unto him--rather, "unto it," the sun.

men--Greek, "the men," namely, those who had the mark of the beast ([Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002).md).

[Revelation 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 16:9</span></span>

men--Greek, "the men."

repented not to give him glory-- ([Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020).md). Affliction, if it does not
melt, hardens the sinner. Compare the better result on others, [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md); [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md); [Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 16:10</span></span>

angel--omitted by A, B, C, Vulgate, and Syriac. But Coptic and ANDREAS
support it.

seat--Greek, "throne of the beast": set up in arrogant mimicry of God's
throne; the dragon gave his throne to the beast ([Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002).md).

darkness--parallel to the Egyptian plague of darkness, Pharaoh being the
type of Antichrist (compare Notes, see on [Rev
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md); compare the fifth trumpet,
[Rev 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#002).md).

gnawed their tongues for pain--Greek, "owing to the pain" occasioned by
the previous plagues, rendered more appalling by the darkness. Or, as
"gnashing of teeth" is one of the accompaniments of hell, so this
"gnawing of their tongues" is through rage at the baffling of their
hopes and the overthrow of their kingdom. They meditate revenge and are
unable to effect it; hence their frenzy \[GROTIUS\]. Those in anguish,
mental and bodily, bite their lips and tongues.

[Revelation 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 16:11</span></span>

sores--This shows that each fresh plague was accompanied with the
continuance of the preceding plagues: there was an accumulation, not a
mere succession, of plagues.

repented not--(Compare [Rev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009).md).

[Revelation 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 16:12</span></span>

angel--so Coptic and ANDREAS. A, B, C, Vulgate, and Syriac omit.

kings of the east--Greek, "the kings who are from the rising of the
sun." Reference to the Euphrates similarly occurs in the sixth trumpet.
The drying up of the Euphrates, I think, is to be taken figuratively, as
Babylon itself, which is situated on it, is undoubtedly so, [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md). The waters of the Euphrates
(compare [Isa 8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).md) are spiritual
Babylon's, that is, the apostate Church's (of which Rome is the chief,
though not exclusive representative) spiritual and temporal powers. The
drying up of the waters of Babylon expresses the same thing as the ten
kings stripping, eating, and burning the whore. The phrase, "way may be
prepared for," is that applied to the Lord's coming ([Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md); [Luk
1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076).md). He shall come from the East
([Mat 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md); [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md), "the glory of the God of Israel
came from the way of the East"): not alone, for His elect transfigured
saints of Israel and the Gentiles shall accompany Him, who are "kings
and priests unto God" ([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md). As
the Antichristian ten kings accompany the beast, so the saints accompany
as kings the King of kings to the last decisive conflict. DE BURGH and
others take it of the Jews, who also were designed to be a kingdom of
priests to God on earth. They shall, doubtless, become priest-kings in
the flesh to the nations in the flesh at His coming. Abraham from the
East (if [Isa 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md), [Isa
41:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008), refers to him, and not Cyrus.md)
conquering the Chaldean kings is a type of Israel's victorious
restoration to the priest-kingdom. Israel's exodus after the last
Egyptian plagues typifies Israel's restoration after the spiritual
Babylon, the apostate Church, has been smitten. Israel's promotion to
the priest-kingdom after Pharaoh's downfall, and at the Lord's descent
at Sinai to establish the theocracy, typifies the restored kingdom of
Israel at the Lord's more glorious descent, when Antichrist shall be
destroyed utterly. Thus, besides the transfigured saints, Israel
secondarily may be meant by "the kings from the East" who shall
accompany the "King of kings" returning "from the way of the East" to
reign over His ancient people. As to the drying up again of the waters
opposing His people's assuming the kingdom, compare [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); [Zac
10:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md). The name Israel ([Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028).md) implies a prince with God.
Compare [Mic 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md) as to the return of
the kingdom to Jerusalem. DURHAM, several centuries ago, interpreted the
drying up of the Euphrates to mean the wasting away of the Turkish
power, which has heretofore held Palestine, and so the way being
prepared for Israel's restoration. But as Babylon refers to the apostate
Church, not to Mohammedanism, the drying up of the Euphrates (answering
to Cyrus' overthrow of literal Babylon by marching into it through the
dry channel of the Euphrates) must answer to the draining off of the
apostate Church's resources, the Roman and Greek corrupt Church having
been heretofore one of the greatest barriers by its idolatries and
persecutions in the way of Israel's restoration and conversion. The
kings of the earth who are earthly ([Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md), stand in contrast to the kings
from the East who are heavenly.

[Revelation 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 16:13</span></span>

unclean spirits like frogs--the antitype to the plague of frogs sent on
Egypt. The presence of the "unclean spirit" in the land (Palestine) is
foretold, [Zac 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002.md), in connection
with idolatrous prophets. Beginning with infidelity as to Jesus Christ's
coming in the flesh, men shall end in the grossest idolatry of the
beast, the incarnation of all that is self-deifying and God-opposed in
the world powers of all ages; having rejected Him that came in the
Father's name, they shall worship one that comes in his own, though
really the devil's representative; as frogs croak by night in marshes
and quagmires, so these unclean spirits in the darkness of error teach
lies amidst the mire of filthy lusts. They talk of liberty, but it is
not Gospel liberty, but license for lust. There being three, as also
seven, in the description of the last and worst state of the Jewish
nation, implies a parody of the two divine numbers, three of the
Trinity, and seven of the Holy Spirit ([Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004).md). Some observe that three frogs
were the original arms of France, a country which has been the center of
infidelity, socialism, and false spiritualism. A and B read, "as it were
frogs," instead of "like frogs," which is not supported by manuscripts.
The unclean spirit out of the mouth of the dragon symbolizes the proud
infidelity which opposes God and Christ. That out of the beast's mouth
is the spirit of the world, which in the politics of men, whether
lawless democracy or despotism, sets man above God. That out of the
mouth of the false prophet is lying spiritualism and religious delusion,
which shall take the place of the harlot when she shall have been
destroyed.

the dragon--Satan, who gives his power and throne ([Rev
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002).md) to the beast.

false prophet--distinct from the harlot, the apostate Church (of which
Rome is the chief, though not sole, representative), [Rev
17:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md), [Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md); and identical with the second
beast, [Rev 13:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md), as appears by
comparing [Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md) with [Rev
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013.md); ultimately consigned to the
lake of fire with the first beast; as is also the dragon a little later
([Rev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md). The dragon, the beast,
and the false prophet, "the mystery of iniquity," form a blasphemous
Antitrinity, the counterfeit of "the mystery of godliness" God manifests
in Christ, witnessed to by the Spirit. The dragon acts the part of God
the Father, assigning his authority to his representative the beast, as
the Father assigns His to the Son. They are accordingly jointly
worshipped; compare as to the Father and Son, [Joh
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md); as the ten-horned beast has its
ten horns crowned with diadems (Greek, [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md), so Christ has on His head many
diadems. While the false prophet, like the Holy Ghost, speaks not of
himself, but tells all men to worship the beast, and confirms his
testimony to the beast by miracles, as the Holy Ghost attested similarly
to Christ's divine mission.

[Revelation 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 16:14</span></span>

devils--Greek, "demons."

working miracles--Greek, "signs."

go forth unto--or "for," that is, to tempt them to the battle with
Christ.

the kings of the earth and, &c.--A, B, Syriac, and ANDREAS omit "of the
earth and," which clause is not in any manuscript. Translate, "kings of
the whole habitable world," who are "of this world," in contrast to "the
kings of (from) the East" (the sun-rising), [Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md), namely, the saints to whom
Christ has appointed a kingdom, and who are "children of light." God, in
permitting Satan's miracles, as in the case of the Egyptian magicians
who were His instruments in hardening Pharaoh's heart, gives the
reprobate up to judicial delusion preparatory to their destruction. As
Aaron's rod was changed into a serpent, so were those of the Egyptian
magicians. Aaron turned the water into blood; so did the magicians.
Aaron brought up frogs; so did the magicians. With the frogs their power
ceased. So this, or whatever is antitypical to it, will be the last
effort of the dragon, beast, and false prophet.

battle--Greek, "war"; the final conflict for the kingship of the world
described in [Rev 19:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md).

[Revelation 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 16:15</span></span>

The gathering of the world kings with the beast against the Lamb is the
signal for Christ's coming; therefore He here gives the charge to be
watching for His coming and clothed in the garments of justification and
sanctification, so as to be accepted.

thief-- ([Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md).

they--saints and angels.

shame--literally, "unseemliness" (Greek, "aschemosunee"): Greek, [Co1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005.md) : a different word from the Greek
in [Rev 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018) (Greek, "aischunee".md).

[Revelation 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 16:16</span></span>

he--rather, "they (the three unclean spirits) gathered them together."
If English Version be retained, "He" will refer to God who gives them
over to the delusion of the three unclean spirits; or else the sixth
angel ([Rev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012).md).

Armageddon--Hebrew, "Har," a mountain, and "Megiddo" in Manasseh in
Galilee, the scene of the overthrow of the Canaanite kings by God's
miraculous interposition under Deborah and Barak; the same as the great
plain of Esdraelon. Josiah, too, as the ally of Babylon, was defeated
and slain at Megiddo; and the mourning of the Jews at the time just
before God shall interpose for them against all the nations confederate
against Jerusalem, is compared to the mourning for Josiah at Megiddo.
Megiddo comes from a root, gadad, "cut off," and means slaughter.
Compare [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), [Joe
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012.md), [Joe
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md), where "the valley of
Jehoshaphat" (meaning in Hebrew, "judgment of God") is mentioned as the
scene of God's final vengeance on the God-opposing foe. Probably some
great plain, antitypical to the valleys of Megiddo and Jehoshaphat, will
be the scene.

[Revelation 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 16:17</span></span>

angel--so ANDREAS. But A, B, Vulgate, and Syriac omit it.

into--so ANDREAS (Greek, "eis"). But A and B, "upon" (Greek, "epi").

great--so B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS. But A omits.

of heaven--so B and ANDREAS But A, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic omit.

It is done--"It is come to pass." God's voice as to the final
consummation, as Jesus' voice on the cross when the work of expiation
was completed, "It is finished."

[Revelation 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 16:18</span></span>

voice . . . thunders . . . lightnings--A has the order, "lightnings . .
. voices . . . thunders." This is the same close as that of the seven
seals and the seven thunders; but with the difference that they do not
merely form the conclusion, but introduce the consequence, of the last
vial, namely, the utter destruction of Babylon and then of the
Antichristian armies.

earthquake--which is often preceded by a lurid state of air, such as
would result from the vial poured upon it.

men were--so B, Vulgate, Syriac, and ANDREAS. But A and Coptic read, "A
man was."

so mighty--Greek, "such."

[Revelation 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 16:19</span></span>

the great city--the capital and seat of the apostate Church, spiritual
Babylon (of which Rome is the representative, if one literal city be
meant). The city in [Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md) (see on
[Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008).md), is probably distinct,
namely, Jerusalem under Antichrist (the beast, who is distinct from the
harlot or apostate Church). In [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md) only a tenth of Jerusalem falls
whereas here the city (Babylon) "became (Greek) into three parts" by the
earthquake.

cities of the nations--other great cities in league with spiritual
Babylon.

great . . . came in remembrance--Greek, "Babylon the great was
remembered" ([Rev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005).md). It is now
that the last call to escape from Babylon is given to God's people in
her ([Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004).md).

fierceness--the boiling over outburst of His wrath (Greek, "thumou
orgees"), compare Note, see on [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 16:20</span></span>

Plainly parallel to [Rev 6:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014.md), and
by anticipation descriptive of the last judgment.

the mountains--rather as Greek, "there were found no mountains."

[Revelation 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 16:21</span></span>

fell--Greek, "descends."

upon men--Greek, "the men."

and men blasphemed God--not those struck who died, but the rest. Unlike
the result in the case of Jerusalem ([Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013).md), where "the remnant . . .
affrighted . . . gave glory to the God of heaven."

was--Greek, "is."
