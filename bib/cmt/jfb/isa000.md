### [Isaiah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 0:0</span></span>

ISAIAH, son of Amoz (not Amos); contemporary of Jonah, Amos, Hosea, in
Israel, but younger than they; and of Micah, in Judah. His call to a
higher degree of the prophetic office ([Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md) is assigned to the last year
of Uzziah, that is, 754 B.C. The first through fifth chapters belong to
the closing years of that reign; not, as some think, to Jotham's reign:
in the reign of the latter he seems to have exercised his office only
orally, and not to have left any record of his prophecies because they
were not intended for all ages. The first through fifth and sixth
chapters are all that was designed for the Church universal of the
prophecies of the first twenty years of his office. New historical
epochs, such as occurred in the reigns of Ahaz and Hezekiah, when the
affairs of Israel became interwoven with those of the Asiatic empires,
are marked by prophetic writings. The prophets had now to interpret the
judgments of the Lord, so as to make the people conscious of His
punitive justice, as also of His mercy. Isa. 7:1-10:4 belong to the
reign of Ahaz. The thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters are
historical, reaching to the fifteenth year of Hezekiah; probably the
tenth through twelfth chapters and all from the thirteenth through
twenty-sixth chapters, inclusive, belong to the same reign; the
historical section being appended to facilitate the right understanding
of these prophecies; thus we have Isaiah's office extending from about
760 to 713 B.C., forty-seven years. Tradition (Talmud) represents him as
having been sawn asunder by Manasseh with a wooden saw, for having said
that he had seen Jehovah ([Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md);
[Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037).md). [Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md) seems to imply that Isaiah
survived Hezekiah; but "first and last" is not added, as in [Ch2
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md), which makes it possible that
his history of Hezekiah was only carried up to a certain point. The
second part, the fortieth through sixty-sixth chapters, containing
complaints of gross idolatry, needs not to be restricted to Manasseh's
reign, but is applicable to previous reigns. At the accession of
Manasseh, Isaiah would be eighty-four; and if he prophesied for eight
years afterwards, he must have endured martyrdom at ninety-two; so Hosea
prophesied for sixty years. And Eastern tradition reports that he lived
to one hundred and twenty. The conclusive argument against the tradition
is that, according to the inscription, all Isaiah's prophecies are
included in the time from Uzziah to Hezekiah; and the internal evidence
accords with this.

His WIFE is called the prophetess \[[Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md)\], that is, endowed, as Miriam,
with a prophetic gift.

His CHILDREN were considered by him as not belonging merely to himself;
in their names, Shearjashub, "the remnant shall return" \[[Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md), Margin\], and
Maher-shalal-hash-baz, "speeding to the spoil, he hasteth to the prey"
\[[Isa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md), Margin\], the two chief
points of his prophecies are intimated to the people, the judgments of
the Lord on the people and the world, and yet His mercy to the elect.

His GARMENT of sackcloth ([Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002).md),
too, was a silent preaching by fact; he appears as the embodiment of
that repentance which he taught.

His HISTORICAL WORKS.--History, as written by the prophets, is
retroverted prophecy. As the past and future alike proceed from the
essence of God, an inspired insight into the past implies an insight
into the future, and vice versa. Hence most of the Old Testament
histories are written by prophets and are classed with their writings;
the Chronicles being not so classed, cannot have been written by them,
but are taken from historical monographs of theirs; for example,
Isaiah's life of Uzziah, [Ch2 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md);
also of Hezekiah, [Ch2 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md); of these
latter all that was important for all ages has been preserved to us,
while the rest, which was local and temporary, has been lost.

The INSCRIPTION ([Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md) applies to
the whole book and implies that Isaiah is the author of the second part
(the fortieth through sixty-sixth chapters), as well as of the first.
Nor do the words, "concerning Judah and Jerusalem" \[[Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)\], oppose the idea that the
inscription applies to the whole; for whatever he says against other
nations, he says on account of their relation to Judah. So the
inscription of Amos, "concerning Israel" \[[Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)\], though several prophecies
follow against foreign nations. EWALD maintains that the fortieth
through sixty-sixth chapters, though spurious, were subjoined to the
previous portion, in order to preserve the former. But it is untrue that
the first portion is unconnected with those chapters. The former ends
with the Babylonian exile ([Isa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006).md),
the latter begins with the coming redemption from it. The portion, the
fortieth through forty-sixth chapters, has no heading of its own, a
proof that it is closely connected with what precedes, and falls under
the general heading in [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md).
JOSEPHUS (The Antiquities of the Jews, 11. 1, sec. 1, 2) says that Cyrus
was induced by the prophecies of Isaiah ([Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md) to aid the Jews in returning
and rebuilding the temple [Ezr 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)
confirms this; Cyrus in his edict there plainly refers to the prophecies
in the second portion, which assign the kingdoms to him from Jehovah,
and the duty of rebuilding the temple. Probably he took from them his
historical name Cyrus (Coresh). Moreover, subsequent prophets imitate
this second portion, which EWALD assigns to later times; for example,
compare Jer. 50:1-51:64 with Isaiah's predictions against Babylon \[Isa.
13:1-14:23\]. "The Holy One of Israel," occurring but three times
elsewhere in the Old Testament \[[Kg2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022.md); [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041.md); [Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018.md); [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md); [Jer
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md)\], is a favorite expression in
the second, as in the first portion of Isaiah: it expresses God's
covenant faithfulness in fulfilling the promises therein: Jeremiah
borrows the expression from him. Also Ecclesiasticus 48:22-25
("comforted"), quotes [Isa 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md) as
Isaiah's. [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md) quotes [Isa
61:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md) as Isaiah's, and as read as
such by Jesus Christ in the synagogue.

The DEFINITENESS of the prophecies is striking: As in the second portion
of isaiah, so in [Mic 4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md), the
Babylonian exile, and the deliverance from it, are foretold a hundred
fifty years before any hostilities had arisen between Babylon and Judah.
On the other hand, all the prophets who foretell the Assyrian invasion
coincide in stating, that Judah should be delivered from it, not by
Egyptian aid, but directly by the Lord. Again Jeremiah, in the height of
the Chaldean prosperity, foretold its conquest by the Medes, who should
enter Babylon through the dry bed of the Euphrates on a night of general
revelry. No human calculation could have discovered these facts. EICHORN
terms these prophecies "veiled historical descriptions," recognizing in
spite of himself that they are more than general poetical fancies. The
fifty-third chapter of Isaiah was certainly written ages before the
Messiah, yet it minutely portrays His sufferings: these cannot be Jewish
inventions, for the Jews looked for a reigning, not a suffering,
Messiah.

Rationalists are so far right that THE PROPHECIES ARE ON A GENERAL BASIS
whereby they are distinguished from soothsaying. They rest on the
essential idea of God. The prophets, penetrated by this inner knowledge
of His character, became conscious of the eternal laws by which the
world is governed: that sin is man's ruin, and must be followed by
judgment, but that God's covenant mercy to His elect is unchangeable.
Without prophetism, the elect remnant would have decreased, and even
God's judgments would have missed their end, by not being recognized as
such: they would have been unmeaning, isolated facts. Babylon was in
Isaiah's days under Assyria; it had tried a revolt unsuccessfully: but
the elements of its subsequent success and greatness were then existing.
The Holy Ghost enlightened his natural powers to discern this its rise;
and his spiritual faculties, to foresee its fall, the sure consequence,
in God's eternal law, of the pride which pagan success generates--and
also Judah's restoration, as the covenant-people, with whom God,
according to His essential character, would not be wroth for ever. True
conversion is the prophet's grand remedy against all evils: in this
alone consists his politics. Rebuke, threatening, and promise, regularly
succeed one another. The idea at the basis of all is in [Isa
26:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md); [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md); [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md).

The USE OF THE PRESENT AND PRETERITE in prophecy is no proof that the
author is later than Isaiah. For seers view the future as present, and
indicate what is ideally past, not really past; seeing things in the
light of God, who "calls the things that are not as though they were."
Moreover, as in looking from a height on a landscape, hills seem close
together which are really wide apart, so, in events foretold, the order,
succession, and grouping are presented, but the intervals of time are
overlooked. The time, however, is sometimes marked ([Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md). Thus the deliverance from
Babylon, and that effected by Messiah, are in rapid transition grouped
together by THE LAW OF PROPHETIC SUGGESTION; yet no prophet so confounds
the two as to make Messiah the leader of Israel from Babylon. To the
prophet there was probably no double sense; but to his spiritual eye the
two events, though distinct, lay so near, and were so analogous, that he
could not separate them in description without unfaithfulness to the
picture presented before him. The more remote and antitypical event,
however, namely, Messiah's coming, is that to which he always hastens,
and which he describes with far more minuteness than he does the nearer
type; for example, Cyrus (compare [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md) with [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001).md). In some cases he takes his
stand in the midst of events between, for example, the humiliation of
Jesus Christ, which he views as past, and His glorification, as yet to
come, using the future tense as to the latter (compare [Isa
53:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md) with [Isa
53:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). Marks of the time of events
are given sparingly in the prophets: yet, as to Messiah, definitely
enough to create the general expectation of Him at the time that He was
in fact born.

The CHALDÃ†ISMS alleged against the genuineness of the second portion of
Isaiah, are found more in the first and undoubted portion. They occur in
all the Old Testament, especially in the poetical parts, which prefer
unusual expressions, and are due to the fact that the patriarchs were
surrounded by Chaldee-speaking people; and in Isaiah's time a few
Chaldee words had crept in from abroad.

His SYMBOLS are few and simple, and his poetical images correct; in the
prophets, during and after the exile, the reverse holds good; Haggai and
Malachi are not exceptions; for, though void of bold images, their
style, unlike Isaiah's, rises little above prose: a clear proof that our
Isaiah was long before the exile.

Of VISIONS, strictly so called, he has but one, that in the sixth
chapter; even it is more simple than those in later prophets. But he
often gives SIGNS, that is, a present fact as pledge of the more distant
future; God condescending to the feebleness of man ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); [Isa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030.md); [Isa
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#007).md).

The VARIETIES IN HIS STYLE do not prove spuriousness, but that he varied
his style with his subject. The second portion is not so much addressed
to his contemporaries, as to the future people of the Lord, the elect
remnant, purified by the previous judgments. Hence its tenderness of
style, and frequent repetitions ([Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md): for comforting exhortation uses
many words; so also the many epithets added to the name of God, intended
as stays whereon faith may rest for comfort, so as not to despair. In
both portions alike there are peculiarities characteristic of Isaiah;
for example, "to be called" equivalent to to be: the repetition of the
same words, instead of synonyms, in the parallel members of verses; the
interspersing of his prophecies with hymns: "the remnant of olive
trees," &c., for the remnant of people who have escaped God's judgments.
Also compare [Isa 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025.md) with [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md).

The CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT favors the opinion that Isaiah himself
collected his prophecies into the volume; not Hezekiah's men, as the
Talmud guesses from [Pro 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md). All the
portions, the dates of which can be ascertained, stand in the right
place, except a few instances, where prophecies of similar contents are
placed together: with the termination of the Assyrian invasion (the
thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters) terminated the public life
of Isaiah. The second part is his prophetic legacy to the small band of
the faithful, analogous to the last speeches of Moses and of Jesus
Christ to His chosen disciples.

The EXPECTATION OF MESSIAH is so strong in Isaiah, that JEROME To
Paulinus calls his book not a prophecy, but the gospel: "He is not so
much a prophet as an evangelist." Messiah was already shadowed forth in
[Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), as the Shiloh, or
tranquillizer; also in Psalms 2, 45, 72, 110. Isaiah brings it out more
definitely; and, whereas they dwelt on His kingly office, Isaiah
develops most His priestly and prophetic office; the hundred tenth Psalm
also had set forth His priesthood, but His kingly rather than, as
Isaiah, His suffering, priesthood. The latter is especially dwelt on in
the second part, addressed to the faithful elect; whereas the first
part, addressed to the whole people, dwells on Messiah's glory, the
antidote to the fears which then filled the people, and the assurance
that the kingdom of God, then represented by Judah, would not be
overwhelmed by the surrounding nations.

His STYLE (HENGSTENBERG, Christology of the Old Testament,) is simple
and sublime; in imagery, intermediate between the poverty of Jeremiah
and the exuberance of Ezekiel. He shows his command of it in varying it
to suit his subject.

The FORM is mostly that of Hebrew poetical parallelism, with, however, a
freedom unshackled by undue restrictions.

JUDAH, the less apostate people, rather than Israel, was the subject of
his prophecies: his residence was mostly at Jerusalem. On his praises,
see Ecclesiasticus 48:22-25. Christ and the apostles quote no prophet so
frequently.
