### [Psalms Chapter 119](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 119:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 119:1</span></span>

ALEPH. ([Psa 119:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001).md).

This celebrated Psalm has several peculiarities. It is divided into
twenty-two parts or stanzas, denoted by the twenty-two letters of the
Hebrew alphabet. Each stanza contains eight verses, and the first letter
of each verse is that which gives name to the stanza. Its contents are
mainly praises of God's Word, exhortations to its perusal, and reverence
for it, prayers for its proper influence, and complaints of the wicked
for despising it. There are but two verses ([Psa
119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122.md), [Psa
119:132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132).md) which do not contain some
term or description of God's Word. These terms are of various
derivations, but here used, for the most part, synonymously, though the
use of a variety of terms seems designed, in order to express better the
several aspects in which our relations to the revealed word of God are
presented. The Psalm does not appear to have any relation to any special
occasion or interest of the Jewish Church or nation, but was evidently
"intended as a manual of pious thoughts, especially for instructing the
young, and its peculiar artificial structure was probably adopted to aid
the memory in retaining the language." (Psa. 119:1-176)

undefiled--literally, "complete," perfect, or sincere (compare [Psa
37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037).md).

in--or, "of"

the way--course of life.

walk--act

in the law--according to it (compare [Luk
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006).md).

law--from a word meaning "to teach," is a term of rather general
purport, denoting the instruction of God's Word.

[Psalms 119:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 119:2</span></span>

testimonies--The word of God is so called, because in it He testifies
for truth and against sin.

seek him--that is, a knowledge of Him, with desire for conformity to His
will.

[Psalms 119:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 119:3</span></span>

his ways--the course He reveals as right.

[Psalms 119:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 119:4</span></span>

precepts--are those directions which relate to special conduct, from a
word meaning "to inspect."

statutes--or ordinances, positive laws of permanent nature. Both words
originally denote rather positive than moral laws, such as derive force
from the divine appointment, whether their nature or the reasons for
them are apprehended by us or not.

commandments--or institutions. The term is comprehensive, but rather
denotes fundamental directions for conduct, both enjoining and
forbidding.

have respect unto--or regard carefully as to their whole purport.

[Psalms 119:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 119:7</span></span>

judgments--rules of conduct formed by God's judicial decisions; hence
the wide sense of the word in the Psalms, so that it includes decisions
of approval as well as condemnation.

[Psalms 119:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 119:8</span></span>

Recognizes the need of divine grace.

[Psalms 119:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 119:9</span></span>

BETH. ([Psa 119:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#009).md).

The whole verse may be read as a question; for,

by taking heed--is better, "for" taking heed, that is, so as to do it.
The answer is implied, and inferable from [Psa
119:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#005.md), [Psa
119:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md), [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md), &c., that is, by God's grace.

[Psalms 119:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 119:10</span></span>

We must carefully treasure up the word of God, declare it to others,
meditate on it, and heartily delight in it; and then by His grace we
shall act according to it.

[Psalms 119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 119:17</span></span>

GIMEL. ([Psa 119:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017).md).

Life is desirable in order to serve God; that we may do so aright, we
should seek to have our eyes opened to behold His truth, and earnestly
desire fully to understand it.

[Psalms 119:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 119:21</span></span>

God will rebuke those who despise His word and deliver His servants from
their reproach, giving them boldness in and by His truth, even before
the greatest men.

[Psalms 119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 119:25</span></span>

DALETH. ([Psa 119:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025).md).

Submitting ourselves in depression to God, He will revive us by His
promises, and lead us to declare His mercy to others.

[Psalms 119:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 119:28</span></span>

In order to adhere to His word, we must seek deliverance from
temptations to sin as well as from despondency.

enlarge--or, "expand"

my heart--with gracious affections.

[Psalms 119:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 119:33</span></span>

HE. ([Psa 119:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033).md).

To encourage us in prayer for divine aid in adhering to His truth, we
are permitted to believe that by His help we shall succeed.

the way of thy statutes--that is, the way or manner of life prescribed
by them. The help we hope to obtain by prayer is to be the basis on
which our resolutions should rest.

[Psalms 119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 119:37</span></span>

Turn away mine eyes--literally, "Make my eyes to pass, not noticing
evil."

vanity--literally, "falsehood;" all other objects of trust than God;
idols, human power, &c. ([Psa 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#006.md);
[Psa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md); [Psa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md); [Psa
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009).md).

quicken . . . in thy way--make me with living energy to pursue the way
marked out by Thee. Revive me from the death of spiritual helplessness
([Psa 119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017.md), [Psa
119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md), [Psa
119:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#040.md), [Psa
119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050.md); [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 119:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 119:38</span></span>

who is devoted to thy fear--or better, "which (that is, Thy word) is for
Thy fear," for producing it. "Which is to those who fear Thee." God's
word of promise belongs peculiarly to such (compare [Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md); [Kg1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md); [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025).md) \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Psalms 119:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 119:39</span></span>

Our hope of freedom from the reproach of inconsistency is in God's
power, quickening us to live according to His Word, which He leads us to
love.

for thy judgments are good--The time must therefore be at hand when Thy
justice will turn the "reproach" from Thy Church upon the world ([Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md); [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md); [Zep
2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 119:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 119:41</span></span>

VAU. ([Psa 119:41-48](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041).md).

The sentiment more fully carried out. God's mercies and salvation, as
revealed in His Word, provide hope of forgiveness for the past and
security in a righteous course for the future.

[Psalms 119:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 119:42</span></span>

The possession of God's gift of "salvation" ([Psa
119:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#041).md) will be the Psalmist's answer
to the foe's "reproach," that his hope was a fallacious one.

[Psalms 119:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 119:45</span></span>

To freedom from reproach, when imbued with God's truth, there is added
"great boldness in the faith" \[[Ti1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md)\], accompanied with increasing
delight in the holy law itself, which becomes an element of happiness.

[Psalms 119:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 119:48</span></span>

My hands . . . lift up unto . . . commandments--that is, I will
prayerfully ([Psa 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002).md) direct my
heart to keep Thy commandments.

[Psalms 119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 119:49</span></span>

ZAIN. ([Psa 119:49-56](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049).md).

Resting on the promises consoles under affliction and the tauntings of
the insolent.

upon which--rather, "Remember Thy word unto Thy servant, because," &c.
So the Hebrew requires \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Psalms 119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 119:50</span></span>

for--rather, "This is my comfort . . . that," &c. \[MAURER\].

hath quickened--What the Word has already done is to faith a pledge of
what it shall yet do.

[Psalms 119:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">psa 119:52</span></span>

The pious take comfort, when harassed and distressed by wickedness of
men who forsake God's law, in remembering that the great principles of
God's truth will still abide; and also God's

judgments of old--that is, His past interpositions in behalf of His
people are a pledge that He will again interpose to deliver them; and
they become the theme of constant and delightful meditation. The more we
keep the more we love the law of God.

[Psalms 119:53](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">psa 119:53</span></span>

Horror--rather, "vehement wrath" \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Psalms 119:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">psa 119:54</span></span>

songs--As the exile sings songs of his home ([Psa
137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003).md), so the child of God, "a
stranger on earth," sings the songs of heaven, his true home ([Psa
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012).md). In ancient times, laws were
put in verse, to imprint them the more on the memory of the people. So
God's laws are the believer's songs.

house of my pilgrimage--present life ([Gen
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md); [Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md); [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 119:56](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">psa 119:56</span></span>

Rather, "This is peculiarly mine (literally, to me), that I keep Thy
precepts" \[HENGSTENBERG and MAURER\].

[Psalms 119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">psa 119:57</span></span>

CHETH. ([Psa 119:57-64](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057).md).

Sincere desires for God's favor, penitence, and activity in a new
obedience, truly evince the sincerity of those who profess to find God a
portion ([Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Lam
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024).md).

[Psalms 119:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">psa 119:58</span></span>

favour--Hebrew, "face" ([Psa 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 119:59](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">psa 119:59</span></span>

So the prodigal son, when reduced to straits of misery ([Luk
15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 119:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">psa 119:61</span></span>

This the more, if opposition of enemies, or love of ease is overcome in
thus honoring God's law.

have robbed me--better, surrounded me, either as forcible constraints
like fetters, or as the cords of their nets. HENGSTENBERG translates,
"snares."

[Psalms 119:62](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">psa 119:62</span></span>

At midnight--HENGSTENBERG supposes a reference to the time when the Lord
went forth to slay the Egyptian first-born ([Exo
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md); [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md); compare [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020).md). But it rather refers to the
Psalmist's own praises and prayers in the night time. Compare Paul and
Silas ([Act 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md); compare [Psa
63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 119:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">psa 119:63</span></span>

The communion of the saints. Delight in their company is an evidence of
belonging to them ([Psa 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md); [Amo
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 119:64](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">psa 119:64</span></span>

While opposed by the wicked, and opposing them, the pious delight in
those who fear God, but, after all, rely for favor and guidance not on
merit, but mercy.

[Psalms 119:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">psa 119:65</span></span>

TETH. ([Psa 119:65-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#065).md).

The reliance on promises ([Psa 119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049).md)
is strengthened by experience of past dealings according with promises,
and a prayer for guidance, encouraged by sanctified affliction.

[Psalms 119:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">psa 119:66</span></span>

Teach me good judgment and knowledge--namely, in Thy word (so as to
fathom its deep spirituality); for the corresponding expression ([Psa
119:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#012.md), [Psa
119:64](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#064.md), [Psa
119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068).md), is, "Teach me Thy statutes."

[Psalms 119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">psa 119:67</span></span>

Referred by HENGSTENBERG to the chastening effect produced on the Jews'
minds by the captivity ([Jer
31:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md). The truth is a general one
([Job 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006.md); [Joh
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002.md); [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">psa 119:68</span></span>

Compare as to the Lord Jesus ([Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038).md).

[Psalms 119:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">psa 119:69</span></span>

The crafty malice of the wicked, in slandering him, so far from turning
him away, but binds him closer to God's Word, which they are too stupid
in sin to appreciate. HENGSTENBERG refers the "lie" to such slanders
against the Jews during the captivity, as that in [Ezr
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001.md), of sedition.

[Psalms 119:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">psa 119:70</span></span>

fat as grease--spiritually insensible ([Psa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md); [Psa
73:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#007.md); [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">psa 119:71</span></span>

So also affliction of any kind acts as a wholesome discipline in leading
the pious more highly to value the truth and promises of God.

[Psalms 119:73](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">psa 119:73</span></span>

JOD. ([Psa 119:73-80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#073).md).

As God made, so He can best control, us. So as to Israel, he owed to God
his whole internal and external existence ([Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 119:74](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#074.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">psa 119:74</span></span>

So when He has led us to rely on His truth, He will "make us to the
praise of His grace" by others. "Those who fear Thee will be glad at my
prosperity, as they consider my cause their cause" ([Psa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md); [Psa
142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_075">psa 119:75</span></span>

in faithfulness--that is, without in the least violating Thy
faithfulness; because my sins deserved and needed fatherly chastisement.
Enduring chastisement with a filial temper ([Heb
12:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006).md), God's promises of mercy
([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md) will be fulfilled, and He
will give comfort in sorrow ([Lam
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022.md); [Co2
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 119:77](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_077">psa 119:77</span></span>

Let thy tender mercies come unto me--As I am not able to come unto them.
But the wicked will be confounded.

[Psalms 119:78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_078">psa 119:78</span></span>

but I . . . meditate in thy precepts--and so shall not be "ashamed,"
that is, put to shame ([Psa 119:80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080).md).

[Psalms 119:79](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#079.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_079">psa 119:79</span></span>

Those who may have thought his afflictions an evidence of God's
rejection will then be led to return to Him; as the friends of

[Psalms 119:80](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#080.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_080">psa 119:80</span></span>

Let my . . . be sound--that is, perfect, sincere.

ashamed--disappointed in my hope of salvation.

[Psalms 119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_081">psa 119:81</span></span>

CAPH. ([Psa 119:81-88](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081).md).

In sorrow the pious heart yearns for the comforts of God's promises
([Psa 73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 119:82](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#082.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_082">psa 119:82</span></span>

Mine eyes fail for thy word--that is, with yearning desire for Thy word.

consumed me upon earth--HENGSTENBERG translates, "in the land";
understanding "me" of the nation Israel, of which but a small remnant
was left. But English Version is simpler; either, "They have consumed me
so as to leave almost nothing of me on earth"; or, "They have almost
destroyed and prostrated me on the earth" \[MAURER\].

I forsook not--Whatever else I am forsaken of, I forsake not Thy
precepts, and so am not mistaken of Thee ([Psa
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md), [Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013.md); [Co2
4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008).md), and the injuries and insults
of the wicked increase the need for it. But, however they act regardless
of God's law, the pious, adhering to its teaching, receive quickening
grace, and are sustained steadfast.

[Psalms 119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">psa 119:89</span></span>

LAMED. ([Psa 119:89-96](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089).md).

In all changes God's Word remains firm ([Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025).md). Like the heavens, it
continually attests God's unfailing power and unchanging care ([Psa
89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_090">psa 119:90</span></span>

thou hast established the earth, and it abideth-- ([Psa

[Psalms 119:91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_091">psa 119:91</span></span>

They--the heaven ([Psa 119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089).md) and the
earth ([Psa 119:90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090).md). HENGSTENBERG
translates, "They stand for thy judgment," that is, ready, as obedient
servants, to execute them. The usage of this Psalm favors this view. But
see [Jer 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025.md).

[Psalms 119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_092">psa 119:92</span></span>

Hence the pious are encouraged and inclined to seek a knowledge of it,
and persevere amidst the efforts of those planning and waiting to
destroy them.

delights.

[Psalms 119:93](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#093.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_093">psa 119:93</span></span>

The bounds of created perfection may be defined, but those of God's law
in its nature, application, and influence, are infinite. There is no
human thing so perfect but that something is wanting to it; its limits
are narrow, whereas God's law is of infinite breadth, reaching to all
cases, perfectly meeting what each requires, and to all times ([Psa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md), [Psa
19:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md); [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011).md). It cannot be cramped within any
definitions of man's dogmatical systems. Man never outgrows the Word. It
does not shock the ignorant man with declared anticipations of
discoveries which he had not yet made; while in it the man of science
finds his newest discoveries by tacit anticipations provided for.

[Psalms 119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_097">psa 119:97</span></span>

MEM. ([Psa 119:97-104](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097).md).

experience of its application.

4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md), [Deu

they are ever with me--The Hebrew is, rather singular, "it is ever with
me"; the commandments forming ONE complete whole, Thy law.

[Psalms 119:99](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#099.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_099">psa 119:99</span></span>

understanding--is practical skill ([Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 119:100](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#100.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">psa 119:100</span></span>

more than the ancients--Antiquity is no help against stupidity, where it
does not accord with God's word \[LUTHER\] ([Job
32:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007).md). The Bible is the key of all
knowledge, the history of the world, past, present, and to come ([Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010).md). He who does the will of God
shall know of the doctrine ([Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 119:101](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#101.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_101">psa 119:101</span></span>

Avoidance of sinful courses is both the effect and means of increasing
in divine knowledge (compare [Psa
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_105">psa 119:105</span></span>

NUN. ([Psa 119:105-112](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105).md).

Not only does the Word of God inform us of His will, but, as a light on
a path in darkness, it shows us how to follow the right and avoid the
wrong way. The lamp of the Word is not the sun. He would blind our eyes
in our present fallen state; but we may bless God for the light shining
as in a dark place, to guide us until the Sun of Righteousness shall
come, and we shall be made capable of seeing Him ([Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004).md). The lamp is fed with the oil of
the Spirit. The allusion is to the lamps and torches carried at night
before an Eastern caravan.

freewill offerings--the spontaneous expressions of his gratitude, as
contrasted with the appointed "offerings" of the temple ([Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md). He determines to pursue this
way, relying on God's quickening power ([Psa
119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050).md) in affliction, and a gracious
acceptance of his "spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise" ([Psa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md), [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md), [Psa

[Psalms 119:109](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#109.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_109">psa 119:109</span></span>

In the midst of deadly perils (the phrase is drawn from the fact that
what we carry in our hands may easily slip from them, [Jdg
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md); [Sa1
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021.md); [Job

his safety and guidance is in the truth and promises of God.

vain thoughts--better, "unstable persons," literally, "divided men,"
those of a divided, doubting mind ([Jam

\[HENGSTENBERG\], skeptics, or, skeptical notions as opposed to the
certainty of God's word.

Hence he fears not wicked men, nor dreads disappointment, sustained by
God in making His law the rule of life.

[Psalms 119:118](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#118.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118">psa 119:118</span></span>

But the disobedient and rebellious will be visited by God's wrath, which
impresses the pious with wholesome fear and awe.

their deceit is falsehood--that is, all their cunning deceit, wherewith
they seek to entrap the godly, is in vain.

[Psalms 119:120](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#120.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">psa 119:120</span></span>

The "judgments" are those on the wicked ([Psa
119:119](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#119).md). Joyful hope goes hand in
hand with fear ([Hab 3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 119:121](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_121">psa 119:121</span></span>

AIN. ([Psa 119:121-128](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121).md).

On the grounds of his integrity, desire for God's word, and covenant
relation to Him, the servant of God may plead for His protecting care
against the wicked, gracious guidance to the knowledge of truth, and His
effective vindication of the righteous and their cause, which is also
His own.

[Psalms 119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_122">psa 119:122</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_127">psa 119:127</span></span>

Therefore--that is, In view of these benefits, or, Because of the glory
of Thy law, so much praised in the previous parts of the Psalm.

I love . . . \[and\] Therefore (repeated)--All its precepts, on all
subjects, are estimable for their purity, and lead one imbued with their
spirit to hate all evil ([Psa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010).md).
The Word of God admits of no eclecticism; its least title is perfect
([Psa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md); [Mat

[Psalms 119:130](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">psa 119:130</span></span>

The entrance--literally, "opening"; God's words, as an open door, let in
light, or knowledge. Rather, as HENGSTENBERG explains it, "The opening
up," or, "explanation of thy word." To the natural man the doors of
God's Word are shut. [Luk 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027.md), [Luk
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031.md); [Act
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003.md); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md), confirm this view, "opening
(that is, explaining) and alleging," &c.

unto the simple--those needing or desiring it (compare [Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 119:131](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#131.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131">psa 119:131</span></span>

An ardent desire (compare [Psa 56:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001).md)
for spiritual enlightening, establishment in a right course, deliverance
from the wicked, and evidence of God's favor is expressed

I opened my mouth, and panted--as a traveller in a hot desert pants for
the cooling breeze ([Psa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 119:132](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#132.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_132">psa 119:132</span></span>

Look . . . upon me--opposed to hiding or averting the face (compare [Psa

86:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#006.md); [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017).md).

as thou usest to do--or, "as it is right in regard to those who love Thy
name." Such have a right to the manifestations of God's grace, resting
on the nature of God as faithful to His promise to such, not on their
own merits.

[Psalms 119:133](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#133.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_133">psa 119:133</span></span>

Order my steps--Make firm, so that there be no halting ([Psa

any iniquity-- [Psa 119:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#034.md) favors
HENGSTENBERG, "any iniquitous man," any "oppressor." But the parallel
first clause in this ([Psa 119:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#033).md)
favors English Version ([Psa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013).md).
His hope of deliverance from external oppression of man ([Psa
119:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#034).md) is founded on his deliverance
from the internal "dominion of iniquity," in answer to his prayer ([Psa

[Psalms 119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136.md)

Zealous himself to keep God's law, he is deeply afflicted when others

The principles of God's government are permanent and reliable, and in

An intelligent devotion is led by divine promises and is directed to an
increase of gracious affections, arising from a contemplation of

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_147">psa 119:147</span></span>

even the usual periods of the night; when the night watches, which might

Though the remembering of God's law is not meritorious, yet it evinces a

wicked in neglecting His law, reject God and despise His promises

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_158">psa 119:158</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136).md).

transgressors--or, literally, "traitors," who are faithless to a
righteous sovereign and side with His enemies (compare [Psa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md), [Psa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 119:159](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#159.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_159">psa 119:159</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 119:121-126](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#121.md), [Psa
119:153-155](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#153).md).

quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness-- ([Psa
119:88](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#088).md). This prayer occurs here for
the ninth time, showing a deep sense of frailty.

[Psalms 119:160](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#160.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">psa 119:160</span></span>

God has been ever faithful, and the principles of His government will
ever continue worthy of confidence.

from the beginning--that is, "every word from Genesis (called so by the
Jews from its first words, 'In the beginning') to the end of the
Scriptures is true." HENGSTENBERG translates more literally, "The sum of
thy words is truth." The sense is substantially the same. The whole body
of revelation is truth. "Thy Word is nothing but truth" \[LUTHER\].

[Psalms 119:161](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_161">psa 119:161</span></span>

SCHIN. ([Psa 119:161-168](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#161).md).

(Compare [Psa 119:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#046.md), [Psa
119:86](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#086).md).

awe--reverential, not slavish fear, which could not coexist with love
([Psa 119:163](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#163.md); [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008).md). Instead of fearing his
persecutors, he fears God's Word alone ([Luk
12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004).md). The Jews inscribe in the
first page of the great Bible ([Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017).md), "How dreadful is this place!
This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
heaven!"

[Psalms 119:162](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#162.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_162">psa 119:162</span></span>

(Compare [Mat 13:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044).md). Though
persecuted by the mighty, the pious are not turned from revering God's
authority to seek their favor, but rejoice in the possession of this
"pearl of great price," as great victors in spoils. Hating falsehood and
loving truth, often, every day, praising God for it, they find peace and
freedom from temptation.

[Psalms 119:163](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#163.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_163">psa 119:163</span></span>

lying--that is, as in [Psa 119:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029.md),
unfaithfulness to the covenant of God with His people; apostasy.

[Psalms 119:165](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#165.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_165">psa 119:165</span></span>

nothing shall offend them--or, "cause them to offend" (compare Margin).

[Psalms 119:166](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#166.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_166">psa 119:166</span></span>

As they keep God's law from motives of love for it, and are free from
slavish fear, the are ready to subject their lives to His inspection.

[Psalms 119:168](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#168.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_168">psa 119:168</span></span>

all my ways are before thee--I wish to order my ways as before Thee,
rather than in reference to man ([Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md); [Psa
73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023).md). All men's ways are under God's
eye ([Pro 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021).md); the godly alone
realize the fact, and live accordingly.

[Psalms 119:169](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#169.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_169">psa 119:169</span></span>

TAU. ([Psa 119:169-176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#169).md).

The prayer for understanding of the truth precedes that for deliverance.
The fulfilment of the first is the basis of the fulfilment of the second
([Psa 90:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011).md). On the terms "cry"
and "supplication" (compare [Psa 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009.md);
[Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 119:171](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#171.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_171">psa 119:171</span></span>

shall utter--or, "pour out praise" (compare [Psa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002).md); shall cause Thy praises to
stream forth as from a bubbling, overflowing fountain.

[Psalms 119:172](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#172.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_172">psa 119:172</span></span>

My tongue shall speak of thy word--literally, "answer Thy Word," that
is, with praise, respond to Thy word. Every expression in which we
praise God and His Word is a response, or acknowledgment, corresponding
to the perfections of Him whom we praise.

[Psalms 119:173](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#173.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_173">psa 119:173</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 119:77](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#077.md), [Psa
119:81](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#081.md), [Psa
119:92](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#092).md).

I have chosen--in preference to all other objects of delight.

[Psalms 119:175](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_175">psa 119:175</span></span>

Save me that I may praise Thee.

thy judgments--as in [Psa 119:149](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#149.md),
[Psa 119:156](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#156.md).

[Psalms 119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_176">psa 119:176</span></span>

Though a wanderer from God, the truly pious ever desires to be drawn
back to Him; and, though for a time negligent of duty, he never forgets
the commandments by which it is taught.

lost--therefore utterly helpless as to recovering itself ([Jer
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006.md); [Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004).md). Not only the sinner before
conversion, but the believer after conversion, is unable to recover
himself; but the latter, after temporary wandering, knows to whom to
look for restoration. [Psa 119:175-176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#175.md)
seem to sum up the petitions, confessions, and professions of the Psalm.
The writer desires God's favor, that he may praise Him for His truth,
confesses that he has erred, but, in the midst of all his wanderings and
adversities, professes an abiding attachment to the revealed Word of
God, the theme of such repeated eulogies, and the recognized source of
such great and unnumbered blessings. Thus the Psalm, though more than
usually didactic, is made the medium of both parts of devotion--prayer
and praise.
