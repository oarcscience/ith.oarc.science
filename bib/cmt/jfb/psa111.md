### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 111:1</span></span>

The Psalmist celebrates God's gracious dealings with His people, of
which a summary statement is given. ([Psa
111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001).md)

Praise ye the Lord--or, Hallelujah ([Psa
104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035).md). This seems to serve as a
title to those of the later Psalms, which, like this, set forth God's
gracious government and its blessed fruits. This praise claims the

whole heart-- ([Psa 86:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#012).md), and is
rendered publicly.

upright--a title of the true Israel ([Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 111:2</span></span>

His works, that is, of providence and grace are

sought--or, carefully studied, by all desiring to know them.

[Psalms 111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 111:3</span></span>

honourable and glorious--literally, "honor and majesty," which
illustrate His glorious perfections.

righteousness-- ([Psa 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017.md); [Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001).md), which He has made memorable by
wonders of love and mercy, in supplying the wants of His people
according to covenant engagements.

[Psalms 111:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 111:6</span></span>

His power was shown especially in giving them the promised land, and His
faithfulness and justice thus displayed are, like His precepts, reliable
and of permanent obligation.

[Psalms 111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 111:9</span></span>

The deliverance He provided accorded to His established covenant. Thus
He manifested Himself in the sum of His perfections ([Psa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md), [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md); [Psa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003).md) worthy of reverence.

[Psalms 111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 111:10</span></span>

And hence love and fear of such a God is the chief element of true
wisdom (compare [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010).md).
