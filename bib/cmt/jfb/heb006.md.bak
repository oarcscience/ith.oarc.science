### [Hebrews Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 6:1</span></span>

WARNING AGAINST RETROGRADING, WHICH SOON LEADS TO APOSTASY;
ENCOURAGEMENT TO STEADFASTNESS FROM GOD'S FAITHFULNESS TO HIS WORD AND
OATH. ([Heb 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md)

Therefore--Wherefore: seeing that ye ought not now to be still "babes"
([Heb 5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011).md).

leaving--getting further forward than the elementary "principles." "As
in building a house one must never leave the foundation: yet to be
always laboring in 'laying the foundation' would be ridiculous"
\[CALVIN\].

the principles of the doctrine--Greek, "the word of the beginning," that
is, the discussion of the "first principles of Christianity ([Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012).md).

let us go on--Greek, "let us be borne forward," or "bear ourselves
forward"; implying active exertion: press on. Paul, in teaching, here
classifies himself with the Hebrew readers, or (as they ought to be)
learners, and says, Let us together press forward.

perfection--the matured knowledge of those who are "of full age" ([Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014).md) in Christian attainments.

foundation of--that is, consisting in "repentance."

repentance from dead works--namely, not springing from the vital
principle of faith and love toward God, and so counted, like their doer,
dead before God. This repentance from dead works is therefore paired
with "faith toward God." The three pairs of truths enumerated are
designedly such as JEWISH believers might in some degree have known from
the Old Testament, but had been taught more clearly when they became
Christians. This accounts for the omission of distinct specification of
some essential first principle of Christian truth. Hence, too, he
mentions "faith toward God," and not explicitly faith toward Christ
(though of course included). Repentance and faith were the first
principles taught under the Gospel.

[Hebrews 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 6:2</span></span>

the doctrine of baptisms--paired with "laying on of hands," as the
latter followed on Christian baptism, and answers to the rite of
confirmation in Episcopal churches. Jewish believers passed, by an easy
transition, from Jewish baptismal purifications ([Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010), "washings".md), baptism of
proselytes, and John's baptism, and legal imposition of hands, to their
Christian analogues, baptism, and the subsequent laying on of hands,
accompanied by the gift of the Holy Ghost (compare [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md). Greek, "baptismoi," plural,
including Jewish and Christian baptisms, are to be distinguished from
baptisma, singular, restricted to Christian baptism. The six particulars
here specified had been, as it were, the Christian Catechism of the Old
Testament; and such Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ
immediately on the new light being shed on these fundamental
particulars, were accounted as having the elementary principles of the
doctrine of Christ \[BENGEL\]. The first and most obvious elementary
instruction of Jews would be the teaching them the typical significance
of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfilment \[ALFORD\].

resurrection, &c.--held already by the Jews from the Old Testament:
confirmed with clearer light in Christian teaching or "doctrine."

eternal judgment--judgment fraught with eternal consequences either of
joy or of woe.

[Hebrews 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 6:3</span></span>

will we do--So some of the oldest manuscripts read; but others, "Let us
do." "This," that is, "Go on unto perfection."

if God permit--For even in the case of good resolutions, we cannot carry
them into effect, save through God "working in us both to will and to do
of His good pleasure" ([Phi 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013).md). The
"for" in [Heb 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md) refers to this: I
say, if God permit, for there are cases where God does not permit, for
example, "it is impossible," &c. Without God's blessing, the cultivation
of the ground does not succeed ([Heb
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007).md).

[Hebrews 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 6:4</span></span>

We must "go on toward perfection"; for if we fall away, after having
received enlightenment, it will be impossible to renew us again to
repentance.

for those--"in the case of those."

once enlightened--once for all illuminated by the word of God taught in
connection with "baptism" (to which, in [Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md), as once for all done," once
enlightened" here answers); compare [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md). This passage probably originated
the application of the term "illumination" to baptism in subsequent
times. Illumination, however, was not supposed to be the inseparable
accompaniment of baptism: thus CHRYSOSTOM says, "Heretics have baptism,
not illumination: they are baptized in body, but not enlightened in
soul: as Simon Magus was baptized, but not illuminated." That
"enlightened" here means knowledge of the word of truth, appears from
comparing the same Greek word "illuminated," [Heb
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md), with [Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md), where "knowledge of the truth"
answers to it.

tasted of the heavenly gift--tasted for themselves. As "enlightened"
refers to the sense of sight: so here taste follows. "The heavenly
gift"; Christ given by the Father and revealed by the enlightening word
preached and written: as conferring peace in the remission of sins; and
as the Bestower of the gift of the Holy Spirit ([Act
8:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#019).md),

made partakers of the Holy Ghost--specified as distinct from, though so
inseparably connected with, "enlightened," and "tasted of the heavenly
gift," Christ, as answering to "laying on of hands" after baptism, which
was then generally accompanied with the impartation of the Holy Ghost in
miraculous gifts.

[Hebrews 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 6:5</span></span>

tasted the good word of God--distinct from "tasted OF (genitive) the
heavenly gift"; we do not yet enjoy all the fulness of Christ, but only
have a taste OF Him, the heavenly gift now; but believers may taste the
whole word (accusative case) of God already, namely, God's "good word of
promise." The Old Testament promise of Canaan to Israel typified "the
good word of God's" promise of the heavenly rest (Heb. 4:1-16).
Therefore, there immediately follows the clause, "the powers of the
world to come." As "enlightening" and "tasting of the heavenly gift,"
Christ, the Bread of Life, answers to FAITH: so "made partakers of the
Holy Ghost," to CHARITY, which is the first-fruit of the Spirit: and
"tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come," to
HOPE. Thus the triad of privileges answers to the Trinity, the Father,
Son, and Spirit, in their respective works toward us. "The world to
come," is the Christian dispensation, viewed especially in its future
glories, though already begun in grace here. The world to come thus
stands in contrast to course of this world, altogether disorganized
because God is not its spring of action and end. By faith, Christians
make the world to come a present reality, though but a foretaste of the
perfect future. The powers of this new spiritual world, partly exhibited
in outward miracles at that time, and then, as now, especially
consisting in the Spirit's inward quickening influences are the earnest
of the coming inheritance above, and lead the believer who gives himself
up to the Spirit to seek to live as the angels, to sit with Christ in
heavenly places, to set the affections on things above, and not on
things on earth, and to look for Christ's coming and the full
manifestation of the world to come. This "world to come," in its future
aspect, thus corresponds to "resurrection of the dead and eternal life"
([Heb 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002).md), the first Christian
principles which the Hebrew believers had been taught, by the Christian
light being thrown back on their Old Testament for their instruction
(see on [Heb 6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md). "The world to
come," which, as to its "powers," exists already in the redeemed, will
pass into a fully realized fact at Christ's coming ([Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004).md).

[Hebrews 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 6:6</span></span>

If--Greek, "And (yet) have fallen away"; compare a less extreme falling
or declension, [Gal 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md), "Ye are
fallen from grace." Here an entire and wilful apostasy is meant; the
Hebrews had not yet so fallen away; but he warns them that such would be
the final result of retrogression, if, instead of "going on to
perfection," they should need to learn again the first principles of
Christianity ([Heb 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md).

to renew them again--They have been "once" ([Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md) already renewed, or made anew,
and now they need to be "renewed" over "again."

crucify to themselves the Son of God--"are crucifiying to themselves"
Christ, instead of, like Paul, crucifying the world unto them by the
cross of Christ ([Gal 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014).md). So in
[Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md), "trodden under foot the
Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith . . .
sanctified, an unholy thing." "The Son of God," marking His dignity,
shows the greatness of their offense.

put him to an open shame--literally, "make a public example of" Him, as
if He were a malefactor suspended on a tree. What the carnal Israel did
outwardly, those who fall away from light do inwardly, they virtually
crucify again the Son of God; "they tear him out of the recesses of
their hearts where He had fixed His abode and exhibit Him to the open
scoffs of the world as something powerless and common" \[BLEEK in
ALFORD\]. The Montanists and Novatians used this passage to justify the
lasting exclusion from the Church of those who had once lapsed. The
Catholic Church always opposed this view, and readmitted the lapsed on
their repentance, but did not rebaptize them. This passage implies that
persons may be in some sense "renewed," and yet fall away finally; for
the words, "renew again," imply that they have been, in some sense, not
the full sense, ONCE RENEWED by the Holy Ghost; but certainly not that
they are "the elect," for these can never fall away, being chosen unto
everlasting life ([Joh 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028).md). The
elect abide in Christ, hear and continuously obey His voice, and do not
fall away. He who abides not in Christ, is cast forth as a withered
branch; but he who abides in Him becomes more and more free from sin;
the wicked one cannot touch him; and he by faith overcomes the world. A
temporary faith is possible, without one thereby being constituted one
of the elect ([Mar 4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#016).md). At the
same time it does not limit God's grace, as if it were "impossible" for
God to reclaim even such a hardened rebel so as yet to look on Him whom
he has pierced. The impossibility rests in their having known in
themselves once the power of Christ's sacrifice, and yet now rejecting
it; there cannot possibly be any new means devised for their renewal
afresh, and the means provided by God's love they now, after experience
of them, deliberately and continuously reject; their conscience being
served, and they "twice dead" ([Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012).md), are now past hope, except by a
miracle of God's grace. "It is the curse of evil eternally to propagate
evil" \[THOLUCK\]. "He who is led into the whole (?) compass of
Christian experiences, may yet cease to abide in them; he who abides not
in them, was, at the very time when he had those objective experiences,
not subjectively true to them; otherwise there would have been fulfilled
in him, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance" ([Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012).md), so that he
would have abided in them and not have fallen away" \[THOLUCK\]. Such a
one was never truly a Spirit-led disciple of Christ ([Rom
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014).md). The sin against the Holy
Ghost, though somewhat similar, is not identical with this sin; for that
sin may be committed by those outside the Church (as in [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md), [Mat
12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031).md); this, only by those inside.

[Hebrews 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 6:7</span></span>

the earth--rather as Greek (no article), "land."

which drinketh in--Greek, "which has drunk in"; not merely receiving it
on the surface. Answering to those who have enjoyed the privilege of
Christian experiences, being in some sense renewed by the Holy Ghost;
true alike of those who persevere and those who "fall away."

the rain that cometh oft upon it--not merely failing over it, or towards
it, but falling and resting upon it so as to cover it (the Greek
genitive, not the accusative). The "oft" implies, on God's part, the
riches of His abounding grace ("coming" spontaneously, and often); and,
on the apostate's part, the wilful perversity whereby he has done
continual despite to the oft-repeated motions of the Spirit. Compare
"How often," [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). The rain of
heaven falls both on the elect and the apostates.

bringeth forth--as the natural result of "having drunk in the rain." See
above.

herbs--provender.

meet--fit. Such as the master of the soil wishes. The opposite of
"rejected," [Heb 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md).

by whom--rather as Greek, "for (that is, on account of) whom," namely,
the lords of the soil; not the laborers, as English Version, namely, God
and His Christ ([Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009).md). The heart
of man is the earth; man is the dresser; herbs are brought forth meet,
not for the dresser, by whom, but for God, the owner of the soil, for
whom it is dressed. The plural is general, the owners whoever they may
be; here God.

receiveth--"partaketh of."

blessing--fruitfulness. Contrast God's curse causing unfruitfulness
([Gen 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017).md); also spiritually ([Jer
17:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005).md).

from God--Man's use of means is vain unless God bless ([Co1
3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006).md).

[Hebrews 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 6:8</span></span>

that which--rather as Greek (no article), "But if it (the 'land,' [Heb
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007).md) bear"; not so favorable a word as
"bringeth forth," [Heb 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007.md), said of
the good soil.

briers--Greek, "thistles."

rejected--after having been tested; so the Greek implies. Reprobate . .
. rejected by the Lord.

nigh unto cursing--on the verge of being given up to its own barrenness
by the just curse of God. This "nigh" softens the severity of the
previous "It is impossible," &c. ([Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md), [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006).md). The ground is not yet actually
cursed.

whose--"of which (land) the end is unto burning," namely, with the
consuming fire of the last judgment; as the land of Sodom was given to
"brimstone, salt, and burning" ([Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023).md); so as to the ungodly ([Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md), [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md); [Mat
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#019.md); [Mat
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md); [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md). Jerusalem, which had so
resisted the grace of Christ, was then nigh unto cursing, and in a few
years was burned. Compare [Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md),
"burned up their city" an earnest of a like fate to all wilful abusers
of God's grace ([Heb 10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md).

[Hebrews 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 6:9</span></span>

beloved--appositely here introduced; LOVE to you prompts me in the
strong warnings I have just given, not that I entertain unfavorable
thoughts of you; nay, I anticipate better things of you; Greek "the
things which are better"; that ye are not thorn-bearing, or nigh unto
cursing, and doomed unto burning, but heirs of salvation in accordance
with God's faithfulness ([Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md).

we are persuaded--on good grounds; the result of proof. Compare [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md), "I myself am persuaded of you,
my brethren, that ye are full of goodness." A confirmation of the
Pauline authorship of this Epistle.

things that accompany--Greek, "things that hold by," that is, are close
unto "salvation." Things that are linked unto salvation (compare [Heb
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019).md). In opposition to "nigh unto
cursing."

though--Greek, "if even we thus speak." "For it is better to make you
afraid with words, that ye may not suffer in fact."

[Hebrews 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 6:10</span></span>

not unrighteous--not unfaithful to His own gracious promise. Not that we
have any inherent right to claim reward; for (1) a servant has no merit,
as he only does that which is his bounden duty; (2) our best
performances bear no proportion to what we leave undone; (3) all
strength comes from God; but God has promised of His own grace to reward
the good works of His people (already accepted through faith in Christ);
it is His promise, not our merits, which would make it unrighteous were
He not to reward His people's works. God will be no man's debtor.

your work--your whole Christian life of active obedience.

labour of love--The oldest manuscripts omit "labor of," which probably
crept in from [Th1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md). As "love"
occurs here, so "hope," [Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md),
"faith," [Heb 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md); as in [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013.md) : the Pauline triad. By their
love he sharpens their hope and faith.

ye have showed--(Compare [Heb
10:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032).md).

toward his name--Your acts of love to the saints were done for His
name's sake. The distressed condition of the Palestinian Christians
appears from the collection for them. Though receiving bounty from other
churches, and therefore not able to minister much by pecuniary help, yet
those somewhat better off could minister to the greatest sufferers in
their Church in various other ways (compare [Ti2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018).md). Paul, as elsewhere, gives them
the utmost credit for their graces, while delicately hinting the need of
perseverance, a lack of which had probably somewhat begun to show
itself.

[Hebrews 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 6:11</span></span>

And--Greek, "But."

desire--Greek, "earnestly desire." The language of fatherly affection,
rather than command.

every one of you--implying that all in the Palestinian churches had not
shown the same diligence as some of those whom he praises in [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md). "He cares alike for great and
small, and overlooks none." "Every one of them," even those diligent in
acts of LOVE ([Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md), needed to be
stimulated to persevere in the same diligence with a view to the full
assurance of HOPE unto the end. They needed, besides love, patient
perseverance, resting on hope and faith ([Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md); [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007).md). Compare "the full assurance of
faith," [Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md); [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md).

unto the end--the coming of Christ.

[Hebrews 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 6:12</span></span>

be not--Greek, "become not." In [Heb
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md), he said, "Ye have become dull
(Greek, 'slothful') of hearing"; here he warns them not to become
"slothful absolutely," namely, also in mind and deed. He will not become
slothful who keeps always the end in view; hope is the means of ensuring
this.

followers--Greek, "imitators"; so in [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md), Greek; [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md).

patience--Greek, "long-suffering endurance." There is the long-suffering
patience, or endurance of love, [Co1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004.md), and that of faith, [Heb
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md).

them who . . . inherit the promises--Greek, "who are inheriting," &c.;
to whom the promises are their inheritance. Not that they have actually
entered on the perfect inheritance, which [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md), [Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039.md) explicitly denies; though
doubtless the dead in Christ have, in the disembodied soul, a foretaste
of it; but "them (enumerated in Heb. 11:2-40) who in every age have
been, are, or shall be, inheritors of the promises"; of whom Abraham is
an illustrious example ([Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md).

[Hebrews 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 6:13</span></span>

For--confirming the reasonableness of resting on "the promises" as
infallibly sure, resting as they do on God's oath, by the instance of
Abraham. "He now gives consolation, by the oath of God's grace, to those
whom, in the second, third, and fourth chapters, he had warned by the
oath of God's 'wrath.' The oath of wrath did not primarily extend its
force beyond the wilderness; but the oath of grace is in force for ever"
\[BENGEL\].

[Hebrews 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 6:14</span></span>

multiplying . . . multiply--Hebraism for superabundantly multiply.

thee--The increase of Abraham's seed is virtually an increase of
himself. The argument here refers to Abraham himself as an example;
therefore Paul quotes [Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md),
"thee," instead of "thy seed."

[Hebrews 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 6:15</span></span>

so--thus relying on the promise.

[Hebrews 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 6:16</span></span>

for confirmation--not to be joined, as English Version, to "an oath";
but to "an end" \[ALFORD\]. I prefer, "The oath is to them, in respect
to confirmation (of one's solemn promise or covenant; as here, God's),
an end of all contradiction (so the Greek is translated, [Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003).md), or "gainsaying." This passage
shows: (1) an oath is sanctioned even in the Christian dispensation as
lawful; (2) that the limits to its use are, that it only be employed
where it can put an end to contradiction in disputes, and for
confirmation of a solemn promise.

[Hebrews 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 6:17</span></span>

Wherein--that is, Which being the case among men, God, in accommodation
to their manner of confirming covenants, superadded to His sure word His
oath: the "TWO immutable things" ([Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).md).

willing . . . counsel--Greek, "willing . . . will"; words akin.
Expressing the utmost benignity \[BENGEL\].

more abundantly--than had He not sworn. His word would have been amply
enough; but, to make assurance doubly sure, He "interposed with an oath"
(so the Greek). Literally, He acted as Mediator, coming between Himself
and us; as if He were less, while He swears, than Himself by whom He
swears (for the less among men usually swear by the greater). Dost thou
not yet believe, thou that hearest the promise? \[BENGEL\].

heirs of promise--not only Abraham's literal, but also his spiritual,
seed ([Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029).md).

[Hebrews 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 6:18</span></span>

immutable--Translate, as in [Heb 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md),
"unchangeable."

impossible . . . to lie--"ever to lie"; this is the force of the Greek
aorist \[ALFORD\]. His not being able to deny Himself is a proof, not of
weakness, but of strength incomparable.

consolation--under doubts and fears, and so "encouragement," literally,
"exhortation."

fled for refuge--as if from a shipwreck; or, as one fleeing to one of
the six cities of refuge. Kadesh, that is, holy, implies the holiness of
Jesus, our Refuge. Shechem, that is, shoulder, the government is upon
his shoulder ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md). Hebron, that
is, fellowship, believers are called into the fellowship of Christ.
Bezer, that is, a fortress, Christ is so to all who trust in Him.
Ramoth, that is, high, for Him hath God exalted with His right hand
([Act 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031).md). Golan, that is, joy, for
in Him all the saints are justified and shall glory.

lay hold upon the hope--that is, the object of our hope, as upon a
preservative from sinking.

set before us--as a prize for which we strive; a new image, namely, the
race course ([Heb 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md).

[Hebrews 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 6:19</span></span>

Hope is found represented on coins by an anchor.

sure and steadfast--sure in respect to us: steadfast, or "firm"
\[ALFORD\], in itself. Not such an anchor as will not keep the vessel
from tossing, or an anchor unsound or too light \[THEOPHYLACT\].

which entereth into that--that is the place

within the veil--two images beautifully combined: (1) The soul is the
ship: the world the sea: the bliss beyond the world, the distant coast;
the hope resting on faith, the anchor which prevents the vessel being
tossed to and fro; the encouraging consolation through the promise and
oath of God, the cable connecting the ship and anchor. (2) The world is
the fore-court: heaven, the Holy of Holies; Christ, the High Priest
going before us, so as to enable us, after Him, and through Him, to
enter within the veil. ESTIUS explains, As the anchor does not stay in
the waters, but enters the ground hidden beneath the waters, and fastens
itself in it, so hope, our anchor of the soul, is not satisfied with
merely coming to the vestibule, that is, is not content with merely
earthly and visible goods, but penetrates even to those which are within
the veil, namely, to the Holy of Holies, where it lays hold on God
Himself, and heavenly goods, and fastens on them. "Hope, entering within
heaven, hath made us already to be in the things promised to us, even
while we are still below, and have not yet received them; such strength
hope has, as to make those that are earthly to become heavenly." "The
soul clings, as one in fear of shipwreck to an anchor, and sees not
whither the cable of the anchor runs--where it is fastened: but she
knows that it is fastened behind the veil which hides the future glory."

veil--Greek, "catapetasma": the second veil which shut in the Holiest
Place. The outer veil was called by a distinct Greek term, calumma: "the
second (that is, the inner) veil."

[Hebrews 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 6:20</span></span>

The absence of the Greek article requires ALFORD'S translation, "Where.
As forerunner for us (that is, in our behalf), entered Jesus" \[and is
now: this last clause is implied in the 'where' of the Greek, which
implies being IN a place: 'whither' is understood to 'entered,' taken
out of 'where'; whither Jesus entered, and where He is now\]. The "for
us" implies that it was not for Himself, as God, He needed to enter
there, but as our High Priest, representing and introducing us, His
followers, opening the way to us, by His intercession with the Father,
as the Aaronic high priest entered the Holiest Place once a year to make
propitiation for the people. The first-fruits of our nature are
ascended, and so the rest is sanctified. Christ's ascension is our
promotion: and whither the glory of the Head has preceded, thither the
hope of the body, too, is called. We ought to keep festal day, since
Christ has taken up and set in the heavens the first-fruit of our lump,
that is, the human flesh \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. As John Baptist was Christ's
forerunner on earth, so Christ is ours in heaven.
