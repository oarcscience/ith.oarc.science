### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 4:1-16)

returned--namely, to the thought set forth ([Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); [Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009).md).

power--MAURER, not so well, "violence."

no comforter--twice said to express continued suffering without any to
give comfort ([Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 4:2</span></span>

A profane sentiment if severed from its connection; but just in its
bearing on Solomon's scope. If religion were not taken into account
([Ecc 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md), [Ecc
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019).md), to die as soon as possible
would be desirable, so as not to suffer or witness "oppressions"; and
still more so, not to be born at all ([Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001).md). Job ([Job
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012.md); [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md), David ([Psa
73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003), &c..md), Jeremiah ([Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md), Habakkuk ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md), all passed through the same
perplexity, until they went into the sanctuary, and looked beyond the
present to the "judgment" ([Psa 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md);
[Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md); [Hab
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017).md). Then they saw the need of
delay, before completely punishing the wicked, to give space for
repentance, or else for accumulation of wrath ([Rom
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015).md); and before completely rewarding
the godly, to give room for faith and perseverance in tribulation ([Psa
92:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md). Earnests, however, are often
even now given, by partial judgments of the future, to assure us, in
spite of difficulties, that God governs the earth.

[Ecclesiastes 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 4:3</span></span>

not seen--nor experienced.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

right--rather, "prosperous" (see on [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021).md). Prosperity, which men so much
covet, is the very source of provoking oppression ([Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md) and "envy," so far is it from
constituting the chief good.

[Ecclesiastes 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 4:5</span></span>

Still the

fool (the wicked oppressor) is not to be envied even in this life, who
"folds his hands together" in idleness ([Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010.md); [Pro
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#033).md), living on the means he
wrongfully wrests from others; for such a one

eateth his own flesh--that is, is a self-tormentor, never satisfied, his
spirit preying on itself ([Isa 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#020.md);
[Isa 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026).md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 4:6</span></span>

Hebrew; "One open hand (palm) full of quietness, than both closed hands
full of travail." "Quietness" (mental tranquillity flowing from honest
labor), opposed to "eating one's own flesh" ([Ecc
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005).md), also opposed to anxious labor to
gain ([Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md); [Pro
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016.md); [Pro
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#008).md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 4:7</span></span>

A vanity described in [Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 4:8</span></span>

not a second--no partner.

child--"son or brother," put for any heir ([Deu
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005).md).

eye-- ([Ecc 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008).md). The miser would not
be able to give an account of his infatuation.

[Ecclesiastes 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 4:9</span></span>

Two--opposed to "one" ([Ecc 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008).md). Ties
of union, marriage, friendship, religious communion, are better than the
selfish solitariness of the miser ([Gen
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018).md).

reward--Advantage accrues from their efforts being conjoined. The Talmud
says, "A man without a companion is like a left hand without the right.

[Ecclesiastes 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 4:10</span></span>

if they fall--if the one or other fall, as may happen to both, namely,
into any distress of body, mind, or soul.

[Ecclesiastes 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 4:11</span></span>

(See on [Kg1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001).md). The image is taken
from man and wife, but applies universally to the warm sympathy derived
from social ties. So Christian ties ([Luk
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032.md); [Act
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#015).md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 4:12</span></span>

one--enemy.

threefold cord--proverbial for a combination of many--for example,
husband, wife, and children ([Pro
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014).md); so Christians ([Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md); [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md), [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019).md). Untwist the cord, and the
separate threads are easily "broken."

[Ecclesiastes 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 4:13</span></span>

The "threefold cord" \[[Ecc 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md)\] of
social ties suggests the subject of civil government. In this case too,
he concludes that kingly power confers no lasting happiness. The "wise"
child, though a supposed case of Solomon, answers, in the event foreseen
by the Holy Ghost, to Jeroboam, then a poor but valiant youth, once a
"servant" of Solomon, and ([Kg1
11:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026).md) appointed by God through the
prophet Ahijah to be heir of the kingdom of the ten tribes about to be
rent from Rehoboam. The "old and foolish king" answers to Solomon
himself, who had lost his wisdom, when, in defiance of two warnings of
God ([Kg1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md); [Kg1
9:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002).md), he forsook God.

will no more be admonished--knows not yet how to take warning (see
Margin) God had by Ahijah already intimated the judgment coming on
Solomon ([Kg1 11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011).md).

[Ecclesiastes 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 4:14</span></span>

out of prison--Solomon uses this phrase of a supposed case; for example,
Joseph raised from a dungeon to be lord of Egypt. His words are at the
same time so framed by the Holy Ghost that they answer virtually to
Jeroboam, who fled to escape a "prison" and death from Solomon, to
Shishak of Egypt ([Kg1 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040).md). This
unconscious presaging of his own doom, and that of Rehoboam, constitutes
the irony. David's elevation from poverty and exile, under Saul (which
may have been before Solomon's mind), had so far their counterpart in
that of Jeroboam.

whereas . . . becometh poor--rather, "though he (the youth) was born
poor in his kingdom" (in the land where afterwards he was to reign).

[Ecclesiastes 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 4:15</span></span>

"I considered all the living," the present generation, in relation to
("with") the "second youth" (the "legitimate successor" of the "old
king," as opposed to the "poor youth," the one first spoken of, about to
be raised from poverty to a throne), that is, Rehoboam.

in his stead--the old king's.

[Ecclesiastes 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 4:16</span></span>

Notwithstanding their now worshipping the rising sun, the heir-apparent,
I reflected that "there were no bounds, no stability ([Sa2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006.md); [Sa2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001).md), no check on the love of
innovation, of all that have been before them," that is, the past
generation; so

also they that come after--that is, the next generation,

shall not rejoice in him--namely, Rehoboam. The parallel, "shall not
rejoice," fixes the sense of "no bounds," no permanent adherence, though
now men rejoice in him.
