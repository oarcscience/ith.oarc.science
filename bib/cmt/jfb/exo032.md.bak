### [Exodus Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 32:1</span></span>

THE GOLDEN CALF. (Exo. 32:1-35)

when the people saw that Moses delayed--They supposed that he had lost
his way in the darkness or perished in the fire.

the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron--rather, "against"
Aaron in a tumultuous manner, to compel him to do what they wished. The
incidents related in this chapter disclose a state of popular sentiment
and feeling among the Israelites that stands in singular contrast to the
tone of profound and humble reverence they displayed at the giving of
the law. Within a space of little more than thirty days, their
impressions were dissipated. Although they were still encamped upon
ground which they had every reason to regard as holy; although the cloud
of glory that capped the summit of Sinai was still before their eyes,
affording a visible demonstration of their being in close contact, or
rather in the immediate presence, of God, they acted as if they had
entirely forgotten the impressive scenes of which they had been so
recently the witnesses.

said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us--The Hebrew
word rendered "gods" is simply the name of God in its plural form. The
image made was single, and therefore it would be imputing to the
Israelites a greater sin than they were guilty of, to charge them with
renouncing the worship of the true God for idols. The fact is, that they
required, like children, to have something to strike their senses, and
as the Shekinah, "the glory of God," of which they had hitherto enjoyed
the sight, was now veiled, they wished for some visible material object
as the symbol of the divine presence, which should go before them as the
pillar of fire had done.

[Exodus 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 32:2</span></span>

Aaron said, . . . Break off . . . earrings--It was not an Egyptian
custom for young men to wear earrings, and the circumstance, therefore,
seems to point out "the mixed rabble," who were chiefly foreign slaves,
as the ringleaders in this insurrection. In giving direction to break
their earrings, Aaron probably calculated on gaining time; or, perhaps,
on their covetousness and love of finery proving stronger than their
idolatrous propensity. If such were his expectations, they were doomed
to signal disappointment. Better to have calmly and earnestly
remonstrated with them, or to have preferred duty to expediency, leaving
the issue in the hands of Providence.

[Exodus 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 32:3</span></span>

all the people brake off the golden earrings--The Egyptian rings, as
seen on the monuments, were round massy plates of metal; and as they
were rings of this sort the Israelites wore, their size and number must,
in the general collection, have produced a large store of the precious
metal.

[Exodus 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 32:4</span></span>

fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten
calf--The words are transposed, and the rendering should be, "he framed
with a graving tool the image to be made, and having poured the liquid
gold into the mould, he made it a molten calf." It is not said whether
it was of life size, whether it was of solid gold or merely a wooden
frame covered with plates of gold. This idol seems to have been the god
Apis, the chief deity of the Egyptians, worshipped at Memphis under the
form of a live ox, three years old. It was distinguished by a triangular
white spot on its forehead and other peculiar marks. Images of it in the
form of a whole ox, or of a calf's head on the end of a pole, were very
common; and it makes a great figure on the monuments where it is
represented in the van of all processions, as borne aloft on men's
shoulders.

they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt--It is inconceivable that they, who but a few weeks before
had witnessed such amazing demonstrations of the true God, could have
suddenly sunk to such a pitch of infatuation and brutish stupidity, as
to imagine that human art or hands could make a god that should go
before them. But it must be borne in mind, that though by election and
in name they were the people of God, they were as yet, in feelings and
associations, in habits and tastes, little, if at all different, from
Egyptians. They meant the calf to be an image, a visible sign or symbol
of Jehovah, so that their sin consisted not in a breach of the FIRST
\[[Exo 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md)\], but of the SECOND
commandment \[[Exo 20:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004.md)\].

[Exodus 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 32:5</span></span>

Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow is a feast to the Lord--a
remarkable circumstance, strongly confirmatory of the view that they had
not renounced the worship of Jehovah, but in accordance with Egyptian
notions, had formed an image with which they had been familiar, to be
the visible symbol of the divine presence. But there seems to have been
much of the revelry that marked the feasts of the heathen.

[Exodus 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 32:7</span></span>

the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down--Intelligence of the
idolatrous scene enacted at the foot of the mount was communicated to
Moses in language borrowed from human passions and feelings, and the
judgment of a justly offended God was pronounced in terms of just
indignation against the gross violation of the so recently promulgated
laws.

[Exodus 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 32:10</span></span>

make of thee a great nation--Care must be taken not to suppose this
language as betokening any change or vacillation in the divine purpose.
The covenant made with the patriarchs had been ratified in the most
solemn manner; it could not and never was intended that it should be
broken. But the manner in which God spoke to Moses served two important
purposes--it tended to develop the faith and intercessory patriotism of
the Hebrew leader, and to excite the serious alarm of the people, that
God would reject them and deprive them of the privileges they had fondly
fancied were so secure.

[Exodus 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 32:15</span></span>

Moses turned, and went down from the mount--The plain, Er-Raheh, is not
visible from the top of Jebel Musa, nor can the mount be descended on
the side towards that valley; hence Moses and his companion, who on duty
had patiently waited his return in the hollow of the mountain's brow,
heard the shouting some time before they actually saw the camp.

[Exodus 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 32:19</span></span>

Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands--The
arrival of the leader, like the appearance of a specter, arrested the
revellers in the midst of their carnival, and his act of righteous
indignation when he dashed on the ground the tables of the law, in token
that as they had so soon departed from their covenant relation, so God
could withdraw the peculiar privileges that He had promised them--that
act, together with the rigorous measures that followed, forms one of the
most striking scenes recorded in sacred history.

[Exodus 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 32:20</span></span>

he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, &c.--It
has been supposed that the gold was dissolved by natron or some chemical
substance. But there is no mention of solubility here, or in [Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021.md); it was "burned in the fire," to
cast it into ingots of suitable size for the operations which
follow--"grounded to powder"; the powder of malleable metals can be
ground so fine as to resemble dust from the wings of a moth or
butterfly; and these dust particles will float in water for hours, and
in a running stream for days. These operations of grinding were intended
to show contempt for such worthless gods, and the Israelites would be
made to remember the humiliating lesson by the state of the water they
had drunk for a time \[NAPIER\]. Others think that as the idolatrous
festivals were usually ended with great use of sweet wine, the nauseous
draught of the gold dust would be a severe punishment (compare [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md), [Kg2
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md); [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md); [Ch2
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#007).md).

[Exodus 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 32:22</span></span>

And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot--Aaron cuts a poor
figure, making a shuffling excuse and betraying more dread of the anger
of Moses than of the Lord (compare [Deu
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020).md).

[Exodus 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 32:25</span></span>

naked--either unarmed and defenseless, or ashamed from a sense of guilt.
Some think they were literally naked, as the Egyptians performed some of
their rites in that indecent manner.

[Exodus 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 32:26</span></span>

Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said--The camp is supposed to
have been protected by a rampart after the attack of the Amalekites.

Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me--The zeal and courage of
Moses was astonishing, considering he opposed an intoxicated mob. The
people were separated into two divisions, and those who were the boldest
and most obstinate in vindicating their idolatry were put to death,
while the rest, who withdrew in shame or sorrow, were spared.

[Exodus 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 32:29</span></span>

Consecrate yourselves to-day to the Lord--or, "Ye have consecrated
yourselves to-day." The Levites, notwithstanding the dejection of Aaron,
distinguished themselves by their zeal for the honor of God and their
conduct in doing the office of executioners on this occasion; and this
was one reason that they were appointed to a high and honorable office
in the service of the sanctuary.

[Exodus 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 32:30</span></span>

Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin--Moses labored to
show the people the heinous nature of their sin, and to bring them to
repentance. But not content with that, he hastened more earnestly to
intercede for them.

[Exodus 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 32:32</span></span>

blot me . . . out of thy book--an allusion to the registering of the
living, and erasing the names of those who die. What warmth of affection
did he evince for his brethren! How fully was he animated with the true
spirit of a patriot, when he professed his willingness to die for them.
But Christ actually died for His people ([Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008).md).

[Exodus 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 32:35</span></span>

the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf--No immediate
judgments were inflicted, but this early lapse into idolatry was always
mentioned as an aggravation of their subsequent apostasies.
