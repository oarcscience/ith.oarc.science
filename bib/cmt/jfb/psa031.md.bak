### [Psalms Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 31:1</span></span>

The prayer of a believer in time of deep distress. In the first part,
cries for help are mingled with expressions of confidence. Then the
detail of griefs engrosses his attention, till, in the assurance of
strong but submissive faith, he rises to the language of unmingled
joyful trust and exhorts others to like love and confidence towards God.
(Psa. 31:1-24)

Expresses the general tone of feeling of the Psalm.

[Psalms 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 31:2</span></span>

He seeks help in God's righteous government ([Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008).md), and begs for an attentive
hearing, and speedy and effectual aid. With no other help and no claim
of merit, he relies solely on God's regard to His own perfections for a
safe guidance and release from the snares of his enemies. On the terms
"rock," &c., (compare [Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md); [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), [Psa
18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md); [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md); [Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md); [Psa
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021).md).

[Psalms 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 31:5</span></span>

commit my spirit--my life, or myself. Our Saviour used the words on the
Cross \[[Luk 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md)\], not as
prophetical, but, as many pious men have done, as expressive of His
unshaken confidence in God. The Psalmist rests on God's faithfulness to
His promises to His people, and hence avows himself one of them,
detesting all who revere objects of idolatry (compare [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md); [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 31:7</span></span>

hast known my soul, &c.--had regard to me in trouble.

[Psalms 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 31:8</span></span>

shut me up . . . enemy--abandon to ([Sa1
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011).md).

large room--place of safety (compare [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019).md).

[Psalms 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 31:9</span></span>

mine eye, &c.--denotes extreme weakness (compare [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007).md).

grief--mingled sorrow and indignation ([Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007).md).

soul and . . . belly--the whole person.

[Psalms 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 31:10</span></span>

Though the effects ascribed to grief are not mere figures of speech--

spent . . . consumed--must be taken in the modified sense of wasted and
decayed.

iniquity--or, suffering by it (see on [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 31:11</span></span>

among--or, literally, "from," or, "by" my enemies. The latter clauses
describe the progress of his disgrace to the lowest degree, till,

[Psalms 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 31:12</span></span>

he is forgotten as one dead, and contemned as a useless broken vessel.

[Psalms 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 31:13</span></span>

For--introduces further reasons for his prayer, the unjust, deliberate,
and murderous purposes of his foes.

[Psalms 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 31:14</span></span>

In his profession of trust he includes the terms of the prayer
expressing it.

[Psalms 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 31:15</span></span>

times--course of life.

deliver . . . hand--opposed to "shut me up," &c., of [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 31:16</span></span>

Make . . . shine--(Compare [Num 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025.md);
[Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006).md). Deprecating from himself,
he imprecates on the wicked God's displeasure, and prays that their
virulent persecution of him may be stopped.

[Psalms 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 31:19</span></span>

God displays openly His purposed goodness to His people.

[Psalms 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 31:20</span></span>

the secret of thy presence--or, covering of Thy countenance; the
protection He thus affords; compare [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md) for a similar figure; "dwelling"
used there for "presence" here. The idea of security further presented
by the figure of a tent and a fortified city \[[Psa
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021.md)\].

[Psalms 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 31:22</span></span>

For I said--literally, "And I said," in an adversative sense. I, thus
favored, was despondent.

in my haste--in my terror.

cut off . . . eyes--from all the protection of Thy presence.

[Psalms 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 31:23</span></span>

the Lord . . . proud doer--literally, "the Lord is keeping faith," that
is, with His people, and is repaying, &c. Then let none despair, but
take courage; their hopes shall not be in vain.
