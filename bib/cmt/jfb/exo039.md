### [Exodus Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001)

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

GARMENTS OF THE PRIESTS. (Exo. 39:1-43)

cloths of service--official robes. The ephod of the high priest, the
robe of the ephod, the girdle of needlework, and the embroidered coat
were all of fine linen; for on no material less delicate could such
elaborate symbolical figures have been portrayed in embroidery, and all
beautified with the same brilliant colors. (See on Exo. 28:1-43).

[Exodus 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003)

cut the gold into wires to work it--that is, the metal was beaten with a
hammer into thin plates, cut with scissors or some other instrument into
long slips, then rounded into filaments or threads. "Cloth of golden
tissue is not uncommon on the monuments, and specimens of it have been
found rolled about mummies; but it is not easy to determine whether the
gold thread was originally interwoven or subsequently inserted by the
embroiderer" \[TAYLOR\].

[Exodus 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 39:30</span></span>

a writing, like to the engravings of a signet--The seal-ring worn both
by ancient and modern Egyptians on the little finger of the right hand,
contained, inscribed on a cornelian or other precious stone, along with
the owner's name, a religious sentiment or sacred symbol, intimating
that he was the servant of God, or expressive of trust in Him. And it
was to this practice the inscription on the high priest alludes (compare
[Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033)).

[Exodus 39:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 39:34</span></span>

the covering of rams' skin dyed red--(See on [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005)). It was probably red morocco
leather and "badgers' skins," rather "the skins of the tahash, supposed
to be the dugong, or dolphin of the Red Sea, the skin of which is still
used by the Arabs under the same appellation" \[GOSS\].

[Exodus 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 39:43</span></span>

Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the
Lord had commanded--A formal inspection was made on the completion of
the tabernacle, not only with a view to have the work transferred from
the charge of the workmen, but to ascertain whether it corresponded with
"the pattern." The result of a careful and minute survey showed that
every plank, curtain, altar, and vase had been most accurately made of
the form, and in the place designed by the Divine Architect--and Moses,
in accepting it of their hands, thanked God for them, and begged Him to
bless them.
