### [Lamentations Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 5:1</span></span>

EPIPHONEMA, OR A CLOSING RECAPITULATION OF THE CALAMITIES TREATED IN THE
PREVIOUS ELEGIES. (Lam. 5:1-22)

([Psa 89:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050).md).

[Lamentations 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 5:2</span></span>

Our inheritance--"Thine inheritance" ([Psa
79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001).md). The land given of old to us by
Thy gift.

[Lamentations 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 5:3</span></span>

fatherless--Our whole land is full of orphans \[CALVIN\]. Or, "we are
fatherless," being abandoned by Thee our "Father" ([Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019).md), \[GROTIUS\].

[Lamentations 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 5:4</span></span>

water for money--The Jews were compelled to pay the enemy for the water
of their own cisterns after the overthrow of Jerusalem; or rather, it
refers to their sojourn in Babylon; they had to pay tax for access to
the rivers and fountains. Thus, "our" means the water which we need, the
commonest necessary of life.

our wood--In Judea each one could get wood without pay; in Babylon, "our
wood," the wood we need, must be paid for.

[Lamentations 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 5:5</span></span>

Literally, "On our necks we are persecuted"; that is, Men tread on our
necks ([Psa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012.md); [Isa
51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023.md); compare [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md). The extremest oppression. The
foe not merely galled the Jews face, back, and sides, but their neck. A
just retribution, as they had been stiff in neck against the yoke of God
([Ch2 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md), Margin; [Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029.md); [Isa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004).md).

[Lamentations 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 5:6</span></span>

given . . . hand to--in token of submission (see on [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015).md).

to . . . Egyptians--at the death of Josiah ([Ch2
36:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#003).md).

Assyrians--that is, the Chaldeans who occupied the empire which Assyria
had held. So [Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md).

to be satisfied with bread-- ([Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048).md).

[Lamentations 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 5:7</span></span>

([Jer 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029).md).

borne their iniquities--that is, the punishment of them. The accumulated
sins of our fathers from age to age, as well as our own, are visited on
us. They say this as a plea why God should pity them (compare [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002), &c..md).

[Lamentations 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 5:8</span></span>

Servants . . . ruled . . . us--Servants under the Chaldean governors
ruled the Jews ([Neh 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015).md). Israel,
once a "kingdom of priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md), is become like Canaan, "a
servant of servants," according to the curse ([Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025).md). The Chaldeans were designed to
be "servants" of Shem, being descended from Ham ([Gen
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026).md). Now through the Jews' sin,
their positions are reversed.

[Lamentations 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 5:9</span></span>

We gat our bread with . . . peril--that is, those of us left in the city
after its capture by the Chaldeans.

because of . . . sword of . . . wilderness--because of the liability to
attack by the robber Arabs of the wilderness, through which the Jews had
to pass to get "bread" from Egypt (compare [Lam
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006).md).

[Lamentations 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 5:10</span></span>

As an oven is scorched with too much fire, so our skin with the hot
blast of famine (Margin, rightly, "storms," like the hot simoom). Hunger
dries up the pores so that the skin becomes like as if it were scorched
by the sun ([Job 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md); [Psa
119:83](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#083).md).

[Lamentations 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 5:11</span></span>

So in just retribution Babylon itself should fare in the end. Jerusalem
shall for the last time suffer these woes before her final restoration
([Zac 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md).

[Lamentations 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 5:12</span></span>

hanged . . . by their hand--a piece of wanton cruelty invented by the
Chaldeans. GROTIUS translates, "Princes were hung by the hand of the
enemy"; hanging was a usual mode of execution ([Gen
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#019).md).

elders--officials ([Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016).md).

[Lamentations 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 5:13</span></span>

young men . . . grind--The work of the lowest female slave was laid on
young men ([Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md); [Job
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010).md).

children fell under . . . wood--Mere children had to bear burdens of
wood so heavy that they sank beneath them.

[Lamentations 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 5:14</span></span>

Aged men in the East meet in the open space round the gate to decide
judicial trials and to hold social converse ([Job
29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007).md).

[Lamentations 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 5:16</span></span>

The crown--all our glory, the kingdom and the priesthood ([Job
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#009.md); [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md), [Psa
89:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#044).md).

[Lamentations 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 5:17</span></span>

([Lam 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#022.md); [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011).md).

[Lamentations 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 5:18</span></span>

foxes--They frequent desolate places where they can freely and
fearlessly roam.

[Lamentations 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 5:19</span></span>

([Psa 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012).md). The perpetuity of God's
rule over human affairs, however He may seem to let His people be
oppressed for a time, is their ground of hope of restoration.

[Lamentations 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 5:20</span></span>

for ever--that is, for "so long a time."

[Lamentations 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 5:21</span></span>

([Psa 80:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#003.md); [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md). "Restore us to favor with
Thee, and so we shall be restored to our old position" \[GROTIUS\].
Jeremiah is not speaking of spiritual conversion, but of that outward
turning whereby God receives men into His fatherly favor, manifested in
bestowing prosperity \[CALVIN\]. Still, as Israel is a type of the
Church, temporal goods typify spiritual blessings; and so the sinner may
use this prayer for God to convert him.

[Lamentations 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 5:22</span></span>

Rather, "Unless haply Thou hast utterly rejected us, and art beyond
measure wroth against us," that is, Unless Thou art implacable, which is
impossible, hear our prayer \[CALVIN\]. Or, as Margin, "For wouldest
Thou utterly reject us?" &c.--No; that cannot be. The Jews, in this
book, and in Isaiah and Malachi, to avoid the ill-omen of a mournful
closing sentence, repeat the verse immediately preceding the last
\[CALVIN\].
