### [Nehemiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 13:1</span></span>

UPON THE READING OF THE LAW SEPARATION IS MADE FROM THE MIXED MULTITUDE.
([Neh 13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001).md)

On that day--This was not immediately consequent on the dedication of
the city wall and gates, but after Nehemiah's return from the Persian
court to Jerusalem, his absence having extended over a considerable
period. The transaction here described probably took place on one of the
periodical occasions for the public readings of the law, when the
people's attention was particularly directed to some violations of it
which called for immediate correction. There is another instance
afforded, in addition to those which have already fallen under our
notice, of the great advantages resulting from the public and periodical
reading of the divine law. It was an established provision for the
religious instruction of the people, for diffusing a knowledge and a
reverence for the sacred volume, as well as for removing those errors
and corruptions which might, in the course of time, have crept in.

the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of
God for ever--that is, not be incorporated into the Israelitish kingdom,
nor united in marriage relations with that people ([Deu
23:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003).md). This appeal to the authority
of the divine law led to a dissolution of all heathen alliances ([Neh
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002.md); [Ezr
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003).md).

[Nehemiah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 13:4</span></span>

before this--The practice of these mixed marriages, in open neglect or
violation of the law, had become so common, that even the pontifical
house, which ought to have set a better example, was polluted by such an
impure mixture.

Eliashib the priest . . . was allied unto Tobiah--This person was the
high priest ([Neh 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028.md); also [Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001).md), who, by virtue of his dignified
office, had the superintendence and control of the apartments attached
to the temple. The laxity of his principles, as well as of his practice,
is sufficiently apparent from his contracting a family connection with
so notorious an enemy of Israel as Tobiah. But his obsequious attentions
had carried him much farther; for to accommodate so important a person
as Tobiah on his occasional visits to Jerusalem, Eliashib had provided
him a splendid apartment in the temple. The introduction of so gross an
impropriety can be accounted for in no other way than by supposing that
in the absence of the priests and the cessation of the services, the
temple was regarded as a common public building, which might, in the
circumstances, be appropriated as a palatial residence.

[Nehemiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 13:6</span></span>

But in all this was not I at Jerusalem--Eliashib (concluding that, as
Nehemiah had departed from Jerusalem, and, on the expiry of his allotted
term of absence, had resigned his government, he had gone not to return)
began to use great liberties, and, there being none left whose authority
or frown he dreaded, allowed himself to do things most unworthy of his
sacred office, and which, though in unison with his own irreligious
character, he would not have dared to attempt during the residence of
the pious governor. Nehemiah resided twelve years as governor of
Jerusalem, and having succeeded in repairing and refortifying the city,
he at the end of that period returned to his duties in Shushan. How long
\[Nehemiah\] remained there is not expressly said, but "after certain
days," which is a Scripture phraseology for a year or a number of years,
he obtained leave to resume the government of Jerusalem; to his deep
mortification and regret, he found matters in the neglected and
disorderly state here described. Such gross irregularities as were
practised, such extraordinary corruptions as had crept in, evidently
imply the lapse of a considerable time. Besides, they exhibit the
character of Eliashib, the high priest, in a most unfavorable light; for
while he ought, by his office, to have preserved the inviolable sanctity
of the temple and its furniture, his influence had been directly
exercised for evil; especially he had given permission and countenance
to a most indecent outrage--the appropriation of the best apartments in
the sacred building to a heathen governor, one of the worst and most
determined enemies of the people and the worship of God. The very first
reform Nehemiah on his second visit resolved upon, was the stopping of
this gross profanation \[by Eliashib\]. The chamber which had been
polluted by the residence of the idolatrous Ammonite was, after
undergoing the process of ritual purification ([Num
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#009).md), restored to its proper use--a
storehouse for the sacred vessels.

[Nehemiah 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 13:10</span></span>

NEHEMIAH REFORMS THE OFFICERS IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. ([Neh
13:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010).md)

And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given
them--The people, disgusted with the malversations of Eliashib, or the
lax and irregular performance of the sacred rites, withheld the tithes,
so that the ministers of religion were compelled for their livelihood to
withdraw to their patrimonial possessions in the country. The temple
services had ceased; all religious duties had fallen into neglect. The
money put into the sacred treasury had been squandered in the
entertainment of an Ammonite heathen, an open and contemptuous enemy of
God and His people. The return of the governor put an end to these
disgraceful and profane proceedings. He administered a sharp rebuke to
those priests to whom the management of the temple and its services was
committed, for the total neglect of their duties, and the violation of
the solemn promises which they had made to him at his departure. He
upbraided them with the serious charge of having not only withheld from
men their dues, but of having robbed God, by neglecting the care of His
house and service. And thus having roused them to a sense of duty and
incited them to testify their godly sorrow for their criminal negligence
by renewed devotedness to their sacred work, Nehemiah restored the
temple services. He recalled the dispersed Levites to the regular
discharge of their duties; while the people at large, perceiving that
their contributions would be no longer perverted to improper uses,
willingly brought in their tithes as formerly. Men of integrity and good
report were appointed to act as trustees of the sacred treasures, and
thus order, regularity, and active service were re-established in the
temple.

[Nehemiah 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015.md)

THE VIOLATION OF THE SABBATH. (Neh. 13:15-31)

In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the
sabbath--The cessation of the temple services had been necessarily
followed by a public profanation of the Sabbath, and this had gone so
far that labor was carried on in the fields, and fish brought to the
markets on the sacred day. Nehemiah took the decisive step of ordering
the city gates to be shut, and not to be opened, till the Sabbath was
past; and in order to ensure the faithful execution of this order, he
stationed some of his own servants as guards, to prevent the
introduction of any commodities on that day. On the merchants and
various dealers finding admission denied them, they set up booths
outside the walls, in hopes of still driving a traffic with the
peasantry; but the governor threatened, if they continued, to adopt
violent measures for their removal. For this purpose a body of Levites
was stationed as sentinels at the gate, with discretionary powers to
protect the sanctification of the Sabbath.

could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of
each people--a mongrel dialect imbibed from their mothers, together with
foreign principles and habits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 13:25</span></span>

cursed them--that is, pronounced on them an anathema which entailed
excommunication.

smote . . . and plucked off their hair--To cut off the hair of offenders
seems to be a punishment rather disgraceful than severe; yet it is
supposed that pain was added to disgrace, and that they tore off the
hair with violence as if they were plucking a bird alive.
