### [Acts Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

[Acts 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 27:1</span></span>

THE VOYAGE TO ITALY--THE SHIPWRECK AND SAFE LANDING AT MALTA. (Acts
27:1-44)

we should sail, &c.--The "we" here reintroduces the historian as one of
the company. Not that he had left the apostle from the time when he last
included himself ([Act 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018).md), but the
apostle was parted from him by his arrest and imprisonment, until now,
when they met in the ship.

delivered Paul and certain other prisoners--State prisoners going to be
tried at Rome; of which several instances are on record.

Julius--who treats the apostle throughout with such marked courtesy
([Act 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003.md), [Act
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#043.md); [Act
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016).md), that it has been thought
\[BENGEL\] he was present when Paul made his defense before Agrippa (see
[Act 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023).md), and was impressed with
his lofty bearing.

a centurion of Augustus' band--the Augustan cohort, an honorary title
given to more than one legion of the Roman army, implying, perhaps, that
they acted as a bodyguard to the emperor or procurator, as occasion
required.

[Acts 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 27:2</span></span>

a ship of--belonging to.

Adramyttium--a port on the northeast coast of the Ã†gean Sea. Doubtless
the centurion expected to find another ship, bound for Italy, at some of
the ports of Asia Minor, without having to go with this ship all the way
to Adramyttium; and in this he was not disappointed. See on [Act
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006.md).

meaning to sail by the coasts--"places."

of Asia--a coasting vessel, which was to touch at the ports of
proconsular Asia.

one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us--rather,
"Aristarchus the Macedonian," &c. The word "one" should not have been
introduced here by our translators, as if this name had not occurred
before; for we find him seized by the Ephesian mob as a "man of
Macedonia and Paul's companion in travel" ([Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).md) and as a "Thessalonian"
accompanying the apostle from Ephesus on his voyage back to Palestine
([Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004).md). Here both these places
are mentioned in connection with his name. After this we find him at
Rome with the apostle ([Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md).

[Acts 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 27:3</span></span>

next day we touched at Sidon--To reach this ancient and celebrated
Mediterranean port, about seventy miles north from CÃ&brvbr;sarea, in
one day, they must have had a fair wind.

Julius courteously--(See on [Act
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001).md).

gave him liberty to go to his friends--no doubt disciples, gained, it
would seem, by degrees, all along the PhÅ“nician coast since the first
preaching there (see on [Act 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md) and
[Act 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004).md).

to refresh himself--which after his long confinement would not be
unnecessary. Such small personal details are in this case extremely
interesting.

[Acts 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 27:4</span></span>

when we had launched--"set sail."

from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were
contrary--The wind blowing from the westward, probably with a touch of
the north, which was adverse, they sailed under the lee of Cyprus,
keeping it on their left, and steering between it and the mainland of
PhÅ“nicia.

[Acts 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 27:5</span></span>

when we had sailed over the Sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia--coasts with
which Paul had been long familiar, the one, perhaps, from boyhood, the
other from the time of his first missionary tour.

we came to Myra, a city of Lycia--a port a little east of Patara (see on
[Act 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001).md).

[Acts 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 27:6</span></span>

there . . . found a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy, and he put
us therein--(See on [Act 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002).md). As
Egypt was the granary of Italy, and this vessel was laden with wheat
([Act 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#035).md), we need not wonder it
was large enough to carry two hundred seventy-six souls, passengers and
crew together ([Act 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#037).md). Besides,
the Egyptian merchantmen, among the largest in the Mediterranean, were
equal to the largest merchantmen in our day. It may seem strange that on
their passage from Alexandria to Italy they should be found at a Lycian
port. But even still it is not unusual to stand to the north towards
Asia Minor, for the sake of the current.

[Acts 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 27:7</span></span>

sailed slowly many days--owing to contrary winds.

and scarce--"with difficulty."

were come over against Cnidus--a town on the promontory of the peninsula
of that name, having the island of Coos (see on [Act
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001).md) to the west of it. But for the
contrary wind they might have made the distance from Myra (one hundred
thirty miles) in one day. They would naturally have put in at Cnidus,
whose larger harbor was admirable, but the strong westerly current
induced them to run south.

under--the lee of

Crete--(See on [Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md).

over against Salmone--the cape at the eastern extremity of the island.

[Acts 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 27:8</span></span>

And hardly passing it--"with difficulty coasting along it," from the
same cause as before, the westerly current and head winds.

came to . . . the Fair Havens--an anchorage near the center of the south
coast, and a little east of Cape Matala, the southern most point of the
island.

nigh whereunto was the city Lasea--identified by the REVEREND GEORGE
BROWN \[SMITH, Voyages and Shipwreck of St. Paul, Appendix 3, Second
Edition, 1856\]. (To this invaluable book commentators on this chapter,
and these notes, are much indebted).

[Acts 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 27:9</span></span>

when much time was spent--since leaving CÃ&brvbr;sarea. But for
unforeseen delays they might have reached the Italian coast before the
stormy season.

and when sailing--the navigation of the open sea.

was now dangerous, because the fast was now . . . past--that of the day
of atonement, answering to the end of September and beginning of
October, about which time the navigation is pronounced unsafe by writers
of authority. Since all hope of completing the voyage during that season
was abandoned, the question next was, whether they should winter at Fair
Havens, or move to Port Phenice, a harbor about forty miles to the
westward. Paul assisted at the consultation and strongly urged them to
winter where they were.

[Acts 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 27:10</span></span>

Sirs, I perceive, that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage,
&c.--not by any divine communication, but simply in the exercise of a
good judgment aided by some experience. The event justified his
decision.

[Acts 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 27:11</span></span>

Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and owner . . . more than
. . . Paul--He would naturally think them best able to judge, and there
was much to say for their opinion, as the bay at Fair Havens, being open
to nearly one-half of the compass, could not be a good winter harbor.

[Acts 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 27:12</span></span>

Phenice--"Phenix," now called Lutro.

which lieth toward the southwest and northwest--If this means that it
was open to the west, it would certainly not be good anchorage! It is
thought therefore to mean that a wind from that quarter would lead into
it, or that it lay in an easterly direction from such a wind \[SMITH\].
[Act 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#013.md) seems to confirm this.

[Acts 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 27:13</span></span>

when the south wind blew softly, supposing they had attained their
purpose--With such a wind they had every prospect of reaching their
destination in a few hours.

[Acts 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 27:14</span></span>

a tempestuous--"typhonic"

wind--that is, like a typhon or tornado, causing a whirling of the
clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air.

called Euroclydon--The true reading appears to be Euro-aquilo, or
east-northeast, which answers all the effects here ascribed to it.

[Acts 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 27:15</span></span>

could not bear up into--"face"

the wind, we let her drift--before the gale.

[Acts 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 27:16</span></span>

under--the lee of.

a certain--"small"

island . . . Clauda--southwest of Crete, now called Gonzo; about
twenty-three miles to leeward.

we had much work to come by--that is, to hoist up and secure.

the boat--now become necessary. But why was this difficult?
Independently of the gale, raging at the time, the boat had been towed
between twenty and thirty miles after the gale sprang up, and could
scarcely fail to be filled with water \[SMITH\].

[Acts 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 27:17</span></span>

undergirding the ship--that is, passing four or five turns of a
cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of the ship, to enable her to
resist the violence of the seas, an operation rarely resorted to in
modern seamanship.

fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands--"be cast ashore" or
"stranded upon the Syrtis," the Syrtis Major, a gulf on the African
coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its dangerous
shoals.

they strake--"struck"

sail--This cannot be the meaning, for to strike sail would have driven
them directly towards the Syrtis. The meaning must be, "lowered the
gear" (appurtenances of every kind); here, perhaps, referring to the
lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it \[SMITH\].

[Acts 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 27:19</span></span>

cast out with our own hands--passengers and crew together.

the tackling of the ship--whatever they could do without that carried
weight. This further effort to lighten the ship seems to show that it
was now in a leaking condition, as will presently appear more evident.

[Acts 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 27:20</span></span>

neither sun nor stars appeared in many--"several"

days--probably most of the fourteen days mentioned in [Act
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md). This continued thickness of the
atmosphere prevented their making the necessary observations of the
heavenly bodies by day or by night; so that they could not tell where
they were.

all hope that we should be saved was taken away--"Their exertions to
subdue the leak had been unavailing; they could not tell which way to
make for the nearest land, in order to run their ship ashore, the only
resource for a sinking ship: but unless they did make the land, they
must founder at sea. Their apprehensions, therefore, were not so much
caused by the fury of the tempest, as by the state of the ship"
\[SMITH\]. From the inferiority of ancient to modern naval architecture,
leaks were sprung much more easily, and the means of repairing them were
fewer than now. Hence the far greater number of shipwrecks from this
cause.

[Acts 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 27:21</span></span>

But after long abstinence--(See on [Act
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033).md). "The hardships which the crew
endured during a gale of such continuance, and their exhaustion from
laboring at the pumps and hunger, may be imagined, but are not
described" \[SMITH\].

Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have
hearkened to me, &c.--not meaning to reflect on them for the past, but
to claim their confidence for what he was now to say:

[Acts 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 27:23</span></span>

there stood by me this night the angel of God--as in [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md).

whose I am-- ([Co1 6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md).

and whom I serve--in the sense of worship or religious consecration (see
on [Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).md).

[Acts 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 27:24</span></span>

saying, Fear not, Paul: thou must be brought before CÃ&brvbr;sar and,
lo, God hath given thee all . . . that sail with thee--While the crew
were toiling at the pumps, Paul was wrestling in prayer, not for himself
only and the cause in which he was going a prisoner to Rome, but with
true magnanimity of soul for all his shipmates; and God heard him,
"giving him" (remarkable expression!) all that sailed with him. "When
the cheerless day came he gathered the sailors (and passengers) around
him on the deck of the laboring vessel, and raising his voice above the
storm" \[HOWSON\], reported the divine communication he had received;
adding with a noble simplicity, "for I believe God that it shall be even
as it was told me," and encouraging all on board to "be of good cheer"
in the same confidence. What a contrast to this is the speech of
CÃ&brvbr;sar in similar circumstances to his pilot, bidding him keep up
his spirit because he carried CÃ&brvbr;sar and CÃ&brvbr;sar's fortune!
\[PLUTARCH\]. The Roman general knew no better name for the Divine
Providence, by which he had been so often preserved, than CÃ&brvbr;sar's
fortune \[HUMPHRY\]. From the explicit particulars--that the ship would
be lost, but not one that sailed in it, and that they "must be cast on a
certain island"--one would conclude a visional representation of a total
wreck, a mass of human beings struggling with the angry elements, and
one and all of those whose figures and countenances had daily met his
eye on deck, standing on some unknown island shore. From what follows,
it would seem that Paul from this time was regarded with a deference
akin to awe.

[Acts 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 27:27</span></span>

when the fourteenth night was come--from the time they left Fair Havens.

as we were driven--drifting

up and down in Adria--the Adriatic, that sea which lies between Greece
and Italy.

about midnight the shipmen deemed--no doubt from the peculiar sound of
the breakers.

that they drew near some country--"that some land was approaching them."
This nautical language gives a graphic character to the narrative.

[Acts 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 27:29</span></span>

they cast four anchors out of the stern--The ordinary way was to cast
the anchor, as now, from the bow: but ancient ships, built with both
ends alike, were fitted with hawseholes in the stern, so that in case of
need they could anchor either way. And when the fear was, as here, that
they might fall on the rocks to leeward, and the intention was to run
the ship ashore as soon as daylight enabled them to fix upon a safe
spot, the very best thing they could do was to anchor by the stern
\[SMITH\]. In stormy weather two anchors were used, and we have
instances of four being employed, as here.

and wished--"anxiously" or "devoutly wished."

for day--the remark this of one present, and with all his shipmates
alive to the horrors of their condition. "The ship might go down at her
anchors, or the coast to leeward might be iron-bound, affording no beach
on which they could land with safety. Hence their anxious longing for
day, and the ungenerous but natural attempt, not peculiar to ancient
times, of the seamen to save their own lives by taking to the boat"
\[SMITH\].

[Acts 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 27:30</span></span>

as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship--under cover of night.

when they had let down the boat . . . as though they would . . . cast
anchors out of the foreship--"bow"--rather, "carry out" anchors, to hold
the ship fore as well as aft. "This could have been of no advantage in
the circumstances, and as the pretext could not deceive a seaman, we
must infer that the officers of the ship were parties to the unworthy
attempt, which was perhaps detected by the nautical skill of St. Luke,
and communicated by him to St. Paul" \[SMITH\].

[Acts 27:31](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 27:31</span></span>

Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers--the only parties now to
be trusted, and whose own safety was now at stake.

except ye abide in the ship ye cannot be saved--The soldiers and
passengers could not be expected to possess the necessary seamanship in
so very critical a case. The flight of the crew, therefore, might well
be regarded as certain destruction to all who remained. In full
assurance of ultimate safety, in virtue of a DIVINE pledge, to all in
the ship, Paul speaks and acts throughout this whole scene in the
exercise of a sound judgment as to the indispensable HUMAN conditions of
safety; and as there is no trace of any feeling of inconsistency between
these two things in his mind, so even the centurion, under whose orders
the soldiers acted on Paul's views, seems never to have felt perplexed
by the twofold aspect, divine and human, in which the same thing
presented itself to the mind of Paul. Divine agency and human
instrumentality are in all the events of life quite as much as here. The
only difference is that the one is for the most part shrouded from view,
while the other is ever naked and open to the senses.

[Acts 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 27:32</span></span>

Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat--already lowered.

and let her fall off--let the boat drift away.

[Acts 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 27:33</span></span>

while day was coming on--"until it should be day"; that is, in the
interval between the cutting off of the boat and the approach of day,
which all were "anxiously looking for" ([Act
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#029).md).

Paul--now looked up to by all the passengers as the man to direct them.

besought them all to take meat--"partake of a meal."

saying, This is the fourteenth day ye have tarried--"waited for a
breathing time."

having eaten nothing--that is, taken no regular meal. The impossibility
of cooking, the occupation of all hands to keep down leakage, &c.,
sufficiently explain this, which is indeed a common occurrence in such
cases.

[Acts 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 27:34</span></span>

I pray you to take some meat, for this is for your health, for there
shall not a hair fall from . . . any of you--On this beautiful union of
confidence in the divine pledge and care for the whole ship's health and
safety see on [Act 27:31](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#031.md).

[Acts 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 27:35</span></span>

when he had thus spoken he took bread--assuming the lead.

and gave thanks to God in presence of them all--an impressive act in
such circumstances, and fitted to plant a testimony for the God he
served in the breasts of all.

when he had broken it, he began to eat--not understood by the Christians
in the ship as a love-feast, or celebration of the Lord's Supper, as
some think, but a meal to recruit exhausted nature, which Paul shows
them by his own example how a Christian partakes of.

[Acts 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 27:36</span></span>

Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat--"took
food"; the first full meal since the commencement of the gale. Such
courage in desperate circumstances as Paul here showed is wonderfully
infectious.

[Acts 27:38](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 27:38</span></span>

when they had eaten enough, &c.--With fresh strength after the meal,
they make a third and last effort to lighten the ship, not only by
pumping, as before, but by throwing the whole cargo of wheat into the
sea (see on [Act 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006).md).

[Acts 27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 27:39</span></span>

when it was day they knew not the land--This has been thought surprising
in sailors accustomed to that sea. But the scene of the wreck is remote
from the great harbor, and possesses no marked features by which it
could be recognized, even by a native if he came unexpectedly upon it
\[SMITH\], not to speak of the rain pouring in torrents ([Act
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002).md), which would throw a haze over
the coast even after day broke. Immediately on landing they knew where
they were ([Act 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001).md).

discovered a creek with a shore--Every creek of course, must have a
shore; but the meaning is, a practicable shore, in a nautical sense,
that is, one with a smooth beach, in contradistinction to a rocky coast
(as [Act 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041) shows.md).

into which they were minded, if . . . possible, to thrust the ship--This
was their one chance of safety.

[Acts 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 27:40</span></span>

taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea--The Margin
is here evidently right, "cut the anchors (away), they left them in the
sea."

loosed the rudder bands--Ancient ships were steered by two large
paddles, one on each quarter. When anchored by the stern in a gale, it
would be necessary to lift them out of the water and secure them by
lashings or rudder bands, and to loose these when the ship was again got
under way \[SMITH\].

hoised up the mainsail--her, "the foresail," the best possible sail that
be set in the circumstances. How necessary must the crew have been to
execute all these movements, and how obvious the foresight which made
their stay indispensable to the safety of all on board (see on [Act
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#031).md)!

[Acts 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 27:41</span></span>

falling into a place where two seas met--SMITH thinks this refers to the
channel, not more than one hundred yards broad, which separates the
small island of Salmone from Malta, forming a communication between the
sea inside the bay and that outside.

the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable--"The rocks of Malta
disintegrate into extremely minute particles of sand and clay, which,
when acted upon by the currents or surface agitation, form a deposit of
tenacious clay; but, in still waters, where these causes do not act, mud
is formed; but it is only in creeks, where there are no currents, and at
such a depth as to be undisturbed by the waves, that the mud occurs. A
ship, therefore, impelled by the force of a gale, into a creek, with
such a bottom, would strike a bottom of mud, graduating into tenacious
clay, into which the fore part would fix itself, and be held fast, while
the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" \[SMITH\].

hinder part was broken--The continued action denoted by the tense here
