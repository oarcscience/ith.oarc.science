### [Genesis Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 6:2</span></span>

WICKEDNESS OF THE WORLD. (Gen. 6:1-22)

the sons of God saw the daughters of men--By the former is meant the
family of Seth, who were professedly religious; by the latter, the
descendants of apostate Cain. Mixed marriages between parties of
opposite principles and practice were necessarily sources of extensive
corruption. The women, religious themselves, would as wives and mothers
exert an influence fatal to the existence of religion in their
household, and consequently the people of that later age sank to the
lowest depravity.

[Genesis 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 6:3</span></span>

flesh--utterly, hopelessly debased.

And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive--Christ, as God,
had by His Spirit inspiring Enoch, Noah, and perhaps other prophets
([Pe1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md); [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md), preached repentance to the
antediluvians; but they were incorrigible.

yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years--It is probable that
the corruption of the world, which had now reached its height, had been
long and gradually increasing, and this idea receives support from the
long respite granted.

[Genesis 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 6:4</span></span>

giants--The term in Hebrew implies not so much the idea of great stature
as of reckless ferocity, impious and daring characters, who spread
devastation and carnage far and wide.

[Genesis 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 6:5</span></span>

God saw it . . . repented . . . grieved--God cannot change ([Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md); but, by language suited to our
nature and experience, He is described as about to alter His visible
procedure towards mankind--from being merciful and long-suffering, He
was about to show Himself a God of judgment; and, as that impious race
had filled up the measure of their iniquities, He was about to introduce
a terrible display of His justice ([Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011).md).

[Genesis 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 6:8</span></span>

But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord--favor. What an awful state
of things when only one man or one family of piety and virtue was now
existing among the professed sons of God!

[Genesis 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 6:9</span></span>

Noah . . . just . . . and perfect--not absolutely; for since the fall of
Adam no man has been free from sin except Jesus Christ. But as living by
faith he was just ([Gal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md); [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007).md) and perfect--that is, sincere in
his desire to do God's will.

[Genesis 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 6:11</span></span>

the earth was filled with violence--In the absence of any well-regulated
government it is easy to imagine what evils would arise. Men did what
was right in their own eyes, and, having no fear of God, destruction and
misery were in their ways.

[Genesis 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 6:13</span></span>

And God said unto Noah--How startling must have been the announcement of
the threatened destruction! There was no outward indication of it. The
course of nature and experience seemed against the probability of its
occurrence. The public opinion of mankind would ridicule it. The whole
world would be ranged against him. Yet, persuaded the communication was
from God, through faith ([Heb 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007).md),
he set about preparing the means for preserving himself and family from
the impending calamity.

[Genesis 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 6:14</span></span>

Make thee an ark--ark, a hollow chest ([Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003).md).

gopher wood--probably cypress, remarkable for its durability and
abounding on the Armenian mountains.

rooms--cabins or small cells.

pitch it within and without--mineral pitch, asphalt, naphtha, or some
bituminous substance, which, when smeared over and become hardened,
would make it perfectly watertight.

[Genesis 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 6:15</span></span>

And this is the fashion--According to the description, the ark was not a
ship, but an immense house in form and structure like the houses in the
East, designed not to sail, but only to float. Assuming the cubit to be
21.888 inches, the ark would be five hundred forty-seven feet long,
ninety-one feet two inches wide, and forty-seven feet two inches high.

[Genesis 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 6:16</span></span>

A window--probably a skylight, formed of some transparent substance
unknown.

in a cubit shalt thou finish it above--a direction to raise the roof in
the middle, seemingly to form a gentle slope for letting the water run
off.

[Genesis 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 6:17</span></span>

And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood--The repetition of the
announcement was to establish its certainty ([Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032).md). Whatever opinion may be
entertained as to the operation of natural laws and agencies in the
deluge, it was brought on the world by God as a punishment for the
enormous wickedness of its inhabitants.

[Genesis 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 6:18</span></span>

But with thee will I establish my covenant--a special promise of
deliverance, called a covenant, to convince him of the confidence to be
reposed in it. The substance and terms of this covenant are related at
[Gen 6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#019.md).

[Genesis 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 6:22</span></span>

Thus did Noah--He began without delay to prepare the colossal fabric,
and in every step of his progress faithfully followed the divine
directions he had received.
