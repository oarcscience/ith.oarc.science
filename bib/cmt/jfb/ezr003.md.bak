### [Ezra Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 3:1</span></span>

THE ALTAR SET UP. ([Ezr 3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001).md)

when the seventh month was come--The departure of the returning exiles
from Babylon took place in the spring. For some time after their arrival
they were occupied in the necessary work of rearing habitations to
themselves amid the ruins of Jerusalem and its neighborhood. This
preliminary work being completed, they addressed themselves to rebuild
the altar of burnt offering. As the seventh month of the sacred year was
at hand--corresponding to the latter end of our September--when the
feast of tabernacles ([Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034).md) fell
to be observed, they resolved to celebrate that religious festival, just
as if the temple had been fully restored.

[Ezra 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 3:2</span></span>

Jeshua--the grandson of Seraiah, the high priest, put to death by
Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah ([Kg2
25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018).md). His father, Josedech, had
been carried captive to Babylon, and died there, some time before this.

Zerubbabel--was, according to the order of nature, son of Pedaiah ([Ch1
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017).md); but having been brought up
by Salathiel, he was called his son.

builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings
thereon--This was of urgent and immediate necessity, in order, first, to
make atonement for their sins; secondly, to obtain the divine blessing
on their preparations for the temple, as well as animate their feelings
of piety and patriotism for the prosecution of that national work.

[Ezra 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 3:3</span></span>

they set the altar upon his bases--They reared it upon its old
foundation, so that it occupied as nearly as possible the site on which
it had formerly stood.

they offered burnt offerings . . . morning and evening--Deeming it their
duty to perform the public rites of religion, they did not wait till the
temple should be rebuilt and dedicated; but, at the outset, they resumed
the daily service prescribed by the law ([Exo
29:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Lev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md), [Lev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#011).md), as well as observed the annual
seasons of solemn observance.

[Ezra 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 3:4</span></span>

OFFERINGS RENEWED. ([Ezr 3:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004).md)

They kept also the feast of tabernacles . . . From the first day of the
seventh month--They revived at that time the daily oblation, and it was
on the fifteenth day of that month the feast of tabernacles was held.

[Ezra 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 3:7</span></span>

They gave . . . meat . . . drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon--They
opened negotiations with the Tyrians for workmen, as well as for timber,
on the same terms and with the same views as Solomon had done ([Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md); [Ch2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#015).md).

[Ezra 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 3:8</span></span>

THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE LAID. ([Ezr
3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md)

appointed the Levites . . . to set forward the work--that is, to act as
overseers of the workmen, and to direct and animate the laborers in the
various departments.

[Ezra 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 3:9</span></span>

Jeshua with his sons--not the high priest, but a Levite ([Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040).md). To these, as probably
distinguished for their mechanical skill and taste, the duty of acting
as overseers was particularly committed.

[Ezra 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 3:12</span></span>

But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers . . . wept
with a loud voice--Those painful emotions were excited by the sad
contrast between the prosperous circumstances in which the foundations
of the first temple had been laid and the desolate, reduced state of the
country and city when the second was begun; between the inferior size
and less costliness of the stones used in the foundations of the second
([Kg1 7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009).md), and the much smaller
extent of the foundation itself, including all the appurtenances of the
building ([Hag 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003).md); between the
comparative smallness of their present means and the immense resources
of David and Solomon. Perhaps, however, the chief cause of grief was
that the second temple would be destitute of those things which formed
the great and distinguishing glory of the first; namely, the ark, the
shekinah, the Urim and Thummim, &c. Not that this second temple was not
a very grand and beautiful structure. But no matter how great its
material splendor was, it was inferior in this respect to that of
Solomon. Yet the glory of the second far outshone that of the first
temple in another and more important point of view, namely, the
receiving within its walls the incarnate Saviour ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md).

[Ezra 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 3:13</span></span>

the people could not discern the shout of joy from the noise of the
weeping of the people--Among Eastern people, expressions of sorrow are
always very loud and vehement. It is indicated by wailing, the howl of
which is sometimes not easily distinguishable from joyful acclamations.
