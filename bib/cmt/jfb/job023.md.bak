### [Job Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

[Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 23:2</span></span>

JOB'S ANSWER. (Job 23:1-17)

to-day--implying, perhaps, that the debate was carried on through more
days than one (see Introduction).

bitter-- ([Job 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011.md); [Job
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001).md).

my stroke--the hand of God on me (Margin, [Job
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021.md); [Psa
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004).md).

heavier than--is so heavy that I cannot relieve myself adequately by
groaning.

[Job 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 23:3</span></span>

The same wish as in [Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md) (compare
[Heb 10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md).

Seat--The idea in the Hebrew is a well-prepared throne ([Psa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007).md).

[Job 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 23:4</span></span>

order--state methodically ([Job 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md);
[Isa 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026).md).

fill, &c.--I would have abundance of arguments to adduce.

[Job 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 23:5</span></span>

he--emphatic: it little matters what man may say of me, if only I know
what God judges of me.

[Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 23:6</span></span>

An objection suggests itself, while he utters the wish ([Job
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005).md). Do I hereby wish that He should
plead against me with His omnipotence? Far from it! ([Job
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019.md), [Job
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md); [Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md); [Job
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018).md).

strength--so as to prevail with Him: as in Jacob's case ([Hos
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md). UMBREIT and MAURER better
translate as in [Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md) (I only wish
that He) "would attend to me," that is, give me a patient hearing as an
ordinary judge, not using His omnipotence, but only His divine knowledge
of my innocence.

[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 23:7</span></span>

There--rather, "Then": if God would "attend" to me ([Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006).md).

righteous--that is, the result of my dispute would be, He would
acknowledge me as righteous.

delivered--from suspicion of guilt on the part of my Judge.

[Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 23:8</span></span>

But I wish in vain. For "behold," &c.

forward . . . backward--rather, "to the east--to the west." The Hebrew
geographers faced the east, that is, sunrise: not the north, as we do.
So "before" means east: "behind," west (so the Hindus). Para,
"before"--east: Apara, "behind"--west: Daschina, "the right
hand"--south: Bama, "left"--north. A similar reference to sunrise
appears in the name Asia, "sunrise," Europe, "sunset"; pure Babylonian
names, as RAWLINSON shows.

[Job 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 23:9</span></span>

Rather, "To the north."

work--God's glorious works are especially seen towards the north region
of the sky by one in the northern hemisphere. The antithesis is between
God working and yet not being beheld: as in [Job
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md), between "He goeth by," and "I
see Him not." If the Hebrew bears it, the parallelism to the second
clause is better suited by translating, as UMBREIT, "doth hide himself";
but then the antithesis to "behold" would be lost.

right hand--"in the south."

hideth--appropriately, of the unexplored south, then regarded as
uninhabitable because of its heat (see [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029).md).

[Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 23:10</span></span>

But--correcting himself for the wish that his cause should be known
before God. The omniscient One already knoweth the way in me (my inward
principles: His outward way or course of acts is mentioned in [Job
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md). So in me, [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021).md); though for some inscrutable
cause He as yet hides Himself ([Job
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008).md).

when--let Him only but try my cause, I shall, &c.

[Job 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 23:11</span></span>

held--fast by His steps. The law is in Old Testament poetry regarded as
a way, God going before us as our guide, in whose footsteps we must
tread ([Psa 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005).md).

declined-- ([Psa 125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005).md).

[Job 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 23:12</span></span>

esteemed--rather, "laid up," namely, as a treasure found ([Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md); [Psa
119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011).md); alluding to the words of
Eliphaz ([Job 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022).md). There was no
need to tell me so; I have done so already ([Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).md).

necessary--"Appointed portion" (of food; as in [Pro
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008).md). UMBREIT and MAURER translate,
"More than my law," my own will, in antithesis to "the words of His
mouth" ([Joh 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038).md). Probably under the
general term, "what is appointed to me" (the same Hebrew is in [Job
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014).md), all that ministers to the
appetites of the body and carnal will is included.

[Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 23:13</span></span>

in one mind--notwithstanding my innocence, He is unaltered in His
purpose of proving me guilty ([Job
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012).md).

soul--His will ([Psa 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003).md). God's
sovereignty. He has one great purpose; nothing is haphazard; everything
has its proper place with a view to His purpose.

[Job 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 23:14</span></span>

many such--He has yet many more such ills in store for me, though hidden
in His breast ([Job 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013).md).

[Job 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 23:15</span></span>

God's decrees, impossible to be resisted, and leaving us in the dark as
to what may come next, are calculated to fill the mind with holy awe
\[BARNES\].

[Job 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 23:16</span></span>

soft--faint; hath melted my courage. Here again Job's language is that
of Jesus Christ ([Psa 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014).md).

[Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 23:17</span></span>

Because I was not taken away by death from the evil to come (literally,
"from before the face of the darkness," [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001).md). Alluding to the words of
Eliphaz ([Job 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011).md), "darkness," that
is, calamity.

cut off--rather, in the Arabic sense, brought to the land of silence; my
sad complaint hushed in death \[UMBREIT\]. "Darkness" in the second
clause, not the same Hebrew word as in the first, "cloud," "obscurity."
Instead of "covering the cloud (of evil) from my face," He "covers" me
with it ([Job 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011).md).
