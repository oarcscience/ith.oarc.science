Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

JEHOVAH'S ATTRIBUTES AS A JEALOUS JUDGE OF SIN, YET MERCIFUL TO HIS
TRUSTING PEOPLE, SHOULD INSPIRE THEM WITH CONFIDENCE. HE WILL NOT ALLOW
THE ASSYRIANS AGAIN TO ASSAIL THEM, BUT WILL DESTROY THE FOE. ([Nah
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001))

burden of Nineveh--the prophetic doom of Nineveh. Nahum prophesied
against that city a hundred fifty years after Jonah.

[Nahum 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 1:2</span></span>

jealous--In this there is sternness, yet tender affection. We are
jealous only of those we love: a husband, of a wife; a king, of his
subjects' loyalty. God is jealous of men because He loves them. God will
not bear a rival in His claims on them. His burning jealousy for His own
wounded honor and their love, as much as His justice, accounts for all
His fearful judgments: the flood, the destruction of Jerusalem, that of
Nineveh. His jealousy will not admit of His friends being oppressed, and
their enemies flourishing (compare [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005); [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)). Burning zeal enters into the
idea in "jealous" here (compare [Num
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011), [Num
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013); [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010)).

the Lord revengeth . . . Lord revengeth--The repetition of the
incommunicable name JEHOVAH, and of His revenging, gives an awful
solemnity to the introduction.

furious--literally, "a master of fury." So a master of the tongue, that
is, "eloquent." "One who, if He pleases, can most readily give effect to
His fury" \[GROTIUS\]. Nahum has in view the provocation to fury given
to God by the Assyrians, after having carried away the ten tribes, now
proceeding to invade Judea under Hezekiah.

reserveth wrath for his enemies--reserves it against His own appointed
time ([Pe2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009)). After long waiting
for their repentance in vain, at length punishing them. A wrong estimate
of Jehovah is formed from His suspending punishment: it is not that He
is insensible or dilatory, but He reserves wrath for His own fit time.
In the case of the penitent, He does not reserve or retain His anger
([Psa 103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009); [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005), [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018)).

[Nahum 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 1:3</span></span>

slow to anger, and great in power--that is, but great in power, so as to
be able in a moment, if He pleases, to destroy the wicked. His
long-suffering is not from want of power to punish ([Exo
34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006)).

not at all acquit--literally, "will not acquitting acquit," or treat as
innocent.

Lord hath his way in the whirlwind--From this to [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005), inclusive, is a description of
His power exhibited in the phenomena of nature, especially when He is
wroth. His vengeance shall sweep away the Assyrian foe like a whirlwind
([Pro 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025)).

clouds are the dust of his feet--Large as they are, He treads on them,
as a man would on the small dust; He is Lord of the clouds, and uses
them as He pleases.

[Nahum 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 1:4</span></span>

rebuketh the sea--as Jesus did ([Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026)), proving Himself God (compare
[Isa 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)).

Bashan languisheth--through drought; ordinarily it was a region famed
for its rich pasturage (compare [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010)).

flower of Lebanon--its bloom; all that blooms so luxuriantly on Lebanon
([Hos 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007)). As Bashan was famed for
its pastures, Carmel for its corn fields and vineyards, so Lebanon for
its forests ([Isa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009)). There is
nothing in the world so blooming that God cannot change it when He is
wroth.

[Nahum 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">nah 1:5</span></span>

earth is burned--so GROTIUS. Rather, "lifts itself," that is, "heaveth"
\[MAURER\]: as the Hebrew is translated in [Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009); [Hos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001); compare [Sa2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021), Margin.

[Nahum 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">nah 1:6</span></span>

fury is poured out like fire--like the liquid fire poured out of
volcanoes in all directions (see [Jer
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020)).

rocks are thrown down--or, "are burnt asunder"; the usual effect of
volcanic fire ([Jer 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025), [Jer
51:56](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#056)). As Hannibal burst asunder the
Alpine rocks by fire to make a passage for his army \[GROTIUS\].

[Nahum 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 1:7</span></span>

Here Nahum enters on his special subject, for which the previous verses
have prepared the way, namely, to assure his people of safety in Jehovah
under the impending attack of Sennacherib ([Nah
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007)), and to announce the doom of
Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian foe ([Nah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008)). The contrast of [Nah
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007) heightens the force.

he knoweth--recognizes as His own ([Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005); [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002)); and so, cares for and guards
([Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)).

[Nahum 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 1:8</span></span>

with an overrunning flood--that is, with irresistible might which
overruns every barrier like a flood. This image is often applied to
overwhelming armies of invaders. Also of calamity in general ([Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006); [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007); [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005)). There is, perhaps, a special
allusion to the mode of Nineveh's capture by the Medo-Babylonian army;
namely, through a flood in the river which broke down the wall twenty
furlongs (see on [Nah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006); [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008); [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026); [Dan
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010), [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040)).

end of the place thereof--Nineveh is personified as a queen; and "her
place" of residence (the Hebrew for "thereof" is feminine) is the city
itself ([Nah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008)), \[MAURER\]. Or, He
shall so utterly destroy Nineveh that its place cannot be found; [Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017) confirms this (compare [Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036); [Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035); [Rev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008); [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)).

darkness--the severest calamities.

[Nahum 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 1:9</span></span>

What do ye imagine against the Lord?--abrupt address to the Assyrians.
How mad is your attempt, O Assyrians, to resist so powerful a God! What
can ye do against such an adversary, successful though ye have been
against all other adversaries? Ye imagine ye have to do merely with
mortals and with a weak people, and that so you will gain an easy
victory; but you have to encounter God, the protector of His people.
Parallel to [Isa 37:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023); compare
[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).

he will make an utter end--The utter overthrow of Sennacherib's host,
soon about to take place, is an earnest of the "utter end" of Nineveh
itself.

affliction shall not rise up the second time--Judah's "affliction"
caused by the invasion shall never rise again. So [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012). But CALVIN takes the
"affliction" to be that of Assyria: "There will be no need of His
inflicting on you a second blow: He will make an utter end of you once
for all" ([Sa1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012); [Sa1
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008); [Sa2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010)). If so, this verse, in contrast
to [Nah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012), will express, Affliction
shall visit the Assyrian no more, in a sense very different from that in
which God will afflict Judah no more. In the Assyrian's case, because
the blow will be fatally final; the latter, because God will make
lasting blessedness in Judah's case succeed temporary chastisement. But
it seems simpler to refer "affliction" here, as in [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012), to Judah; indeed destruction,
rather than affliction, applies to the Assyrian.

[Nahum 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">nah 1:10</span></span>

while they are folden together as thorns--literally, "to the same degree
as thorns" (compare [Ch1 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027),
Margin). As thorns, so folded together and entangled that they cannot be
loosed asunder without trouble, are thrown by the husbandmen all in a
mass into the fire, so the Assyrians shall all be given together to
destruction. Compare [Sa2 23:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006),
where also "thorns" are the image of the wicked. As this image
represents the speediness of their destruction in a mass, so that of
"drunkards," their rushing as it were of their own accord into it; for
drunkards fall down without any one pushing them \[KIMCHI\]. CALVIN
explains, Although ye be dangerous to touch as thorns (that is, full of
rage and violence), yet the Lord can easily consume you. But "although"
will hardly apply to the next clause. English Version and KIMCHI,
therefore, are to be preferred. The comparison to drunkards is
appropriate. For drunkards, though exulting and bold, are weak and
easily thrown down by even a finger touching them. So the insolent
self-confidence of the Assyrians shall precipitate their overthrow by
God. The Hebrew is "soaked," or "drunken as with their own wine." Their
drunken revelries are perhaps alluded to, during which the foe
(according to DIODORUS SICULUS \[2\]) broke into their city, and
Sardanapalus burned his palace; though the main and ultimate destruction
of Nineveh referred to by Nahum was long subsequent to that under
Sardanapalus.

[Nahum 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 1:11</span></span>

The cause of Nineveh's overthrow: Sennacherib's plots against Judah.

come out of thee--O Nineveh. From thyself shall arise the source of thy
own ruin. Thou shalt have only thyself to blame for it.

imagineth evil--Sennacherib carried out the imaginations of his
countrymen ([Nah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009)) against the Lord
and His people ([Kg2 19:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022)).

a wicked counsellor--literally, "a counsellor of Belial." Belial means
"without profit," worthless, and so bad ([Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025); [Co2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015)).

[Nahum 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 1:12</span></span>

The same truths repeated as in [Nah
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009), Jehovah here being the
speaker. He addresses Judah, prophesying good to it, and evil to the
Assyrian.

Though they be quiet--that is, without fear, and tranquilly secure. So
Chaldee and CALVIN. Or, "entire," "complete"; "Though their power be
unbroken \[MAURER\], and though they be so many, yet even so they shall
be cut down" (literally, "shorn"; as hair shaved off closely by a razor,
[Isa 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020)). As the Assyrian was a
razor shaving others, so shall he be shaven himself. Retribution in
kind. In the height of their pride and power, they shall be clean cut
off. The same Hebrew stands for "likewise" and "yet thus." So many as
they are, so many shall they perish.

when he shall pass through--or, "and he shall pass away," namely, "the
wicked counsellor" ([Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011)),
Sennacherib. The change of number to the singular distinguishes him from
his host. They shall be cut down, he shall pass away home ([Kg2
19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035)) \[HENDERSON\]. English
Version is better, "they shall be cut down, "when" He (Jehovah) shall
pass through," destroying by one stroke the Assyrian host. This gives
the reason why they with all their numbers and power are to be so
utterly cut off. Compare "pass through," that is, in destroying power
([Eze 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012), [Eze
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023); [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008); [Dan
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010)).

Though I have afflicted thee--Judah, "I will afflict thee no more" ([Isa
40:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001); [Isa
52:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001)). The contrast is between
"they," the Assyrians, and "thee," Judah. Their punishment is fatal and
final. Judah's was temporary and corrective.

[Nahum 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">nah 1:13</span></span>

will I break his yoke--the Assyrian's yoke, namely, the tribute imposed
by Sennacherib on Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014)).

from off thee--O Judah ([Isa 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027)).

[Nahum 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">nah 1:14</span></span>

that no more of thy name be sown--that no more of thy seed, bearing thy
name, as kings of Nineveh, be propagated; that thy dynasty become
extinct, namely, on the destruction of Nineveh here foretold; "thee"
means the king of Assyria.

will I cut off . . . graven image--The Medes under Cyaxares, the joint
destroyers of Nineveh with the Babylonians, hated idolatry, and would
delight in destroying its idols. As the Assyrians had treated the gods
of other nations, so their own should be treated ([Kg2
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#018)). The Assyrian palaces partook
of a sacred character \[LAYARD\]; so that "house of thy gods" may refer
to the palace. At Khorsabad there is remaining a representation of a man
cutting an idol to pieces.

I will make thy grave--rather, "I will make it (namely, 'the house of
thy gods,' that is, 'Nisroch') thy grave" ([Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037); [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)). Thus, by Sennacherib's being
slain in it, Nisroch's house should be defiled. Neither thy gods, nor
thy temple, shall save thee; but the latter shall be thy sepulchre.

thou art vile--or, thou art lighter than due weight ([Dan
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#027); compare [Job
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006)) \[MAURER\].

[Nahum 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">nah 1:15</span></span>

This verse is joined in the Hebrew text to the second chapter. It is
nearly the same as [Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007),
referring to the similar deliverance from Babylon.

him that bringeth good tidings--announcing the overthrow of Sennacherib
and deliverance of Jerusalem. The "mountains" are those round Jerusalem,
on which Sennacherib's host had so lately encamped, preventing Judah
from keeping her "feasts," but on which messengers now speed to
Jerusalem, publishing his overthrow with a loud voice where lately they
durst not have opened their mouths. A type of the far more glorious
spiritual deliverance of God's people from Satan by Messiah, heralded by
ministers of the Gospel ([Rom 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015)).

perform thy vows--which thou didst promise if God would deliver thee
from the Assyrian.

the wicked--literally, "Belial"; the same as the "counsellor of Belial"
([Nah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011), Margin); namely,
Sennacherib.
