### [Hebrews Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)

[Hebrews 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 3:1</span></span>

THE SON OF GOD GREATER THAN MOSES, WHEREFORE UNBELIEF TOWARDS HIM WILL
INCUR A HEAVIER PUNISHMENT THAN BEFELL UNBELIEVING ISRAEL IN THE
WILDERNESS. (Heb. 3:1-19)

Wherefore--Greek, "Whence," that is, seeing we have such a sympathizing
Helper you ought to "consider attentively," "contemplate"; fix your eyes
and mind on Him with a view to profiting by the contemplation ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)). The Greek word is often used by
Luke, Paul's companion ([Luk 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024),
[Luk 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027)).

brethren--in Christ, the common bond of union.

partakers--"of the Holy Ghost."

heavenly calling--coming to us from heaven, and leading us to heaven
whence it comes. [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014), "the high
calling"; Greek "the calling above," that is, heavenly.

the Apostle and High Priest of our profession--There is but one Greek
article to both nouns, "Him who is at once Apostle and High
Priest"--Apostle, as Ambassador (a higher designation than
"angel"-messenger) sent by the Father ([Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021)), pleading the cause of God with
us; High Priest, as pleading our cause with God. Both His Apostleship
and High Priesthood are comprehended in the one title, Mediator
\[BENGEL\]. Though the title "Apostle" is nowhere else applied to
Christ, it is appropriate here in addressing Hebrews, who used the term
of the delegates sent by the high priest to collect the temple tribute
from Jews resident in foreign countries, even as Christ was Delegate of
the Father to this world far off from Him ([Mat
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037)). Hence as what applies to Him,
applies also to His people, the Twelve are designated His apostles, even
as He is the Father's ([Joh 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021)). It
was desirable to avoid designating Him here "angel," in order to
distinguish His nature from that of angels mentioned before, though he
is "the Angel of the Covenant." The "legate of the Church" (Sheliach
Tsibbur) offered up the prayers in the synagogue in the name of all, and
for all. So Jesus, "the Apostle of our profession," is delegated to
intercede for the Church before the Father. The words "of our
profession," mark that it is not of the legal ritual, but of our
Christian faith, that He is the High Priest. Paul compares Him as an
Apostle to Moses; as High Priest to Aaron. He alone holds both offices
combined, and in a more eminent degree than either, which those two
brothers held apart.

profession--"confession," corresponds to God having spoken to us by His
Son, sent as Apostle and High Priest. What God proclaims we confess.

[Hebrews 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 3:2</span></span>

He first notes the feature of resemblance between Moses and Christ, in
order to conciliate the Hebrew Christians whom He addressed, and who
still entertained a very high opinion of Moses; he afterwards brings
forward Christ's superiority to Moses.

Who was faithful--The Greek implies also that He still is faithful,
namely, as our mediating High Priest, faithful to the trust God has
assigned Him ([Heb 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)). So Moses in
God's house ([Num 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007)).

appointed him--"made Him" HIGH PRIEST; to be supplied from the preceding
context. Greek, "made"; so in [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005); [Sa1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006), Margin; [Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036); so the Greek fathers. Not as
ALFORD, with AMBROSE and the Latins, "created Him," that is, as man, in
His incarnation. The likeness of Moses to Messiah was foretold by Moses
himself ([Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015)). Other prophets
only explained Moses, who was in this respect superior to them; but
Christ was like Moses, yet superior.

[Hebrews 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 3:3</span></span>

For--assigning the reason why they should "consider" attentively
"Christ" ([Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)), highly as they
regard Moses who resembled Him in faithfulness ([Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)).

was--Greek, "has been."

counted worthy of more glory--by God, when He exalted Him to His own
right hand. The Hebrew Christians admitted the fact ([Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013)).

builded the house--Greek, "inasmuch as He hath more honor than the
house, who prepared it," or "established it" \[ALFORD\]. The Greek verb
is used purposely instead of "builded," in order to mark that the
building meant is not a literal, but a spiritual house: the Church both
of the Old Testament and New Testament; and that the building of such a
house includes all the preparations of providence and grace needed to
furnish it with "living stones" and fitting "servants." Thus, as Christ
the Founder and Establisher (in Old Testament as well as the New
Testament) is greater than the house so established, including the
servants, He is greater also than Moses, who was but a "servant." Moses,
as a servant, is a portion of the house, and less than the house;
Christ, as the Instrumental Creator of all things, must be God, and so
greater than the house of which Moses was but a part. Glory is the
result of honor.

[Hebrews 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 3:4</span></span>

Someone must be the establisher of every house; Moses was not the
establisher of the house, but a portion of it (but He who established
all things, and therefore the spiritual house in question, is God).
Christ, as being instrumentally the Establisher of all things, must be
the Establisher of the house, and so greater than Moses.

[Hebrews 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 3:5</span></span>

faithful in all his house--that is in all GOD'S house ([Heb
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004)).

servant--not here the Greek for "slave," but "a ministering attendant";
marking the high office of Moses towards God, though inferior to Christ,
a kind of steward.

for a testimony of, &c.--in order that he might in his typical
institutions give "testimony" to Israel "of the things" of the Gospel
"which were to be spoken afterwards" by Christ ([Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005); [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008), [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)).

[Hebrews 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 3:6</span></span>

But Christ--was and is faithful ([Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)).

as a son over his own house--rather, "over His (GOD'S, [Heb
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004)) house"; and therefore, as the
inference from His being one with God, over His own house. So [Heb
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021), "having an High Priest over the
house of God." Christ enters His Father's house as the Master \[OVER
it\], but Moses as a servant \[IN it, [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002), [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)\] \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. An ambassador in
the absence of the king is very distinguished--in the presence of the
king he falls back into the multitude \[BENGEL\].

whose house are we--Paul and his Hebrew readers. One old manuscript,
with Vulgate and LUCIFER, reads, "which house"; but the weightiest
manuscripts support English Version reading.

the rejoicing--rather, "the matter of rejoicing."

of the hope--"of our hope." Since all our good things lie in hopes, we
ought so to hold fast our hopes as already to rejoice, as though our
hopes were realized \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

firm unto the end--omitted in LUCIFER and AMBROSE, and in one oldest
manuscript, but supported by most oldest manuscripts.

[Hebrews 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 3:7</span></span>

Exhortation from [Psa 95:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007), not
through unbelief to lose participation in the spiritual house. Seeing
that we are the house of God if we hold fast our confidence . . . ([Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)). Jesus is "faithful," be not ye
unfaithful ([Heb 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002), [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012)). The sentence beginning with
"wherefore," interrupted by the parenthesis confirming the argument from
[Psa 95:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007), is completed at [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012), "Take heed," &c.

Holy Ghost saith--by the inspired Psalmist; so that the words of the
latter are the words of God Himself.

To-day--at length; in David's day, as contrasted with the days of Moses
in the wilderness, and the whole time since then, during which they had
been rebellious against God's voice; as for instance, in the wilderness
([Heb 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008)). The Psalm, each fresh time
when used in public worship, by "to-day," will mean the particular day
when it was, or is, used.

hear--obediently.

his voice--of grace.

[Hebrews 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 3:8</span></span>

Harden not your hearts--This phrase here only is used of man's own act;
usually of God's act ([Rom 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018)). When
man is spoken of as the agent in hardening, the phrase usually is,
"harden his neck," or "back" ([Neh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017)).

provocation . . . temptation--"Massah-meribah," translated in Margin
"tentation . . . chiding," or "strife" ([Exo
17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)). Both names seem to refer to
that one event, the murmuring of the people against the Lord at Rephidim
for want of water. The first offense especially ought to be guarded
against, and is the most severely reproved, as it is apt to produce many
more. [Num 20:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001) and [Deu
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008) mention a second similar occasion
in the wilderness of Sin, near Kadesh, also called Meribah.

in the day--Greek, "according to the day of."

[Hebrews 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 3:9</span></span>

When--rather, "Where," namely, in the wilderness.

your fathers--The authority of the ancients is not conclusive
\[BENGEL\].

tempted me, proved me--The oldest manuscripts read, "tempted (Me) in the
way of testing," that is, putting (Me) to the proof whether I was able
and willing to relieve them, not believing that I am so.

saw my works forty years--They saw, without being led thereby to
repentance, My works of power partly in affording miraculous help,
partly in executing vengeance, forty years. The "forty years" joined in
the Hebrew and Septuagint, and below, [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017), with "I was grieved," is here
joined with "they saw." Both are true; for, during the same forty years
that they were tempting God by unbelief, notwithstanding their seeing
God's miraculous works, God was being grieved. The lesson intended to be
hinted to the Hebrew Christians is, their "to-day" is to last only
between the first preaching of the Gospel and Jerusalem's impending
overthrow, namely, FORTY YEARS; exactly the number of years of Israel's
sojourn in the wilderness, until the full measure of their guilt having
been filled up all the rebels were overthrown.

[Hebrews 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 3:10</span></span>

grieved--displeased. Compare "walk contrary," [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024), [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028).

that generation--"that" implies alienation and estrangement. But the
oldest manuscripts read, "this."

said--"grieved," or "displeased," at their first offense. Subsequently
when they hardened their heart in unbelief still more, He sware in His
wrath ([Heb 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011)); an ascending
gradation (compare [Heb 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017)).

and they have not known--Greek, "But these very persons," &c. They
perceived I was displeased with them, yet they, the same persons, did
not a whit the more wish to know my ways \[BENGEL\]; compare "but they,"
[Psa 106:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043).

not known my ways--not known practically and believingly the ways in
which I would have had them go, so as to reach My rest ([Exo
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#020)).

[Hebrews 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 3:11</span></span>

So--literally, "as."

I sware--BENGEL remarks the oath of God preceded the forty years.

not--literally, "If they shall enter . . . (God do so to me and more
also)," [Sa2 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035). The Greek is the
same, [Mar 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012).

my rest--Canaan, primarily, their rest after wandering in the
wilderness: still, even when in it, they never fully enjoyed rest;
whence it followed that the threat extended farther than the exclusion
of the unbelieving from the literal land of rest, and that the rest
promised to the believing in its full blessedness was, and is, yet
future: [Psa 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013); [Psa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009), [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011), [Psa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022), [Psa
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#029), and Christ's own beatitude
([Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005)) all accord with this, [Heb
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009).

[Hebrews 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 3:12</span></span>

Take heed--to be joined with "wherefore," [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007).

lest there be--Greek (indicative), "lest there shall be"; lest there be,
as I fear there is; implying that it is not merely a possible
contingency, but that there is ground for thinking it will be so.

in any--"in any one of you." Not merely ought all in general be on their
guard, but they ought to be so concerned for the safety of each one
member, as not to suffer any one to perish through their negligence
\[CALVIN\].

heart--The heart is not to be trusted. Compare [Heb
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010), "They do always err in their
heart."

unbelief--faithlessness. Christ is faithful; therefore, saith Paul to
the Hebrews, we ought not to be faithless as our fathers were under
Moses.

departing--apostatizing. The opposite of "come unto" Him ([Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016)). God punishes such apostates in
kind. He departs from them--the worst of woes.

the living God--real: the distinctive characteristic of the God of
Israel, not like the lifeless gods of the heathen; therefore One whose
threats are awful realities. To apostatize from Christ is to apostatize
from the living God ([Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003)).

[Hebrews 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 3:13</span></span>

one another--Greek, "yourselves"; let each exhort himself and his
neighbor.

daily--Greek, "on each day," or "day by day."

while it is called To-day--while the "to-day" lasts (the day of grace,
[Luk 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021), before the coming of the
day of glory and judgment at Christ's coming, [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025), [Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)). To-morrow is the day when idle
men work, and fools repent. To-morrow is Satan's to-day; he cares not
what good resolutions you form, if only you fix them for to-morrow.

lest . . . of you--The "you" is emphatic, as distinguished from "your
fathers" ([Heb 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009)). "That from among
you no one (so the Greek order is in some of the oldest manuscripts) be
hardened" ([Heb 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008)).

deceitfulness--causing you to "err in your heart."

sin--unbelief.

[Hebrews 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 3:14</span></span>

For, &c.--enforcing the warning, [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012).

partakers of Christ--(Compare [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001), [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)). So "partakers of the Holy Ghost"
([Heb 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)).

hold--Greek, "hold fast."

the beginning of our confidence--that is, the confidence (literally,
substantial, solid confidence) of faith which we have begun ([Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)). A Christian so long as he is
not made perfect, considers himself as a beginner \[BENGEL\].

unto the end--unto the coming of Christ ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)).

[Hebrews 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 3:15</span></span>

While it is said--connected with [Heb
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013), "exhort one another . . . while
it is said, To-day": [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014), "for
we are made partakers," &c., being a parenthesis. "It entirely depends
on yourselves that the invitation of the ninety-fifth Psalm be not a
mere invitation, but also an actual enjoyment." ALFORD translates,
"Since (that is, 'for') it is said," &c., regarding [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015) as a proof that we must "hold . .
. confidence . . . unto the end," in order to be "partakers of Christ."

[Hebrews 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 3:16</span></span>

For some--rather interrogatively, "For WHO was it that, when they had
heard (referring to 'if ye will hear,' [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015)), did provoke (God)?" The "For"
implies, Ye need to take heed against unbelief: for, was it not because
of unbelief that all our fathers were excluded ([Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003))? "Some," and "not all," would be
a faint way of putting his argument, when his object is to show the
universality of the evil. Not merely some, but all the Israelites, for
the solitary exceptions, Joshua and Caleb, are hardly to be taken into
account in so general a statement. So [Heb
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017), are interrogative: (1) the
beginning of the provocation, soon after the departure from Egypt, is
marked in [Heb 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016); (2) the forty
years of it in the wilderness, [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017); (3) the denial of entrance into
the land of rest, [Heb 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018). Compare
Note, see on [Co1 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005), "with the
majority of them God was displeased."

howbeit--"Nay (why need I put the question?), was it not all that came
out of Egypt?" ([Exo 17:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)).

by Moses--by the instrumentality of Moses as their leader.

[Hebrews 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 3:17</span></span>

But--Translate, "Moreover," as it is not in contrast to [Heb
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016), but carrying out the same
thought.

corpses--literally, "limbs," implying that their bodies fell limb from
limb.

[Hebrews 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 3:18</span></span>

to them that believed not--rather as Greek, "to them that disobeyed."
Practical unbelief ([Deu 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#026)).

[Hebrews 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 3:19</span></span>

they could not enter--though desiring it.
