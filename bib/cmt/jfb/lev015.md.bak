### [Leviticus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 15:2</span></span>

UNCLEANNESS OF MEN. (Lev. 15:1-18)

When any man hath a running issue--This chapter describes other forms of
uncleanness, the nature of which is sufficiently intelligible in the
text without any explanatory comment. Being the effects of
licentiousness, they properly come within the notice of the legislator,
and the very stringent rules here prescribed, both for the separation of
the person diseased and for avoiding contamination from anything
connected with him, were well calculated not only to prevent contagion,
but to discourage the excesses of licentious indulgence.

[Leviticus 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 15:9</span></span>

what saddle . . . he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be
unclean--(See on [Gen 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034).md).

[Leviticus 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 15:12</span></span>

the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be
broken--It is thought that the pottery of the Israelites, like the
earthenware jars in which the Egyptians kept their water, was unglazed
and consequently porous, and that it was its porousness which, rendering
it extremely liable to imbibe small particles of impure matter, was the
reason why the vessel touched by an unclean person was ordered to be
broken.

[Leviticus 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 15:13</span></span>

then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing--Like a
leprous person he underwent a week's probation, to make sure he was
completely healed. Then with the sacrifices prescribed, the priest made
an atonement for him, that is, offered the oblations necessary for the
removal of his ceremonial defilement, as well as the typical pardon of
his sins.

[Leviticus 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 15:19</span></span>

UNCLEANNESS OF WOMEN. ([Lev 15:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019).md)

if a woman have an issue--Though this, like the leprosy, might be a
natural affection, it was anciently considered contagious and entailed a
ceremonial defilement which typified a moral impurity. This ceremonial
defilement had to be removed by an appointed method of ceremonial
expiation, and the neglect of it subjected any one to the guilt of
defiling the tabernacle, and to death as the penalty of profane
temerity.

[Leviticus 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 15:31</span></span>

Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
uncleanness--The divine wisdom was manifested in inspiring the
Israelites with a profound reverence for holy things; and nothing was
more suited to this purpose than to debar from the tabernacle all who
were polluted by any kind of uncleanness, ceremonial as well as natural,
mental as well as physical. The better to mark out that people as His
family, His servants and priests, dwelling in the camp as in a holy
place, consecrated by His presence and His tabernacle, He required of
them complete purity, and did not allow them to come before Him when
defiled, even by involuntary or secret impurities, as a want of respect
due to His majesty. And when we bear in mind that God was training a
people to live in His presence in some measure as priests devoted to His
service, we shall not consider these rules for the maintenance of
personal purity either too stringent or too minute ([Th1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004).md).
