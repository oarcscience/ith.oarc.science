### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

Upon Nehiloth--flutes or wind instruments. The writer begs to be heard,
on the ground of God's regard for His covenant-people and true
worshippers as contrasted with His holy hatred to the wicked. He prays
for divine guidance, on account of his watchful, malignant, and
deceitful enemies; and for their destruction as being also God's
enemies. At the same time he expresses his confidence that God will
extend aid to His people. ([Psa
5:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001).md)

meditation--moanings of that half-uttered form to which deep feeling
gives rise--groanings, as in [Rom
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md).

[Psalms 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md)

Hearken--incline the ear ([Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md);
compare [Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002).md) --give close
attention.

my cry--that is, for help ([Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md);
[Jer 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019).md).

my King--thus by covenant relation interested in my cause.

[Psalms 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 5:3</span></span>

direct--literally, "set in order," as the showbread was placed or set in
order ([Exo 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

For, &c.--God only regards sincere worshippers.

evil--or, "the evil man."

dwell--lodge, remain under protection.

[Psalms 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 5:5</span></span>

foolish--vainglorious and insolent.

iniquity--especially such as denotes a negation, or defect, that is, of

house-- ([Ch1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#023).md), the tabernacle.

temple--literally, "palace," applied to God's residence, the Holy of
Holies ([Sa1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md); [Sa2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#007).md); the inner part of the
tabernacle.

toward--not in; the high priest alone was allowed to enter.

[Psalms 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 5:8</span></span>

enemies--literally, "watchers" ([Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011).md), hence special need of
guidance.

in thy righteousness--an attribute implying faithfulness in promises as
well as threatenings.

make thy way straight--that is, make the way of providence plain.

[Psalms 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md)

The wicked are not reliable because by nature they are full of
