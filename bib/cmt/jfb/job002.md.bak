### [Job Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)

[Job 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 2:1</span></span>

SATAN FURTHER TEMPTS JOB. ([Job 2:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001).md)

a day--appointed for the angels giving an account of their ministry to
God. The words "to present himself before the Lord" occur here, though
not in [Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md), as Satan has now a
special report to make as to Job.

[Job 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 2:3</span></span>

integrity--literally, "completeness"; so "perfect," another form of the
same Hebrew word, [Job 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md).

movedst . . . against--So [Sa1 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md);
compare [Ch1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001.md) with [Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001.md).

[Job 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 2:4</span></span>

Skin for skin--a proverb. Supply, "He will give." The "skin" is
figurative for any outward good. Nothing outward is so dear that a man
will not exchange it for some other outward good; "but" (not "yea")
"life," the inward good, cannot be replaced; a man will sacrifice
everything else for its sake. Satan sneers bitterly at man's egotism and
says that Job bears the loss of property and children because these are
mere outward and exchangeable goods, but he will give up all things,
even his religion, in order to save his life, if you touch his bones and
flesh. "Skin" and "life" are in antithesis \[UMBREIT\]. The martyrs
prove Satan's sneer false. ROSENMULLER explains it not so well. A man
willingly gives up another's skin (life) for his own skin (life). So Job
might bear the loss of his children, &c., with equanimity, so long as he
remained unhurt himself; but when touched in his own person, he would
renounce God. Thus the first "skin" means the other's skin, that is,
body; the second "skin," one's own, as in [Exo
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028.md).

[Job 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 2:6</span></span>

but save--rather, "only spare his life." Satan shows his ingenuity in
inflicting pain, and also his knowledge of what man's body can bear
without vital injury.

[Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 2:7</span></span>

sore boils--malignant boils; rather, as it is singular in the Hebrew, a
"burning sore." Job was covered with one universal inflammation. The use
of the potsherd \[[Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md)\] agrees
with this view. It was that form of leprosy called black (to distinguish
it from the white), or elephantiasis, because the feet swell like those
of the elephant. The Arabic judham ([Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035).md), where "sore botch" is rather
the black burning boil ([Isa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md).

[Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 2:8</span></span>

a potsherd--not a piece of a broken earthen vessel, but an instrument
made for scratching (the root of the Hebrew word is "scratch"); the sore
was too disgusting to touch. "To sit in the ashes" marks the deepest
mourning ([Jon 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006).md); also humility, as
if the mourner were nothing but dust and ashes; so Abraham ([Gen
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027).md).

[Job 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 2:9</span></span>

JOB REPROVES HIS WIFE. ([Job 2:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009).md)

curse God--rather, "renounce" God. (See on [Job
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005).md) \[UMBREIT\]. However, it was
usual among the heathens, when disappointed in their prayers accompanied
with offerings to their gods, to reproach and curse them.

and die--that is, take thy farewell of God and so die. For no good is to
be got out of religion, either here or hereafter; or, at least, not in
this life \[GILL\]; Nothing makes the ungodly so angry as to see the
godly under trial not angry.

[Job 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 2:10</span></span>

the foolish women--Sin and folly are allied in Scripture ([Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025.md); [Sa2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013.md); [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md).

receive evil--bear willingly ([Lam
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039).md).

[Job 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 2:11</span></span>

Eliphaz--The view of RAWLINSON that "the names of Job's three friends
represent the Chaldean times, about 700 B.C.," cannot be accepted.
Eliphaz is an Idumean name, Esau's oldest son ([Gen
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#004).md); and Teman, son of Eliphaz ([Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015).md), called "duke." EUSEBIUS places
Teman in Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a (but see on [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019).md). Teman means "at the right
hand"; and then the south, namely, part of Idumea; capital of Edom ([Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012).md). Hebrew geographers faced the
east, not the north as we do; hence with them "the right hand" was the
south. Temanites were famed for wisdom ([Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007).md). BARUCH mentions them as
"authors of fables" (namely, proverbs embodying the results of
observation), and "searchers out of understanding."

Bildad the Shuhite--Shuah ("a pit"), son of Abraham and Keturah ([Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002).md). PTOLEMY mentions the region
Syccea, in Arabia-Deserta, east of Batanea.

Zophar the Naamathite--not of the Naamans in Judah ([Jos
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#041).md), which was too distant; but
some region in Arabia-Deserta. FRETELIUS says there was a Naamath in Uz.

[Job 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 2:12</span></span>

toward heaven--They threw ashes violently upwards, that they might fall
on their heads and cover them--the deepest mourning ([Jos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006.md); [Act
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023).md).

[Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 2:13</span></span>

seven days . . . nights--They did not remain in the same posture and
without food, &c., all this time, but for most of this period daily and
nightly. Sitting on the earth marked mourning ([Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md). Seven days was the usual length
of it ([Gen 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#010.md); [Sa1
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013).md). This silence may have been due
to a rising suspicion of evil in Job; but chiefly because it is only
ordinary griefs that find vent in language; extraordinary griefs are too
great for utterance.
