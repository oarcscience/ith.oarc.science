### [Jeremiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 9:1</span></span>

JEREMIAH'S LAMENTATION FOR THE JEWS' SINS AND CONSEQUENT PUNISHMENT.
(Jer. 9:1-26)

This verse is more fitly joined to the last chapter, as [Jer
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md) in the Hebrew (compare [Isa
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md); [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md); [Lam
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048).md).

[Jeremiah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 9:2</span></span>

lodging-place--a caravanseral for caravans, or companies travelling in
the desert, remote from towns. It was a square building enclosing an
open court. Though a lonely and often filthy dwelling, Jeremiah would
prefer even it to the comforts of Jerusalem, so as to be removed from
the pollutions of the capital ([Psa
55:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 9:3</span></span>

bend . . . tongues . . . for lies--that is, with lies as their arrows;
they direct lies on their tongue as their bow ([Psa
64:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003).md).

not valiant for . . . truth-- ([Jer
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028).md). MAURER translates, "They do not
prevail by truth" or faith ([Psa
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004).md). Their tongue, not faith, is
their weapon.

upon . . . earth--rather, "in the land."

know not me-- ([Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 9:4</span></span>

supplant--literally, "trip up by the heel" ([Hos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md).

walk with slanders-- ([Jer 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 9:5</span></span>

weary themselves--are at laborious pains to act perversely \[MAURER\].
Sin is a hard bondage ([Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 9:6</span></span>

Thine--God addresses Jeremiah, who dwelt in the midst of deceitful men.

refuse to know me--Their ignorance of God is wilful ([Jer
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003.md); [Jer
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 9:7</span></span>

melt . . . try them--by sending calamities on them.

for how shall I do--"What else can I do for the sake of the daughter of
My people?" \[MAURER\], ([Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025.md);
[Mal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 9:8</span></span>

tongue . . . arrow shot out--rather, "a murdering arrow" \[MAURER\]
([Jer 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md).

speaketh peaceably . . . in heart . . . layeth . . . wait--layeth his
ambush \[HENDERSON\], ([Psa 55:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 9:9</span></span>

([Jer 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md), [Jer
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029).md).

[Jeremiah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 9:10</span></span>

Jeremiah breaks in upon Jehovah's threats of wrath with lamentation for
his desolated country.

mountains--once cultivated and fruitful: the hillsides were cultivated
in terraces between the rocks.

habitations of . . . wilderness--rather, "the pleasant herbage
(literally, 'the choice parts' of any thing) of the pasture plain." The
Hebrew for "wilderness" expresses not a barren desert, but an untilled
plain, fit for pasture.

burned up--because no one waters them, the inhabitants being all gone.

none can pass through them--much less inhabit them.

fowl-- ([Jer 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 9:11</span></span>

And--omit "And." Jehovah here resumes His speech from [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md).

heaps--(see on [Isa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002).md).

dragons--jackals.

[Jeremiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 9:12</span></span>

Rather, "Who is a wise man? (that is, Whosoever has inspired wisdom,
[Pe2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md); let him understand this
(weigh well the evils impending, and the causes of their being sent);
and he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken (that is, whosoever is
prophetically inspired), let him declare it to his fellow countrymen,"
if haply they may be roused to repentance, the only hope of safety.

[Jeremiah 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 9:13</span></span>

Answer to the "for what the land perisheth" ([Jer
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 9:14</span></span>

([Jer 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024).md).

Baalim--plural of Baal, to express his supposed manifold powers.

fathers taught them-- ([Gal 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md). We are not to follow the errors
of the fathers, but the authority of Scripture and of God \[JEROME\].

[Jeremiah 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 9:15</span></span>

feed-- ([Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014.md); [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md); [Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 9:16</span></span>

nor their fathers have known--alluding to [Jer
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#014.md), "Their fathers taught them"
idolatry; therefore the children shall be scattered to a land which
neither their fathers nor they have known.

send a sword after them--Not even in flight shall they be safe.

[Jeremiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 9:17</span></span>

mourning women--hired to heighten lamentation by plaintive cries baring
the breast, beating the arms, and suffering the hair to flow dishevelled
([Ch2 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md); [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md); [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023).md).

cunning--skilled in wailing.

[Jeremiah 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 9:18</span></span>

([Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 9:19</span></span>

The cry of "the mourning women."

spoiled--laid waste.

dwellings cast us out--fulfilling [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md); [Lev
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022.md). CALVIN translates, "The enemy
have cast down our habitations."

[Jeremiah 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 9:20</span></span>

Yet--rather, "Only" \[HENDERSON\]. This particle calls attention to what
follows.

teach . . . daughters wailing--The deaths will be so many that there
will be a lack of mourning women to bewail them. The mothers, therefore,
must teach their daughters the science to supply the want.

[Jeremiah 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 9:21</span></span>

death . . . windows--The death-inflicting soldiery, finding the doors
closed, burst in by the windows.

to cut off . . . children from . . . streets--Death cannot be said to
enter the windows to cut off the children in the streets, but to cut
them off, so as no more to play in the streets without ([Zac
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 9:22</span></span>

saith the Lord--continuing the thread of discourse from [Jer
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020.md).

dung-- ([Jer 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002).md).

handful . . . none . . . gather them--implying that the handful has been
so trodden as to be not worth even the poor gleaner's effort to gather
it. Or the Eastern custom may be referred to: the reaper cuts the grain
and is followed by another who gathers it. This grain shall not be worth
gathering. How galling to the pride of the Jews to hear that so shall
their carcasses be trodden contemptuously under foot!

[Jeremiah 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 9:23</span></span>

wisdom--political sagacity; as if it could rescue from the impending
calamities.

might--military prowess.

[Jeremiah 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 9:24</span></span>

Nothing but an experimental knowledge of God will save the nation.

understandeth--theoretically; in the intellect.

knoweth--practically: so as to walk in My ways ([Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016.md); [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021.md); [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031).md).

loving kindness--God's mercy is put in the first and highest place,
because without it we should flee from God in fear and despair.

judgment . . . righteousness--loving-kindness towards the godly;
judgment towards the ungodly; righteousness the most perfect fairness in
all cases \[GROTIUS\]. Faithfulness to His promises to preserve the
godly, as well as stern execution of judgment on the ungodly, is
included in "righteousness."

in the earth--contrary to the dogma of some philosophers, that God does
not interfere in terrestrial concerns ([Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011).md).

in these . . . I delight--as well in doing them as in seeing them done
by others ([Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 9:25</span></span>

with the uncircumcised--rather, "all that are circumcised in
uncircumcision" \[HENDERSON\]. The Hebrew is an abstract term, not a
concrete, as English Version translates, and as the pious "circumcised"
is. The nations specified, Egypt, Judah, &c., were outwardly
"circumcised," but in heart were "uncircumcised." The heathen nations
were defiled, in spite of their literal circumcision, by idolatry. The
Jews, with all their glorying in their spiritual privileges, were no
better ([Jer 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md); [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Deu
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md); [Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md). However, [Eze
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md); [Eze
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md), may imply that the Egyptians
were uncircumcised; and it is uncertain as to the other nations
specified whether they were at that early time circumcised. HERODOTUS
says the Egyptians were so; but others think this applies only to the
priests and others having a sacred character, not to the mass of the
nation; so English Version may be fight ([Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 9:26</span></span>

Egypt--put first to degrade Judah, who, though in privileges above the
Gentiles, by unfaithfulness sank below them . . . Egypt, too, was the
power in which the Jews were so prone to trust, and by whose instigation
they, as well as the other peoples specified, revolted from Babylon.

in the utmost corners--rather, "having the hair shaven (or clipped) in
angles," that is, having the beard on the cheek narrowed or cut: a
Canaanitish custom, forbidden to the Israelites ([Lev
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md); [Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).md). The Arabs are hereby referred
to (compare [Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md); [Jer
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032).md), as the words in apposition
show, "that dwell in the wilderness."

uncircumcised . . . uncircumcised in the heart--The addition of "in the
heart" in Israel's case marks its greater guilt in proportion to its
greater privileges, as compared with the rest.
