### [Psalms Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)

[Psalms 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 23:1</span></span>

Under a metaphor borrowed from scenes of pastoral life, with which David
was familiar, he describes God's providential care in providing
refreshment, guidance, protection, and abundance, and so affording
grounds of confidence in His perpetual favor. ([Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001))

Christ's relation to His people is often represented by the figure of a
shepherd ([Joh 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020); [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)), and therefore the opinion that
He is the Lord here so described, and in [Gen
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001); [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011), is not without some good
reason.

[Psalms 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 23:2</span></span>

green pastures--or, "pastures of tender grass," are mentioned, not in
respect to food, but as places of cool and refreshing rest.

the still waters--are, literally, "waters of "stillness," whose quiet
flow invites to repose. They are contrasted with boisterous streams on
the one hand, and stagnant, offensive pools on the other.

[Psalms 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 23:3</span></span>

To restore the soul is to revive or quicken it ([Psa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007)), or relieve it ([Lam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011), [Lam
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019)).

paths of righteousness--those of safety, as directed by God, and
pleasing to Him.

for his name's sake--or, regard for His perfections, pledged for His
people's welfare.

[Psalms 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 23:4</span></span>

In the darkest and most trying hour God is near.

the valley of the shadow of death--is a ravine overhung by high
precipitous cliffs, filled with dense forests, and well calculated to
inspire dread to the timid, and afford a covert to beasts of prey. While
expressive of any great danger or cause of terror, it does not exclude
the greatest of all, to which it is most popularly applied, and which
its terms suggest.

thy rod and thy staff--are symbols of a shepherd's office. By them he
guides his sheep.

[Psalms 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 23:5</span></span>

Another figure expresses God's provided care.

a table--or, "food," anointing

oil--the symbol of gladness, and the overflowing

cup--which represents abundance--are prepared for the child of God, who
may feast in spite of his enemies, confident that this favor will ever
attend him. This beautiful Psalm most admirably sets before us, in its
chief figure, that of a shepherd, the gentle, kind, and sure care
extended to God's people, who, as a shepherd, both rules and feeds them.
The closing verse shows that the blessings mentioned are spiritual.
