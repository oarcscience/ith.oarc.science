### [Isaiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 1:1</span></span>

(Isa. 1:1-31)

THE GENERAL TITLE OR PROGRAM applying to the entire book: this
discountenances the Talmud tradition, that he was sawn asunder by
Manasseh.

Isaiah--equivalent to "The Lord shall save"; significant of the subject
of his prophecies. On "vision," see [Sa1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md); [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md); and see my Introduction.

Judah and Jerusalem--Other nations also are the subjects of his
prophecies; but only in their relation to the Jews (Isa. 13:1-23:18); so
also the ten tribes of Israel are introduced only in the same relation
(Isa. 7:1-9:21). Jerusalem is particularly specified, being the site of
the temple, and the center of the theocracy, and the future throne of
Messiah ([Psa 48:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md), [Psa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017).md). Jesus Christ is the "Lion of
the tribe of Judah" ([Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005).md).

Uzziah--called also Azariah ([Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md); [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md), [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), [Ch2
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020).md). The Old Testament prophecies
spiritually interpret the histories, as the New Testament Epistles
interpret the Gospels and Acts. Study them together, to see their
spiritual relations. Isaiah prophesied for only a few years before
Uzziah's death; but his prophecies of that period (Isa. 1:1-6:13) apply
to Jotham's reign also, in which he probably wrote none; for Isa. 7:1-25
enters immediately on Ahaz' reign, after Uzziah in [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md); the prophecies under Hezekiah
follow next.

[Isaiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 1:2</span></span>

The very words of Moses ([Deu 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001).md);
this implies that the law was the charter and basis of all prophecy
([Isa 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020).md).

Lord--Jehovah; in Hebrew, "the self-existing and promise-fulfilling,
unchangeable One." The Jews never pronounced this holy name, but
substituted Adonai. The English Version, LORD in capitals, marks the
Hebrew "Jehovah," though Lord is rather equivalent to "Adonai" than
"Jehovah."

children-- ([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022).md).

rebelled--as sons ([Deu 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018).md) and as
subjects, God being king in the theocracy ([Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010).md). "Brought up," literally,
"elevated," namely, to peculiar privileges ([Jer
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md); [Rom
9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 1:3</span></span>

([Jer 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007).md).

crib--the stall where it is fed ([Pro
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004).md). Spiritually the word and
ordinances.

Israel--The whole nation, Judah as well as Israel, in the restricted
sense. God regards His covenant-people in their designed unity.

not know--namely, his Owner, as the parallelism requires; that is, not
recognize Him as such ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md),
equivalent to "my people," [Joh
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010).md).

consider--attend to his Master ([Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md), notwithstanding the spiritual
food which He provides (answering to "crib" in the parallel clause).

[Isaiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 1:4</span></span>

people--the peculiar designation of God's elect nation ([Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010).md), that they should be "laden with
iniquity" is therefore the more monstrous. Sin is a load ([Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md); [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028).md).

seed--another appellation of God's elect ([Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md), designed to be a "holy seed"
([Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013).md), but, awful to say,
"evildoers!"

children--by adoption ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md), yet
"evildoers"; not only so, but "corrupters" of others ([Gen
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012).md); the climax. So
"nation--people--seed children."

provoked--literally, "despised," namely, so as to provoke ([Pro
1:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030).md).

Holy One of Israel--the peculiar heinousness of their sin, that it was
against their God ([Amo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002).md).

gone . . . backward--literally, "estranged" ([Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 1:5</span></span>

Why--rather, as Vulgate, "On what part." Image from a body covered all
over with marks of blows ([Psa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003).md).
There is no part in which you have not been smitten.

head . . . sick, &c.--not referring, as it is commonly quoted, to their
sins, but to the universality of their punishment. However, sin, the
moral disease of the head or intellect, and the heart, is doubtless made
its own punishment ([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md). "Sick," literally, "is in a
state of sickness" \[GESENIUS\]; "has passed into sickness" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 1:6</span></span>

From the lowest to the highest of the people; "the ancient and
honorable, the head, the prophet that teacheth lies, the tail." See [Isa
9:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md). He first states their
wretched condition, obvious to all ([Isa
1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md); and then, not previously,
their irreligious state, the cause of it.

wounds--judicially inflicted ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md).

mollified with ointment--The art of medicine in the East consists
chiefly in external applications ([Luk
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md); [Jam
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 1:7</span></span>

Judah had not in Uzziah's reign recovered from the ravages of the
Syrians in Joash's reign ([Ch2 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024).md),
and of Israel in Amaziah's reign ([Ch2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013.md), [Ch2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023), &c..md). Compare Isaiah's
contemporary ([Amo 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006).md), where, as
here ([Isa 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md), Israel is compared
to "Sodom and Gomorrah," because of the judgments on it by "fire."

in your presence--before your eyes: without your being able to prevent
them.

desolate, &c.--literally, "there is desolation, such as one might look
for from foreign" invaders.

[Isaiah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 1:8</span></span>

daughter of Zion--the city ([Psa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014).md), Jerusalem and its inhabitants
([Kg2 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021).md): "daughter" (feminine,
singular being used as a neuter collective noun), equivalent to sons
([Isa 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006), Margin.md) \[MAURER\].
Metropolis or "mother-city" is the corresponding term. The idea of
youthful beauty is included in "daughter."

left--as a remnant escaping the general destruction.

cottage--a hut, made to give temporary shelter to the caretaker of the
vineyard.

lodge--not permanent.

besieged--rather, as "left," and [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md) require, preserved, namely, from
the desolation all round \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 1:9</span></span>

Jehovah of Sabaoth, that is, God of the angelic and starry hosts ([Psa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005.md); [Psa
147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md); [Psa
148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002).md). The latter were objects of
idolatry, called hence Sabaism ([Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016).md). God is above even them ([Ch1
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#026).md). "The groves" were symbols of
these starry hosts; it was their worship of Sabaoth instead of the Lord
of Sabaoth, which had caused the present desolation ([Ch2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018).md). It needed no less a power than
His, to preserve even a "remnant." Condescending grace for the elect's
sake, since He has no need of us, seeing that He has countless hosts to
serve Him.

[Isaiah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 1:10</span></span>

Sodom--spiritually ([Gen 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md); [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md); [Eze
16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046.md); [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 1:11</span></span>

God does not here absolutely disparage sacrifice, which is as old and
universal as sin ([Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021.md); [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md), and sin is almost as old as the
world; but sacrifice, unaccompanied with obedience of heart and life
([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); [Psa
50:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009.md); [Psa
51:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006).md). Positive precepts are only
means; moral obedience is the end. A foreshadowing of the gospel, when
the One real sacrifice was to supersede all the shadowy ones, and "bring
in everlasting righteousness" ([Psa
40:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md); [Heb
10:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md).

full--to satiety; weary of

burnt offerings--burnt whole, except the blood, which was sprinkled
about the altar.

fat--not to be eaten by man, but burnt on the altar ([Lev
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004.md), [Lev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011.md), [Lev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 1:12</span></span>

appear before me--in the temple where the Shekinah, resting on the ark,
was the symbol of God's presence ([Exo
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015.md); [Psa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002).md).

who hath required this--as if you were doing God a service by such
hypocritical offerings ([Job 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007).md).
God did require it ([Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017).md), but
not in this spirit ([Mic 6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006).md).

courts--areas, in which the worshippers were. None but priests entered
the temple itself.

[Isaiah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 1:13</span></span>

oblations--unbloody; "meat (old English sense, not flesh) offerings,"
that is, of flour, fruits, oil, &c. ([Lev
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001).md). Hebrew, mincha.

incense--put upon the sacrifices, and burnt on the altar of incense.
Type of prayer ([Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md).

new moons--observed as festivals ([Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md); [Num
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), [Num
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014).md) with sacrifices and blowing of
silver trumpets.

sabbaths--both the seventh day and the beginning and closing days of the
great feasts (Lev. 23:24-39).

away with--bear, MAURER translates, "I cannot bear iniquity and the
solemn meeting," that is, the meeting associated with
iniquity--literally, the closing days of the feasts; so the great days
([Lev 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md).

[Isaiah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 1:14</span></span>

appointed--the sabbath, passover, pentecost, day of atonement, and feast
of tabernacles \[HENGSTENBERG\]; they alone were fixed to certain times
of the year.

weary-- ([Isa 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 1:15</span></span>

([Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md); [Lam
3:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#043).md).

spread . . . hands--in prayer ([Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022).md). Hebrew, "bloods," for all
heinous sins, persecution of God's servants especially ([Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md). It was the vocation of the
prophets to dispel the delusion, so contrary to the law itself ([Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016).md), that outward ritualism would
satisfy God.

[Isaiah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 1:16</span></span>

God saith to the sinner, "Wash you," &c., that he, finding his inability
to "make" himself "clean," may cry to God, Wash me, cleanse me ([Psa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002.md), [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md), [Psa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010).md).

before mine eyes--not mere outward reformation before man's eyes, who
cannot, as God, see into the heart ([Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 1:17</span></span>

seek judgment--justice, as magistrates, instead of seeking bribes ([Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md), [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016).md).

judge--vindicate ([Psa 68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 1:18</span></span>

God deigns to argue the case with us, that all may see the just, nay,
loving principle of His dealings with men ([Isa
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026).md).

scarlet--the color of Jesus Christ's robe when bearing our "sins" ([Mat
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028).md). So Rahab's thread ([Jos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#018.md); compare [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004).md). The rabbins say that when the
lot used to be taken, a scarlet fillet was bound on the scapegoat's
head, and after the high priest had confessed his and the people's sins
over it, the fillet became white: the miracle ceased, according to them,
forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem, that is, exactly when
Jesus Christ was crucified; a remarkable admission of adversaries.
Hebrew for "scarlet" radically means double-dyed; so the deep-fixed
permanency of sin in the heart, which no mere tears can wash away.

snow-- ([Psa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).md). Repentance is
presupposed, before sin can be made white as snow ([Isa
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019).md); it too is God's gift ([Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md), end; [Lam
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md); [Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031).md).

red--refers to "blood" ([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015).md).

as wool--restored to its original undyed whiteness. This verse shows
that the old fathers did not look only for transitory promises (Article
VII, Book of Common Prayer). For sins of ignorance, and such like, alone
had trespass offerings appointed for them; greater guilt therefore
needed a greater sacrifice, for, "without shedding of blood there was no
remission"; but none such was appointed, and yet forgiveness was
promised and expected; therefore spiritual Jews must have looked for the
One Mediator of both Old Testament and New Testament, though dimly
understood.

[Isaiah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 1:19</span></span>

Temporal blessings in "the land of their possession" were prominent in
the Old Testament promises, as suited to the childhood of the Church
([Exo 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017).md). New Testament spiritual
promises derive their imagery from the former ([Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 1:20</span></span>

Lord hath spoken it--Isaiah's prophecies rest on the law ([Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033).md). God alters not His word
Numbers 23. 19).

[Isaiah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 1:21</span></span>

faithful--as a wife ([Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Hos
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019).md).

harlot-- ([Eze 16:28-35](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028).md).

righteousness lodged-- ([Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md).

murderers--murderous oppressors, as the antithesis requires (see on [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md); [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 1:22</span></span>

Thy princes and people are degenerate in "solid worth," equivalent to
"silver" ([Jer 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028.md), [Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030.md); [Eze
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018).md), and in their use of the
living Word, equivalent to "wine" ([Sol
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009).md).

mixed--literally, "circumcised." So the Arabic, "to murder" wine,
equivalent to dilute it.

[Isaiah 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 1:23</span></span>

companions of thieves--by connivance ([Pro
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024).md).

gifts-- ([Eze 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012).md). A nation's
corruption begins with its rulers.

[Isaiah 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 1:24</span></span>

Lord . . . Lord--Adonai, JEHOVAH.

mighty One of Israel--mighty to take vengeance, as before, to save.

Ah--indignation.

ease me--My long tried patience will find relief in at last punishing
the guilty ([Eze 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013).md). God's language
condescends to human conceptions.

[Isaiah 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 1:25</span></span>

turn . . . hand--not in wrath, but in grace ([Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md), "upon thee," as [Isa
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md) show; contrasted with the
enemies, of whom He will avenge Himself ([Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md).

purely--literally, "as alkali purifies."

thy dross--not thy sins, but the sinful persons ([Jer
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029).md); "enemies" ([Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md); degenerate princes (see on [Isa
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022).md), intermingled with the elect
"remnant" of grace.

tin--Hebrew, bedil, here the alloy of lead, tin, &c., separated by
smelting from the silver. The pious Bishop Bedell took his motto from
this.

[Isaiah 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 1:26</span></span>

As the degeneracy had shown itself most in the magistrates ([Isa
1:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017).md), so, at the "restoration,"
these shall be such as the theocracy "at the first" had contemplated,
namely, after the Babylonish restoration in part and typically, but
fully and antitypically under Messiah ([Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md); [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); [Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md); [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028).md).

faithful--no longer "an harlot."

[Isaiah 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 1:27</span></span>

redeemed--temporarily, civilly, and morally; type of the spiritual
redemption by the price of Jesus Christ's blood ([Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md), the foundation of "judgment"
and "righteousness," and so of pardon. The judgment and righteousness
are God's first ([Isa 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).md); so they become man's when
"converted" ([Rom 8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md); typified in
the display of God's "justice," then exhibited in delivering His
covenant-people, whereby justice or "righteousness" was produced in
them.

converts--so MAURER. But Margin, "they that return of her," namely the
remnant that return from captivity. However, as Isaiah had not yet
expressly foretold the Babylonian captivity, the English Version is
better.

[Isaiah 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 1:28</span></span>

destruction--literally, "breaking into shivers" ([Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).md). The prophets hasten forward to
the final extinction of the ungodly ([Psa
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md); [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md); of which antecedent judgments
are types.

[Isaiah 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 1:29</span></span>

ashamed-- ([Rom 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021).md).

oaks--Others translate the "terebinth" or "turpentine tree." Groves were
dedicated to idols. Our Druids took their name from the Greek for
"oaks." A sacred tree is often found in Assyrian sculpture; symbol of
the starry hosts, Saba.

gardens--planted enclosures for idolatry; the counterpart of the garden
of Eden.

[Isaiah 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 1:30</span></span>

oak--Ye shall be like the "oaks," the object of your "desire" ([Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029).md). People become like the gods
they worship; they never rise above their level ([Psa
135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018).md). So men's sins become their
own scourges ([Jer 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009).md). The leaf of
the idol oak fades by a law of necessary consequence, having no living
sap or "water" from God. So "garden" answers to "gardens" ([Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029).md).

[Isaiah 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 1:31</span></span>

strong--powerful rulers ([Amo 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009).md).

maker of it--rather, his work. He shall be at once the fuel, "tow," and
the cause of the fire, by kindling the first "spark."

both--the wicked ruler, and "his work," which "is as a spark."
