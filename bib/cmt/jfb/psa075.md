### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

Al-taschith--(See on [Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md),
title). In impending danger, the Psalmist, anticipating relief in view
of God's righteous government, takes courage and renders praise. ([Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001).md)

God's name or perfections are set forth by His wondrous works.

[Psalms 75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 75:2</span></span>

These verses express the purpose of God to administer a just government,
and in a time of anarchy that He sustains the nation. Some apply the
words to the Psalmist.

receive the congregation--literally, "take a set time" ([Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md); [Hos
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003).md), or an assembly at a set
time--that is, for judging.

[Psalms 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 75:3</span></span>

pillars of it-- ([Sa1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 75:4</span></span>

Here the writer speaks in view of God's declaration, warning the wicked.

Lift . . . up the horn--to exalt power, here, of the wicked
himself--that is, to be arrogant or self-elated.

[Psalms 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 75:5</span></span>

speak . . . neck--insolently.

[Psalms 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 75:6</span></span>

promotion--literally, "a lifting up." God is the only right judge of
merit.

[Psalms 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 75:8</span></span>

in the hand . . . a cup . . . red--God's wrath often thus represented
(compare [Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md) [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md).

but the dregs--literally, "surely the dregs, they shall drain it."

[Psalms 75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 75:9</span></span>

Contrasted is the lot of the pious who will praise God, and, acting
under His direction, will destroy the power of the wicked, and exalt
that of the righteous.
