### [Jeremiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 3:1</span></span>

GOD'S MERCY NOTWITHSTANDING JUDAH'S VILENESS. (Jer. 3:1-25)

They say--rather, as Hebrew, "saying," in agreement with "the LORD";
[Jer 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037) of last chapter \[MAURER\].
Or, it is equivalent to, "Suppose this case." Some copyist may have
omitted, "The word of the Lord came to me," saying.

shall he return unto her--will he take her back? It was unlawful to do
so ([Deu 24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)).

shall not--Should not the land be polluted if this were done?

yet return-- ([Jer 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022); [Jer
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001); [Zac
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003); compare [Eze
16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051), [Eze
16:58](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#058), [Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)). "Nevertheless," &c. (see on
[Isa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 3:2</span></span>

high places--the scene of idolatries which were spiritual adulteries.

In . . . ways . . . sat for them--watching for lovers like a prostitute
([Gen 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014), [Gen
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#021); [Pro
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#012); [Pro
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#028); [Eze
16:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)), and like an Arab who lies
in wait for travellers. The Arabs of the desert, east and south of
Palestine, are still notorious as robbers.

[Jeremiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 3:3</span></span>

no latter rain--essential to the crops in Palestine; withheld in
judgment ([Lev 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019); compare [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023)).

whore's forehead-- ([Jer 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012); [Eze
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 3:4</span></span>

from this time--not referring, as MICHAELIS thinks, to the reformation
begun the year before, that is, the twelfth of Josiah; it means--now at
once, now at last.

me--contrasted with the "stock" whom they had heretofore called on as
"father" ([Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027); [Luk
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018)).

thou art--rather, "thou wast."

guide of . . . youth--that is, husband ([Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002); [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017); [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007), [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015)). Husband and father are the two
most endearing of ties.

[Jeremiah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 3:5</span></span>

he--"thou," the second person, had preceded. The change to the third
person implies a putting away of God to a greater distance from them;
instead of repenting and forsaking their idols, they merely deprecate
the continuance of their punishment. [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012) and [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009), answer their question in the
event of their penitence.

spoken and--rather (God's reply to them), "Thou hast spoken (thus), and
yet (all the while) thou hast done evil," &c.

as thou couldest--with all thy might; with incorrigible persistency
\[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 3:6</span></span>

From here to [Jer 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030), is a new
discourse, delivered in Josiah's reign. It consists of two parts, the
former extending to [Jer 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003), in which
he warns Judah from the example of Israel's doom, and yet promises
Israel final restoration; the latter a threat of Babylonian invasion; as
Nabopolassar founded the Babylonian empire, 625 B.C., the seventeenth of
Josiah, this prophecy is perhaps not earlier than that date ([Jer
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005), &c.; [Jer
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014), &c.; [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001), &c.; Jer. 22:1-30); and probably
not later than the second thorough reformation in the eighteenth year of
the same reign.

backsliding--literally, "apostasy"; not merely apostate, but apostasy
itself, the essence of it ([Jer 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014),
[Jer 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022)).

[Jeremiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 3:7</span></span>

I said-- ([Kg2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013)).

sister-- ([Eze 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046); [Eze
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002), [Eze
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 3:8</span></span>

I saw that, though (whereas) it was for this very reason (namely),
because backsliding (apostate) Israel had committed adultery I had put
her away ([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006), [Kg2
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#018)), and given her a bill of
divorce, yet Judah, &c. ([Eze 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011),
&c.).

bill of divorce--literally, "a writing of cuttings off." The plural
implies the completeness of the severance. The use of this metaphor
here, as in the former discourse ([Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001)), implies a close connection
between the discourses. The epithets are characteristic; Israel
"apostate" (as the Hebrew for "backsliding" is better rendered); Judah,
not as yet utterly apostate, but treacherous or faithless.

also--herself also, like Israel.

[Jeremiah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 3:9</span></span>

it--Some take this verse of Judah, to whom the end of [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008) refers. But [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010) puts Judah in contrast to Israel
in this verse. "Yet for all this," referring to the sad example of
Israel; if [Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009) referred to Judah,
"she" would have been written in [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010), not "Judah." Translate, "It (the
putting away of Israel) had come to pass through . . . whoredom; and
(that is, for) she (Israel) had defiled the land" &c. \[MAURER\].
English Version, however, may be explained to refer to Israel.

lightness--"infamy." \[EWALD\]. MAURER not so well takes it from the
Hebrew root, "voice," "fame."

[Jeremiah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 3:10</span></span>

yet--notwithstanding the lesson given in Israel's case of the fatal
results of apostasy.

not . . . whole heart--The reformation in the eighteenth year of Josiah
was not thorough on the part of the people, for at his death they
relapsed into idolatry ([Ch2 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033);
[Hos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 3:11</span></span>

justified herself--has been made to appear almost just (that is,
comparatively innocent) by the surpassing guilt of Judah, who adds
hypocrisy and treachery to her sin; and who had the example of Israel to
warn her, but in vain (compare [Eze
16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051); [Eze
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011)).

more than--in comparison with.

[Jeremiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 3:12</span></span>

Go--not actually; but turn and proclaim towards the north (Media and
Assyria, where the ten tribes were located by Tiglath-pileser and
Shalmaneser, [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029); [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009), [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011)).

Return . . . backsliding--Hebrew, Shubah, Meshubah, a play on sounds. In
order to excite Judah to godly jealousy ([Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014)), Jehovah addresses the exiled
ten tribes of Israel with a loving invitation.

cause . . . anger to fall--literally, "I will not let fall My
countenance" (compare [Gen 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005); [Job
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003)), that is, I will not continue to
frown on you.

keep--"anger" is to be supplied (see on [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 3:13</span></span>

Only acknowledge-- ([Deu 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001), [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003); [Pro
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013)).

scattered thy ways, &c.-- ([Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025)).
Not merely the calves at Beth-el, but the idols in every direction, were
the objects of their worship ([Eze
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015), [Eze
16:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)).

[Jeremiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 3:14</span></span>

I am married--literally, "I am Lord," that is, husband to you (so [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032); compare [Hos
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019); [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005)). GESENIUS, following the
Septuagint version of [Jer 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032), and
Paul's quotation of it ([Heb 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009)),
translates, "I have rejected you"; so the corresponding Arabic, and the
idea of lordship, may pass into that of looking down upon, and so
rejecting. But the Septuagint in this passage translates, "I will be
Lord over you." And the "for" has much more force in English Version
than in that of GESENIUS. The Hebrew hardly admits the rendering though
\[HENGSTENBERG\].

take you one of a city--Though but one or two Israelites were in a
(foreign) city, they shall not be forgotten; all shall be restored ([Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009)). So, in the spiritual Israel, God
gathers one convert here, another there, into His Church; not the least
one is lost ([Mat 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#014); [Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005); compare [Jer
24:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005)).

family--a clan or tribe.

[Jeremiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 3:15</span></span>

pastors--not religious, but civil rulers, as Zerubbabel, Nehemiah ([Jer
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004); [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 3:16</span></span>

they shall say no more--The Jews shall no longer glory in the possession
of the ark; it shall not be missed, so great shall be the blessings of
the new dispensation. The throne of the Lord, present Himself, shall
eclipse and put out of mind the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat
between the cherubim, God's former throne. The ark, containing the two
tables of the law, disappeared at the Babylonian captivity, and was not
restored to the second temple, implying that the symbolical "glory" was
to be superseded by a "greater glory" ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009)).

neither . . . visit it--rather, "neither shall it be missed" (so in [Jer
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004)).

done--rather, "neither shall it (the ark) be made (that is, be restored)
any more" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 3:17</span></span>

Jerusalem--the whole city, not merely the temple. As it has been the
center of the Hebrew theocracy, so it shall be the point of attraction
to the whole earth ([Isa 2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Zac
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010); [Zac
14:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)).

throne of . . . Lord--The Shekinah, the symbol of God's peculiar
nearness to Israel ([Deu 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007)) shall be
surpassed by the antitype, God's own throne in Jerusalem ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008); [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005)).

imagination--rather, as Margin, "the obstinacy" or stubbornness.

[Jeremiah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 3:18</span></span>

Judah . . . Israel . . . together--Two distinct apostasies, that of
Israel and that of Judah, were foretold ([Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008), [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010)). The two have never been united
since the Babylonish captivity; therefore their joint restoration must
be still future ([Isa 11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012); [Eze
37:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016); [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011)).

north-- ([Jer 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012)).

land . . . given . . . inheritance-- ([Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 3:19</span></span>

The good land covenanted to Abraham is to be restored to his seed. But
the question arises, How shall this be done?

put . . . among . . . children--the Greek for adoption means, literally,
"putting among the sons."

the children--that is, My children. "How shall I receive thee back into
My family, after thou hast so long forsaken Me for idols?" The answer
is, they would acknowledge Him as "Father," and no longer turn away from
Him. God assumes the language of one wondering how so desperate
apostates could be restored to His family and its privileges (compare
[Eze 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003); CALVIN makes it, How the
race of Abraham can be propagated again, being as it were dead); yet as
His purpose has decreed it so, He shows how it shall be effected,
namely, they shall receive from Him the spirit of adoption to cry, "My
Father" ([Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)). The elect are "children" already
in God's purpose; this is the ground of the subsequent realization of
this relationship ([Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005); [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)).

pleasant land-- ([Jer 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006); [Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016), Margin).

heritage of . . . hosts--a heritage the most goodly of all nations
\[MAURER\]; or a "heritage possessed by powerful hosts" ([Deu
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038); [Amo
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009)). The rendering "splendors,"
instead of "hosts," is opposed by the fact that the Hebrew for
"splendor" is not found in the plural.

[Jeremiah 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 3:20</span></span>

Surely--rather, "But."

husband--literally, "friend."

[Jeremiah 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 3:21</span></span>

In harmony with the preceding promises of God, the penitential
confessions of Israel are heard.

high places--The scene of their idolatries is the scene of their
confessions. Compare [Jer 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023), in
which they cast aside their trust in these idolatrous high places. The
publicity of their penitence is also implied (compare [Jer
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029); [Jer
48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038)).

[Jeremiah 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 3:22</span></span>

Jehovah's renewed invitation ([Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012), [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014)) and their immediate response.

heal--forgive ([Ch2 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018), [Ch2
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#020); [Hos
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004)).

unto thee--rather, "in obedience to thee"; literally, "for thee"
\[ROSENMULLER\].

[Jeremiah 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 3:23</span></span>

multitude of mountains--that is, the multitude of gods worshipped on
them (compare [Psa 121:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001), Margin).

[Jeremiah 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 3:24</span></span>

shame--that is, the idols, whose worship only covers us with shame ([Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010)). So far from bringing us
"salvation," they have cost us our cattle and even our children, whom we
have sacrificed to them.

[Jeremiah 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 3:25</span></span>

([Ezr 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007)).
