[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 16:1</span></span>

AHAZ' WICKED REIGN OVER JUDAH. (2Ki. 16:1-16)

Ahaz . . . did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord--\[See
on [Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).\] The character of this
king's reign, the voluptuousness and religious degeneracy of all classes
of the people, are graphically portrayed in the writings of Isaiah, who
prophesied at that period. The great increase of worldly wealth and
luxury in the reigns of Azariah and Jotham had introduced a host of
corruptions, which, during his reign, and by the influence of Ahaz, bore
fruit in the idolatrous practices of every kind which prevailed in all
parts of the kingdom (see [Ch2 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 16:3</span></span>

walked in the way of the kings of Israel--This is descriptive of the
early part of his reign, when, like the kings of Israel, he patronized
the symbolic worship of God by images but he gradually went farther into
gross idolatry ([Ch2 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002)).

made his son to pass through the fire-- ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)). The hands of the idol Moloch
being red hot, the children were passed through between them, which was
considered a form of lustration. There is reason to believe that, in
certain circumstances, the children were burnt to death ([Psa
106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037)). This was strongly prohibited
in the law ([Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021); [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002); [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)), although there is no evidence
that it was practised in Israel till the time of Ahaz.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 16:5</span></span>

Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came
up to Jerusalem--Notwithstanding their great efforts and military
preparations, they failed to take it and, being disappointed, raised the
siege and returned home (compare [Isa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 16:6</span></span>

Rezin . . . recovered Elath--which Azariah had got into his possession
([Kg2 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022)).

the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day--The Septuagint
version has "the Edomites," which the most judicious commentators and
travellers \[ROBINSON\] prefer.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 16:7</span></span>

So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser--In spite of the assurance
given him by Isaiah by two signs, the one immediate, the other remote
([Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014); [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004)), that the confederate kings would
not prevail against him, Ahaz sought aid from the Assyrian monarch, to
purchase which he sent the treasures of the palace and temple.
Tiglath-pileser marched against Damascus, slew Rezin the king, and
carried the people of Damascus into captivity to Kir, which is thought
to have been the city Karine (now Kerend), in Media.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 16:10</span></span>

And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser--This was a visit
of respect, and perhaps of gratitude. During his stay in that heathen
city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly captivated. Forthwith
a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with orders to Urijah the
priest to get one constructed according to the Damascus model, and let
this new altar supersede the old one in the temple. Urijah, with
culpable complaisance, acted according to his instructions ([Kg2
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#016)). The sin in this affair
consisted in meddling with, and improving according to human taste and
fancy, the altars of the temple, the patterns of which had been
furnished by divine authority ([Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040); [Exo
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030); [Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001); [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019)). Urijah was one of the
witnesses taken by Isaiah to bear his prediction against Syria and
Israel ([Isa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 16:17</span></span>

HE SPOILS THE TEMPLE. ([Kg2 16:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017))

cut off the borders of the bases, &c.--It is thought that he did this to
use the elaborate sculpture in adorning his palace.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 16:18</span></span>

the covert for the Sabbath--the portico through which the priests
entered the temple on the Sabbath.

the king's entry without--a private external entrance for the king into
the temple. The change made by Ahaz consisted in removing both of these
into the temple from fear of the king of Assyria, that, in case of a
siege, he might secure the entrance of the temple from him.
