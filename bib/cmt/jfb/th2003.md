### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 3:1</span></span>

HE ASKS THEIR PRAYERS: HIS CONFIDENCE IN THEM: PRAYER FOR THEM: CHARGES
AGAINST DISORDERLY IDLE CONDUCT; HIS OWN EXAMPLE: CONCLUDING PRAYER AND
SALUTATION. (2Th. 3:1-18)

Finally--literally, "As to what remains."

may have free course--literally, "may run"; spread rapidly without a
drag on the wheels of its course. That the new-creating word may "run,"
as "swiftly" as the creative word at the first ([Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015).md). The opposite is the word of
God being "bound" ([Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009).md).

glorified--by sinners accepting it ([Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md); [Gal
1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023).md). Contrast "evil spoken of"
([Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014).md).

as it is with you-- ([Th1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md); [Th1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md); [Th1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 3:2</span></span>

that we . . . be delivered from unreasonable . . . men--literally, men
out of place, inept, unseemly: out of the way bad: more than ordinarily
bad. An undesigned coincidence with [Act
18:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md). Paul was now at Corinth, where
the JEWS "opposed themselves" to his preaching: in answer to his prayers
and those of his converts at Thessalonica and elsewhere, "the Lord, in
vision," assured him of exemption from "the hurt," and of success in
bringing in "much people." On the unreasonable, out-of-the way
perversity of the Jews, as known to the Thessalonians, see [Th1
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md).

have not faith--or as Greek, "the faith" of the Christian: the only
antidote to what is "unreasonable and wicked." The Thessalonians, from
their ready acceptance of the Gospel ([Th1
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005).md), might think "all" would
similarly receive it; but the Jews were far from having such a readiness
to believe the truth.

[2 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 3:3</span></span>

faithful--alluding to "faith" ([Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002).md) : though many will not believe,
the Lord (other very old manuscripts read "God") is still to be believed
in as faithful to His promises ([Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Ti2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013).md). Faith on the part of man
answers to faithfulness on the part of God.

stablish you--as he had prayed ([Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017).md). Though it was on himself that
wicked men were making their onset, he turns away from asking the
Thessalonians' prayers for HIS deliverance ([Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md) : so unselfish was he, even in
religion), to express his assurance of THEIR establishment in the faith,
and preservation from evil. This assurance thus exactly answers to his
prayer for them ([Th2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017).md), "Our Lord
. . . stablish you in every good word and work." He has before his mind
the Lord's Prayer, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil"; where, as here, the translation may be, "from the evil one"; the
great hinderer of "every good word and work." Compare [Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md), "the wicked one."

[2 Thessalonians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 3:4</span></span>

we have confidence in the Lord--as "faithful" ([Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003).md). Have confidence in no man when
left to himself \[BENGEL\].

that ye both do--Some of the oldest manuscripts insert a clause, "that
ye both have done" before, "and are doing, and will do." He means the
majority by "ye," not all of them (compare [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md); [Th2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md); [Th1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 3:5</span></span>

If "the Lord" be here the Holy Ghost ([Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md), the three Persons of the
Trinity will occur in this verse.

love of God--love to God.

patient waiting for Christ--rather as Greek, "the patience (endurance)
of Christ," namely, which Christ showed \[ALFORD\] ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md); [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003).md). ESTIUS, however, supports
English Version (compare [Rev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md);
[Rev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010).md). At all events, this grace,
"patience," or persevering endurance, is connected with the "hope" ([Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md), [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010).md) of Christ's coming. In ALFORD'S
translation we may compare [Heb
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001), "Run with patience (endurance.md)
. . . looking to JESUS . . . who, for the joy that was before Him,
endured the cross"; so WE are to endure, as looking for the hope to be
realized at His coming ([Heb
10:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 3:6</span></span>

we command you--Hereby he puts to a particular test their obedience in
general to his commands, which obedience he had recognized in [Th2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004.md).

withdraw--literally, "to furl the sails"; as we say, to steer clear of
(compare [Th2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014).md). Some had given up
labor as though the Lord's day was immediately coming. He had enjoined
mild censure of such in [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md),
"Warn . . . the unruly"; but now that the mischief had become more
confirmed, he enjoins stricter discipline, namely, withdrawal from their
company (compare [Co1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md); [Jo2
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010).md): not a formal sentence of
excommunication, such as was subsequently passed on more heinous
offenders (as in [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md); [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md). He says "brother," that is,
professing Christian; for in the case of unprofessing heathen, believers
needed not be so strict ([Co1
5:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010).md).

disorderly--Paul plainly would not have sanctioned the order of
Mendicant Friars, who reduce such a "disorderly" and lazy life to a
system. Call it not an order, but a burden to the community (BENGEL,
alluding to the Greek, [Th2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md), for
"be chargeable," literally, "be a burden").

the tradition--the oral instruction which he had given to them when
present ([Th2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010).md), and subsequently
committed to writing ([Th1 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011).md).

which he received of us--Some oldest manuscripts read, "ye received";
others, "they received." The English Version reading has no very old
authority.

[2 Thessalonians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 3:7</span></span>

how ye ought to follow us--how ye ought to live so as to "imitate (so
the Greek for 'follow') us" (compare Notes, see on [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md); [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 3:8</span></span>

eat any man's bread--Greek, "eat bread from any man," that is, live at
anyone's expense. Contrast [Th2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012.md),
"eat THEIR OWN bread."

wrought-- ([Act 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034).md). In both
Epistles they state they maintained themselves by labor; but in this
second Epistle they do so in order to offer themselves herein as an
example to the idle; whereas, in the first, their object in doing so is
to vindicate themselves from all imputation of mercenary motives in
preaching the Gospel ([Th1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005.md), [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009).md) \[EDMUNDS\]. They preached
gratuitously though they might have claimed maintenance from their
converts.

labour and travail--"toil and hardship" (see on [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009).md).

night and day--scarcely allowing time for repose.

chargeable--Greek, "a burden," or "burdensome." The Philippians did not
regard it as a burden to contribute to his support ([Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015).md), sending to him while he was
in this very Thessalonica ([Act 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015.md),
[Act 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034.md), [Act
16:40](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040).md). Many Thessalonians, doubtless,
would have felt it a privilege to contribute, but as he saw some idlers
among them who would have made a pretext of his example to justify
themselves, he waived his right. His reason for the same course at
Corinth was to mark how different were his aims from those of the false
teachers who sought their own lucre ([Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md), [Co2
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012).md). It is at the very time and
place of writing these Epistles that Paul is expressly said to have
wrought at tent-making with Aquila ([Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003).md); an undesigned coincidence.

[2 Thessalonians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 3:9</span></span>

([Co1 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004.md), &c.; [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)..md)

[2 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 3:10</span></span>

For even--Translate, "For also." We not only set you the example, but
gave a positive "command."

commanded--Greek imperfect, "We were commanding"; we kept charge of you.

would not work--Greek, "is unwilling to work." BENGEL makes this to be
the argument: not that such a one is to have his food withdrawn from him
by others; but he proves from the necessity of eating the necessity of
working; using this pleasantry, Let him who will not work show himself
an angel, that is, do without food as the angels do (but since he cannot
do without food, then he ought to be not unwilling to work). It seems to
me simpler to take it as a punishment of the idle. Paul often quotes
good adages current among the people, stamping them with inspired
approval. In the Hebrew, "Bereshith Rabba," the same saying is found;
and in the book Zeror, "He who will not work before the sabbath, must
not eat on the sabbath."

[2 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 3:11</span></span>

busy bodies--In the Greek the similarity of sound marks the antithesis,
"Doing none of their own business, yet overdoing in the business of
others." Busy about everyone's business but their own. "Nature abhors a
vacuum"; so if not doing one's own business, one is apt to meddle with
his neighbor's business. Idleness is the parent of busybodies ([Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013).md). Contrast [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 3:12</span></span>

by--The oldest manuscripts read, "IN the Lord Jesus." So the Greek, [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md), implying the sphere wherein such
conduct is appropriate and consistent. "We exhort you thus, as ministers
IN Christ, exhorting our people IN Christ."

with quietness--quiet industry; laying aside restless, bustling,
intermeddling officiousness ([Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011).md).

their own--bread earned by themselves, not another's bread ([Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 3:13</span></span>

be not weary--The oldest manuscripts read, "Be not cowardly in"; do not
be wanting in strenuousness in doing well. EDMUNDS explains it: Do not
culpably neglect to do well, namely, with patient industry do your duty
in your several callings. In contrast to the "disorderly, not-working
busybodies" ([Th2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md); compare [Gal
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 3:14</span></span>

note that man--mark him in your own mind as one to be avoided ([Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006).md).

that he may be ashamed--Greek, "made to turn and look into himself, and
so be put to shame." Feeling himself shunned by godly brethren, he may
become ashamed of his course.

[2 Thessalonians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 3:15</span></span>

admonish him as a brother--not yet excommunicated (compare [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017).md). Do not shun him in
contemptuous silence, but tell him why he is so avoided ([Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md); [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014).md).

[2 Thessalonians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 3:16</span></span>

Lord of peace--Jesus Christ. The same title is given to Him as to the
Father, "the GOD of peace" ([Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md); [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011).md). An appropriate title in the
prayer here, where the harmony of the Christian community was liable to
interruption from the "disorderly." The Greek article requires the
translation, "Give you the peace" which it is "His to give." "Peace"
outward and inward, here and hereafter ([Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017).md).

always--unbroken, not changing with outward circumstances.

by all means--Greek, "in every way." Most of the oldest manuscripts
read, "in every place"; thus he prays for their peace in all times
("always") and places.

Lord be with you all--May He bless you not only with peace, but also
with His presence ([Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).md). Even
the disorderly brethren (compare [Th2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015), "a brother".md) are included in
this prayer.

[2 Thessalonians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th2 3:17</span></span>

The Epistle was written by an amanuensis (perhaps Silas or Timothy), and
only the closing salutation written by Paul's "own hand" (compare [Rom
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md); [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021.md); [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018).md). Wherever Paul does not subjoin
this autograph salutation, we may presume he wrote the whole Epistle
himself ([Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011).md).

which--which autograph salutation.

the token--to distinguish genuine Epistles from spurious ones put forth
in my name ([Th2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002).md).

in every epistle--Some think he signed his name to every Epistle with
his own hand; but as there is no trace of this in any manuscripts of all
the Epistles, it is more likely that he alludes to his writing with his
own hand in closing every Epistle, even in those Epistles (Romans,
Second Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, First Thessalonians) wherein
he does not specify his having done so.

so I write--so I sign my name: this is a specimen of my handwriting, by
which to distinguish my geniune letters from forgeries.

[2 Thessalonians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th2 3:18</span></span>

He closes every Epistle by praying for GRACE to those whom he addresses.

Amen--omitted in the oldest manuscripts It was doubtless the response of
the congregation after hearing the Epistle read publicly; hence it crept
into copies.

The Subscription is spurious, as the Epistle was written not "from
Athens," but from Corinth.
