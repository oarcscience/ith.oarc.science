MANASSEH'S WICKED REIGN, AND GREAT IDOLATRY. (2Ki. 21:1-18)

Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign--He must have been
born three years after his father's recovery; and his minority, spent
under the influence of guardians who were hostile to the religious
principles and reforming policy of his father, may account in part for
the anti-theocratic principles of his reign. The work of religious
reformation which Hezekiah had zealously carried on was but partially
accomplished. There was little appearance of its influence on the heart
and manners of the people at large. On the contrary, the true fear of
God had vanished from the mass of the people; corruption and vice
increased, and were openly practised ([Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007), &c..md) by the degenerate leaders,
who, having got the young prince Manasseh into their power, directed his
education, trained him up in their views, and seduced him into the open
patronage of idolatry. Hence, when he became sovereign, he introduced
the worship of idols, the restoration of high places, and the erection
of altars or pillars to Baal, and the placing, in the temple of God
itself, a graven image of Asherah, the sacred or symbolic tree, which
represented "all the host of heaven." This was not idolatry, but pure
star-worship, of Chaldaic and Assyrian origin \[KEIL\]. The sun, as
among the Persians, had chariots and horses consecrated to it ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md); and incense was offered to the
stars on the housetops ([Kg2 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md);
[Ch2 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#005.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md), and in the temple area with the
face turned toward the sunrise ([Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 21:5</span></span>

the two courts of the house of the Lord--the court of the priests, and
the large court of the people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 21:6</span></span>

made his son pass through the fire--(See on [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003).md).

observed times--from an observation of the clouds.

used enchantments--jugglery and spells.

dealt with familiar spirits--Septuagint, "ventriloquists," who pretended
to ask counsel of a familiar spirit and gave the response received from
him to others.

and wizards--wise or knowing ones, who pretended to reveal secrets, to
recover things lost and hidden treasure, and to interpret dreams. A
great influx of these impostors had, at various times, poured from
Chaldea into the land of Israel to pursue their gainful occupations,
especially during the reigns of the latter kings; and Manasseh was not
only their liberal patron, but zealous to appear himself an adept in the
arts. He raised them to be an influential class at his court, as they
were in that of Assyria and Babylon, where nothing was done till they
had ascertained the lucky hour and were promised a happy issue.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 21:7</span></span>

And he set a graven image--The placing of the Asherah within the
precincts of the temple, which was dedicated to the worship of the true
God, is dwelt upon as the most aggravated outrage of the royal idolater.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 21:8</span></span>

Neither will I make the feet of Israel move . . . out of the land which
I gave their fathers--alluding to the promise ([Sa2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010).md).

only if they will observe, &c.--This condition was expressed from the
first plantation of Israel in Canaan. But that people not only did not
keep it, but through the pernicious influence of Manasseh, were seduced
into greater excesses of idolatrous corruption than even the original
Canaanites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 21:10</span></span>

And the Lord spake by his servants the prophets--These were Hosea, Joel,
Nahum, Habakkuk, and Isaiah. Their counsels, admonitions, and prophetic
warnings, were put on record in the national chronicles ([Ch2
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018).md) and now form part of the sacred
canon.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 21:12</span></span>

whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle--a strong
metaphorical form of announcing an extraordinary and appalling event
(see [Sa1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md); [Jer
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md); also [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 21:13</span></span>

the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab--Captives
doomed to destruction were sometimes grouped together and marked off by
means of a measuring-line and plummet ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Amo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007).md); so that the line of Samaria
means the line drawn for the destruction of Samaria; the plummet of the
house of Ahab, for exterminating his apostate family; and the import of
the threatening declaration here is that Judah would be utterly
destroyed, as Samaria and the dynasty of Ahab had been.

I will wipe Jerusalem, &c.--The same doom is denounced more strongly in
a figure unmistakably significant.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 21:14</span></span>

I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance--The people of Judah, who
of all the chosen people alone remained. The consequence of the Lord's
forsaking them would be their fall into the power of their enemies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 21:16</span></span>

Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood--Not content with the patronage
and the practice of idolatrous abomination, he was a cruel persecutor of
all who did not conform. The land was deluged with the blood of good
men; among whom it is traditionally said Isaiah suffered a horrid death,
by being sawn asunder (see on [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 21:19</span></span>

AMON'S WICKED REIGN. ([Kg2 21:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019).md)

Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign--This prince
continued the idolatrous policy of his father; and, after an inglorious
reign of two years, he was massacred by some of his own domestics. The
people slew the regicide conspirators and placed his son Josiah on the
throne.
