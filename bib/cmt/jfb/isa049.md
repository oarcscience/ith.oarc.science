### [Isaiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 49:1</span></span>

SIMILAR TO CHAPTER 42 ([Isa 49:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md).
(Isa. 49:1-26)

O isles--Messiah is here regarded as having been rejected by the Jews
([Isa 49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004).md), and as now turning to
the Gentiles, to whom the Father hath given Him "for a light and
salvation." "Isles" mean all regions beyond sea.

from the womb-- ([Isa 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002.md); [Luk
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036).md).

from . . . bowels . . . mention of my name--His name "Jesus" (that is,
God-Saviour) was designated by God before His birth ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 49:2</span></span>

my mouth . . . sword-- ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md);
[Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md). The double office of the
Word of God, saving and damnatory, is implied ([Isa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); [Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md).

shaft-- ([Psa 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005).md). "Polished," that
is, free from all rust, implies His unsullied purity.

in . . . quiver . . . hid me--Like a sword in its scabbard, or a shaft
in the quiver, Messiah, before His appearing, was hid with God, ready to
be drawn forth at the moment God saw fit \[HENGSTENBERG\]; also always
protected by God, as the arrow by the quiver ([Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 49:3</span></span>

Israel--applied to Messiah, according to the true import of the name,
the Prince who had power with God in wrestling in behalf of man, and who
prevails ([Gen 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md); [Hos
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md). He is also the ideal Israel,
the representative man of the nation (compare [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md) with [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md).

in whom . . . glorified-- ([Joh 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013.md);
[Joh 17:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 49:4</span></span>

I--Messiah.

in vain--comparatively in the case of the greater number of His own
countrymen. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not" ([Isa
53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); [Luk
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#014.md); [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md); [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005).md). Only a hundred twenty disciples
met after His personal ministry was ended ([Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015).md).

yet . . . my judgment . . . with the Lord--Ultimately, God will do
justice to My cause, and reward (Margin for "work," compare [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md); [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011).md) My labors and sufferings. He
was never "discouraged" ([Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md);
[Isa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md), [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010).md). He calmly, in spite of seeming
ill success for the time, left the result with God, confident of final
triumph ([Isa 53:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); [Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023).md). So the ministers of Christ
([Co1 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md); [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 49:5</span></span>

The reason why He was confident that His work would be accepted and
rewarded, namely, because He is "glorious in the eyes of Jehovah," &c.

to bring Jacob again to him-- ([Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md); [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026).md).

Though Israel be not gathered--metaphor from a scattered flock which the
shepherd gathers together again; or a hen and her chickens ([Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md). Instead of the text "not," the
Keri has the similar Hebrew word, "to Him," which the parallelism
favors: "And that Israel may be gathered to Him."

yet--rather, parenthetically. "For I am glorious, &c., and My God is My
strength." Then ([Isa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006).md) resuming
the words from the beginning of [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005), "He saith" (I repeat.md), &c.
HORSLEY explains, "Notwithstanding the incredulity of the Jews, Messiah
shall be glorified in the conversion of the Gentiles," reading as
English Version: but if the Keri be read, "Israel shall at one time or
other be gathered, notwithstanding their incredulity during Messiah's
sojourn on earth."

[Isaiah 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 49:6</span></span>

It is a light thing--"It is too little that Thou shouldest,"
\[HENGSTENBERG\], that is, It is not enough honor to Thee to raise up
Jacob and Israel, but I design for Thee more, namely, that Thou
shouldest be the means of enlightening the Gentiles ([Isa
42:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003).md).

the preserved--namely, those remaining after the judgments of God on the
nation--the elect remnant of Israel reserved for mercy. LOWTH, with a
slight but needless change of the Hebrew, translates for "tribes" and
"preserved," the "scions"--the "branches."

[Isaiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 49:7</span></span>

whom man despiseth--Hebrew, "the despised of soul," that is, by every
soul, by all men ([Isa 52:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md); [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md); [Isa
50:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Psa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006).md). LOWTH translates, "whose person
is despised."

abhorreth--literally, "who is an abomination to the nation" ([Luk
23:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#018).md). The Jews contemptuously
call Him always Tolvi, "the crucified." I prefer, on account of Goi, the
Hebrew term for nation being usually applied to the Gentiles, and that
for people to the Jews ([Hos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md); so
the Greek terms respectively also Laos and Ethne, [Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025).md), to take "nation" here
collectively for the Gentile world, which also spurned Him ([Psa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); [Act
4:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025).md).

servant of rulers-- ([Mat 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027).md). He
who would not exert His power against the rulers ([Mat
26:52-53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052).md).

shall see--namely the fulfilment of God's promises ([Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md), [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006)), "when He (shall be.md) a light to
the Gentiles."

arise--to reverence Thee ([Psa
72:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md).

princes also--rather, for the parallelism, supply the ellipsis, thus,
"Princes shall see and shall worship."

faithful--namely, to His promises.

choose thee--as God's elect ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 49:8</span></span>

Messiah is represented as having asked for the grace of God in behalf of
sinners; this verse contains God the Father's favorable answer.

an acceptable time--"In a time of grace" \[HENGSTENBERG\]. A limited
time ([Isa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002).md). The time judged by God to be the
best fitted for effecting the purposes of His grace by Messiah.

heard thee-- ([Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md).

day of salvation--when "the fulness of time" ([Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md) shall have come. The day of
salvation is "to-day" ([Heb 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007).md).

helped--given Thee the help needed to enable Thee, as man, to accomplish
man's salvation.

preserve--from the assaults and efforts of Satan, to divert Thee from
Thy voluntary death to save man.

covenant of the people--(See on [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md). "The people," in the singular,
is always applied exclusively to Israel.

establish the earth--rather, "to restore the land," namely, Canaan to
Israel. Spiritually, the restoration of the Church (the spiritual
Israel) to the heavenly land forfeited by man's sin is also included.

cause to inherit . . . desolate heritages--image from the desolate state
of Judea during the Babylonish captivity. Spiritually, the Gentile
world, a moral waste, shall become a garden of the Lord. Literally,
Judea lying desolate for ages shall be possessed again by Israel
(compare [Isa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007), "in their land".md).
Jesus, the antitype of, and bearing the same name as Joshua ([Heb
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008).md), shall, like him, divide the land
among its true heirs ([Isa 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md); [Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 49:9</span></span>

([Isa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md); [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012).md).

prisoners--the Jews bound in legal bondage.

them . . . in darkness--the Gentiles having no light as to the one true
God \[VITRINGA\].

Show yourselves--not only see but be seen ([Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016.md); [Mar
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019).md). Come forth from the darkness of
your prison into the light of the Sun of righteousness.

in the ways, &c.--In a desert there are no "ways," nor "high places,"
with "pastures"; thus the sense is: "They shall have their pastures, not
in deserts, but in cultivated and inhabited places." Laying aside the
figure, the churches of Christ at the first shall be gathered, not in
obscure and unknown regions, but in the most populous parts of the Roman
empire, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, &c. \[VITRINGA\]. Another sense
probably is the right one. Israel, on its way back to the Holy Land,
shall not have to turn aside to devious paths in search of necessaries,
but shall find them in all places wherever their route lies; so
ROSENMULLER. God will supply them as if He should make the grass grow in
the trodden ways and on the barren high places.

[Isaiah 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 49:10</span></span>

Messiah will abundantly satisfy all the wants, both of literal Israel on
their way to Palestine, and of the spiritual on their way to heaven, as
their Shepherd ([Isa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013.md); [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).md), also in heaven ([Rev
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 49:11</span></span>

my--All things are God's.

mountains a way--I will remove all obstructions out of the way ([Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004).md).

exalted--that is, cast up ([Isa 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014.md);
[Isa 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md); for instance, over
valleys. VITRINGA explains "mountains" as great kingdoms, Egypt, Syria,
&c., subjected to Rome, to facilitate the spreading of the Gospel;
"highways," the Christian doctrine wherein those who join the Church
walk, and which, at the time of Constantine, was to be raised into
prominence before all, and publicly protected ([Isa
35:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 49:12</span></span>

Sinim--The Arabians and other Asiatics called China Sin, or Tchin; the
Chinese had no special name for themselves, but either adopted that of
the reigning dynasty or some high-sounding titles. This view of "Sinim"
suits the context which requires a people to be meant "from far," and
distinct from those "from the north and from the west" \[GESENIUS\].

[Isaiah 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 49:13</span></span>

So [Rev 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md). God will have mercy on
the afflicted, because of His compassion; on His afflicted, because of
His covenant.

[Isaiah 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 49:14</span></span>

Zion--the literal Israel's complaint, as if God had forsaken her in the
Babylonian captivity; also in their dispersion previous to their future
restoration; thereby God's mercy shall be called forth ([Isa
63:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md); [Psa
77:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#009.md); [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 49:15</span></span>

([Isa 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021.md); [Psa
103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md); [Mat
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 49:16</span></span>

Alluding to the Jews' custom (perhaps drawn from [Exo
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009).md) of puncturing on their hands a
representation of their city and temple, in token of zeal for them
\[LOWTH\], ([Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 49:17</span></span>

Thy children--Israel ([Isa 49:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md);
[Isa 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006).md). JEROME reads, for "Thy
children," "Thy builders"; they that destroyed thee shall hasten to
build thee.

haste--to rebuild thy desolate capital.

shall go forth--Thy destroyers shall leave Judea to Israel in
undisturbed possession.

[Isaiah 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 49:18</span></span>

As Zion is often compared to a bride ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005).md), so the accession of converts is
like bridal ornaments ("jewels," [Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017).md). Her literal children are,
however, more immediately meant, as the context refers to their
restoration; and only secondarily to her spiritual children by
conversion to Christ. Israel shall be the means of the final complete
conversion of the nations ([Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md);
[Rom 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

as a bride--namely, binds on her ornaments.

[Isaiah 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 49:19</span></span>

land of thy destruction--thy land once the scene of destruction.

too narrow-- ([Isa 54:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md); [Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 49:20</span></span>

children . . . after . . . other--rather, "the children of thy
widowhood," that is, the children of whom thou hast been bereft during
their dispersion in other lands (see on [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008).md) \[MAURER\].

again--rather, "yet."

give place--rather, "stand close to me," namely, in order that we may be
the more able to dwell in in the narrow place \[HORSLEY\]. Compare as to
Israel's spiritual children, and the extension of the gospel sphere,
[Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md), [Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024.md); [Co2
10:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014.md). But [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md) (compare [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020).md) shows that her literal children
are primarily meant. GESENIUS translates, "Make room."

[Isaiah 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 49:21</span></span>

Who, &c.--Zion's joyful wonder at the unexpected restoration of the ten
tribes. Secondarily, the accession of spiritual Israelites to the mother
church of Jerusalem from the Gentiles is meant. This created surprise at
first ([Act 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045.md); [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md); [Act
15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003).md).

lost . . . am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro--rather,
"bereaved of . . . have been barren, an exile and outcast" \[HORSLEY\].
She had been "put away" by Jehovah, her husband ([Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md); hence her wonder at the
children begotten to her.

[Isaiah 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 49:22</span></span>

lift . . . hand--that is, beckon to (see on [Isa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002).md).

standard-- ([Isa 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md).

bring . . . sons in . . . arms--The Gentiles shall aid in restoring
Israel to its own land ([Isa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004.md);
[Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020).md). Children able to support
themselves are carried on the shoulders in the East; but infants, in the
arms, or astride on one haunch ([Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012).md). "Thy sons" must be distinct
from "the Gentiles," who carry them; and therefore cannot primarily
refer to converts among the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 49:23</span></span>

lick . . . dust--that is, kiss thy feet in token of humble submission.

for they . . . not . . . ashamed . . . wait for me--The restoration of
Israel shall be in answer to their prayerful waiting on the Lord ([Isa
30:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md); [Psa
102:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 49:24</span></span>

the prey--Israel, long a prey to mighty Gentile nations, whose
oppression of her shall reach its highest point under Antichrist ([Dan
11:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md), [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041.md), [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045).md).

lawful captive--the Jews justly consigned for their sins ([Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md) as captives to the foe.
Secondarily, Satan and Death are "the mighty" conquerors of man, upon
whom his sin give them their "lawful" claim. Christ answers that claim
for the sinners, and so the captive is set free ([Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md); [Job
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md); [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md), where [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md) shows the primary reference is to
Israel's restoration, to which the resurrection corresponds; [Isa

4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Heb

translate, "the captives taken from among the just Israelites."

[Isaiah 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 49:25</span></span>

([Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md); [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md).

contend with him, &c.-- ([Isa 54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 49:26</span></span>

feed . . . own flesh--a phrase for internal strifes ([Isa
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#020).md).

own blood--a just retribution for their having shed the blood of God's
servants ([Rev 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006).md).

sweet wine--that is must, or new wine, the pure juice which flows from
the heap of grapes before they are pressed; the ancients could preserve
it for a long time, so as to retain its flavor. It was so mild that it
required a large quantity to intoxicate; thus the idea here is that very
much blood would be shed ([Rev 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md),
[Rev 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020).md).

all flesh shall, &c.--the effect on the world of God's judgments ([Isa
66:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md), [Isa
66:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md); [Rev
15:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).md).
