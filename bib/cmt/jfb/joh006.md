### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 6:3</span></span>

FIVE THOUSAND MIRACULOUSLY FED. ([Joh
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001).md)

a mountain--somewhere in that hilly range which skirts the east side of
the lake.

[John 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 6:4</span></span>

passover . . . was nigh--but for the reason mentioned ([Joh
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001).md), Jesus kept away from it,
remaining in Galilee.

[John 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 6:14</span></span>

JESUS WALKS ON THE SEA. ([Joh 6:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014).md)

that prophet--(See on [Joh 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021).md).

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

departed . . . to a mountain himself alone--(1) to rest, which He came
to this "desert place" on purpose to do before the miracle of the
loaves, but could not for the multitude that followed Him (see [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031)); and (2.md) "to pray" ([Mat
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#023.md); [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046).md). But from His mountain-top He
kept watching the ship (see on [Joh
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018).md), and doubtless prayed both for
them, and with a view to the new manifestation which He was to give them
of His glory.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

when even was come--(See on [Mar
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#035).md).

entered into a ship--"constrained" to do so by their Master ([Mat
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md); [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045).md), in order to put an end to the
misdirected excitement in His favor ([Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015).md), into which the disciples
themselves may have been somewhat drawn. The word "constrained" implies
reluctance on their part, perhaps from unwillingness to part with their
Master and embark at night, leaving Him alone on the mountain.

went--rather, "were proceeding."

toward Capernaum--Mark says ([Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045).md), "unto Bethsaida," meaning
"Bethsaida of Galilee" ([Joh 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021).md),
on the west side of the lake. The place they left was of the same name
(see on [Mar 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032).md).

Jesus was not come to them--They probably lingered in hopes of His still
joining them, and so let the darkness come on.

[John 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 6:18</span></span>

sea arose, &c.--and they were "now in the midst of it" ([Mat
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#024).md). Mark adds the graphic and
touching particular, "He saw them toiling in rowing" ([Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048).md), putting forth all their
strength to buffet the waves and bear on against a head wind, but to
little effect. He saw this from His mountain-top, and through the
darkness of the night, for His heart was all with them; yet would He not
go to their relief till His own time came.

[John 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 6:19</span></span>

they see Jesus--"about the fourth watch of the night" ([Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md); [Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048).md), or between three and six in the
morning.

walking on the sea--What Job ([Job
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008).md) celebrates as the distinguishing
prerogative of GOD, "WHO ALONE spreadeth out the heavens, and TREADETH
UPON THE WAVES OF THE SEA"--What AGUR challenges as GOD'S unapproachable
prerogative, to "GATHER THE WIND IN HIS FISTS, and BIND THE WATERS IN A
GARMENT" ([Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004).md) --lo! this is
here done in flesh, by "THE SON OF MAN."

drawing nigh to the ship--yet as though He "would have passed by them,"
[Mar 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048.md) (compare [Luk
24:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028.md); [Gen
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003.md), [Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); [Gen
32:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).md).

they were afraid--"cried out for fear" ([Mat
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026).md), "supposing it had been a
spirit" ([Mar 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#049).md). He would appear
to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the waters; then as a
human figure, but--in the dark tempestuous sky, and not dreaming that it
could be their Lord--they take it for a spirit. (How often thus we
miscall our chiefest mercies--not only thinking them distant when they
are near, but thinking the best the worst!)

[John 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 6:20</span></span>

It is I; be not afraid--Matthew ([Mat
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#027).md) and Mark ([Mar
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#050).md) give before these exhilarating
words, that to them well-known one, "Be of good cheer!"

[John 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 6:21</span></span>

willingly received him into the ship--their first fears being now
converted into wonder and delight.

and immediately the ship was at the land--This additional miracle, for
as such it is manifestly related, is recorded here alone. Yet all that
is meant seems to be that as the storm was suddenly calmed, so the
little bark--propelled by the secret power of the Lord of Nature now
sailing in it--glided through the now unruffled waters, and while they
were wrapt in wonder at what had happened, not heeding their rapid
motion, was found at port, to their still further surprise.

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

JESUS FOLLOWED BY THE MULTITUDES TO CAPERNAUM, DISCOURSES TO THEM IN THE
SYNAGOGUE OF THE BREAD OF LIFE--EFFECT OF THIS ON TWO CLASSES OF THE
DISCIPLES. (John 6:22-71)

These verses are a little involved, from the Evangelist's desire to
mention every circumstance, however minute, that might call up the scene
as vividly to the reader as it stood before his own view.

The day following--the miracle of the loaves, and the stormy night; the
day on which they landed at Capernaum.

the people which stood on the other side of the sea--not the whole
multitude that had been fed, but only such of them as remained over
night about the shore, that is, on the east side of the lake; for we are
supposed to have come, with Jesus and His disciples in the ship, to the
west side, to Capernaum.

saw that there was none other boat there, &c.--The meaning is, the
people had observed that there had been only one boat on the east side
where they were; namely, the one in which the disciples had crossed at
night to the other, the west side, and they had also observed that Jesus
had not gone on board that boat, but His disciples had put off without
Him:

[John 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 6:23</span></span>

Howbeit, &c.--"Howbeit," adds the Evangelist, in a lively parenthesis,
"there came other boats from Tiberias" (which lay near the southwest
coast of the lake), whose passengers were part of the multitude that had
followed Jesus to the east side, and been miraculously fed; these boats
were fastened somewhere (says the Evangelist)

nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had
given thanks--thus he refers to the glorious "miracle of the
loaves"--and now they were put in requisition to convey the people back
again to the west side. For when "the people saw that Jesus was not
there, neither His disciples, they also took shipping \[in these boats\]
and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."

[John 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 6:25</span></span>

when they had found him on the other side--at Capernaum.

they said, &c.--astonished at His being there, and wondering how He
could have accomplished it, whether by land or water, and when He came;
for being quite unaware of His having walked upon the sea and landed
with the disciples in the ship, they could not see how, unless He had
travelled all night round the head of the lake alone, He could have
reached Capernaum, and even then, how He could have arrived before
themselves.

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

Ye seek me, &c.--Jesus does not put them through their difficulty, says
nothing of His treading on the waves of the sea, nor even notices their
question, but takes advantage of the favorable moment for pointing out
to them how forward, flippant, and superficial were their views, and how
low their desires. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the
miracles"--literally, "the signs," that is, supernatural tokens of a
higher presence, and a divine commission, "but because ye did eat of the
loaves and were filled." From this He proceeds at once to that other
Bread, just as, with the woman of Samaria, to that other Water ([Joh
4:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009).md). We should have supposed all
that follows to have been delivered by the wayside, or wherever they
happened first to meet. But from [Joh
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059.md) we gather that they had probably
met about the door of the synagogue--"for that was the day in which they
assembled in their synagogues" \[LIGHTFOOT\]--and that on being asked,
at the close of the service, if He had any word of exhortation to the
people, He had taken the two breads, the perishing and the living bread,
for the subject of His profound and extraordinary discourse.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

which the Son of man--taking that title of Himself which denoted His
incarnate life.

shall give unto you--in the sense of [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md).

him hath God the Father sealed--marked out and authenticated for that
transcendent office, to impart to the world the bread of an everlasting
life, and this in the character of "the Son of man."

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

What shall we do . . . the works of God--such works as God will approve.
Different answers may be given to such a question, according to the
spirit which prompts the inquiry. (See [Hos
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md); [Luk
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012).md). Here our Lord, knowing whom
He had to deal with, shapes His reply accordingly.

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

This is the work of God--That lies at the threshold of all acceptable
obedience, being not only the prerequisite to it, but the proper spring
of it--in that sense, the work of works, emphatically "the work of God."

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

What sign showest thou, &c.--But how could they ask "a sign," when many
of them scarce a day before had witnessed such a "sign" as had never
till then been vouchsafed to men; when after witnessing it, they could
hardly be restrained from making Him a king; when they followed Him from
the one side of the lake to the other; and when, in the opening words of
this very discourse, He had chided them for seeking Him, "not because
they saw the signs," but for the loaves? The truth seems to be that they
were confounded by the novel claims which our Lord had just advanced. In
proposing to make Him a king, it was for far other purposes than
dispensing to the world the bread of an everlasting life; and when He
seemed to raise His claims even higher still, by representing it as the
grand "work of God," that they should believe on Himself as His Sent
One, they saw very clearly that He was making a demand upon them beyond
anything they were prepared to accord to Him, and beyond all that man
had ever before made. Hence their question, "What dost Thou work?"

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Our fathers did eat manna, &c.--insinuating the inferiority of Christ's
miracle of the loaves to those of Moses: "When Moses claimed the
confidence of the fathers, 'he gave them bread from heaven to eat'--not
for a few thousands, but for millions, and not once only, but daily
throughout their wilderness journey."

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not, &c.--"It was not Moses that gave you the manna, and
even it was but from the lower heavens; 'but My Father giveth you the
true bread,' and that 'from heaven.'"

[John 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 6:33</span></span>

For the bread of God is he, &c.--This verse is perhaps best left in its
own transparent grandeur--holding up the Bread Itself as divine,
spiritual, and eternal; its ordained Fountain and essential Substance,
"Him who came down from heaven to give it" (that Eternal Life which was
with the Father and was manifested unto us, [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md); and its designed objects, "the
world."

[John 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 6:34</span></span>

Lord, evermore give us this bread--speaking now with a certain reverence
(as at [Joh 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025).md), the perpetuity of
the manna floating perhaps in their minds, and much like the Samaritan
woman, when her eyes were but half opened, "Sir, give Me this water,"
&c. ([Joh 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015).md).

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

I am the bread of life--Henceforth the discourse is all in the first
person, "I," "Me," which occur in one form or other, as STIER reckons,
thirty-five times.

he that cometh to me--to obtain what the soul craves, and as the only
all-sufficient and ordained source of supply.

hunger . . . thirst--shall have conscious and abiding satisfaction.

[John 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 6:36</span></span>

But . . . ye have seen me, and believe not--seen Him not in His mere
bodily presence, but in all the majesty of His life, His teaching, His
works.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All that, &c.--This comprehensive and very grand passage is expressed
with a peculiar artistic precision. The opening general statement ([Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037)) consists of two members: (1.md)
"ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVETH ME SHALL COME TO ME"--that is, "Though ye,
as I told you, have no faith in Me, My errand into the world shall in no
wise be defeated; for all that the Father giveth Me shall infallibly
come to Me." Observe, what is given Him by the Father is expressed in
the singular number and neuter gender--literally, "everything"; while
those who come to Him are put in the masculine gender and singular
number--"every one." The whole mass, so to speak, is gifted by the
Father to the Son as a unity, which the Son evolves, one by one, in the
execution of His trust. So [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md),
"that He should give eternal life to all that which Thou hast given Him"
\[BENGEL\]. This "shall" expresses the glorious certainty of it, the
Father being pledged to see to it that the gift be no empty mockery. (2)
"AND HIM THAT COMETH TO MEI WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT." As the former was
the divine, this is just the human side of the same thing. True, the
"coming" ones of the second clause are just the "given" ones of the
first. But had our Lord merely said, "When those that have been given Me
of My Father shall come to Me, I will receive them"--besides being very
flat, the impression conveyed would have been quite different, sounding
as if there were no other laws in operation, in the movement of sinners
to Christ, but such as are wholly divine and inscrutable to us; whereas,
though He does speak of it as a sublime certainty which men's refusals
cannot frustrate, He speaks of that certainty as taking effect only by
men's voluntary advances to Him and acceptance of Him--"Him that cometh
to Me," "whosoever will," throwing the door wide open. Only it is not
the simply willing, but the actually coming, whom He will not cast out;
for the word here employed usually denotes arrival, as distinguished
from the ordinary word, which rather expresses the act of coming (see
[Joh 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042), Greek.md), \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\]. "In no wise" is an emphatic negative, to meet the fears of
the timid (as in [Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md), to meet
the presumption of the hardened). These, then, being the two members of
the general opening statement, what follows is meant to take in both,

[John 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

For I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will--to play an
independent part.

but--in respect to both the foregoing things, the divine and the human
side of salvation.

the will of Him that sent Me--What this twofold will of Him that sent
Him is, we are next sublimely told ([Joh
6:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039).md):

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

And this--in the first place.

is the will of Him that sent me, that of all--everything.

which He hath given Me--(taking up the identical words of [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037).md).

I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day--The
meaning is not, of course, that He is charged to keep the objects
entrusted to Him as He received them, so as they should merely suffer
nothing in His hands. For as they were just "perishing" sinners of
Adam's family, to let "nothing" of such "be lost," but "raise them up at
the last day," must involve, first, giving His flesh for them ([Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051).md), that they "might not perish,
but have everlasting life"; and then, after "keeping them from falling,"
raising their sleeping dust in incorruption and glory, and presenting
them, body and soul, perfect and entire, wanting nothing, to Him who
gave them to Him, saying, "Behold I and the children which God hath
given Me." So much for the first will of Him that sent Him, the divine
side of man's salvation, whose every stage and movement is inscrutable
to us, but infallibly certain.

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

And this--in the second place.

is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son and
believeth on Him--seeing the Son believeth on Him.

may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day--This
is the human side of the same thing as in the foregoing verse, and
answering to "Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out"; that
is, I have it expressly in charge that everyone that so "beholdeth" (so
vieweth) the Son as to believe on Him shall have everlasting life; and,
that none of Him be lost, "I will raise him up at the last day." (See on
[Joh 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054).md).

[John 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 6:41</span></span>

Jews murmured--muttered, not in our Lord's hearing, but He knew it ([Joh
6:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#043.md); [Joh
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025).md).

he said, I am the bread, &c.--Missing the sense and glory of this, and
having no relish for such sublimities, they harp upon the "Bread from
heaven." "What can this mean? Do we not know all about Him--where, when,
and of whom He was born? And yet He says He came down from heaven!"

[John 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 6:43</span></span>

Murmur not . . . No man--that is, Be not either startled or stumbled at
these sayings; for it needs divine teaching to understand them, divine
drawing to submit to them.

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

can come to me--in the sense of [Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md).

except the Father which hath sent me--that is, the Father as the Sender
of Me and to carry out the design of My mission.

draw him--by an internal and efficacious operation; though by all the
means of rational conviction, and in a way altogether consonant to their
moral nature ([Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md); [Hos
11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003).md).

raise him up, &c.--(See on [Joh 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054).md).

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

written in the prophets--in [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Jer
31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); other similar passages may
also have been in view. Our Lord thus falls back upon Scripture
authority for this seemingly hard saying.

all taught of God--not by external revelation merely, but by internal
illumination, corresponding to the "drawing" of [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md).

Every man therefore, &c.--that is, who hath been thus efficaciously
taught of Him.

cometh unto me--with absolute certainty, yet in the sense above given of
"drawing"; that is, "As none can come to Me but as divinely drawn, so
none thus drawn shall fail to come."

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any man hath seen, &c.--Lest they should confound that "hearing
and learning of the Father," to which believers are admitted by divine
teaching, with His own immediate access to Him, He here throws in a
parenthetical explanation; stating, as explicitly as words could do it,
how totally different the two cases were, and that only He who is "from
God" hath this naked, immediate access to the Father. (See [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md).

[John 6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 6:47</span></span>

He that believeth, &c.--(See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024).md).

[John 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 6:48</span></span>

I am the bread of life--"As he that believeth in Me hath everlasting
life, so I am Myself the everlasting Sustenance of that life." (Repeated
from [Joh 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035).md).

[John 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 6:49</span></span>

Your fathers--of whom ye spake ([Joh
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031).md); not "ours," by which He would
hint that He had a higher descent, of which they dreamt not \[BENGEL\].

did eat manna . . . and are dead--recurring to their own point about the
manna, as one of the noblest of the ordained preparatory illustrations
of His own office: "Your fathers, ye say, ate manna in the wilderness;
and ye say well, for so they did, but they are dead--even they whose
carcasses fell in the wilderness did eat of that bread; the Bread
whereof I speak cometh down from heaven, which the manna never did, that
men, eating of it, may live for ever."

[John 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

I am, &c.--Understand, it is of MYSELF I now speak as the Bread from
heaven; of MEif a man eat he shall live for ever; and "THE BREAD WHICH I
WILL GIVE IS MY FLESH, WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE LIFE OF THE WORLD."
Here, for the first time in this high discourse, our Lord explicitly
introduces His sacrificial death--for only rationalists can doubt this
not only as that which constitutes Him the Bread of life to men, but as
THAT very element IN HIM WHICH POSSESSES THE LIFE-GIVING VIRTUE.--"From
this time we hear no more (in this discourse) of "Bread"; this figure is
dropped, and the reality takes its place" \[STIER\]. The words "I will
give" may be compared with the words of institution at the Supper, "This
is My body which is given for you" ([Luk
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019).md), or in Paul's report of it,
"broken for you" ([Co1 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024).md).

[John 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 6:52</span></span>

Jews strove among themselves--arguing the point together.

How can, &c.--that is, Give us His flesh to eat? Absurd.

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Except ye eat the flesh . . . and drink the blood . . . no life,
&c.--The harshest word He had yet uttered in their ears. They asked how
it was possible to eat His flesh. He answers, with great solemnity, "It
is indispensable." Yet even here a thoughtful hearer might find
something to temper the harshness. He says they must not only "eat His
flesh" but "drink His blood," which could not but suggest the idea of
His death--implied in the separation of one's flesh from his blood. And
as He had already hinted that it was to be something very different from
a natural death, saying, "My flesh I will give for the life of the
world" ([Joh 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051).md), it must have been
pretty plain to candid hearers that He meant something above the gross
idea which the bare terms expressed. And farther, when He added that
they "had no life in them unless they thus ate and drank," it was
impossible they should think He meant that the temporal life they were
then living was dependent on their eating and drinking, in this gross
sense, His flesh and blood. Yet the whole statement was certainly
confounding, and beyond doubt was meant to be so. Our Lord had told them
that in spite of all they had "seen" in Him, they "did not believe"
([Joh 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036).md). For their conviction
therefore he does not here lay Himself out; but having the ear not only
of them but of the more candid and thoughtful in the crowded synagogue,
and the miracle of the loaves having led up to the most exalted of all
views of His Person and Office, He takes advantage of their very
difficulties and objections to announce, for all time, those most
profound truths which are here expressed, regardless of the disgust of
the unteachable, and the prejudices even of the most sincere, which His
language would seem only designed to deepen. The truth really conveyed
here is no other than that expressed in [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md), though in more emphatic
terms--that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the
spiritual and eternal life of men; and that unless men voluntarily
appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as
to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no
spiritual and eternal life at all. Not as if His death were the only
thing of value, but it is what gives all else in Christ's Incarnate
Person, Life, and Office, their whole value to us sinners.

[John 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 6:54</span></span>

Whoso eateth . . . hath, &c.--The former verse said that unless they
partook of Him they had no life; this adds, that whoever does so "hath
eternal life."

and I will raise him up at the last day--For the fourth time this is
repeated (see [Joh 6:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md), [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044).md) --showing most clearly that the
"eternal life" which such a man "hath" cannot be the same with the
future resurrection life from which it is carefully distinguished each
time, but a life communicated here below immediately on believing ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024).md); and giving to the
resurrection of the body as that which consummates the redemption of the
entire man, a prominence which in the current theology, it is to be
feared, it has seldom had. (See [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023); 1Co. 15:1-58, throughout.md).

[John 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 6:56</span></span>

He that eateth . . . dwelleth in me and I in him--As our food becomes
incorporated with ourselves, so Christ and those who eat His flesh and
drink His blood become spiritually one life, though personally distinct.

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

As the living Father hath sent me--to communicate His own life.

and I live by the Father--literally, "because of the Father"; My life
and His being one, but Mine that of a Son, whose it is to be "of the
Father." (See [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026).md).

he that eateth me, . . . shall live by me--literally, "because of Me."
So that though one spiritual life with Him, "the Head of every man is
Christ, as the head of Christ is God" ([Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md); [Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023).md).

[John 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 6:58</span></span>

This is that bread, &c.--a sort of summing up of the whole discourse, on
which let this one further remark suffice--that as our Lord, instead of
softening down His figurative sublimities, or even putting them in naked
phraseology, leaves the great truths of His Person and Office, and our
participation of Him and it, enshrined for all time in those glorious
forms of speech, so when we attempt to strip the truth of these figures,
figures though they be, it goes away from us, like water when the vessel
is broken, and our wisdom lies in raising our own spirit, and attuning
our own ear, to our Lord's chosen modes of expression. (It should be
added that although this discourse has nothing to do with the Sacrament
of the Supper, the Sacrament has everything to do with it, as the
visible embodiment of these figures, and, to the believing partaker, a
real, yea, and the most lively and affecting participation of His flesh
and blood, and nourishment thereby of the spiritual and eternal life,
here below).

[John 6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 6:59</span></span>

These things said he in the synagogue--which seems to imply that what
follows took place after the congregation had broken up.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

Many . . . of his disciples--His pretty constant followers, though an
outer circle of them.

hard saying--not merely harsh, but insufferable, as the word often means
in the Old Testament.

who can hear--submit to listen to it.

[John 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">joh 6:61</span></span>

Doth this offend . . . What and if, &c.--that is, "If ye are stumbled at
what I have said, how will ye bear what I now say?" Not that His
ascension itself would stumble them more than His death, but that after
recoiling from the mention of the one, they would not be in a state of
mind to take in the other.

[John 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">joh 6:63</span></span>

the flesh profiteth nothing--Much of His discourse was about "flesh";
but flesh as such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart
that life which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul.

the words that I speak . . . are spirit and . . . life--The whole burden
of the discourse is "spirit," not mere flesh, and "life" in its highest,
not its lowest sense, and the words I have employed are to be
interpreted solely in that sense.

[John 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">joh 6:64</span></span>

But there are some, &c.--that is, "But it matters little to some of you
in what sense I speak, for ye believe not." This was said, adds the
Evangelist, not merely of the outer but of the inner circle of His
disciples; for He knew the traitor, though it was not yet time to expose
him.

[John 6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">joh 6:65</span></span>

Therefore said I, &c.--that is, "That was why I spoke to you of the
necessity of divine teaching which some of you are strangers to."

except it were given him--plainly showing that by the Father's "drawing"
([Joh 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044).md) was meant an internal and
efficacious operation, for in recalling the statement here He says, it
must be "given to a man to come" to Christ.

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

From that time, &c.--or, in consequence of this. Those last words of our
Lord seemed to have given them the finishing stroke--they could not
stand it any longer.

walked no more--Many a journey, it may be, they had taken with Him, but
now they gave Him up finally!

[John 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">joh 6:67</span></span>

the twelve--the first time they are thus mentioned in this Gospel.

Will ye also go away?--Affecting appeal! Evidently Christ felt the
desertion of Him even by those miserable men who could not abide His
statements; and seeing a disturbance even of the wheat by the violence
of the wind which blew away the chaff (not yet visibly showing itself,
but open to His eyes of fire), He would nip it in the bud by this home
question.

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

Then Simon Peter--whose forwardness in this case was noble, and to the
wounded spirit of His Lord doubtless very grateful.

Lord, to whom, &c.--that is, "We cannot deny that we have been staggered
as well as they, and seeing so many go away who, as we thought, might
have been retained by teaching a little less hard to take in, our own
endurance has been severely tried, nor have we been able to stop short
of the question, Shall we follow the rest, and give it up? But when it
came to this, our light returned, and our hearts were reassured. For as
soon as we thought of going away, there arose upon us that awful
question, 'TO WHOM shall we go?' To the lifeless formalism and wretched
traditions of the elders? to the gods many and lords many of the heathen
around us? or to blank unbelief? Nay, Lord, we are shut up. They have
none of that 'ETERNAL LIFE' to offer us whereof Thou hast been
discoursing, in words rich and ravishing as well as in words staggering
to human wisdom. That life we cannot want; that life we have learnt to
crave as a necessity of the deeper nature which Thou hast awakened: 'the
words of that eternal life' (the authority to reveal it and the power to
confer it). Thou hast: Therefore will we stay with Thee--we must."

[John 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">joh 6:69</span></span>

And we believe,--(See on [Mat 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016).md).
Peter seems to have added this not merely--probably not so much--as an
assurance to his Lord of his heart's belief in Him, as for the purpose
of fortifying himself and his faithful brethren against that recoil from
his Lord's harsh statements which he was probably struggling against
with difficulty at that moment. Note.--There are seasons when one's
faith is tried to the utmost, particularly by speculative difficulties;
the spiritual eye then swims, and all truth seems ready to depart from
us. At such seasons, a clear perception that to abandon the faith of
Christ is to face black desolation, ruin and death; and on recoiling
from this, to be able to fall back, not merely on first principles and
immovable foundations, but on personal experience of a Living Lord in
whom all truth is wrapt up and made flesh for our very benefit--this is
a relief unspeakable. Under that blessed Wing taking shelter, until we
are again fit to grapple with the questions that have staggered us, we
at length either find our way through them, or attain to a calm
satisfaction in the discovery that they lie beyond the limits of present
apprehension.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

Have not I chosen . . . and one of you is a devil:--"Well said,
Simon-Barjonas, but that 'we' embraces not so wide a circle as in the
simplicity of thine heart thou thinkest; for though I have chosen you
but twelve, one even of these is a 'devil'" (the temple, the tool of
that wicked one).
