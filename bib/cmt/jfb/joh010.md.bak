### [John Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md)

[John 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 10:1</span></span>

THE GOOD SHEPHERD. (John 10:1-21)

He that entereth not by the door--the legitimate way (without saying
what that was, as yet).

into the sheepfold--the sacred enclosure of God's true people.

climbeth up some other way--not referring to the assumption of
ecclesiastical office without an external call, for those Jewish rulers,
specially aimed at, had this ([Mat
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002).md), but to the want of a true
spiritual commission, the seal of heaven going along with the outward
authority; it is the assumption of the spiritual guidance of the people
without this that is meant.

[John 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 10:2</span></span>

he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep--a true,
divinely recognized shepherd.

[John 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 10:3</span></span>

To him the porter openeth--that is, right of free access is given, by
order of Him to whom the sheep belong; for it is better not to give the
allusion a more specific interpretation \[CALVIN, MEYER, LUTHARDT\].

and the sheep hear his voice--This and all that follows, though it
admits of important application to every faithful shepherd of God's
flock, is in its direct and highest sense true only of "the great
Shepherd of the sheep," who in the first five verses seems plainly,
under the simple character of a true shepherd, to be drawing His own
portrait \[LAMPE, STIER, &c.\].

[John 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 10:7</span></span>

I am the door of the sheep--that is, the way in to the fold, with all
blessed privileges, both for shepherds and sheep (compare [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md).

[John 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 10:8</span></span>

All that ever came before me--the false prophets; not as claiming the
prerogatives of Messiah, but as perverters of the people from the way of
life, all pointing to Him \[OLSHAUSEN\].

the sheep did not hear them--the instinct of their divinely taught
hearts preserving them from seducers, and attaching them to the
heaven-sent prophets, of whom it is said that "the Spirit of Christ was
in them" ([Pe1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md).

[John 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 10:9</span></span>

by me if any man enter in--whether shepherd or sheep.

shall be saved--the great object of the pastoral office, as of all the
divine arrangements towards mankind.

and shall go in and out and find pasture--in, as to a place of safety
and repose; out, as to "green pastures and still waters" ([Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002).md) for nourishment and refreshing,
and all this only transferred to another clime, and enjoyed in another
manner, at the close of this earthly scene ([Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017).md).

[John 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 10:10</span></span>

I am come that they might have life, and . . . more abundantly--not
merely to preserve but impart LIFE, and communicate it in rich and
unfailing exuberance. What a claim! Yet it is only an echo of all His
teaching; and He who uttered these and like words must be either a
blasphemer, all worthy of the death He died, or "God with us"--there can
be no middle course.

[John 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 10:11</span></span>

I am the good shepherd--emphatically, and, in the sense intended,
exclusively so ([Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md); [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md).

the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep--Though this may be said
of literal shepherds, who, even for their brute flock, have, like David,
encountered "the lion and the bear" at the risk of their own lives, and
still more of faithful pastors who, like the early bishops of Rome, have
been the foremost to brave the fury of their enemies against the flock
committed to their care; yet here, beyond doubt, it points to the
struggle which was to issue in the willing surrender of the Redeemer's
own life, to save His sheep from destruction.

[John 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 10:12</span></span>

an hireling . . . whose own the sheep are not--who has no property, in
them. By this He points to His own peculiar relation to the sheep, the
same as His Father's, the great Proprietor and Lord of the flock, who
styles Him "My Shepherd, the Man that is My Fellow" ([Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md), and though faithful
under-shepherds are so in their Master's interest, that they feel a
measure of His own concern for their charge, the language is strictly
applicable only to "the Son over His own house" ([Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006).md).

seeth the wolf coming--not the devil distinctively, as some take it
\[STIER, ALFORD, &c.\], but generally whoever comes upon the flock with
hostile intent, in whatever form: though the wicked one, no doubt, is at
the bottom of such movements \[LUTHARDT\].

[John 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 10:14</span></span>

I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep--in the peculiar sense of [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md).

am known of mine--the soul's response to the voice that has inwardly and
efficaciously called it; for of this mutual loving acquaintance ours is
the effect of His. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the active
element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is
the passive principle, the reception of His life and light. In this
reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime object of
its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity, though a
derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to His
commands" \[OLSHAUSEN\]. From this mutual knowledge Jesus rises to
another and loftier reciprocity of knowledge.

[John 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 10:15</span></span>

As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father--What claim to
absolute equality with the Father could exceed this? (See on [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027).md).

and I lay down my life for the sheep--How sublime this, immediately
following the lofty claim of the preceding clause! It is the riches and
the poverty of "the Word made flesh"--one glorious Person reaching at
once up to the Throne and down even to the dust of death, "that we might
live through Him." A candid interpretation of the words, "for the
sheep," ought to go far to establish the special relation of the
vicarious death of Christ to the Church.

[John 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 10:16</span></span>

other sheep I have . . . not of this fold: them also I must bring--He
means the perishing Gentiles, already His "sheep" in the love of His
heart and the purpose of His grace to "bring them" in due time.

they shall hear my voice--This is not the language of mere foresight
that they would believe, but the expression of a purpose to draw them to
Himself by an inward and efficacious call, which would infallibly issue
in their spontaneous accession to Him.

and there shall be one fold--rather "one flock" (for the word for
"fold," as in the foregoing verses, is quite different).

[John 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 10:17</span></span>

Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, &c.--As
the highest act of the Son's love to the Father was the laying down of
His life for the sheep at His "commandment," so the Father's love to Him
as His incarnate Son reaches its consummation, and finds its highest
justification, in that sublimest and most affecting of all acts.

that I might take it again--His resurrection-life being indispensable to
the accomplishment of the fruit of His death.

[John 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 10:18</span></span>

No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down myself: I have power to lay
it down, and I have power to take it again--It is impossible for
language more plainly and emphatically to express the absolute
voluntariness of Christ's death, such a voluntariness as it would be
manifest presumption in any mere creature to affirm of his own death. It
is beyond all doubt the language of One who was conscious that His life
was His own (which no creature's is), and therefore His to surrender or
retain at will. Here lay the glory of His sacrifice, that it was purely
voluntary. The claim of "power to take it again" is no less important,
as showing that His resurrection, though ascribed to the Father, in the
sense we shall presently see, was nevertheless His own assertion of His
own right to life as soon as the purposes of His voluntary death were
accomplished.

This commandment--to "lay down His--life, that He might take it again."

have I received of my Father--So that Christ died at once by "command"
of His Father, and by such a voluntary obedience to that command as has
made Him (so to speak) infinitely dear to the Father. The necessity of
Christ's death, in the light of these profound sayings, must be manifest
to all but the superficial student.

[John 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 10:19</span></span>

There was a division . . . again among the Jews for these sayings--the
light and the darkness revealing themselves with increasing clearness in
the separation of the teachable from the obstinately prejudiced. The one
saw in Him only "a devil and a madman"; the other revolted at the
thought that such words could come from one possessed, and sight be
given to the blind by a demoniac; showing clearly that a deeper
impression had been made upon them than their words expressed.

[John 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 10:22</span></span>

DISCOURSE AT THE FEAST OF DEDICATION--FROM THE FURY OF HIS ENEMIES JESUS
ESCAPES BEYOND JORDAN, WHERE MANY BELIEVE ON HIM. (John 10:22-42)

it was . . . the feast of the dedication--celebrated rather more than
two months after the feast of tabernacles, during which intermediate
period our Lord seems to have remained in the neighborhood of Jerusalem.
It was instituted by Jude Maccabeus, to commemorate the purification of
the temple from the profanations to which it had been subjected by
Antiochus Epiphanes 165 B.C., and kept for eight days, from the
twenty-fifth Chisleu (December), the day on which Judas began the first
joyous celebration of it (I Maccabees 4:52, 56, 59; and JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 7.7.7).

it was winter--implying some inclemency. Therefore,

[John 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 10:23</span></span>

Jesus walked . . . in Solomon's porch--for shelter. This portico was on
the east side of the temple, and JOSEPHUS says it was part of the
original structure of Solomon \[Antiquities, 20.9.7\].

[John 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 10:24</span></span>

Then came the Jews--the rulers. (See on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019).md).

How long dost thou make us to doubt?--"hold us in suspense" (Margin).

If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly--But when the plainest evidence
of it was resisted, what weight could a mere assertion of it have?

[John 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 10:25</span></span>

Jesus answered them, I told you--that is, in substance, what I am (for
example [Joh 7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md), [Joh
8:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035.md), [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058).md).

[John 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 10:26</span></span>

ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said--referring to
the whole strain of the Parable of the Sheep, ([Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001), &c..md).

[John 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 10:27</span></span>

My sheep hear my voice, &c.--(See on [Joh
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#008).md).

[John 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 10:28</span></span>

I give unto them eternal life--not "will give them"; for it is a present
gift. (See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024).md). It is a very grand utterance,
couched in the language of majestic authority.

[John 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 10:29</span></span>

My Father, which gave them me--(See on [Joh
6:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037).md).

is greater than all--with whom no adverse power can contend. It is a
general expression of an admitted truth, and what follows shows for what
purpose it was uttered, "and none is able to pluck them out of My
Father's hand." The impossibility of true believers being lost, in the
midst of all the temptations which they may encounter, does not consist
in their fidelity and decision, but is founded upon the power of God.
Here the doctrine of predestination is presented in its sublime and
sacred aspect; there is a predestination of the holy, which is taught
from one end of the Scriptures to the other; not, indeed, of such a
nature that an "irresistible grace" compels the opposing will of man (of
course not), but so that that will of man which receives and loves the
commands of God is produced only by God's grace (OLSHAUSEN--a testimony
all the more valuable, being given in spite of Lutheran prejudice).

[John 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 10:30</span></span>

I and my Father are one--Our language admits not of the precision of the
original in this great saying. "Are" is in the masculine gender--"we
(two persons) are"; while "one" is neuter--"one thing." Perhaps "one
interest" expresses, as nearly as may be, the purport of the saying.
There seemed to be some contradiction between His saying they had been
given by His Father into His own hands, out of which they could not be
plucked, and then saying that none could pluck them out of His Father's
hands, as if they had not been given out of them. "Neither have they,"
says He; "though He has given them to Me, they are as much in His own
almighty hands as ever--they cannot be, and when given to Me they are
not, given away from Himself; for HE AND I HAVE ALL IN COMMON." Thus it
will be seen, that, though oneness of essence is not the precise thing
here affirmed, that truth is the basis of what is affirmed, without
which it would not be true. And AUGUSTINE was right in saying the "We
are" condemns the Sabellians (who denied the distinction of Persons in
the Godhead), while the "one" (as explained) condemns the Arians (who
denied the unity of their essence).

[John 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 10:31</span></span>

Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him--and for precisely the
same thing as before ([Joh 8:58-59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058).md).

[John 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 10:32</span></span>

Many good works have I showed you--that is, works of pure benevolence
(as in [Act 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md), "Who went about
doing good," &c.; see [Mar 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#037).md).

from my Father--not so much by His power, but as directly commissioned
by Him to do them. This He says to meet the imputation of unwarrantable
assumption of the divine prerogatives \[LUTHARDT\].

for which of those works do ye stone me?--"are ye stoning (that is,
going to stone) me?"

[John 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 10:33</span></span>

for a blasphemy--whose legal punishment was stoning ([Lev
24:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011).md).

thou, being a man--that is, a man only.

makest thyself God--Twice before they understood Him to advance the same
claim, and both times they prepared themselves to avenge what they took
to be the insulted honor of God, as here, in the way directed by their
law ([Joh 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md); [Joh
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059).md).

[John 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 10:34</span></span>

Is it not written in your law--in [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md), respecting judges or
magistrates.

Ye are gods--being the official representatives and commissioned agents
of God.

[John 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 10:35</span></span>

If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came . . . Say ye of
him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou
blasphemest--The whole force of this reasoning, which has been but in
part seized by the commentators, lies in what is said of the two parties
compared. The comparison of Himself with mere men, divinely
commissioned, is intended to show (as NEANDER well expresses it) that
the idea of a communication of the Divine Majesty to human nature was by
no means foreign to the revelations of the Old Testament; but there is
also a contrast between Himself and all merely human representatives of
God--the one "sanctified by the Father and sent into the world"; the
other, "to whom the word of God (merely) came," which is expressly
designed to prevent His being massed up with them as only one of many
human officials of God. It is never said of Christ that "the word of the
Lord came to Him"; whereas this is the well-known formula by which the
divine commission, even to the highest of mere men, is expressed, as
John the Baptist ([Luk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002).md). The
reason is that given by the Baptist himself (see on [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031).md). The contrast is between those
"to whom the word of God came"--men of the earth, earthy, who were
merely privileged to get a divine message to utter (if prophets), or a
divine office to discharge (if judges)--and "Him whom (not being of the
earth at all) the Father sanctified (or set apart), and sent into the
world," an expression never used of any merely human messenger of God,
and used only of Himself.

because, I said, I am the Son of God--It is worthy of special notice
that our Lord had not said, in so many words, that He was the Son of
God, on this occasion. But He had said what beyond doubt amounted to
it--namely, that He gave His sheep eternal life, and none could pluck
them out of His hand; that He had got them from His Father, in whose
hands, though given to Him, they still remained, and out of whose hand
none could pluck them; and that they were the indefeasible property of
both, inasmuch as "He and His Father were one." Our Lord considers all
this as just saying of Himself, "I am the Son of God"--one nature with
Him, yet mysteriously of Him. The parenthesis ([Joh
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035).md), "and the Scripture cannot be
broken," referring to the terms used of magistrates in the eighty-second
Psalm, has an important bearing on the authority of the living oracles.
"The Scripture, as the expressed will of the unchangeable God, is itself
unchangeable and indissoluble" \[OLSHAUSEN\]. (Compare [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017).md).

[John 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 10:37</span></span>

though ye believe not me, believe the works--There was in Christ's
words, independently of any miracles, a self-evidencing truth, majesty
and grace, which those who had any spiritual susceptibility were unable
to resist ([Joh 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046.md); [Joh
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030).md). But, for those who wanted this,
"the works" were a mighty help. When these failed, the case was
desperate indeed.

that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in
him--thus reiterating His claim to essential oneness with the Father,
which He had only seemed to soften down, that He might calm their rage
and get their ear again for a moment.

[John 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 10:39</span></span>

Therefore they sought again to take him--true to their original
understanding of His words, for they saw perfectly well that He meant to
"make Himself God" throughout all this dialogue.

he escaped out of their hand--(See on [Luk
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030.md); [Joh
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059).md).

[John 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 10:40</span></span>

went away again beyond Jordan . . . the place where John at first
baptized--(See on [Joh 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028).md).

[John 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 10:41</span></span>

many resorted to him--on whom the ministry of the Baptist had left
permanent impressions.

John did no miracle, but all things John spake of this man were
true--what they now heard and saw in Jesus only confirming in their
minds the divinity of His forerunner's mission, though unaccompanied by
any of His Master's miracles. And thus, "many believed on Him there."
