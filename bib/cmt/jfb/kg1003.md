[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

SOLOMON MARRIES PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER. ([Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001))

Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh--This was a royal title, equivalent
to "sultan," and the personal name of this monarch is said to have been
Vaphres. The formation, on equal terms, of this matrimonial alliance
with the royal family of Egypt, shows the high consideration to which
the Hebrew kingdom had now arisen. Rosellini has given, from the
Egyptian monuments, what is supposed to be a portrait of this princess.
She was received in the land of her adoption with great eclat; for the
Song of Solomon and the forty-fifth Psalm are supposed to have been
composed in honor of this occasion, although they may both have a higher
typical reference to the introduction of the Gentiles into the church.

and brought her into the city of David--that is, Jerusalem. She was not
admissible into the stronghold of Zion, the building where the ark was
([Deu 23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007)). She seems to have been
lodged at first in his mother's apartments ([Sol
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004); [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002)), as a suitable residence was not
yet provided for her in the new palace ([Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008); [Kg1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024); [Ch2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011)).

building . . . the wall of Jerusalem round about--Although David had
begun ([Psa 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018)), it was, according
to JOSEPHUS, reserved for Solomon to extend and complete the
fortifications of the city. It has been questioned whether this marriage
was in conformity with the law (see [Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016); [Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003); [Ezr
10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001); [Neh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#026)). But it is nowhere censured in
Scripture, as are the connections Solomon formed with other foreigners
([Kg1 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)); whence it may be
inferred that he had stipulated for her abandonment of idolatry, and
conforming to the Jewish religion ([Psa
45:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 3:3</span></span>

HIGH PLACES BEING IN USE, HE SACRIFICES AT GIBEON. ([Kg1
3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002))

And Solomon loved the Lord--This declaration, illustrated by what
follows, affords undoubted evidence of the young king's piety; nor is
the word "only," which prefaces the statement, to be understood as
introducing a qualifying circumstance that reflected any degree of
censure upon him. The intention of the sacred historian is to describe
the generally prevailing mode of worship before the temple was built.
The

high places were altars erected on natural or artificial eminences,
probably from the idea that men were brought nearer to the Deity. They
had been used by the patriarchs, and had become so universal among the
heathen that they were almost identified with idolatry. They were
prohibited in the law ([Lev 17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003);
[Deu 12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013); [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Eze
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003); [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008)). But, so long as the tabernacle
was migratory and the means for the national worship were merely
provisional, the worship on those high places was tolerated. Hence, as
accounting for their continuance, it is expressly stated ([Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)) that God had not yet chosen a
permanent and exclusive place for his worship.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 3:4</span></span>

the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there--The old tabernacle and the
brazen altar which Moses had made in the wilderness were there ([Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039); [Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029); [Ch2
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003)). The royal progress was of
public importance. It was a season of national devotion. The king was
accompanied by his principal nobility ([Ch2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002)); and, as the occasion was most
probably one of the great annual festivals which lasted seven days, the
rank of the offerer and the succession of daily oblations may help in
part to account for the immense magnitude of the sacrifices.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 3:5</span></span>

In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream--It was probably at
the close of this season, when his mind had been elevated into a high
state of religious fervor by the protracted services. Solomon felt an
intense desire, and he had offered an earnest petition, for the gift of
wisdom. In sleep his thoughts ran upon the subject of his prayer, and he
dreamed that God appeared to him and gave him the option of every thing
in the world--that he asked wisdom, and that God granted his request
([Kg1 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009)). His dream was but an
imaginary repetition of his former desire, but God's grant of it was
real.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 3:6</span></span>

HE CHOOSES WISDOM. ([Kg1 3:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006))

Solomon said--that is, had dreamed that he said.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 3:7</span></span>

I am but a little child--not in age, for he had reached manhood ([Kg1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009)) and must have been at least
twenty years old; but he was raw and inexperienced in matters of
government.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 3:10</span></span>

the speech pleased the Lord--It was Solomon's waking prayers that God
heard and requited, but the acceptance was signified in this vision.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 3:15</span></span>

behold, it was a dream--The vivid impression, the indelible recollection
he had of this dream, together with the new and increased energy
communicated to his mind, and the flow of worldly prosperity that rushed
upon him, gave him assurance that it came by divine inspiration and
originated in the grace of God. The wisdom, however, that was asked and
obtained was not so much of the heart as of the head--it was wisdom not
for himself personally, but for his office, such as would qualify him
for the administration of justice, the government of a kingdom, and for
the attainment of general scientific knowledge.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

HIS JUDGMENT BETWEEN TWO HARLOTS. ([Kg1
3:16-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016))

Then came there two women--Eastern monarchs, who generally administer
justice in person, at least in all cases of difficulty, often appeal to
the principles of human nature when they are at a loss otherwise to find
a clue to the truth or see clearly their way through a mass of
conflicting testimony. The modern history of the East abounds with
anecdotes of judicial cases, in which the decision given was the result
of an experiment similar to this of Solomon upon the natural feelings of
the contending parties.
