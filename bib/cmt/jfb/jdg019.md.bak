### [Judges Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

[Judges 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 19:1</span></span>

A LEVITE GOING TO BETHLEHEM TO FETCH HIS WIFE. ([Jdg
19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001).md)

it came to pass in those days--The painfully interesting episode that
follows, together with the intestine commotion the report of it produced
throughout the country, belongs to the same early period of anarchy and
prevailing disorder.

a certain Levite . . . took to him a concubine--The priests under the
Mosaic law enjoyed the privilege of marrying as well as other classes of
the people. It was no disreputable connection this Levite had formed;
for a nuptial engagement with a concubine wife (though, as wanting in
some outward ceremonies, it was reckoned a secondary or inferior
relationship) possessed the true essence of marriage; it was not only
lawful, but sanctioned by the example of many good men.

[Judges 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 19:2</span></span>

his concubine . . . went away from him unto her father's house--The
cause of the separation assigned in our version rendered it unlawful for
her husband to take her back ([Deu
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004).md); and according to the uniform
style of sentiment and practice in the East, she would have been put to
death, had she gone to her father's family. Other versions concur with
JOSEPHUS, in representing the reason for the flight from her husband's
house to be, that she was disgusted with him, through frequent brawls.

[Judges 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 19:3</span></span>

And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
her--Hebrew, "speak to her heart," in a kindly and affectionate manner,
so as to rekindle her affection. Accompanied by a servant, he arrived at
the house of his father-in-law, who rejoiced to meet him, in the hope
that a complete reconciliation would be brought about between his
daughter and her husband. The Levite, yielding to the hospitable
importunities of his father-in-law, prolonged his stay for days.

[Judges 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 19:8</span></span>

tarried--with reluctance.

until afternoon--literally, "the decline of the day." People in the
East, who take little or nothing to eat in the morning, do not breakfast
till from ten to twelve A.M., and this meal the hospitable relative had
purposely protracted to so late a period as to afford an argument for
urging a further stay.

[Judges 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 19:9</span></span>

the day draweth toward evening--Hebrew, "the pitching time of day."
Travellers who set out at daybreak usually halt about the middle of the
afternoon the first day, to enjoy rest and refreshment. It was, then,
too late a time to commence a journey. But duty, perhaps, obliged the
Levite to indulge no further delay.

[Judges 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 19:10</span></span>

the man . . . departed, and came over against Jebus--The note, "which is
Jerusalem," must have been inserted by Ezra or some later hand. Jebus
being still, though not entirely ([Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008).md) in the possession of the old
inhabitants, the Levite resisted the advice of his attendant to enter it
and determined rather to press forward to pass the night in Gibeah,
which he knew was occupied by Israelites. The distance from Beth-lehem
to Jerusalem is about six miles. The event showed that it would have
been better to have followed the advice of his attendant--to have
trusted themselves among aliens than among their own countrymen.

[Judges 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 19:13</span></span>

in Gibeah, or in Ramah--The first of these places was five miles
northeast, the other from four to five north of Jerusalem.

[Judges 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 19:15</span></span>

when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city--The towns of
Palestine at this remote period could not, it seems, furnish any
establishment in the shape of an inn or public lodging-house. Hence we
conclude that the custom, which is still frequently witnessed in the
cities of the East, was then not uncommon, for travellers who were late
in arriving and who had no introduction to a private family, to spread
their bedding in the streets, or wrapping themselves up in their cloaks,
pass the night in the open air. In the Arab towns and villages, however,
the sheik, or some other person, usually comes out and urgently invites
the strangers to his house. This was done also in ancient Palestine
([Gen 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004.md); [Gen
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002).md). That the same hospitality was
not shown in Gibeah seems to have been owing to the bad character of the
people.

[Judges 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 19:16</span></span>

AN OLD MAN ENTERTAINS HIM AT GIBEAH. ([Jdg
19:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016).md)

there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was
also of mount Ephraim--Perhaps his hospitality was quickened by learning
the stranger's occupation, and that he was on his return to his duties
at Shiloh.

[Judges 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 19:19</span></span>

there is no want of any thing--In answering the kindly inquiries of the
old man, the Levite deemed it right to state that he was under no
necessity of being burdensome on anyone, for he possessed all that was
required to relieve his wants. Oriental travellers always carry a stock
of provisions with them; and knowing that even the khans or
lodging-houses they may find on their way afford nothing beyond rest and
shelter, they are careful to lay in a supply of food both for themselves
and their beasts. Instead of hay, which is seldom met with, they used
chopped straw, which, with a mixture of barley, beans, or the like,
forms the provender for cattle. The old man, however, in the warmth of a
generous heart, refused to listen to any explanation, and bidding the
Levite keep his stocks for any emergency that might occur in the
remainder of his journey, invited them to accept of the hospitalities of
his house for the night.

[Judges 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 19:20</span></span>

only lodge not in the street--As this is no rare or singular
circumstance in the East, the probability is that the old man's earnest
dissuasive from such a procedure arose from his acquaintance with the
infamous practices of the place.

[Judges 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 19:22</span></span>

THE GIBEAHITES ABUSE HIS CONCUBINE TO DEATH. ([Jdg
19:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022).md)

certain sons of Belial beset the house--The narrative of the horrid
outrage that was committed; of the proposal of the old man; the
unfeeling, careless, and in many respects, inexplicable conduct of the
Levite towards his wife, disclose a state of morality that would have
appeared incredible, did it not rest on the testimony of the sacred
historian. Both men ought to have protected the women in the house, even
though at the expense of their lives, or thrown themselves on God's
providence. It should be noted, however, that the guilt of such a foul
outrage is not fastened on the general population of Gibeah.

[Judges 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 19:29</span></span>

divided her . . . into twelve pieces--The want of a regular government
warranted an extraordinary step; and certainly no method could have been
imagined more certain of rousing universal horror and indignation than
this terrible summons of the Levite.
