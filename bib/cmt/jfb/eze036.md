### [Ezekiel Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 36:1</span></span>

ISRAEL AVENGED OF HER FOES, AND RESTORED, FIRST TO INWARD HOLINESS, THEN
TO OUTWARD PROSPERITY. (Eze. 36:1-38)

mountains of Israel--in contrast to "Mount Seir" of the previous
prophecy. They are here personified; Israel's elevation is moral, not
merely physical, as Edom's. Her hills are "the everlasting hills" of
Jacob's prophecy ([Gen 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026)). "The
enemy" (Edom, the singled-out representative of all God's foes), with a
shout of exultation, "Aha!" had claimed, as the nearest kinsman of
Israel (the brother of their father Esau), his vacated inheritance; as
much as to say, the so-called "everlasting" inheritance of Israel and of
the "hills," which typified the unmoved perpetuity of it ([Psa
125:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001)), has come to an end, in spite
of the promise of God, and has become "ours" (compare [Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013); [Deu
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015)).

[Ezekiel 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 36:3</span></span>

Literally, "Because, even because."

swallowed you up--literally, "panted after" you, as a beast after its
prey; implying the greedy cupidity of Edom as to Israel's inheritance
([Psa 56:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)).

lips of talkers--literally, "lips of the tongue," that is, of the
slanderer, the man of tongue. Edom slandered Israel because of the
connection of the latter with Jehovah, as though He were unable to save
them. [Deu 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037), and [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009) had foretold Israel's reproach
among the heathen ([Dan 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016)).

[Ezekiel 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 36:4</span></span>

Inanimate creatures are addressed, to imply that the creature also, as
it were, groans for deliverance from the bondage of corruption into the
glorious liberty of the children of God ([Rom
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)) \[POLANUS\]. The completeness
of the renewed blessedness of all parts of the land is implied.

derision-- ([Psa 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004)).

[Ezekiel 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 36:5</span></span>

to cast it out for a prey--that is, to take the land for a prey, its
inhabitants being cast out. Or the land is compared to a prey cast forth
to wild beasts. FAIRBAIRN needlessly alters the Hebrew pointing and
translates, "that they may plunder its pasturage."

[Ezekiel 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 36:6</span></span>

the shame of the heathen--namely, the shame with which the heathen cover
you ([Psa 123:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 36:7</span></span>

lifted . . . mine hand--in token of an oath ([Eze
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005); [Gen
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022)).

they shall bear their shame--a perpetual shame; whereas the "shame"
which Israel bore from these heathen was only for a time.

[Ezekiel 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 36:8</span></span>

they are at hand to come--that is the Israelites are soon about to
return to their land. This proves that the primary reference of the
prophecy is to the return from Babylon, which was "at hand," or
comparatively near. But this only in part fulfilled the prediction, the
full and final blessing in future, and the restoration from Babylon was
an earnest of it.

[Ezekiel 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 36:10</span></span>

wastes builded-- [Isa 58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012); [Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004); [Amo
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011), [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014), where, as here ([Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)), the names of David,
Messiah's type, and Edom, Israel's foe, are introduced in connection
with the coming restoration.

[Ezekiel 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 36:11</span></span>

do better . . . than at your beginnings--as in the case of Job ([Job
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012)). Whereas the heathen nations
fall irrevocably, Israel shall be more than restored; its last estate
shall exceed even its first.

[Ezekiel 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 36:12</span></span>

to walk upon you--O mountains of Israel ([Eze
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008))!

thee . . . thou--change from plural to singular: O hill of Zion, singled
out from the other mountains of Israel ([Eze
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026)); or land.

thou shall no more . . . bereave them of men--Thou shalt no more provoke
God to bereave them of children (so the ellipsis ought to be supplied,
as Ezekiel probably alludes to [Jer
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007), "I will bereave them of
children").

[Ezekiel 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 36:13</span></span>

Thou land devourest up men--alluding to the words of the spies ([Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032)). The land personified is
represented as doing that which was done in it. Like an unnatural mother
it devoured, that is, it was the grave of its people; of the Canaanites,
its former possessors, through mutual wars, and finally by the sword of
Israel; and now, of the Jews, through internal and external ills; for
example, wars, famine (to which [Eze
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#030), "reproach of famine among the
heathen," implies the allusion here is).

[Ezekiel 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 36:14</span></span>

bereave--so the Keri, or Hebrew Margin reads, to correspond to "bereave"
in [Eze 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013); but "cause to fall" or
"stumble," in the Hebrew text or Chetib, being the more difficult
reading, is the one least likely to come from a corrector; also, it
forms a good transition to the next subject, namely, the moral cause of
the people's calamities, namely, their falls, or stumblings through sin.
The latter ceasing, the former also cease. So the same expression
follows in [Eze 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015), "Neither shalt
thou cause thy nations to fall any more."

[Ezekiel 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 36:17</span></span>

removed woman-- ([Lev 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019), &c.).

[Ezekiel 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 36:18</span></span>

The reason for their removal was their sin, which God's holiness could
not let pass unpunished; just as a woman's legal uncleanness was the
reason for her being separated from the congregation.

[Ezekiel 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 36:20</span></span>

profaned my holy name, when they--the heathen

said to them--the Israelites.

These, &c.--The Israelites gave a handle of reproach to the heathen
against God, who would naturally say, These who take usury, oppress,
commit adultery, &c., and who, in such an abject plight, are "gone
forth" as exiles "out of His land," are specimens of what Jehovah can or
will effect, for His people, and show what kind of a God this so-called
holy, omnipotent, covenant-keeping God must be! ([Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005); [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024)).

[Ezekiel 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 36:21</span></span>

I had pity for mine holy name--that is, I felt pity for it; God's own
name, so dishonored, was the primary object of His pitying concern; then
His people, secondarily, through His concern for it \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 36:22</span></span>

not . . . for your sakes--that is, not for any merit in you; for, on the
contrary, on your part, there is everything to call down continued
severity (compare [Deu 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005)). The
sole and sure ground of hope was God's regard to "His own name," as the
God of covenant grace ([Psa 106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045)),
which He must vindicate from the dishonor brought on it by the Jews,
before the heathen.

[Ezekiel 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 36:23</span></span>

sanctify--vindicate and manifest as holy, in opposition to the heathen
reproaches of it brought on by the Jews' sins and their punishment (see
on [Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020)).

sanctified in you--that is, in respect of you; I shall be regarded in
their eyes as the Holy One, and righteous in My dealings towards you
([Eze 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041); [Eze
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022)).

[Ezekiel 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 36:24</span></span>

Fulfilled primarily in the restoration from Babylon; ultimately to be so
in the restoration "from all countries."

[Ezekiel 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 36:25</span></span>

The external restoration must be preceded by an internal one. The change
in their condition must not be superficial, but must be based on a
radical renewal of the heart. Then the heathen, understanding from the
regenerated lives of God's people how holy God is, would perceive
Israel's past troubles to have been only the necessary vindications of
His righteousness. Thus God's name would be "sanctified" before the
heathen, and God's people be prepared for outward blessings.

sprinkle . . . water--phraseology taken from the law; namely, the water
mixed with the ashes of a heifer sprinkled with a hyssop on the unclean
([Num 19:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009)); the thing signified
being the cleansing blood of Christ sprinkled on the conscience and
heart ([Heb 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022); compare [Jer
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008); [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)).

from all your idols--Literal idolatry has ceased among the Jews ever
since the captivity; so far, the prophecy has been already fulfilled;
but "cleansing from all their idols," for example, covetousness,
prejudices against Jesus of Nazareth, is yet future.

[Ezekiel 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 36:26</span></span>

new heart--mind and will.

spirit--motive and principle of action.

stony heart--unimpressible in serious things; like the "stony ground"
([Mat 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005), [Mat
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020)), unfit for receiving the good
seed so as to bring forth fruit.

heart of flesh--not "carnal" in opposition to "spiritual"; but
impressible and docile, fit for receiving the good seed. In [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031) they are commanded, "Make you a
new heart, and a new spirit." Here God says, "A new heart will I give
you, and a new spirit will I put within you." Thus the responsibility of
man, and the sovereign grace of God, are shown to be coexistent. Man
cannot make himself a new heart unless God gives it ([Phi
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012)).

[Ezekiel 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 36:27</span></span>

my spirit-- ([Eze 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019); [Jer
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039)). The partial reformation at the
return from Babylon ([Ezr 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006), &c.;
Neh. 8:1-9:38) was an earnest of the full renewal hereafter under
Messiah.

[Ezekiel 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 36:28</span></span>

ye . . . my people, . . . I . . . your God-- ([Eze
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020); [Jer
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022)).

[Ezekiel 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 36:29</span></span>

save . . . from all . . . uncleannesses--the province of Jesus,
according to the signification of His name ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)). To be specially exercised in
behalf of the Jews in the latter days ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)).

call for . . . corn--as a master "calls for" a servant; all the powers
and productions of nature are the servants of Jehovah ([Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016); [Mat
8:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008)). Compare as to the
subordination of all the intermediate agents to the Great First Cause,
who will give "corn" and all good things to His people, [Hos
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021); [Zac
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012).

[Ezekiel 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 36:30</span></span>

no more reproach of famine among the heathen--to which their taunt ([Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013)), "Thou land devourest up men,"
in part referred.

[Ezekiel 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 36:31</span></span>

remember your . . . evil ways--with shame and loathing. The unexpected
grace and love of God, manifested in Christ to Israel, shall melt the
people into true repentance, which mere legal fear could not ([Eze
16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061), [Eze
16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063); [Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); compare [Jer
33:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008)).

[Ezekiel 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 36:35</span></span>

they shall say--The heathen, who once made Israel's desolation a ground
of reproach against the name of Jehovah Himself ([Eze
36:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020)); but now He so vindicates
its sanctity ([Eze 36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022)) that
these same heathen are constrained to acknowledge Israel's more than
renewed blessedness to be God's own work, and a ground for glorifying
His name ([Eze 36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036)).

Eden--as Tyre (the type of the world powers in general: so Assyria, a
cedar "in the garden of God, Eden," [Eze
31:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008)), in original advantages, had
been compared to "Eden, the garden of God" ([Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013)), from which she had fallen
irrecoverably; so Israel, once desolate, is to be as "the garden of
Eden" ([Isa 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003)), and is to be so
unchangeably.

[Ezekiel 36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">eze 36:36</span></span>

Lord . . . spoken . . . do it-- ([Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019)).

[Ezekiel 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 36:37</span></span>

I will yet for this be inquired of--so as to grant it. On former
occasions He had refused to be inquired of by Israel because the
inquirers were not in a fit condition of mind to receive a blessing
([Eze 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003); [Eze
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003)). But hereafter, as in the
restoration from Babylon (Neh. 8:1-9:38; Dan. 9:3-20, 21, 23), God will
prepare His people's hearts ([Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026)) to pray aright for the
blessings which He is about to give ([Psa
102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020); [Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)).

like a flock--resuming the image ([Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023), [Eze
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031)).

[Ezekiel 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 36:38</span></span>

As the holy flock--the great flock of choice animals for sacrifice,
brought up to Jerusalem at the three great yearly festivals, the
passover, pentecost, and feast of the tabernacles.

Three stages in Israel's revival present themselves to the prophet's
eye. (1) The new awakening of the people, the resurrection of the dead
([Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)). (2) The reunion of the
formerly hostile members of the community, whose contentions had
affected the whole ([Eze 37:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015)).
(3) The community thus restored is strong enough to withstand the
assault of Gog, &c. (Eze. 38:1-39:29) \[EWALD\].
