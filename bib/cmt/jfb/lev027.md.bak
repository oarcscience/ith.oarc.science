[Leviticus 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 27:2</span></span>

CONCERNING VOWS. (Lev. 27:1-18)

When a man shall make a singular vow, &c.--Persons have, at all times
and in all places, been accustomed to present votive offerings, either
from gratitude for benefits received, or in the event of deliverance
from apprehended evil. And Moses was empowered, by divine authority, to
prescribe the conditions of this voluntary duty.

the persons shall be for the Lord, &c.--better rendered
thus:--"According to thy estimation, the persons shall be for the Lord."
Persons might consecrate themselves or their children to the divine
service, in some inferior or servile kind of work about the sanctuary
([Sa1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001).md). In the event of any
change, the persons so devoted had the privilege in their power of
redeeming themselves; and this chapter specifies the amount of the
redemption money, which the priest had the discretionary power of
reducing, as circumstances might seem to require. Those of mature age,
between twenty and sixty, being capable of the greatest service, were
rated highest; young people, from five till twenty, less, because not so
serviceable; infants, though devotable by their parents before birth
([Sa1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011).md), could not be offered nor
redeemed till a month after birth; old people were valued below the
young, but above children; and the poor--in no case freed from payment,
in order to prevent the rash formation of vows--were rated according to
their means.

[Leviticus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 27:9</span></span>

if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord--a clean
beast. After it had been vowed, it could neither be employed in common
purposes nor exchanged for an equivalent--it must be sacrificed--or if,
through some discovered blemish, it was unsuitable for the altar, it
might be sold, and the money applied for the sacred service. If an
unclean beast--such as an ass or camel, for instance, had been vowed, it
was to be appropriated to the use of the priest at the estimated value,
or it might be redeemed by the person vowing on payment of that value,
and the additional fine of a fifth more.

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord, &c.--In
this case, the house having been valued by the priest and sold, the
proceeds of the sale were to be dedicated to the sanctuary. But if the
owner wished, on second thought, to redeem it, he might have it by
adding a fifth part to the price.

[Leviticus 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 27:16</span></span>

if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some aprt of a field of his
possession, &c.--In the case of acquired property in land, if not
redeemed, it returned to the donor at the Jubilee; whereas the part of a
hereditary estate, which had been vowed, did not revert to the owner,
but remained attached in perpetuity to the sanctuary. The reason for
this remarkable difference was to lay every man under an obligation to
redeem the property, or stimulate his nearest kinsman to do it, in order
to prevent a patrimonial inheritance going out from any family in
Israel.

[Leviticus 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 27:26</span></span>

Only the firstling of the beasts--These, in the case of clean beasts,
being consecrated to God by a universal and standing law ([Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md); [Exo
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#019).md), could not be devoted; and in
that of unclean beasts, were subject to the rule mentioned ([Lev
27:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011).md).

[Leviticus 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 27:28</span></span>

no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he
hath, . . . shall be sold or redeemed--This relates to vows of the most
solemn kind--the devotee accompanying his vow with a solemn imprecation
on himself not to fail in accomplishing his declared purpose.

[Leviticus 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 27:29</span></span>

shall surely be put to death--This announcement imported not that the
person was to be sacrificed or doomed to a violent death; but only that
he should remain till death unalterably in the devoted condition. The
preceding regulations were evidently designed to prevent rashness in
vowing ([Ecc 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004).md) and to encourage
serious and considerate reflection in all matters between God and the
soul ([Luk 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#004).md).

[Leviticus 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 27:30</span></span>

all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land--This law
gave the sanction of divine authority to an ancient usage ([Gen
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020.md); [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022).md). The whole produce of the land
was subjected to the tithe tribute--it was a yearly rent which the
Israelites, as tenants, paid to God, the owner of the land, and a thank
offering they rendered to Him for the bounties of His providence. (See
[Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md); [Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md); [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006).md).

[Leviticus 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 27:32</span></span>

whatsoever passeth under the rod, &c.--This alludes to the mode of
taking the tithe of cattle, which were made to pass singly through a
narrow gateway, where a person with a rod, dipped in ochre, stood, and
counting them, marked the back of every tenth beast, whether male or
female, sound or unsound.

[Leviticus 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 27:34</span></span>

These are the commandments, &c.--The laws contained in this book, for
the most part ceremonial, had an important spiritual bearing, the study
of which is highly instructive ([Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md); [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md); [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018).md). They imposed a burdensome yoke
([Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md), but yet in the infantine
age of the Church formed the necessary discipline of "a schoolmaster to
Christ" \[[Gal 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md)\].
