DAVID SENDS FOR MEPHIBOSHETH. ([Sa2
9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001).md)

David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul--On
inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there
still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old at
his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had never
seen. His lameness ([Sa2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004).md) had
prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the time.
Besides, according to Oriental notions, the younger son of a crowned
monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son of a mere
heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the rival of his
uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being lost sight
of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his existence,
and the retired life he passed with one of the great families in
trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen dynasty.
Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal table on
public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with Eastern
monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in right of
his wife ([Num 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008).md), or been
forfeited to the crown by Ish-bosheth's rebellion ([Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008).md), was provided ([Sa2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#011.md); also [Sa2
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#028).md), for enabling Mephibosheth to
maintain an establishment suitable to his rank, and Ziba appointed
steward to manage it, on the condition of receiving one-half of the
produce in remuneration for his labor and expense, while the other
moiety was to be paid as rent to the owner of the land ([Sa2
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029).md).

Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants--The mention of his sons and
the slaves in his house was to show that Mephibosheth would be honored
with an equipage "as one of the king's sons."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 9:12</span></span>

Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micah--Whether born before
or after his residence in Jerusalem, cannot be ascertained. But through
him the name and memory of the excellent Jonathan was preserved (see
[Ch1 8:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md); [Ch1
9:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#040).md).
