### [Colossians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

[Colossians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS: INTRODUCTION: CONFIRMING EPAPHRAS' TEACHING: THE GLORIES OF
CHRIST: THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER FOR THE COLOSSIANS: HIS OWN MINISTRY OF
THE MYSTERY. (Col. 1:1-29)

by the will of God--Greek, "through," &c. (compare Note, see on [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001).md).

Timothy--(Compare Notes, see on [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md) and [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001).md). He was with Paul at the time of
writing in Rome. He had been companion of Paul in his first tour through
Phrygia, in which Colosse was. Hence the Colossians seem to have
associated him with Paul in their affections, and the apostle joins him
with himself in the address. Neither, probably, had seen the Colossian
Church (compare [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md); but had
seen, during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians, as
Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, and Apphia ([Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002).md), who when converted brought the
Gospel to their native city.

[Colossians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 1:2</span></span>

Colosse--written in the oldest manuscripts, "Colasse." As "saints"
implies union with God, so "the faithful brethren" union with Christian
men \[BENGEL\].

and the Lord Jesus Christ--supported by some oldest manuscripts omitted
by others of equal antiquity.

[Colossians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 1:3</span></span>

Thanksgiving for the "faith, hope, and love" of the Colossians. So in
the twin Epistle sent at the same time and by the same bearer, Tychicus
([Eph 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015).md).

We--I and Timothy.

and the Father--So some of the oldest manuscripts read. But others
better omit the "and," which probably crept in from [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md).

praying always for you--with thanksgiving ([Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006).md). See [Col
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004.md).

[Colossians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 1:4</span></span>

Since we heard--literally, "Having heard." The language implies that he
had only heard of, and not seen, them ([Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md). Compare [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md), where like language is used of a
Church which he had not at the time visited.

love . . . to all--the absent, as well as those present \[BENGEL\].

[Colossians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 1:5</span></span>

For--to be joined with the words immediately preceding: "The love which
ye have to all the saints because of (literally, 'on account of') the
hope," &c. The hope of eternal life will never be in us an inactive
principle but will always produce "love." This passage is abused by
Romanists, as if the hope of salvation depended upon works. A false
argument. It does not follow that our hope is founded on our works
because we are strongly stimulated to live well; since nothing is more
effectual for this purpose than the sense of God's free grace
\[CALVIN\].

laid up--a treasure laid up so as to be out of danger of being lost
([Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md). Faith, love, and hope
([Col 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004).md), comprise the sum of
Christianity. Compare [Col 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md), "the
hope of the Gospel."

in heaven--Greek, "in the heavens."

whereof ye heard before--namely, at the time when it was preached to
you.

in the word, &c.--That "hope" formed part of "the word of the truth of
the Gospel" (compare [Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md), that
is, part of the Gospel truth preached unto you.

[Colossians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 1:6</span></span>

Which is come unto you--Greek, "Which is present among you," that is,
which has come to, and remains with, you. He speaks of the word as a
living person present among them.

as it is in all the world--virtually, as it was by this time preached in
the leading parts of the then known world; potentially, as Christ's
command was that the Gospel should be preached to all nations, and not
be limited, as the law was, to the Jews ([Mat
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038.md); [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md); [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).md). However, the true reading, and
that of the oldest manuscripts, is that which omits the following "and,"
thus (the "it is" of English Version is not in the original Greek): "As
in all the world it is bringing forth fruit and growing (so the oldest
manuscripts read; English Version omits 'and growing,' without good
authority), even as it doth in you also." Then what is asserted is not
that the Gospel has been preached in all the world, but that it is
bearing fruits of righteousness, and (like a tree growing at the same
time that it is bearing fruit) growing in numbers of its converts in, or
throughout, all the world.

heard of it--rather, "heard it."

and knew--rather, "came to know"; became fully experimentally acquainted
with.

the grace of God in truth--that is, in its truth, and with true
knowledge \[ALFORD\].

[Colossians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 1:7</span></span>

As ye also learned--"Also" is omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The
insertion implied that those inserting it thought that Paul had preached
the Gospel to the Colossians as well as Epaphras, Whereas the omission
in the oldest manuscripts implies that Epaphras alone was the founder of
the Church at Colosse.

of--"from Epaphras."

dear--Greek, "beloved."

fellow servant--namely, of Christ. In [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023.md) he calls him "my fellow
prisoner." It is possible that Epaphras may have been apprehended for
his zealous labors in Asia Minor; but more probable that Paul gave him
the title; as his faithful companion in his imprisonment (compare Note,
see on [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), as to MEYER'S
conjecture).

who is for you, &c.--Translate, "who is faithful in your behalf as a
minister of Christ"; hinting that he is one not to be set aside for the
new and erroneous teachers (Col. 2:1-23). Most of the oldest manuscripts
read, "for (or 'in behalf of') US." Vulgate, however, with one of the
oldest manuscripts, supports English Version.

[Colossians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 1:8</span></span>

your love-- ([Col 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004).md); "to all the
saints."

in the Spirit--the sphere or element IN which alone true love is found;
as distinguished from the state of those "in the flesh" ([Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009).md). Yet even they needed to be
stirred up to greater love ([Col
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).md). Love is the first and chief
fruit of the Spirit ([Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022).md).

[Colossians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 1:9</span></span>

we also--on our part.

heard it-- ([Col 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004).md).

pray--Here he states what in particular he prays for; as in [Col
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md) he stated generally the fact of
his praying for them.

to desire--"to make request."

might be filled--rather, "may be filled"; a verb, often found in this
Epistle ([Col 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md), [Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017).md).

knowledge--Greek, "full and accurate knowledge." Akin to the Greek for
"knew" (see on [Col 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006).md).

of his will--as to how ye ought to walk ([Eph
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017).md); as well as chiefly that
"mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed
in Himself; that in the fulness of times He might gather together in one
all things in Christ" ([Eph 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009).md);
God's "will," whereby He eternally purposed to reconcile to Himself, and
save men by Christ, not by angels, as the false teachers in some degree
taught ([Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md) \[ESTIUS\]. There
seems to have been a want of knowledge among the Colossians;
notwithstanding their general excellencies; hence he so often dwells on
this subject ([Col 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md); [Col
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md), [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md); [Col
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005).md). On the contrary he less extols
wisdom to the Corinthians, who were puffed up with the conceit of
knowledge.

wisdom--often mentioned in this Epistle, as opposed to the (false)
"philosophy" and "show of wisdom" ([Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md); compare [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).md).

understanding--sagacity to discern what on each occasion is suited to
the place and the time; its seat is "the understanding" or intellect;
wisdom is more general and has its seat in the whole compass of the
faculties of the soul \[BENGEL\]. "Wouldst thou know that the matters in
the word of Christ are real things? Then never read them for mere
knowledge sake" \[Quoted by GAUSSEN.\] Knowledge is desirable only when
seasoned by "spiritual understanding."

[Colossians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 1:10</span></span>

Greek, "So as to walk"; so that ye may walk. True knowledge of God's
will is inseparable from walking conformably to it.

worthy of the Lord-- ([Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001).md).

unto--so as in every way to be well-pleasing to God.

pleasing--literally, "desire of pleasing."

being fruitful--Greek, "bearing fruit." This is the first manifestation
of their "walking worthy of the Lord." The second is, "increasing
(growing) in the knowledge of God (or as the oldest manuscripts read,
'growing BY the full knowledge of God')"; thus, as the Gospel word ([Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006).md) was said to "bring forth fruit,"
and to "grow" in all the world, even as it did in the Colossians, ever
since the day they knew the grace of God, so here it is Paul's prayer
that they might continue to "bring forth fruit," and "grow" more and
more by the full knowledge of God, the more that "knowledge" ([Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009).md) was imparted to them. The full
knowledge of God is the real instrument of enlargement in soul and life
of the believer \[ALFORD\]. The third manifestation of their walk is
([Col 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011).md), "Being strengthened with
all might," &c. The fourth is ([Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012).md), "Giving thanks unto the
Father," &c.

[Colossians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 1:11</span></span>

Greek, "Being made mighty with (literally, 'in') all might."

according to his glorious power--rather, "according to the power (the
characteristic of 'His glory,' here appropriate to Paul's argument, [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md); [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md); as its exuberant 'riches,' in
[Eph 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016).md) of His glory." His power is
inseparable from His glory ([Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004).md).

unto all patience--so as to attain to all patient endurance;
persevering, enduring continuance in the faith, in spite of trials of
persecutors, and seductions of false teachers.

long-suffering--towards those whom one could repel. "Patience," or
"endurance," is exercised in respect to those whom one cannot repel
\[CHRYSOSTOM\].

with joyfulness--joyful endurance ([Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md); [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md), [Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011).md).

[Colossians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 1:12</span></span>

You "giving thanks unto the Father." See on [Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md); this clause is connected with
"that ye may be filled" ([Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009).md),
and "that ye may walk" ([Col 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010).md).
The connection is not, "We do not cease to pray for you ([Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009).md) giving thanks."

unto the Father--of Jesus Christ, and so our Father by adoption ([Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026.md); [Gal
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md).

which hath made us meet--Greek, "who made us meet." Not "is making us
meet" by progressive growth in holiness; but once for all made us meet.
It is not primarily the Spirit's work that is meant here, as the text is
often used; but the Father's work in putting us by adoption, once for
all, in a new standing, namely, that of children. The believers meant
here were in different stages of progressive sanctification; but in
respect to the meetness specified here, they all alike had it from the
Father, in Christ His Son, being "complete in Him" ([Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010).md). Compare [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md), "sanctified by God the Father";
[Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md). Still, secondarily, this
once-for-all meetness contains in it the germ of sanctification,
afterwards developed progressively in the life by the Father's Spirit in
the believer. The Christian life of heavenliness is the first stage of
heaven itself. There must, and will be, a personal meetness for heaven,
where there is a judicial meetness.

to be partakers, &c.--Greek, "for the (or 'our') portion of the
inheritance ([Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md); [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md); [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md) of the saints in light." "Light"
begins in the believer here, descending from "the Father of lights" by
Jesus, "the true light," and is perfected in the kingdom of light, which
includes knowledge, purity, love, and joy. It is contrasted here with
the "darkness" of the unconverted state ([Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md); compare [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md).

[Colossians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 1:13</span></span>

from--Greek, "out of the power," out of the sphere in which his power is
exercised.

darkness--blindness, hatred, misery \[BENGEL\].

translated--Those thus translated as to state, are also transformed as
to character. Satan has an organized dominion with various orders of
powers of evil ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).md). But the term "kingdom" is
rarely applied to his usurped rule ([Mat
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026).md); it is generally restricted to
the kingdom of God.

his dear Son--rather as Greek, "the Son of His love": the Son on whom
His love rests ([Joh 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md); [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).md): contrasted with the "darkness"
where all is hatred and hateful.

[Colossians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 1:14</span></span>

([Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007)..md)

redemption--rather as Greek, "our redemption."

through his blood--omitted in the oldest manuscripts; probably inserted
from [Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md).

sins--Translate as Greek, "our sins." The more general term: for which
[Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md), Greek, has, "our
transgressions," the more special term.

[Colossians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 1:15</span></span>

They who have experienced in themselves "redemption" ([Col
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014).md), know Christ in the glorious
character here described, as above the highest angels to whom the false
teachers ([Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md) taught worship
was to be paid. Paul describes Him: (1) in relation to God and creation
([Col 1:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)); (2.md) in relation to the
Church ([Col 1:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018).md). As the former
regards Him as the Creator ([Col
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md) and the Sustainer ([Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017).md) of the natural world; so the
latter, as the source and stay of the new moral creation.

image--exact likeness and perfect Representative. Adam was made "in the
image of God" ([Gen 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md). But Christ,
the second Adam, perfectly reflected visibly "the invisible God" ([Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md), whose glories the first Adam
only in part represented. "Image" (eicon) involves "likeness"
(homoiosis); but "likeness" does not involve "image." "Image" always
supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it
is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the
water: the child the living image of the parent. "Likeness" implies mere
resemblance, not the exact counterpart and derivation as "image"
expresses; hence it is nowhere applied to the Son, while "image" is
here, compare [Co1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007.md) \[TRENCH\].
([Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md). Even before His incarnation He
was the image of the invisible God, as the Word ([Joh
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md) by whom God created the worlds,
and by whom God appeared to the patriarchs. Thus His essential character
as always "the image of God," (1) before the incarnation, (2) in the
days of His flesh, and (3) now in His glorified state, is, I think,
contemplated here by the verb "is."

first-born of every creature-- ([Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md), "the first-begotten": "begotten
of His Father before all worlds" \[Nicene Creed\]. Priority and
superlative dignity is implied ([Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027).md). English Version might seem to
favor Arianism, as if Christ were a creature. Translate, "Begotten
(literally, 'born') before every creature," as the context shows, which
gives the reason why He is so designated. "For," &c. ([Col
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md) \[TRENCH\]. This expression
is understood by ORIGEN (so far is the Greek from favoring Socinian or
Arian views) as declaring the Godhead of Christ, and is used by Him as a
phrase to mark that Godhead, in contrast with His manhood \[Book 2, sec.
Against Celsus\]. The Greek does not strictly admit ALFORD'S
translation, "the first-born of all creation."

[Colossians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 1:16</span></span>

For--Greek, "Because." This gives the proof that He is not included in
the things created, but is the "first-begotten" before "every creature"
([Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md), begotten as "the Son of
God's love" ([Col 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013).md), antecedently
to all other emanations: "for" all these other emanations came from Him,
and whatever was created, was created by Him.

by him--rather as Greek, "in Him": as the conditional element,
pre-existent and all-including: the creation of all things BY Him is
expressed afterwards, and is a different fact from the present one,
though implied in it \[ALFORD\]. God revealed Himself in the Son, the
Word of the Father, before all created existence ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md). That Divine Word carries IN
Himself the archetypes of all existences, so that "IN Him all things
that are in heaven and earth have been created." The "in Him" indicates
that the Word is the ideal ground of all existence; the "by Him," below,
that He is the instrument of actually realizing the divine idea
\[NEANDER\]. His essential nature as the Word of the Father is not a
mere appendage of His incarnation, but is the ground of it. The original
relation of the Eternal Word to men "made in His image" ([Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).md), is the source of the new
relation to them by redemption, formed in His incarnation, whereby He
restores them to His lost image. "In Him" implies something prior to
"by" and "for Him" presently after: the three prepositions mark in
succession the beginning, the progress, and the end \[BENGEL\].

all things--Greek, "the universe of things." That the new creation is
not meant in this verse (as Socinians interpret), is plain; for angels,
who are included in the catalogue, were not new created by Christ; and
he does not speak of the new creation till [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md). The creation "of the things that
are in the heavens" (so Greek) includes the creation of the heavens
themselves: the former are rather named, since the inhabitants are more
noble than their dwellings. Heaven and earth and all that is m them
([Ch1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011.md); [Neh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md); [Rev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006).md).

invisible--the world of spirits.

thrones, or dominions--lordships: the thrones are the greater of the
two.

principalities, or powers--rather, "rules, or authorities": the former
are stronger than the latter (compare Note, see on [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021).md). The latter pair refer to
offices in respect to God's creatures: "thrones and dominions" express
exalted relation to God, they being the chariots on which He rides
displaying His glory ([Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017).md). The
existence of various orders of angels is established by this passage.

all things--Greek, "the whole universe of things."

were--rather, to distinguish the Greek aorist, which precedes from the
perfect tense here, "have been created." In the former case the creation
was viewed as a past act at a point of time, or as done once for all;
here it is viewed, not merely as one historic act of creation in the
past, but as the permanent result now and eternally continuing.

by him--as the instrumental Agent ([Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).md).

for him--as the grand End of creation; containing in Himself the reason
why creation is at all, and why it is as it is \[ALFORD\]. He is the
final cause as well as the efficient cause. LACHMANN'S punctuation of
[Col 1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md) is best, whereby "the
first-born of every creature" ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md) answers to "the first-born from
the dead" ([Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018).md), the whole
forming one sentence with the words ("All things were created by Him and
for Him, and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist, and
He is the Head of the body, the Church") intervening as a parenthesis.
Thus Paul puts first, the origination by Him of the natural creation;
secondly, of the new creation. The parenthesis falls into four clauses,
two and two: the former two support the first assertion, "the first-born
of every creature"; the latter two prepare us for "the first-born from
the dead"'; the former two correspond to the latter two in their
form--"All things by Him . . . and He is," and "By Him all things . . .
and He is."

He Himself (the great HE) is (implying divine essential being) before

maintained in their present state. The Son of God is the Conserver, as
well as the Creator of all things \[PEARSON\]. BENGEL less probably
explains, "All things in Him come together into one system: the universe
found its completion in Him" ([Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013).md). Compare as to GOD, [Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md) : similar language; therefore
Christ must be God.

concerning angel-worship, and the power of Oeons or (imaginary) spirit
emanations from God ([Col 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md), [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md).

head of the body, the church--The Church is His body by virtue of His
entering into communion corporeally with human nature \[NEANDER\], ([Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022).md). The same One who is the Head of
all things and beings by creation, is also, by virtue of being "the
first-born from the dead," and so "the first-fruits" of the new creation
among men, the Head of the Church.

who is--that is, in that He is the Beginning \[ALFORD\]. Rather, this is
the beginning of a new paragraph. As the former paragraph, which related
to His originating the physical creation, began with "Who is" ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md); so this, which treats of His
originating the new creation, begins with "who is"; a parenthesis
preceding, which closes the former paragraph, that parenthesis (see on
[Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md), including from "all things
were created by Him," to "Head of the body, the Church." The head of
kings and high priests was anointed, as the seat of the faculties, the
fountain of dignity, and original of all the members (according to
Hebrew etymology). So Jesus by His unction was designated as the Head of
the body, the Church.

the beginning--namely, of the new creation, as of the old ([Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md); [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); compare [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008).md): the beginning of the Church of
the first-born ([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023).md), as being
Himself the "first-born from the dead" ([Act
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023.md); [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023).md). Christ's primogeniture is
threefold: (1) From eternity the "first-begotten" of the Father ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)); (2.md) As the first-born of His
mother ([Mat 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)); (3.md) As the Head of
the Church, mystically begotten of the Father, as it were to a new life,
on the day of His resurrection, which is His "regeneration," even as His
people's coming resurrection will be their "regeneration" (that is, the
resurrection which was begun in the soul, extended to the body and to
the whole creation, [Rom 8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md)
([Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md); [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005).md). Sonship and resurrection are
similarly connected ([Luk 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). Christ by rising from the dead
is the efficient cause ([Co1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022).md),
as having obtained the power, and the exemplary cause, as being the
pattern ([Mic 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md); [Rom
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005.md); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).md), of our resurrection: the
resurrection of "the Head" involves consequentially that of the members.

One holding the first place," or, "take the precedency." Both ideas are
included, priority in time and priority in dignity: now in the
regenerated world, as before in the world of creation ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md). "Begotten before every

all fulness--rather as Greek, "all the fulness," namely, of God,
whatever divine excellence is in God the Father ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md); [Eph

1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md). The Gnostics used the term
"fulness," for the assemblage of emanations, or angelic powers, coming
from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul warns the Church, that the true
"fulness" dwells in Christ alone. This assigns the reason why Christ
takes precedence of every creature ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md). For two reasons Christ is Lord
of the Church: (1) Because the fulness of the divine attributes ([Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019).md) dwells in Him, and so He has the
power to govern the universe; (2) Because ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md) what He has done for the Church
gives Him the right to preside over it.

should . . . dwell--as in a temple ([Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021).md). This indwelling of the Godhead
in Christ is the foundation of the reconciliation by Him \[BENGEL\].
Hence the "and" ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md) connects
as cause and effect the two things, the Godhead in Christ, and the
reconciliation by Christ.

[Colossians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 1:20</span></span>

The Greek order is, "And through Him (Christ) to reconcile again
completely (see on [Eph 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016).md) all
things (Greek, 'the whole universe of things') unto Himself (unto God
the Father, [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019).md), having made
peace (God the Father having made peace) through the blood of His
(Christ's) cross," that is, shed by Christ on the cross: the price and
pledge of our reconciliation with God. The Scripture phrase, "God
reconciles man to Himself," implies that He takes away by the blood of
Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in
union with God (compare Note, see on [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010.md); [Co2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018).md). So the Septuagint, [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md), "Wherewith should he reconcile
himself unto his master," that is, reconcile his master unto him by
appeasing his wrath. So [Mat 5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md).

by him--"through Him" (the instrumental agent in the new creation, as in
the original creation): emphatically repeated, to bring the person of
Christ, as the Head of both creations alike, into prominence.

things in earth . . . in heaven--Good angels, in one sense, do not need
reconciliation to God; fallen angels are excluded from it ([Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006).md). But probably redemption has
effects on the world of spirits unknown to us. Of course, His
reconciling us, and His reconciling them, must be by a different
process, as He took not on Him the nature of angels, so as to offer a
propitiation for them. But the effect of redemption on them, as He is
their Head as well as ours, is that they are thereby brought nearer God,
and so gain an increase of blessedness \[ALFORD\], and larger views of
the love and wisdom of God ([Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010).md). All creation subsists in
Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful
creation is strictly "reconciled" from its enmity; sinless creation,
comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity ([Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018.md); [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md); [Job
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005).md), is lifted into nearer
participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled. Doubtless,
too, man's fall, following on Satan's fall, is a segment of a larger
circle of evil, so that the remedy of the former affects the standing of
angels, from among whom Satan and his host fell. Angels thereby having
seen the magnitude of sin, and the infinite cost of redemption, and the
exclusion of the fallen angels from it, and the inability of any
creature to stand morally in his own strength, are now put beyond the
reach of falling. Thus BACON'S definition of Christ's Headship holds
good: "The Head of redemption to man; the Head of preservation to
angels." Some conjecture that Satan, when unfallen, ruled this earth and
the pre-Adamic animal kingdom: hence his malice against man who
succeeded to the lordship of this earth and its animals, and hence, too,
his assumption of the form of a serpent, the subtlest of the animal
tribes. [Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md) states expressly
"peace in heaven" as the result of finished redemption, as "peace on
earth" was the result of its beginning at Jesus' birth ([Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014).md). BENGEL explains the
reconciliation to be that of not only God, but also angels, estranged
from men because of man's enmity against God. [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md) accords with this: This is true,
but only part of the truth: so ALFORD'S view also is but part of the
truth. An actual reconciliation or restoration of peace in heaven, as
well as on earth, is expressed by Paul. As long as that blood of
reconciliation was not actually shed, which is opposed ([Zac
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008).md) to the accusations of Satan,
but was only in promise, Satan could plead his right against men before
God day and night ([Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md); [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010).md); hence he was in heaven till
the ban on man was broken (compare [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).md). So here; the world of earth
and heaven owe to Christ alone the restoration of harmony after the
conflict and the subjugation of all things under one Head (compare [Heb
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023).md). Sin introduced discord not
only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought
into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss,
a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious
gradation, and perfect consummation. Angels were no more able than men
by themselves to overcome the peace disturbers, and cast out the devils;
it is only "by," or "through HIM," and "the blood of HIS cross," that
peace was restored even in heaven; it is only after Christ has obtained
the victory fully and legally, that Michael ([Rev
12:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007).md) and his angels can cast out
of heaven Satan and his demons (compare [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md). Thus the point of Paul's
argument against angel-worship is, that angels themselves, like men,
wholly depend on Christ, the sole and true object of worship
\[AUBERLEN\].

The Colossians are included in this general reconciliation (compare [Eph

sometime--"once."

alienated--from God and salvation: objectively banished from God,
through the barrier which God's justice interposed against your sin:
subjectively estranged through the alienation of your own wills from
God. The former is the prominent thought (compare [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010).md), as the second follows, "enemies
in your mind." "Actual alienation makes habitual 'enemies'" \[BENGEL\].

in your mind--Greek, "in your understanding" or "thought" ([Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018).md).

by wicked works--rather as Greek, "in your wicked works" (wicked works
were the element in which your enmity subsisted).

yet now--Notwithstanding the former alienation, now that Christ has
come, God hath completely reconciled, or restored to His friendship
again (so the Greek, compare Note, see on [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md).

[Colossians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 1:22</span></span>

In the body of his flesh--the element in which His reconciling
sufferings had place. Compare [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md), "afflictions of Christ in my
flesh" ([Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md). Angels who have
not a "body of flesh" are not in any way our reconciling mediators, as
your false teachers assert, but He, the Lord of angels, who has taken
our flesh, that in it He might atone for our fallen manhood.

through death--rather as Greek, "through His death" (which could only
take place in a body like ours, of flesh, [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).md). This implies He took on Him our
true and entire manhood. Flesh is the sphere in which His human
sufferings could have place (compare [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md); [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).md).

to present you-- ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027).md). The end
of His reconciling atonement by death.

holy--positively; and in relation to God.

unblamable . . . unreprovable--negatively. "Without blemish" (as the
former Greek word is translated as to Jesus, our Head, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019).md) in one's self. Irreproachable
(the Greek for the second word, one who gives no occasion for his being
brought to a law court) is in relation to the world without.
Sanctification, as the fruit, is here treated of; justification, by
Christ's reconciliation, as the tree, having preceded ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); [Eph
5:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014).md). At the same time, our
sanctification is regarded here as perfect in Christ, into whom we are
grafted at regeneration or conversion, and who is "made of God unto us
(perfect) sanctification" ([Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md);
[Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md); [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001).md): not merely progressive
sanctification, which is the gradual development of the sanctification
which Christ is made to the believer from the first.

in his sight--in God's sight, at Christ's appearing.

If--"Assuming that," &c.: not otherwise shall ye be so presented at His
appearing ([Col 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022).md).

grounded--Greek, "founded," "fixed on the foundation" (compare Note, see
on [Eph 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md); [Luk
6:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#048).md).

settled--"steadfast." "Grounded" respects the foundation on which
believers rest; "settled," their own steadfastness ([Pe1

not moved away--by the false teachers.

the hope of the gospel-- ([Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018).md).

which ye have heard . . . which was preached to every creature . . .
whereof I . . . am . . . a minister--Three arguments against their being
"moved away from the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The
universality of the preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For "to
(Greek, 'in') every creature," the oldest manuscripts read, "in all
creation." Compare "in all the world," [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md); "all things . . . in earth," [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md) ([Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015).md): thus he implies that the
Gospel from which he urges them not to be moved, has this mark of truth,
namely, the universality of its announcement, which accords with the
command and prophecy of Christ Himself ([Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014).md). By "was preached," he means
not merely "is being preached," but has been actually, as an
accomplished fact, preached. PLINY, not many years subsequently, in his
famous letter to the Emperor Trajan \[Epistles, Book X., Epistle 97\],
writes, "Many of every age, rank, and sex, are being brought to trial.
For the contagion of that superstition \[Christianity\] has spread over
not only cities, but villages and the country."

whereof I Paul am--rather as Greek, "was made a minister." Respect for
me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, should lead you not to be
moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the Gospel which ye heard from
Epaphras, your "minister" ([Col 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007).md),
is the same of which "I was made a minister" ([Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007).md): if you be moved from it, ye will
desert the teaching of the recognized ministers of the Gospel for
unauthorized false teachers.

[Colossians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">col 1:24</span></span>

Who--The oldest manuscripts omit "who"; then translate, "Now I rejoice."
Some very old manuscripts, and the best of the Latin versions, and
Vulgate, read as English Version. To enhance the glory of Christ as
paramount to all, he mentions his own sufferings for the Church of
Christ. "Now" stands in contrast to "I was made," in the past time ([Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023).md).

for you--"on your behalf," that ye may be confirmed in resting solely on
Christ (to the exclusion of angel-worship) by the glorification of
Christ in my sufferings ([Eph 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001).md).

fill up that which is behind--literally, "the deficiencies"--all that
are lacking of the afflictions of Christ (compare Note, see on [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005).md). Christ is "afflicted in all His
people's afflictions" ([Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009).md).
"The Church is His body in which He is, dwells, lives, and therefore
also suffers" \[VITRINGA\]. Christ was destined to endure certain
afflictions in this figurative body, as well as in His literal; these
were "that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ," which Paul
"filled up." His own meritorious sufferings in expiation for sin were
once for all completely filled up on the Cross. But His Church (His
second Self) has her whole measure of afflictions fixed. The more Paul,
a member, endured, the less remain for the rest of the Church to endure;
the communion of saints thus giving them an interest in his sufferings.
It is in reference to the Church's afflictions, which are "Christ's
afflictions, that Paul here saith, "I fill up the deficiencies," or
"what remain behind of the afflictions of Christ." She is afflicted to
promote her growth in holiness, and her completeness in Christ. Not one
suffering is lost ([Psa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008).md). All her
members have thus a mutual interest in one another's sufferings ([Co1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026).md). But Rome's inference hence, is
utterly false that the Church has a stock treasury of the merits and
satisfactions of Christ and His apostles, out of which she may dispense
indulgences; the context has no reference to sufferings in expiation of
sin and productive of merit. Believers should regard their sufferings
less in relation to themselves as individuals, and more as parts of a
grand whole, carrying out God's perfect plan.

of Christ ([Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019).md), and of the
times ([Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md) required him so to
do" \[BENGEL\].

[Colossians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md)

the mystery--(See on [Eph 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005).md). The mystery, once hidden, now
revealed, is redemption for the whole Gentile world, as well as for the
Jews, "Christ in you (Gentiles) the hope of glory" ([Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).md).

from ages--"from," according to ALFORD, refers to time, not "hidden
from": from the time of the ages; still what is meant is that the
mystery was hidden from the beings living in those "ages." The "ages"
are the vast successive periods marked by successive orders of beings
and stages of creation. Greek, "Ã†ons," a word used by the Gnostics for
angelic beings emanating from God. The Spirit by Paul presciently, in
opposition to Gnostic error already beginning ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md), teaches, that the mystery of
redemption was hidden in God's purposes in Christ, alike from the
angelic beings (compare [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010).md) of
the pre-Adamic "ages," and from the subsequent human "generations."
Translate as Greek, "the ages . . . the generations."

made manifest to his saints--to His apostles and prophets primarily
([Eph 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005).md), and through them to all
His saints.

[Colossians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">col 1:27</span></span>

would--rather as Greek, "willed," or "was pleased to make known." He
resolves all into God's good pleasure and will, that man should not
glory save in God's grace.

what--How full and inexhaustible!

the riches of the glory of this mystery--He accumulates phrase on phrase
to enhance the greatness of the blessing in Christ bestowed by God on
the Gentiles. Compare [Col 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md), "all
the treasures" of wisdom; [Eph 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md),
"the unsearchable riches of Christ"; [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md), "riches of His grace." "The glory
of this mystery" must be the glory which this once hidden, and now
revealed, truth makes you Gentiles partakers of, partly now, but mainly
when Christ shall come ([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md); [Rom
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018).md). This sense is proved by the
following: "Christ in you the hope of the (so Greek) glory." The lower
was the degradation of you Gentiles, the higher is the richness of the
glory to which the mystery revealed now raises you. You were "without
Christ, and having no hope" ([Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md). Now you have "Christ in you the
hope of the glory" just mentioned. ALFORD translates, "Christ among
you," to answer to "this mystery among the Gentiles." But the whole
clause, "Christ IN you ([Eph 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017).md) the
hope of glory," answers to "this mystery," and not to the whole
sentence, "this mystery among the Gentiles." What is made known "among
you Gentiles" is, "Christ in you (now by faith as your hidden life, [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md) the hope of glory" (your
manifested life). The contrast (antithesis) between "CHRIST IN YOU" now
as your hidden life, and "the hope of glory" hereafter to be manifested,
requires this translation.

[Colossians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">col 1:28</span></span>

preach--rather as Greek, "announce" or "proclaim."

warning . . . teaching--"Warning" is connected with repentance, refers
to one's conduct, and is addressed primarily to the heart. "Teaching" is
connected with faith, refers to doctrines, and is addressed primarily to
the intellect. These are the two heads of evangelical teaching.

every . . . every man--without distinction of Jew or Gentile, great or
small ([Rom 10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012).md).

in all wisdom--with all the wisdom in our method of teaching that we
possess: so ALFORD. But [Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md), favor ESTIUS' view, which refers
it to the wisdom communicated to those being taught: keeping back
nothing, but instructing all in the perfect knowledge of the mysteries
of faith which is the true wisdom (compare [Co1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); [Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md); [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017).md).

present--(See on [Col 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022).md); at
Christ's coming.

every man--Paul is zealous lest the false teachers should seduce one
single soul of Christ's people at Colosse. So each individual among them
should be zealous for himself and his neighbor. Even one soul is of
incalculable value.

perfect in Christ--who is the element in living union with whom alone
each believer can find perfection: perfectly instructed ([Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013).md) in doctrine, and full grown or
matured in faith and practice. "Jesus" is omitted in all the oldest
manuscripts.

[Colossians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">col 1:29</span></span>

Whereunto--namely, "to present every man perfect in Christ."

I also labour--rather, "I labor also." I not only "proclaim" (English
Version, "preach") Christ, but I labor also.

striving--in "conflict" ([Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md) of
spirit (compare [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md). The same
Greek word is used of Epaphras ([Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012).md), "laboring fervently for you in
prayers": literally, "agonizing," "striving as in the agony of a
contest." So Jesus in Gethsemane when praying ([Luk
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044).md): so "strive" (the same Greek
word, "agonize"), [Luk 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024.md). So Jacob
"wrestled" in prayer ([Gen 32:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).md).
Compare "contention," Greek, "agony," or "striving earnestness," [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md).

according to his working--Paul avows that he has power to "strive" in
spirit for his converts, so far only as Christ works in him and by him
([Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013).md).

mightily--literally, "in power."
