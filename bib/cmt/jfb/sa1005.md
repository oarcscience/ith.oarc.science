### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 5:1</span></span>

THE PHILISTINES BRING THE ARK INTO THE HOUSE OF DAGON. ([Sa1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001).md)

Ashdod--or Azotus, one of the five Philistine satrapies, and a place of
great strength. It was an inland town, thirty-four miles north of Gaza,
now called Esdud.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 5:2</span></span>

the house of Dagon--Stately temples were erected in honor of this idol,
which was the principal deity of the Philistines, but whose worship
extended over all Syria, as well as Mesopotamia and Chaldea; its name
being found among the Assyrian gods on the cuneiform inscriptions
\[RAWLINSON\]. It was represented under a monstrous combination of a
human head, breast, and arms, joined to the belly and tail of a fish.
The captured ark was placed in the temple of Dagon, right before this
image of the idol.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 5:3</span></span>

DAGON FALLS DOWN. ([Sa1 5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003).md)

they of Ashdod arose early--They were filled with consternation when
they found the object of their stupid veneration prostrate before the
symbol of the divine presence. Though set up, it fell again, and lay in
a state of complete mutilation; its head and arms, severed from the
trunk, were lying in distant and separate places, as if violently cast
off, and only the fishy part remained. The degradation of their idol,
though concealed by the priests on the former occasion, was now more
manifest and infamous. It lay in the attitude of a vanquished enemy and
a suppliant, and this picture of humiliation significantly declared the
superiority of the God of Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 5:5</span></span>

Therefore neither the priests . . . nor any . . . tread on the threshold
of Dagon--A superstitious ceremony crept in, and in the providence of
God was continued, by which the Philistines contributed to publish this
proof of the helplessness of their god.

unto this day--The usage continued in practice at the time when this
history was written--probably in the later years of Samuel's life.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 5:6</span></span>

THE PHILISTINES ARE SMITTEN WITH EMERODS. ([Sa1
5:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006).md)

the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod--The presumption of
the Ashdodites was punished by a severe judgment that overtook them in
the form of a pestilence.

smote them with emerods--bleeding piles, hemorrhoids ([Psa
78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066).md), in a very aggravated form. As
the heathens generally regarded diseases affecting the secret parts of
the body as punishments from the gods for trespasses committed against
themselves, the Ashdodites would be the more ready to look upon the
prevailing epidemic as demonstrating the anger of God, already shown
against their idol.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 5:7</span></span>

the ark of God shall not abide with us--It was removed successively to
several of the large towns of the country, but the same pestilence broke
out in every place and raged so fiercely and fatally that the
authorities were forced to send the ark back into the land of Israel
\[[Sa1 5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md)\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 5:11</span></span>

they sent--that is, the magistrates of Ekron.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 5:12</span></span>

the cry of the city went up to heaven--The disease is attended with
acute pain, and it is far from being a rare phenomenon in the Philistian
plain \[VAN DE VELDE\].
