[Ezekiel 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#002)

CONTINUATION OF THE ORDINANCES FOR THE PRINCE AND FOR THE PEOPLE IN
THEIR WORSHIP. (Eze. 46:1-24)

The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath
only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the
inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare
[Kg1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014), [Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022), Solomon standing before the
altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also [Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014); [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003), "by a pillar": the customary
place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as
representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he
is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the
people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance.
The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to
imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and
people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than
formerly.

[Ezekiel 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 46:9</span></span>

The worshippers were on the great feasts to pass from one side to the
other, through the temple courts, in order that, in such a throng as
should attend the festivals, the ingress and egress should be the more
unimpeded, those going out not being in the way of those coming in.

[Ezekiel 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 46:10</span></span>

prince in the midst--not isolated as at other times, but joining the
great throng of worshippers, at their head, after the example of David
([Psa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004), "I had gone with the
multitude . . . to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise,
with a multitude that kept holy day"); the highest in rank animating the
devotions of the rest by his presence and example.

[Ezekiel 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 46:12</span></span>

Not only is he to perform official acts of worship on holy days and
feasts, but in "voluntary" offerings daily he is to show his individual
zeal, surpassing all his people in liberality, and so setting them a
princely example.

[Ezekiel 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 46:16</span></span>

The prince's possession is to be inalienable, and any portion given to a
servant is to revert to his sons at the year of jubilee, that he may
have no temptation to spoil his people of their inheritance, as formerly
(compare Ahab and Naboth, 1Ki. 21:1-29). The mention of the year of
jubilee implies that there is something literal meant, besides the
spiritual sense. The jubilee year was restored after the captivity
\[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 14.10,6; 1 Maccabees 6:49\]. Perhaps it will be
restored under Messiah's coming reign. Compare [Isa
61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002), where "the acceptable year of
the Lord" is closely connected with the comforting of the mourners in
Zion, and "the day of vengeance" on Zion's foes. The mention of the
prince's sons is another argument against Messiah being meant by "the
prince."

[Ezekiel 46:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 46:19</span></span>

Due regard is to be had for the sanctity of the officiating priests'
food, by cooking courts being provided close to their chambers. One set
of apartments for cooking was to be at the corners of the inner court,
reserved for the flesh of the sin offerings, to be eaten only by the
priests whose perquisite it was ([Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025); [Lev
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007)), before coming forth to mingle
again with the people; another set at the corners of the outer court,
for cooking the flesh of the peace offerings, of which the people
partook along with the priests. All this implies that no longer are the
common and unclean to be confounded with the sacred and divine, but that
in even the least things, as eating and drinking, the glory of God is to
be the aim ([Co1 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031)).

[Ezekiel 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 46:22</span></span>

courts joined--FAIRBAIRN translates, "roofed" or "vaulted." But these
cooking apartments seem to have been uncovered, to let the smoke and
smell of the meat the more easily pass away. They were "joined" or
"attached" to the walls of the courts at the corners of the latter
\[MENOCHIUS\].

[Ezekiel 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 46:23</span></span>

boiling places--boilers.

under the rows--At the foot of the rows, that is, in the lowest part of
the walls, were the places for boiling made.

The happy fruit to the earth at large of God's dwelling with Israel in
holy fellowship is that the blessing is no longer restricted to the one
people and locality, but is to be diffused with comprehensive
catholicity through the whole world. So the plant from the cedar of
Lebanon is represented as gathering under its shelter "all fowl of every
wing" ([Eze 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023)). Even the desert
places of the earth shall be made fruitful by the healing waters of the
Gospel (compare [Isa 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001)).
