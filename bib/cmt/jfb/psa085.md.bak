### [Psalms Chapter 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 85:1</span></span>

On the ground of former mercies, the Psalmist prays for renewed
blessings, and, confidently expecting them, rejoices. ([Psa
85:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001).md)

captivity--not necessarily the Babylonian, but any great evil ([Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 85:2</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 85:3</span></span>

To turn from the "fierceness," implies that He was reconcilable, though

[Psalms 85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 85:4</span></span>

having still occasion for the anger which is deprecated.

[Psalms 85:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 85:5</span></span>

draw out--or, "prolong" ([Psa 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 85:8</span></span>

He is confident God will favor His penitent people ([Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md); [Psa
80:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#018).md).

saints--as in [Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md), the "godly."

[Psalms 85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 85:9</span></span>

They are here termed "them that fear him"; and grace produces glory
([Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 85:10</span></span>

God's promises of "mercy" will be verified by His "truth" (compare [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md); [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010).md); and the "work of
righteousness" in His holy government shall be "peace" ([Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017).md). There is an implied contrast
with a dispensation under which God's truth sustains His threatened
wrath, and His righteousness inflicts misery on the wicked.

[Psalms 85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 85:11</span></span>

Earth and heaven shall abound with the blessings of this government;

[Psalms 85:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 85:12</span></span>

and, under this, the deserted land shall be productive, and men be
"set," or guided in God's holy ways. Doubtless, in this description of
God's returning favor, the writer had in view that more glorious period,
when Christ shall establish His government on God's reconciled justice
and abounding mercy.
