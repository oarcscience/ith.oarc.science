### [Amos Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

[Amos](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">amo 0:0</span></span>

AMOS (meaning in Hebrew "a burden") was ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001).md) a shepherd of Tekoa, a small town
of Judah, six miles southeast from Beth-lehem, and twelve from
Jerusalem, on the borders of the great desert ([Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md); compare [Ch2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006).md). The region being sandy was more
fit for pastoral than for agricultural purposes. Amos therefore owned
and tended flocks, and collected sycamore figs; not that the former was
a menial office, kings themselves, as Mesha of Moab ([Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004).md), exercising it. Amos, however
(from [Amo 7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014).md), seems to have
been of humble rank.

Though belonging to Judah, he was commissioned by God to exercise his
prophetical function in Israel; as the latter kingdom abounded in
impostors, and the prophets of God generally fled to Judah through fear
of the kings of Israel, a true prophet from Judah was the more needed in
it. His name is not to be confounded with that of Isaiah's father, Amoz.

The time of his prophesying was in the reigns of Uzziah king of Judea,
and Jeroboam II, son of Joash, king of Israel ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001).md), that is, in part of the time in
which the two kings were contemporary; probably in Jeroboam's latter
years, after that monarch had recovered from Syria "the coast of Israel
from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain" ([Kg2
14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md); for Amos foretells that
these same coasts, "from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the
wilderness," should be the scene of Israel's being afflicted ([Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014).md); also his references to the
state of luxurious security then existing ([Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), [Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md), [Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013).md), and to the speedy termination
of it by the Assyrian foe ([Amo 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md);
[Amo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012.md), [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015.md); [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md); [Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002).md), point to the latter part of
Jeroboam's reign, which terminated in 784 B.C., the twenty-seventh year
of Uzziah's reign, which continued down to 759 B.C. He was contemporary
with Hosea, only that the latter continued to prophesy in reigns
subsequent to Uzziah ([Hos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md);
whereas Amos ceased to prophesy in the reign of that monarch. The scene
of his ministry was Beth-el, where the idol calves were set up ([Amo
7:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010).md). There his prophecies roused
Amaziah, the idol priest, to accuse him of conspiracy and to try to
drive him back to Judah.

The first six chapters are without figure; the last three symbolical,
but with the explanation subjoined. He first denounces the neighboring
peoples, then the Jews, then Israel (from the third chapter to the end),
closing with the promise or restoration under Messiah ([Amo
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md). His style is thought by
JEROME to betray his humble origin; but though not sublime, it is
regular, perspicuous, and energetic; his images are taken from the
scenes in nature with which he was familiar; his rhythms are flowing,
his parallelisms exact, and his descriptions minute and graphic. Some
peculiar expressions occur: "cleanness of teeth," that is, want of bread
([Amo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006).md); "the excellency of Jacob"
([Amo 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md); [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007).md); "the high places of Isaac" ([Amo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009).md); "the house of Isaac" ([Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016).md); "he that createth the wind"
([Amo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013).md).

HENGSTENBERG draws an able argument for the genuineness of the Mosaic
records from the evidence in Amos, that the existing institutions in
Israel as well as Judah (excepting the calves of Jeroboam), were framed
according to the Pentateuch rules.

Two quotations from Amos occur in the New Testament (compare [Act
7:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md), with [Amo
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md); and [Act
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md), with [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md).

PHILO, JOSEPHUS, MELITO'S catalogue, JEROME, JUSTIN MARTYR (Dialogue
with Trypho, 22, quoting the fifth and six chapters of Amos as "one of
the twelve minor prophets"), and the sixtieth canon of the Laodicean
council support the canonicity of the book of Amos.
