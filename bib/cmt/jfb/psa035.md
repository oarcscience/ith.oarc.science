### [Psalms Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001)

[Psalms 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 35:1</span></span>

The Psalmist invokes God's aid, contrasting the hypocrisy, cunning, and
malice of his enemies with his integrity and generosity. The
imprecations of the first part including a brief notice of their
conduct, the fuller exposition of their hypocrisy and malice in the
second, and the earnest prayer for deliverance from their scornful
triumph in the last, are each closed ([Psa
35:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#009), [Psa
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#018), [Psa
35:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027)) with promises of praise for
the desired relief, in which his friends will unite. The historical
occasion is probably 1Sa. 24:1-22. (Psa. 35:1-28)

God is invoked in the character of a warrior ([Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003); [Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041)).

[Psalms 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 35:3</span></span>

fight against--literally, "devour my devourers."

stop the way against--literally, "shut up" (the way), to meet or oppose,
&c.

I . . . thy salvation--who saves thee.

[Psalms 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 35:4</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017)).

devise my hurt--purpose for evil to me.

[Psalms 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 35:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004)) --a terrible fate;
driven by wind on a slippery path in darkness, and hotly pursued by
supernatural violence ([Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016);
[Act 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023)).

[Psalms 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 35:7</span></span>

net in a pit--or, "pit of their net"--or, "net-pit," as "holy hill" for
"hill of holiness" ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)); a
figure from hunting ([Psa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015)). Their
imprecations on impenitent rebels against God need no vindication; His
justice and wrath are for such; His mercy for penitents. Compare [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016); [Psa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005), on the peculiar fate of the
wicked here noticed.

[Psalms 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 35:10</span></span>

All my bones--every part.

him that spoileth him--(Compare [Psa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002)).

[Psalms 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 35:11</span></span>

False witnesses--literally, "Witnesses of injustice and cruelty"
(compare [Psa 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005); [Psa
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019)).

[Psalms 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 35:12</span></span>

Though they rendered evil for good, he showed a tender sympathy in their
affliction.

spoiling--literally, "bereavement." The usual modes of showing grief are
made, as figures, to express his sorrow.

[Psalms 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 35:13</span></span>

prayer . . . bosom--may denote either the posture--the head
bowed--(compare [Kg1 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042)) --or, that
the prayer was in secret. Some think there is a reference to the
result--the prayer would benefit him if not them.

[Psalms 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 35:14</span></span>

behaved--literally, "went on"--denoting his habit.

heavily--or, "squalidly," his sorrowing occasioning neglect of his
person. Altogether, his grief was that of one for a dearly loved
relative.

[Psalms 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 35:15</span></span>

On the contrary, they rejoiced in his affliction. Halting, or,
"lameness," as in [Psa 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017) for any
distress.

abjects--either as cripples (compare [Sa2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004)), contemptible; or, degraded
persons, such as had been beaten (compare [Job
30:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)).

I knew it not--either the persons, or, reasons of such conduct.

tear me, and ceased not--literally, "were not silent"--showing that the
tearing meant slandering.

[Psalms 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 35:16</span></span>

mockers--who were hired to make sport at feasts ([Pro
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021)).

[Psalms 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 35:17</span></span>

darling--(Compare [Psa 22:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)).

[Psalms 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 35:18</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)).

[Psalms 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 35:19</span></span>

enemies wrongfully--by false and slanderous imputations.

wink with the eye--an insulting gesture ([Pro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013)).

without a cause--manifests more malice than having a wrong cause.

[Psalms 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 35:20</span></span>

deceitful matters--or, "words of deceit."

quiet in the land--the pious lovers of peace.

[Psalms 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 35:21</span></span>

On the gesture compare [Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007); and
on the expressions of malicious triumph, compare [Psa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013); [Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003).

[Psalms 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 35:23</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006); [Psa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001); [Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006)). God's righteous government is
the hope of the pious and terror of the wicked.

[Psalms 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 35:25</span></span>

swallowed him up--utterly destroyed him ([Psa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009); [Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016)).

[Psalms 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 35:26</span></span>

clothed--covered wholly ([Job 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022)).

[Psalms 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 35:27</span></span>

favour . . . cause--delight in it, as vindicated by Thee.

Let the Lord, &c.--Let Him be greatly praised for His care of the just.

[Psalms 35:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 35:28</span></span>

In this praise of God's equitable government ([Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008)) the writer promises ever to
engage.
