### [Isaiah Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 55:1</span></span>

THE CALL OF THE GENTILE WORLD TO FAITH THE RESULT OF GOD'S GRACE TO THE
JEWS FIRST. ([Isa 55:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).md)

every one--After the special privileges of Israel (Isa. 54:1-17) there
follow, as the consequence, the universal invitation to the Gentiles
([Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

Ho--calls the most earnest attention.

thirsteth--has a keen sense of need ([Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).md).

waters . . . wine and milk--a gradation. Not merely water, which is
needed to maintain life at all, but wine and milk to strengthen, cheer,
and nourish; the spiritual blessings of the Gospel are meant ([Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md); [Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). "Waters," plural, to denote
abundance ([Isa 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md).

no money--Yet, in [Isa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md), it is
said, "ye spend money." A seeming paradox. Ye are really spiritual
bankrupts: but thinking yourselves to have money, namely, a devotion of
your own making, ye lavish it on that "which is not bread," that is, on
idols, whether literal or spiritual.

buy . . . without money--another paradox. We are bought, but not with a
price paid by ourselves ([Co1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md);
[Pe1 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md). In a different sense we
are to "buy" salvation, namely, by parting with everything which comes
between us and Christ who has bought it for us and by making it our own
([Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md), [Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046.md); [Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md); [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 55:2</span></span>

not bread-- ([Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013).md). "Bread of
deceit" ([Pro 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017).md). Contrast this
with the "bread of life" ([Joh 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md),
[Joh 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md); also [Luk
14:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016).md).

satisfieth not-- ([Ecc 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008.md); [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008).md).

hearken . . . and eat--When two imperatives are joined, the second
expresses the consequence of obeying the command in the first ([Gen
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018).md). By hearkening ye shall eat. So
in [Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md), "buy and eat." By
buying, and so making it your own, ye shall eat, that is, experimentally
enjoy it ([Joh 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053).md). Compare the
invitation ([Pro 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md); [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004).md).

fatness-- ([Psa 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 55:3</span></span>

me . . . live--by coming to me ye shall live: for "I am the life" ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md).

everlasting covenant-- ([Jer 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040.md);
[Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005).md).

with you . . . David--God's covenant is with the antitypical David,
Messiah ([Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md), and so with us
by our identification with Him.

sure--answering to "everlasting," irrevocable, unfailing, to be relied
on ([Psa 89:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002.md), [Psa
89:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md), [Psa
89:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md); [Jer
33:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md); [Sa2
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015.md); [Co2
1:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018).md).

mercies of David--the mercies of grace ([Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md); [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016).md) which I covenanted to give to
David, and especially to Messiah, his antitype. Quoted in [Act
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034.md).

[Isaiah 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 55:4</span></span>

him--the mystical David ([Eze
37:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md). Given by God ([Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006).md).

witness--He bore witness even unto death for God, to His law, claims,
and plan of redeeming love ([Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005).md). Revelation is a "testimony";
because it is propounded to be received on the authority of the Giver,
and not merely because it can be proved by arguments.

commander--"preceptor" \[HORSLEY\]; "lawgiver" \[BARNES\].

to the people--rather, "peoples."

[Isaiah 55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 55:5</span></span>

thou--Jehovah addresses Messiah.

call . . . run--God must call, before man can, or will, run ([Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044).md). Not merely come, but run
eagerly.

thou knowest not--now as thy people (so in [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023).md).

nation . . . nations--gradation; from Israel, one nation, the Gospel
spread to many nations, and will do so more fully on Israel's
conversion.

knew not thee-- ([Isa 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md); [Eph
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).md).

because of . . . thy God . . . glorified thee-- ([Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), [Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009.md); [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023).md); where similar language is
directed to Israel, because of the identification of Israel with
Messiah, who is the ideal Israel ([Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md); compare with [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); see [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 55:6</span></span>

The condition and limit in the obtaining of the spiritual benefits ([Isa
55:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)): (1) Seek the Lord. (2.md) Seek
Him while He is to be found ([Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md); [Psa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md); [Mat
25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md); [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md); [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md); [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md); [Heb
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md), [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015).md).

call--casting yourselves wholly on His mercy ([Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013).md). Stronger than "seek"; so
"near" is more positive than "while He may be found" ([Rom
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008).md).

near--propitious ([Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md); [Psa
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 55:7</span></span>

unrighteous--Hebrew, "man of iniquity"; true of all men. The "wicked"
sins more openly in "his way"; the "unrighteous" refers to the more
subtle workings of sin in the "thoughts." All are guilty in the latter
respect, thought many fancy themselves safe, because not openly "wicked
in ways" ([Psa 94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011).md). The parallelism
is that of gradation. The progress of the penitent is to be from
negative reformation, "forsaking his way," and a farther step, "his
thoughts," to positive repentance, "returning to the Lord" (the only
true repentance, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md), and
making God his God, along with the other children of God (the crowning
point; appropriation of God to ourselves: "to our God"). "Return"
implies that man originally walked with God, but has apostatized. Isaiah
saith, "our God," the God of the believing Israelites; those themselves
redeemed desire others to come to their God ([Psa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).md).

abundantly pardon--Literally, "multiply to pardon," still more than
"have mercy"; God's graciousness is felt more and more the longer one
knows Him ([Psa 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 55:8</span></span>

For--referring to [Isa 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md). You need
not doubt His willingness "abundantly to pardon" (compare [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012).md); for, though "the wicked" man's
"ways," and "the unrighteous man's thoughts," are so aggravated as to
seem unpardonable, God's "thoughts" and "ways" in pardoning are not
regulated by the proportion of the former, as man's would be towards his
fellow man who offended him; compare the "for" ([Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md); [Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 55:9</span></span>

([Psa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md); [Psa
89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002.md); [Psa
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011).md). "For" is repeated from [Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md). But MAURER, after the negation,
translates, "but."

[Isaiah 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 55:10</span></span>

The hearts of men, once barren of spirituality, shall be made, by the
outpouring of the Spirit under Messiah, to bear fruits of righteousness
([Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md); [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md); [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md); [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006).md).

snow--which covers plants from frost in winter; and, when melted in
spring, waters the earth.

returneth not--void; as in [Isa 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md);
it returns not in the same shape, or without "accomplishing" the desired
end.

bud--germinate.

[Isaiah 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 55:11</span></span>

([Mat 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035).md). Rain may to us seem lost
when it falls on a desert, but it fulfils some purpose of God. So the
gospel word falling on the hard heart; it sometimes works a change at
last; and even if so, it leaves men without excuse. The full
accomplishment of this verse, and [Isa
55:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md), is, however, to be at the
Jews' final restoration and conversion of the world ([Isa
11:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md); [Isa
60:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md), [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 55:12</span></span>

go out--from the various countries in which ye (the Jews) are scattered,
to your own land ([Eze 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017).md).

led--by Messiah, your "Leader" ([Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md); [Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md); [Mic
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012).md).

mountains . . . trees, &c.--images justly used to express the seeming
sympathy of nature with the joy of God's people. For, when sin is
removed, the natural world shall be delivered from "vanity," and be
renewed, so as to be in unison with the regenerated moral world ([Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md); [Psa
98:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md); [Rom
8:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 55:13</span></span>

thorn--emblem of the wicked ([Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md); [Mic
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004).md).

fir tree--the godly ([Isa 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013.md); [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012).md). Compare as to the change
wrought, [Rom 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md).

brier--emblem of uncultivation ([Isa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006).md).

myrtle--Hebrew, Hedes, from which comes Hedassah, the original name of
Esther. Type of the Christian Church; for it is a lowly, though
beautiful, fragrant, and evergreen shrub ([Psa
92:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013).md).

for a name . . . everlasting sign--a perpetual memorial to the glory of
Jehovah ([Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011.md); [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009).md).
