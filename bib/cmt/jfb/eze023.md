### [Ezekiel Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 23:2</span></span>

ISRAEL'S AND JUDAH'S SIN AND PUNISHMENT ARE PARABOLICALLY PORTRAYED
UNDER THE NAMES AHOLAH AND AHOLIBAH. (Eze. 23:1-49)

two . . . of one mother--Israel and Judah, one nation by birth from the
same ancestress, Sarah.

[Ezekiel 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 23:3</span></span>

Even so early in their history as their Egyptian sojourn, they committed
idolatries (see on [Eze 20:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006.md); [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014).md).

in their youth--an aggravation of their sin. It was at the very time of
their receiving extraordinary favors from God ([Eze
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006.md), [Eze
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022).md).

they bruised--namely, the Egyptians.

[Ezekiel 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 23:4</span></span>

Aholah--that is, "Her tent" (put for worship, as the first worship of
God in Israel was in a tent or tabernacle), as contrasted with Aholibah,
that is, "My tent in her." The Beth-el worship of Samaria was of her own
devising, not of God's appointment; the temple-worship of Jerusalem was
expressly appointed by Jehovah, who "dwelt" there, "setting up His
tabernacle among the people as His" ([Exo
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md); [Lev
26:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md); [Jos
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019.md); [Psa
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002).md).

the elder--Samaria is called "the elder" because she preceded Judah in
her apostasy and its punishment.

they were mine--Previous to apostasy under Jeroboam, Samaria (Israel, or
the ten tribes), equally with Judah, worshipped the true God. God
therefore never renounced the right over Israel, but sent prophets, as
Elijah and Elisha, to declare His will to them.

[Ezekiel 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 23:5</span></span>

when . . . mine--literally, "under Me," that is, subject to Me as her
lawful husband.

neighbours--On the northeast the kingdom of Israel bordered on that of
Assyria; for the latter had occupied much of Syria. Their neighborhood
in locality was emblematical of their being near in corruption of morals
and worship. The alliances of Israel with Assyria, which are the chief
subject of reprobation here, tended to this ([Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); [Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md); [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md); [Hos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 23:6</span></span>

blue--rather, "purple" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. As a lustful woman's passions are
fired by showy dress and youthful appearance in men, so Israel was
seduced by the pomp and power of Assyria (compare [Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008).md).

horsemen--cavaliers.

[Ezekiel 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 23:7</span></span>

all their idols--There was nothing that she refused to her lovers.

[Ezekiel 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 23:8</span></span>

whoredoms brought from Egypt--the calves set up in Dan and Beth-el by
Jeroboam, answering to the Egyptian bull-formed idol Apis. Her alliances
with Egypt politically are also meant ([Isa
30:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001).md). The ten tribes probably resumed
the Egyptian rites, in order to enlist the Egyptians against Judah ([Ch2
12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 23:9</span></span>

God, in righteous retribution, turned their objects of trust into the
instruments of their punishment: Pul, Tiglath-pileser, Esar-haddon, and
Shalmaneser ([Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md), [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md), [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md); [Ezr
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002.md), [Ezr
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010).md). "It was their sin to have
sought after such lovers, and it was to be their punishment that these
lovers should become their destroyers" \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 23:10</span></span>

became famous--literally, "she became a name," that is, as notorious by
her punishment as she had been by her sins, so as to be quoted as a
warning to others.

women--that is, neighboring peoples.

[Ezekiel 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 23:11</span></span>

Judah, the southern kingdom, though having the "warning" (see on [Eze
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010).md) of the northern kingdom before
her eyes, instead of profiting by it, went to even greater lengths in
corruption than Israel. Her greater spiritual privileges made her guilt
the greater ([Eze 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047.md), [Eze
16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051.md); [Jer
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 23:12</span></span>

([Eze 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006.md), [Eze
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023).md).

most gorgeously--literally, "to perfection." GROTIUS translates,
"wearing a crown," or "chaplet," such as lovers wore in visiting their
mistresses.

[Ezekiel 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 23:13</span></span>

one way--both alike forsaking God for heathen confidences.

[Ezekiel 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 23:14</span></span>

vermilion--the peculiar color of the Chaldeans, as purple was of the
Assyrians. In striking agreement with this verse is the fact that the
Assyrian sculptures lately discovered have painted and colored
bas-reliefs in red, blue, and black. The Jews (for instance Jehoiakim,
[Jer 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014).md) copied these (compare [Eze
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 23:15</span></span>

exceeding in dyed attire--rather, "in ample dyed turbans"; literally,
"redundant with dyed turbans." The Assyrians delighted in ample,
flowing, and richly colored tunics, scarfs, girdles, and head-dresses or
turbans, varying in ornaments according to the rank.

Chaldea, . . . land of their nativity--between the Black and Caspian
Seas (see on [Isa 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md).

princes--literally, a first-rate military class that fought by threes in
the chariots, one guiding the horses, the other two fighting.

[Ezekiel 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 23:16</span></span>

sent messengers . . . into Chaldea-- ([Eze
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029).md). It was she that solicited the
Chaldeans, not they her. Probably the occasion was when Judah sought to
strengthen herself by a Chaldean alliance against a menaced attack by
Egypt (compare [Kg2 23:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md); [Kg2
24:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md). God made the object of their
sinful desire the instrument of their punishment. Jehoiakim, probably by
a stipulation of tribute, enlisted Nebuchadnezzar against Pharaoh, whose
tributary he previously had been; failing to keep his stipulation, he
brought on himself Nebuchadnezzar's vengeance.

[Ezekiel 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 23:17</span></span>

alienated from them--namely, from the Chaldeans: turning again to the
Egyptians ([Eze 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019).md), trying by
their help to throw off her solemn engagements to Babylon (compare [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md), [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md); [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 23:18</span></span>

my mind was alienated from her--literally, "was broken off from her."
Just retribution for "her mind being alienated (broken off) from the
Chaldeans" ([Eze 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017).md), to whom she
had sworn fealty ([Eze 17:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012).md).
"Discovered" implies the open shamelessness of her apostasy.

[Ezekiel 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 23:19</span></span>

Israel first "called" her lusts, practised when in Egypt, "to her (fond)
remembrance," and then actually returned to them. Mark the danger of
suffering the memory to dwell on the pleasure felt in past sins.

[Ezekiel 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 23:20</span></span>

their paramours--that is, her paramours among them (the Egyptians); she
doted upon their persons as her paramours ([Eze
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005.md), [Eze
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012.md), [Eze
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016).md).

flesh--the membrum virile (very large in the ass). Compare [Lev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002.md), Margin; [Eze
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026.md).

issue of horses--the seminal issue. The horse was made by the Egyptians
the hieroglyphic for a lustful person.

[Ezekiel 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 23:21</span></span>

calledst to remembrance--"didst repeat" \[MAURER\].

in bruising--in suffering . . . to be bruised.

[Ezekiel 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 23:22</span></span>

lovers . . . alienated-- ([Eze 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017).md).
Illicit love, soon or late, ends in open hatred ([Sa2
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#015).md). The Babylonians, the objects
formerly of their God-forgetting love, but now, with characteristic
fickleness, objects of their hatred, shall be made by God the
instruments of their punishment.

[Ezekiel 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 23:23</span></span>

Pekod, &c.-- ([Jer 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021).md). Not a
geographical name, but descriptive of Babylon. "Visitation," peculiarly
the land of "judgment"; in a double sense: actively, the inflicter of
judgment on Judah; passively, as about to be afterwards herself the
object of judgment.

Shoa . . . Koa--"rich . . . noble"; descriptive of Babylon in her
prosperity, having all the world's wealth and dignity at her disposal.
MAURER suggests that, as descriptive appellatives are subjoined to the
proper name, "all the Assyrians" in the second hemistich of the verse
(as the verse ought to be divided at "Koa"), so Pekod, Shoa, and Koa
must be appellatives descriptive of "The Babylonians and . . .
Chaldeans" in the first hemistich; "Pekod" meaning "prefects"; Shoa . .
. Koa, "rich . . . princely."

desirable young men--strong irony. Alluding to [Eze
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012.md), these "desirable young men"
whom thou didst so "dote upon" for their manly vigor of appearance,
shall by that very vigor be the better able to chastise thee.

[Ezekiel 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 23:24</span></span>

with chariots--or, "with armaments"; so the Septuagint; "axes"
\[MAURER\]; or, joining it with "wagons," translate, "with scythe-armed
wagons," or "chariots" \[GROTIUS\].

weels--The unusual height of these increased their formidable appearance
([Eze 1:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016).md).

their judgments--which awarded barbarously severe punishments ([Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md); [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022).md).

[Ezekiel 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 23:25</span></span>

take away thy nose . . . ears--Adulteresses were punished so among the
Egyptians and Chaldeans. Oriental beauties wore ornaments in the ear and
nose. How just the retribution, that the features most bejewelled should
be mutilated! So, allegorically as to Judah, the spiritual adulteress.

[Ezekiel 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 23:26</span></span>

strip . . . of . . . clothes--whereby she attracted her paramours ([Eze
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#039).md).

[Ezekiel 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 23:27</span></span>

Thus . . . make . . . lewdness to cease--The captivity has made the Jews
ever since abhor idolatry, not only on their return from Babylon, but
for the last nineteen centuries of their dispersion, as foretold ([Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 23:28</span></span>

([Eze 23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017.md); [Eze
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037).md).

[Ezekiel 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 23:29</span></span>

take away . . . thy labour--that is, the fruits of thy labor.

leave thee naked--as captive females are treated.

[Ezekiel 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 23:31</span></span>

her cup--of punishment ([Psa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md);
[Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015), &c..md). Thy guilt and that of
Israel being alike, your punishment shall be alike.

[Ezekiel 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">eze 23:34</span></span>

break . . . sherds--So greedily shalt thou suck out every drop like one
drinking to madness (the effect invariably ascribed to drinking God's
cup of wrath, [Jer 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md); [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016).md) that thou shalt crunch the very
shreds of it; that is, there shall be no evil left which thou shalt not
taste.

pluck off thine own breasts--enraged against them as the ministers to
thine adultery.

[Ezekiel 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 23:35</span></span>

forgotten me-- ([Jer 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032.md); [Jer
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#025).md).

cast me behind thy back-- ([Kg1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009.md);
[Neh 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).md).

bear . . . thy lewdness--that is, its penal consequences ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md).

[Ezekiel 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">eze 23:36</span></span>

A summing up of the sins of the two sisters, especially those of Judah.

wilt thou judge--Wilt thou (not) judge (see on [Eze
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004).md)?

[Ezekiel 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 23:38</span></span>

the same day--On the very day that they had burned their children to
Molech in the valley of Gehenna, they shamelessly and hypocritically
presented themselves as worshippers in Jehovah's temple ([Jer
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">eze 23:40</span></span>

messenger was sent--namely, by Judah ([Eze
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016.md); [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009).md).

paintedst . . . eyes-- ([Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md),
Margin; [Jer 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030).md). Black paint was
spread on the eyelids of beauties to make the white of the eye more
attractive by the contrast, so Judah left no seductive art untried.

[Ezekiel 23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">eze 23:41</span></span>

bed--divan. While men reclined at table, women sat, as it seemed
indelicate for them to lie down ([Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004).md) \[GROTIUS\].

table--that is, the idolatrous altar.

mine incense--which I had given thee, and which thou oughtest to have
offered to Me ([Eze 16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018.md); [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md); compare [Pro
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017).md).

[Ezekiel 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">eze 23:42</span></span>

Sabeans--Not content with the princely, handsome Assyrians, the sisters
brought to themselves the rude robber hordes of Sabeans ([Job
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#015).md). The Keri, or Margin, reads
"drunkards."

upon their hands--upon the hands of the sisters, that is, they allured
Samaria and Judah to worship their gods.

[Ezekiel 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">eze 23:43</span></span>

Will they, &c.--Is it possible that paramours will desire any longer to
commit whoredoms with so worn-out an old adulteress?

[Ezekiel 23:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 23:45</span></span>

the righteous men--the Chaldeans; the executioners of God's righteous
vengeance ([Eze 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038).md), not that they
were "righteous" in themselves ([Hab
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md), [Hab
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 23:46</span></span>

a company--properly, "a council of judges" passing sentence on a
criminal \[GROTIUS\]. The "removal" and "spoiling" by the Chaldean army
is the execution of the judicial sentence of God.

[Ezekiel 23:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 23:47</span></span>

stones--the legal penalty of the adulteress ([Eze
16:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#040.md); [Joh
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005).md). Answering to the stones hurled
by the Babylonians from engines in besieging Jerusalem.

houses . . . fire--fulfilled ([Ch2
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md), [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 23:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 23:48</span></span>

([Eze 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027).md).

that all . . . may be taught not to do, &c.-- ([Deu
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 23:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 23:49</span></span>

bear the sins of your idols--that is, the punishment of your idolatry.

know that I am the Lord God--that is, know it to your cost . . . by
bitter suffering.
