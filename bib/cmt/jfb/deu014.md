### [Deuteronomy Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 14:1</span></span>

GOD'S PEOPLE MUST NOT DISFIGURE THEMSELVES IN MOURNING. ([Deu
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001).md)

ye shall not cut yourselves . . . for the dead--It was a common practice
of idolaters, both on ceremonious occasions of their worship ([Kg1
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#028).md), and at funerals (compare [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md); [Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005).md), to make ghastly incisions on
their faces and other parts of their persons with their finger nails or
sharp instruments. The making a large bare space between the eyebrows
was another heathen custom in honor of the dead (see on [Lev
19:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md); [Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).md). Such indecorous and degrading
usages, being extravagant and unnatural expressions of hopeless sorrow
([Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).md), were to be carefully
avoided by the Israelites, as derogatory to the character, and
inconsistent with the position, of those who were the people of God
\[[Deu 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 14:3</span></span>

WHAT MAY BE EATEN, AND WHAT NOT. (Deu. 14:3-21)

Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing--that is, anything forbidden as
unclean (see on [Lev 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 14:5</span></span>

OF BEASTS. ([Deu 14:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004).md)

The hart--(see on [Deu 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015).md).

fallow deer--The Hebrew word (Jachmur) so rendered, does not represent
the fallow deer, which is unknown in Western Asia, but an antelope (Oryx
leucoryx), called by the Arabs, jazmar. It is of a white color, black at
the extremities, and a bright red on the thighs. It was used at
Solomon's table.

wild goat--The word akko is different from that commonly used for a wild
goat ([Sa1 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md); [Psa
104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md); [Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019).md), and it is supposed to be a
goat-deer, having the body of a stag, but the head, horns, and beard of
a goat. An animal of this sort is found in the East, and called Lerwee
\[SHAW, Travels\].

pygarg--a species of antelope (Oryx addax) with white buttocks, wreathed
horns two feet in length, and standing about three feet seven inches
high at the shoulders. It is common in the tracks which the Israelites
had frequented \[SHAW\].

wild ox--supposed to be the Nubian Oryx, which differs from the Oryx
leucoryx (formerly mentioned) by its black color; and it is, moreover,
of larger stature and more slender frame, with longer and more curved
horns. It is called Bekkar-El-Wash by the Arabs.

chamois--rendered by the Septuagint Cameleopard; but, by others who
rightly judge it must have been an animal more familiar to the Hebrews,
it is thought to be the Kebsch (Ovis tragelaphus), rather larger than a
common sheep, covered not with wool, but with reddish hair--a Syrian
sheep-goat.

[Deuteronomy 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 14:11</span></span>

OF BIRDS. ([Deu 14:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#011).md)

Of all clean birds ye shall eat--(See on [Lev
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 14:13</span></span>

glede--thought to be the same as that rendered vulture ( see on [Lev
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#014).md).

[Deuteronomy 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 14:15</span></span>

the cuckow--more probably the sea-gull. \[See on [Lev
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#016.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 14:16</span></span>

the swan--rather, the goose \[MICHAELIS\]. \[See on [Lev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 14:17</span></span>

gier eagle--The Hebrew word Rachemah is manifestly identical with
Rachamah, the name which the Arabs give to the common vulture of Western
Asia and Egypt (Neophron percnopterus). \[See on [Lev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018.md)\].

cormorant--rather, the plungeon; a seafowl. \[See on [Lev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#017.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 14:18</span></span>

the lapwing--the upupa or hoop: a beautiful bird, but of the most
unclean habits. \[See on [Lev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#019.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 14:21</span></span>

Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself--(See on [Lev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md); [Lev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008).md).

thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates--not a
proselyte, for he, as well as an Israelite, was subject to this law; but
a heathen traveller or sojourner.

Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk--This is the third
place in which the prohibition is repeated \[[Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026.md)\]. It was pointed against an
annual pagan ceremony (see on [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Exo
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#026).md).

\[[Deu 14:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md). LAW OF THE TITHE\].

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed--The dedication of a
tenth part of the year's produce in everything was then a religious
duty. It was to be brought as an offering to the sanctuary; and, where
distance prevented its being taken in kind, it was by this statute
convertible into money.

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

At the end of three years . . . the Levite . . . shall come, &c.--The
Levites having no inheritance like the other tribes, the Israelites were
not to forget them, but honestly to tithe their increase \[[Num
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#024.md)\]. Besides the tenth of all the
land produce, they had forty-eight cities, with the surrounding grounds
\[[Num 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#007.md)\], "the best of the land,"
and a certain proportion of the sacrifices as their allotted
perquisites. They had, therefore, if not an affluent, yet a comfortable
and independent, fund for their support.
