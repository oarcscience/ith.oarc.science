(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001">Act 20:1-12</A>)
<p>
<p>departed--after Pentecost (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">Co1 16:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>to go into Macedonia--in pursuance of the first part of his plan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021">Act 19:21</A>). From his Epistles we learn; (1) That, as might have been expected from its position on the coast, he revisited Troas (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012">Co2 2:12</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008">Act 16:8</A>). (2) That while on his former visit he appears to have done no missionary work there, he now went expressly "to preach Christ's Gospel," and found "a door opened unto him of the Lord" there, which he entered so effectually as to lay the foundation of a church there (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006">Act 20:6-7</A>). (3) That he would have remained longer there but for his uneasiness at the non-arrival of Titus, whom he had despatched to Corinth to finish the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001">Co1 16:1-2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006">Co2 8:6</A>), but still more, that he might bring him word what effect his first Epistle to that church had produced. (He had probably arranged that they should meet at Troas). (4) That in this state of mind, afraid of something wrong, he "took leave" of the brethren at Troas, and went from thence into Macedonia.
<p>
<p>It was, no doubt, the city of PHILIPPI that he came to (landing at Nicopolis, its seaport, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011">Act 16:11-12</A>), as appears by comparing <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009">Co2 11:9</A>, where "Macedonia" is named, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015">Phi 4:15</A>, where it appears that Philippi is meant. Here he found the brethren, whom he had left on his former visit in circumstances of such deep interest, a consolidated and thriving church, generous and warmly attached to their father in Christ; under the superintendence, probably, of our historian, "the beloved physician" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040">Act 16:40</A>). All that is said by our historian of this Macedonian visit is that "he went over those parts and gave them much exhortation." (5) Titus not having reached Philippi as soon as the apostle, "his flesh had no rest, but he was troubled on every side: without were fightings, within were fears" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005">Co2 7:5</A>). (6) At length Titus arrived, to the joy of the apostle, the bearer of better tidings from Corinth than he had dared to expect (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006">Co2 7:6-7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013">Co2 7:13</A>), but checkered by painful intelligence of the efforts of a hostile party to undermine his apostolic reputation there (2Co. 10:1-18). (7) Under the mixed feelings which this produced, he wrote--from Macedonia, and probably Philippi--his SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS (see Introduction to Second Corinthians); despatching Titus with it, and along with him two other unnamed deputies, expressly chosen to take up and bring their collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and to whom he bears the beautiful testimony, that they were "the glory of Christ" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022">Co2 8:22-23</A>). (8) It must have been at this time that he penetrated as far as to the confines of "Illyricum," lying along the shores of the Adriatic (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019">Rom 15:19</A>). He would naturally wish that his second Letter to the Corinthians should have some time to produce its proper effect ere he revisited them, and this would appear a convenient opportunity for a northwestern circuit, which would enable him to pay a passing visit to the churches at Thessalonica and Berea, though of this we have no record. On his way southward to Greece, he would preach the Gospel in the intermediate regions of Epirus, Thessaly, and Boeotia (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019">Rom 15:19</A>), though of this we have no record.

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003">Acts 20:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 20:3</A></FONT></span></p>And there abode three months--Though the province only is here mentioned, it is the city of CORINTH that is meant, as the province of "Macedonia" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001">Act 20:1</A>) meant the city of Philippi. Some rough work he anticipated on his arrival at Corinth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001">Co2 10:1-8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#011">Co2 10:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001">Co2 13:1-10</A>) though he had reason to expect satisfaction on the whole; and as we know there were other churches in Achaia besides that at Corinth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001">Co2 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010">Co2 11:10</A>), he would have time enough to pay them all a brief visit during the three months of his stay there. This period was rendered further memorable by the despatch of the EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS, written during his stay at Corinth and sent by "Ph&Aring;&#147;be, a servant [deaconess] of the Church at Cenchrea" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003">Act 18:3</A>), a lady apparently of some standing and substance, who was going thither on private business. (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001">Rom 16:1</A> and see Introduction to Romans). 
<p>
<p>And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria--He had intended to embark, probably at Cenchrea, the eastern harbor of the city, for Palestine, on his route to Jerusalem, the third part of his plan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021">Act 19:21</A>). But having detected some conspiracy against his life by his bitter Jewish enemies as at Damascus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022">Act 9:22-25</A>) and Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029">Act 9:29-30</A>), he changed his plan and determined "to return" as he had come, "through Macedonia." As he was never more to return to Corinth, so this route would bring him, for the last time, face to face with the attached disciples of Berea, Thessalonica, and Philippi.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004">Acts 20:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">act 20:4</A></FONT></span></p>there accompanied him into Asia--the province of Asia. 
<p>
<p>Sopater of Berea--The true reading, beyond doubt, is, "Sopater [the son] of Pyrrhus of Berea." Some think this mention of his father was to distinguish him from Sosipater (the same name in fuller form), mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021">Rom 16:21</A>. But that they were the same person seems more probable. 
<p>
<p>of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029">Act 19:29</A>). 
<p>
<p>and Secundus--of whom nothing else is known. 
<p>
<p>Gaius of Derbe--Though the Gaius of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029">Act 19:29</A> is said to be of "Macedonia," and this one "of Derbe," there is no sufficient reason for supposing them different persons; on the contrary, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023">Rom 16:23</A> (compare with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001">Jo3 1:1</A>, where there is hardly any reason to doubt that the same Gaius is addressed) seems to show that though he spent an important part of his Christian life away from his native Derbe, he had latterly retired to some place not very far from it. 
<p>
<p>and Timotheus--not probably of Derbe, as one might suppose from this verse, but of Lystra (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001">Act 16:1</A>); both being so associated in his early connection with the apostle that the mention of the one in the previous clause would recall the other on the mention of his name. 
<p>
<p>and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus--The latter was an Ephesian, and probably the former also. They seem to have put themselves, from this time forward, at the apostle's disposal, and to the very last been a great comfort to him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021">Eph 6:21-22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007">Col 4:7-8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029">Act 21:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012">Ti2 4:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020">Ti2 4:20</A>). From the mention of the places to which each of these companions belonged, and still more the order in which they occur, we are left to conclude that they were deputies from their respective churches, charged with taking up and bringing on the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, first at Berea, next at Thessalonica, then at Philippi [HOWSON], where we gather that our historian himself rejoined the party (from the resumption at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005">Act 20:5</A> of the "us," dropped at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017">Act 16:17</A>), by whom the Philippian collection would naturally be brought on.

This, compared with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">Co1 16:8</A>, shows that the three months spent at Corinth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003">Act 20:3</A>) were the winter months.

<p>
<p>we . . . sailed--from Troas. 
<p>
<p>unto Assos; there . . . to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot--"to go by land." (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#033">Mar 6:33</A>). In sailing southward from Troas to Assos, one has to round Cape Lecture, and keeping due east to run along the northern shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium, on which it lies. This is a sail of nearly forty miles; whereas by land, cutting right across, in a southeasterly direction, from sea to sea, by that excellent Roman road which then existed, the distance was scarcely more than half. The one way Paul wished his companions to take, while he himself, longing perhaps to enjoy a period of solitude, took the other, joining the ship, by appointment, at Assos.

<p>

<p>
<p>at Samos--another island coming quite close to the mainland, and about as far south of Chios as it is south of Lesbos.

<p>tarried--for the night. 
<p>
<p>at Trogyllium--an anchorage on the projecting mainland, not more than a mile from the southern extremity of the island of Samos. 
<p>
<p>next day we came to Miletus--on the mainland; the ancient capital of Ionia, near the mouth of the Meander.

<p>
<p>Ephesus--He was right opposite to it when approaching Chios. 
<p>
<p>because he would not spend time in Asia--the Asian province of which Ephesus was the chief city. 
<p>
<p>for he hasted, if . . . possible . . . to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost--as a suitable season for giving in the great collection from all the western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his apostolic position with the Church, then represented in large number at Jerusalem. The words imply that there was considerable ground to doubt if he would attain this object--for more than three of the seven weeks from Passover to Pentecost had already expired--and they are inserted evidently to explain why he did not once more visit Ephesus.

But if unfavorable winds and stormy weather had overtaken them, his object could not have been attained, and perhaps he was unwilling to run the risk of detention at Ephesus by the state of the church and other causes. Those here called "elders" or "presbyters," are in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Act 20:28</A> called "bishops." (See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Act 20:28</A>). The identity of presbyters and bishops in the New Testament is beyond all reasonable dispute.

<p>
<p>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031">Act 5:31</A>). REPENTANCE, as distinguished from faith, is that state of the "honest and good heart" which arises from a discovery of one's contrariety to the righteous demands of the divine law. This is said to be "toward God," because seeing Him to be the party dishonored by sin, it feels all its acknowledgments and compunctions to be properly due to Him, as the great Lawgiver, and directs them to Him accordingly; condemning, humbling itself, and grieving before Him, looking also to Him as its only Hope of deliverance. FAITH is said to be "toward our Lord Jesus Christ," because in that frame of mind just described it eagerly credits the testimony of relief divinely provided in Christ, gladly embraces the overtures of reconciliation in Him, and directs all its expectations of salvation, from its first stage to its last, to Him as the one appointed Medium of all grace from God to a sinful world. Thus we have here a brief summary of all Gospel preaching. And it is easy to see why repentance is here put before faith; for the former must of necessity precede the latter. There is a repentance subsequent to faith, the fruit of felt pardon and restoration. It was this which drew the tears with which the Saviour's feet were once so copiously moistened. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037">Luk 7:37-38</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047">Luk 7:47</A>; and compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063">Eze 16:63</A>). But that is not the light in which it is here presented.

Analogous premonitions of coming events are not unknown to the general method of God's providence. They would tend to season the apostle's spirit.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">act 20:24</A></FONT></span></p>But none of these things move me, neither, &amp;c.--In this noble expression of absolute dedication to the service of Christ and preparedness for the worst that could befall him in such a cause, note (1) his jealousy for the peculiar character of his mission, as immediately from Christ Himself on which all the charges against him turned; (2) the burden of that Gospel which he preached--GRACE; it was "the Gospel of the Grace of God."

Whether, therefore, he ever did see them again, is a question to be decided purely on its own evidence.

(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Act 14:23</A> shows that the apostle did not mean to exclude human ordination). 
<p>
<p>overseers--or, as the same word is everywhere else rendered in our version, "bishops." The English Version has hardly dealt fair in this case with the sacred text, in rendering the word "overseers," whereas it ought here, as in all other places, to have been "bishops," in order that the fact of elders and bishops having been originally and apostolically synonymous, might be apparent to the ordinary English reader, which now it is not [ALFORD]. The distinction between these offices cannot be certainly traced till the second century, nor was it established till late in that century. 
<p>
<p>to feed the church of God--or, "the Church of the Lord." Which of these two readings of the text is the true one, is a question which has divided the best critics. The evidence of manuscripts preponderates in favor of "THE LORD"; some of the most ancient Versions, though not all, so read; and ATHANASIUS, the great champion of the supreme Divinity of Christ early in the fourth century, says the expression "Church of God" is unknown to the Scriptures. Which reading, then, does the internal evidence favor? As "Church of God" occurs nine times elsewhere in Paul's writings, and "Church of the Lord" nowhere, the probability, it is said, is that he used his wonted phraseology here also. But if he did, it is extremely difficult to see how so many early transcribers should have altered it into the quite unusual phrase, "Church of the Lord"; whereas, if the apostle did use this latter expression, and the historian wrote it so accordingly, it it easy to see how transcribers might, from being so accustomed to the usual phrase, write it "Church of God." On the whole, therefore, we accept the second reading as most probably the true one. But see what follows. 
<p>
<p>which he hath purchased--"made His own," "acquired." 
<p>
<p>with his own blood--"His own" is emphatic: "That glorified Lord who from the right hand of power in the heavens is gathering and ruling the Church, and by His Spirit, through human agency, hath set you over it, cannot be indifferent to its welfare in your hands, seeing He hath given for it His own most precious blood, thus making it His own by the dearest of all ties." The transcendent sacredness of the Church of Christ is thus made to rest on the dignity of its Lord and the consequent preciousness of that blood which He shed for it. And as the sacrificial atoning character of Christ's death is here plainly expressed, so His supreme dignity is implied as clearly by the second reading as it is expressed by the first. What a motive to pastoral fidelity is here furnished!

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">act 20:29</A></FONT></span></p>after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you--Two classes of coming enemies are here announced, the one more external to themselves, the other bred in the bosom of their own community; both were to be teachers, but the one, "grievous wolves," not sparing, that is, making a prey of the flock; the other (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030">Act 20:30</A>), simply sectarian "perverters" of the truth, with the view of drawing a party after them. Perhaps the one pointed to that subtle poison of Oriental Gnosticism which we know to have very early infected the Asiatic churches; the other to such Judaizing tendencies as we know to have troubled nearly all the early churches. See the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Timothy, also those to the seven churches of Asia (Rev. 2:1-3:22). But watchfulness against all that tends to injure and corrupt the Church is the duty of its pastors in every age.

<p>which--that is, God.

Would to God that such scenes were more frequent in the Church!
