<p>
<p>take counsel--rather, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004">Isa 30:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006">Isa 30:6</A> imply, "execute counsels." 
<p>
<p>cover . . . covering--that is, wrap themselves in reliances disloyal towards Jehovah. "Cover" thus answers to "seek to hide deeply their counsel from the Lord" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015">Isa 29:15</A>). But the Hebrew is literally, "who pour out libations"; as it was by these that leagues were made (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008">Exo 24:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011">Zac 9:11</A>), translate, "who make a league."

<p>Egypt--See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001">Isa 19:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1</A>. 
<p>
<p>Pharaoh--the generic name of the kings of Egypt, as C&Atilde;&brvbr;sar was at Rome. The word in Egyptian means "king" [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.6,2]. Phra, "the sun," was the hieroglyphic symbol and title of the king. 
<p>
<p>shadow--image from shelter against heat: protection (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005">Psa 121:5-6</A>).

<p>
<p>came to Hanes--are come there. West of the Nile, in central Egypt: Egyptian Hnes; the Greek Heracleopolis: perhaps the Anysis of HERODOTUS (2.137); according to GROTIUS, Tahpanhes contracted (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007">Jer 43:7-9</A>); the seat of a reigning prince at the time, as was Zoan, hence the Jewish ambassadors go to both.

[MAURER]; so the Septuagint, the fresh inscription here marks emphatically the prediction that follows. Or, rather, Isaiah sees in vision, the ambassador's beasts burdened with rich presents travelling southwards (namely, to Egypt, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005">Dan 11:5-6</A>), and exclaims, Oh, the burden of treasure on the beasts! &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009">Hos 8:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001">Hos 12:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>land of trouble--the desert between Palestine and Egypt, destitute of water and abounding in dangerous animals (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015">Deu 8:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</A>).

<p>flying serpent-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029">Isa 14:29</A>), a species which springs like a dart from trees, on its prey. 
<p>
<p>will carry--rather, present, "carry," namely, as presents to Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019">Kg1 15:19</A>). 
<p>
<p>young asses--rather, "full-grown asses" [MAURER].

She who boasted of the help she would give, when it came to the test, sat still (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006">Isa 36:6</A>). English Version agrees with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015">Isa 30:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004">Isa 7:4</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 30:8</A></FONT></span></p>table--a tablet (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002">Hab 2:2</A>), which should be set in public, containing the prophecy in a briefer form, to be read by all. 
<p>
<p>a book--namely, a parchment roll, containing the prophecy in full, for the use of distant posterity. Its truth will be seen hereafter when the event has come to pass. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001">Isa 8:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016">Isa 8:16</A>. 
<p>
<p>for ever and ever--rather read, "For a testimony for ever" [Chaldee, JEROME, LOWTH]: "testimony is often joined to the notion of perpetuity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019">Deu 31:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021">Deu 31:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026">Deu 31:26</A>).

<p>
<p>See not--as you now do, foretelling misfortune. 
<p>
<p>Prophesy not . . . right things--Not that they avowedly requested this, but their conduct virtually expressed it. No man, professedly, wished to be deceived; but many seek a kind of teaching which is deceit; and which, if they would examine, they might know to be such (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#013">Kg1 22:13</A>). The Jews desired success to be foretold as the issue of their league with Egypt, though ill had been announced by God's prophet as the result; this constituted the "deceits."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 30:12</A></FONT></span></p>Holy One--Isaiah so little yields to their wicked prejudices that he repeats the very name and truth which they disliked.

<p>this word--Isaiah's exhortation to reliance on Jehovah. 
<p>
<p>oppression--whereby they levied the treasures to be sent to conciliate Egypt (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006">Isa 30:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>perverseness--in relying on Egypt, rather than on Jehovah.

<p>
<p>It--the Jewish state. 
<p>
<p>potter's vessel--earthen and fragile. 
<p>
<p>sherd--a fragment of the vessel large enough to take up a live coal, &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>pit--cistern or pool. The swell of the wall is at first imperceptible and gradual, but at last it comes to the crisis; so the decay of the Jewish state.

The signal staff was erected to rally a nation in war. The remnant of Jews left would be beacons to warn all men of the justice of God, and the truth of His threatenings. GESENIUS (from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008">Lev 26:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030">Deu 32:30</A>) arbitrarily inserts "ten thousand."

Or, "Yet therefore" (namely, because of the distress spoken of in the previous verses; that distress will lead the Jews to repentance, and so Jehovah will pity them) [GESENIUS]. 
<p>
<p>be exalted--Men will have more elevated views of God's mercy; or else, "He will rise up to pity you" [G. V. SMITH]. Or (taking the previous clause as MAURER, "Therefore Jehovah will delay" in punishing you, "in order that He may be gracious to you," if ye repent), He will be far removed from you (so in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005">Psa 10:5</A>, far above out sight); that is, He will not immediately descend to punish, "in order that He may have mercy," &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>judgment--justice; faithfulness to His covenant.

Latterly Gehinnom or Gehenna, that is, valley of Hinnom, was the receptacle of the refuse of the city, to consume which fires were constantly burning. Hence it came to express hell, the place of torment. In the former sense it was a fit place to symbolize the funeral pyre of the Assyrian army (not that it actually perished there); the Hebrews did not burn, but buried their dead, but the heathen Assyrians are to be burnt as a mark of ignominy. In the latter sense Tophet is the receptacle "prepared for the devil (antitype to the king, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012">Isa 14:12-15</A>) and his angels," and unbelieving men (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022">Mat 5:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041">Mat 25:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043">Mar 9:43-44</A>).
