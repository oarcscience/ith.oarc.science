### [Psalms Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)

[Psalms 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 45:1</span></span>

Shoshannim--literally, "Lilies," either descriptive of an instrument so
shaped, or denoting some tune or air so called, after which the Psalm
was to be sung (see on [Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001),
title). A song of loves, or, of beloved ones (plural and feminine)--a
conjugal song. Maschil--(See on [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001), title, and [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001), title) denotes the didactic
character of the Psalm; that it gives instruction, the song being of
allegorical, and not literal, import. The union and glories of Christ
and his Church are described. He is addressed as a king possessed of all
essential graces, as a conqueror exalted on the throne of a righteous
and eternal government, and as a bridegroom arrayed in nuptial splendor.
The Church is portrayed in the purity and loveliness of a royally
adorned and attended bride, invited to forsake her home and share the
honors of her affianced lord. The picture of an Oriental wedding thus
opened is filled up by representing the complimentary gifts of the
wealthy with which the occasion is honored, the procession of the bride
clothed in splendid raiment, attended by her virgin companions, and the
entrance of the joyous throng into the palace of the king. A prediction
of a numerous and distinguished progeny, instead of the complimentary
wish for it usually expressed (compare [Gen
24:60](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#060); [Rut
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011)), and an assurance of a
perpetual fame, closes the Psalm. All ancient Jewish and Christian
interpreters regarded this Psalm as an allegory of the purport above
named. In the Song of Songs the allegory is carried out more fully.
Hosea (Hos. 1:1-3:5) treats the relation of God and His people under the
same figure, and its use to set forth the relation of Christ and His
Church runs through both parts of the Bible (compare [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Isa
62:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004); [Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003); [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001); [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Eph
5:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025), &c.). Other methods of
exposition have been suggested. Several Jewish monarchs, from Solomon to
the wicked Ahab, and various foreign princes, have been named as the
hero of the song. But to none of them can the terms here used be shown
to apply, and it is hardly probable that any mere nuptial song,
especially of a heathen king, would be permitted a place in the sacred
songs of the Jews. The advocates for any other than the Messianic
interpretation have generally silenced each other in succession, while
the application of the most rigorous rules of a fair system of
interpretation has but strengthened the evidences in its favor. The
scope of the Psalm above given is easy and sustained by the explication
of its details. The quotation of [Psa
45:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006) by Paul ([Heb
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)), as applicable to Christ, ought
to be conclusive, and their special exposition shows the propriety of
such an application. (Psa. 45:1-17)

of a ready writer--that is, it is fluent. The theme is inspiring and

[Psalms 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 45:2</span></span>

To rich personal attractions is added grace of the lips, captivating
powers of speech. This is given, and becomes a source of power and
proves a blessing. Christ is a prophet ([Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022)).

[Psalms 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003)

The king is addressed as ready to go forth to battle.

111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003)), or as specially conferred on
mortals ([Psa 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005)), perhaps these
typically.

[Psalms 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004)

[Psalms 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 45:6</span></span>

No lawful construction can be devised to change the sense here given and
sustained by the ancient versions, and above all by Paul ([Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)). Of the perpetuity of this
government, compare [Sa2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013); [Psa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016); [Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005); [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004); [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004); [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007).

[Psalms 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 45:7</span></span>

As in [Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006) the divine nature is
made prominent, here the moral qualities of the human are alleged as the
reason or ground of the mediatorial exultation. Some render "O God, thy
God," instead of

God, thy God--but the latter is sustained by the same form ([Psa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007)), and it was only of His human
nature that the anointing could be predicated (compare [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)).

of solemn joy (compare [Kg1 1:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039)).

fellows--other kings.

[Psalms 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 45:8</span></span>

The king thus inaugurated is now presented as a bridegroom, who appears
in garments richly perfumed, brought out from

ivory palaces--His royal residence; by which, as indications of the
happy bridal occasion, He has been gladdened.

[Psalms 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 45:9</span></span>

In completion of this picture of a marriage festival, female attendants
or bridesmaids of the highest rank attend Him, while the queen, in rich
apparel ([Psa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013)), stands ready for
the nuptial procession.

[Psalms 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 45:10</span></span>

She is invited to the union, for forming which she must leave her
father's people. She representing, by the form of the allegory, the
Church, this address is illustrated by all those scriptures, from [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001) on, which speak of the people of
God as a chosen, separate, and peculiar people. The relation of
subjection to her spouse at once accords with the law of marriage, as
given in [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016); [Gen
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012); [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Pe1
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005), and the relation of the Church
to Christ ([Eph 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)). The love of the
husband is intimately connected with the entire devotion to which the
bride is exhorted.

[Psalms 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 45:12</span></span>

daughter of Tyre-- ([Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014));
denotes the people. Tyre, celebrated for its great wealth, is selected
to represent the richest nations, an idea confirmed by the next clause.
These gifts are brought as means to conciliate the royal parties,
representing the admitted subjection of the offerers. This well sets
forth the exalted position of the Church and her head, whose moral
qualities receive the homage of the world. The contribution of material
wealth to sustain the institutions of the Church may be included
(compare "riches of the Gentiles," [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010); [Isa
60:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005)).

[Psalms 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 45:13</span></span>

the king's daughter--a term of dignity. It may also intimate, with some
allusion to the teaching of the allegory, that the bride of Christ, the
Church, is the daughter of the great king, God.

within--Not only is her outward raiment costly, but all her apparel is
of the richest texture.

wrought gold--gold embroidery, or cloth in which gold is woven.

[Psalms 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 45:14</span></span>

The progress of the procession is described; according to the usual
custom the bride and attendants are conducted to the palace. Some for
the words--

in raiment of needlework--propose another rendering, "on variegated (or
embroidered) cloths"--that is, in the manner of the East, richly wrought
tapestry was spread on the ground, on which the bride walked. As the
dress had been already mentioned, this seems to be a probable
translation.

[Psalms 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 45:15</span></span>

shall they be brought--in solemn form (compare [Job
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#019); [Job
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022)). The entrance into the palace
with great joy closes the scene. So shall the Church be finally brought
to her Lord, and united amid the festivities of the holy beings in
heaven.

[Psalms 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 45:16</span></span>

As earthly monarchs govern widely extended empires by viceroys, this
glorious king is represented as supplying all the principalities of
earth with princes of his own numerous progeny.

[Psalms 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 45:17</span></span>

The glories of this empire shall be as wide as the world and lasting as
eternity.

therefore--Because thus glorious, the praise shall be universal and
perpetual. Some writers have taxed their ingenuity to find in the
history and fortunes of Christ and His Church exact parallels for every
part of this splendid allegory, not excepting its gorgeous Oriental
imagery. Thus, by the dresses of the king and queen, are thought to be
meant the eminent endowments and graces of Christ and His people. The
attendant women, supposed (though inconsistently it might seem with the
inspired character of the work) to be concubines, are thought to
represent the Gentile churches, and the bride the Jewish, &c. But it is
evident that we cannot pursue such a mode of interpretation. For,
following the allegory, we must suspend to the distant future the
results of a union whose consummation as a marriage is still distant
(compare [Rev 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)). In fact, the
imagery here and elsewhere sets before us the Church in two aspects. As
a body, it is yet incomplete, the whole is yet ungathered. As a moral
institution, it is yet imperfect. In the final catastrophe it will be
complete and perfect. Thus, as a bride adorned, &c., it will be united
with its Lord. Thus the union of Christ and the Church triumphant is set
forth. On the other hand, in regard to its component parts, the relation
of Christ as head, as husband, &c., already exists, and as these parts
form an institution in this world, it is by His union with it, and the
gifts and graces with which He endows it, that a spiritual seed arises
and spreads in the world. Hence we must fix our minds only on the one
simple but grand truth, that Christ loves the Church, is head over all
things for it, raises it in His exaltation to the highest moral
dignity--a dignity of which every, even the meanest, sincere disciple
will partake. As to the time, then, in which this allegorical prophecy
is to fulfilled, it may be said that no periods of time are specially
designated. The characteristics of the relation of Christ and His Church
are indicated, and we may suppose that the whole process of His
exaltation from the declaration of His Sonship, by His resurrection, to
the grand catastrophe of the final judgment, with all the collateral
blessings to the Church and the world, lay before the vision of the
inspired prophet.
