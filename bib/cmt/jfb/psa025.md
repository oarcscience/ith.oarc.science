### [Psalms Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)

[Psalms 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 25:1</span></span>

The general tone of this Psalm is that of prayer for help from enemies.
Distress, however, exciting a sense of sin, humble confession,
supplication for pardon, preservation from sin, and divine guidance, are
prominent topics. (Psa. 25:1-22)

lift up my soul-- ([Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004); [Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004)), set my affections (compare [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002)).

[Psalms 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 25:2</span></span>

not be ashamed--by disappointment of hopes of relief.

[Psalms 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 25:3</span></span>

The prayer generalized as to all who wait on God--that is, who expect
His favor. On the other hand, the disappointment of the perfidious, who,
unprovoked, have done evil, is invoked (compare [Sa2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#009)).

[Psalms 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 25:4</span></span>

On the ground of former favor, he invokes divine guidance, according to
God's gracious ways of dealing and faithfulness.

[Psalms 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 25:6</span></span>

Confessing past and present sins, he pleads for mercy, not on
palliations of sin, but on God's well-known benevolence.

[Psalms 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 25:8</span></span>

upright--acting according to His promise.

sinners--the general term, limited by the

meek--who are penitent.

the way--and his way--God's way of providence.

[Psalms 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 25:9</span></span>

in judgment--rightly.

[Psalms 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 25:10</span></span>

paths--similar sense--His modes of dealing (compare [Psa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004)).

mercy and truth-- (Job 14:1-22), God's grace in promising and
faithfulness in performing.

[Psalms 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 25:11</span></span>

God's perfections of love, mercy, goodness, and truth are manifested
(his name, compare [Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010)) in
pardoning sin, and the greatness of sin renders pardon more needed.

[Psalms 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 25:12</span></span>

What he asks for himself is the common lot of all the pious.

[Psalms 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 25:13</span></span>

inherit the earth--(compare [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005)).
The phrase, alluding to the promise of Canaan, expresses all the
blessings included in that promise, temporal as well as spiritual.

[Psalms 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 25:14</span></span>

The reason of the blessing explained--the pious enjoy communion with God
(compare [Pro 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021), [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012)), and, of course, learn His
gracious terms of pardon.

[Psalms 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 25:15</span></span>

His trust in God is fixed.

net--is frequently used as a figure for dangers by enemies ([Psa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015); [Psa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009)).

[Psalms 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 25:16</span></span>

A series of earnest appeals for aid because God had seemed to desert him
(compare [Psa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001); [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013), &c.), his sins oppressed him,
his enemies had enlarged his troubles and were multiplied, increasing in
hate and violence ([Psa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008); [Psa
18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048)).

[Psalms 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 25:20</span></span>

keep my soul-- ([Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)).

put my trust--flee for refuge ([Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)).

[Psalms 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 25:21</span></span>

In conscious innocence of the faults charged by his enemies, he
confidently commits his cause to God. Some refer--

integrity, &c.--to God, meaning His covenant faithfulness. This sense,
though good, is an unusual application of the terms.

[Psalms 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 25:22</span></span>

Extend these blessings to all Thy people in all their distresses.
