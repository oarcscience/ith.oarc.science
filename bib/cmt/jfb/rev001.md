[Revelation 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 1:1</span></span>

TITLE: SOURCE AND OBJECT OF THIS REVELATION: BLESSING ON THE READER AND
KEEPER OF IT, AS THE TIME IS NEAR: INSCRIPTION TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES:
APOSTOLIC GREETING: KEYNOTE, "BEHOLD HE COMETH" (Compare at the close,
[Rev 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020), "Surely I come quickly"):
INTRODUCTORY VISION OF THE SON OF MAN IN GLORY, AMIDST THE SEVEN
CANDLESTICKS, WITH SEVEN STARS IN HIS RIGHT HAND. (Rev. 1:1-20)

Revelation--an apocalypse or unveiling of those things which had been
veiled. A manifesto of the kingdom of Christ. The travelling manual of
the Church for the Gentile Christian times. Not a detailed history of
the future, but a representation of the great epochs and chief powers in
developing the kingdom of God in relation to the world. The
"Church-historical" view goes counter to the great principle that
Scripture interprets itself. Revelation is to teach us to understand the
times, not the times to interpret to us the Apocalypse, although it is
in the nature of the case that a reflex influence is exerted here and is
understood by the prudent \[AUBERLEN\]. The book is in a series of
parallel groups, not in chronological succession. Still there is an
organic historical development of the kingdom of God. In this book all
the other books of the Bible end and meet: in it is the consummation of
all previous prophecy. Daniel foretells as to Christ and the Roman
destruction of Jerusalem, and the last Antichrist. But John's Revelation
fills up the intermediate period, and describes the millennium and final
state beyond Antichrist. Daniel, as a godly statesman, views the history
of God's people in relation to the four world kingdoms. John, as an
apostle, views history from the Christian Church aspect. The term
Apocalypse is applied to no Old Testament book. Daniel is the nearest
approach to it; but what Daniel was told to seal and shut up till the
time of the end, John, now that the time is at hand ([Rev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003)), is directed to reveal.

of Jesus Christ--coming from Him. Jesus Christ, not John the writer, is
the Author of the Apocalypse. Christ taught many things before His
departure; but those which were unsuitable for announcement at that time
He brought together into the Apocalypse \[BENGEL\]. Compare His promise,
[Joh 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015), "All things that I have
heard of My Father, I have made known unto you"; also, [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013), "The Spirit of truth will show
you things to come." The Gospels and Acts are the books, respectively,
of His first advent, in the flesh, and in the Spirit; the Epistles are
the inspired comment on them. The Apocalypse is the book of His second
advent and the events preliminary to it.

which God gave unto him--The Father reveals Himself and His will in, and
by, His Son.

to show--The word recurs in [Rev 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006)
: so entirely have the parts of Revelation reference to one another. It
is its peculiar excellence that it comprises in a perfect compendium
future things, and these widely differing: things close at hand, far
off, and between the two; great and little; destroying and saving;
repeated from old prophecies and new; long and short, and these
interwoven with one another, opposed and mutually agreeing; mutually
involving and evolving one another; so that in no book more than in this
would the addition, or taking away, of a single word or clause ([Rev
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018)), have the effect of marring
the sense of the context and the comparison of passages together
\[BENGEL\].

his servants--not merely to "His servant John," but to all His servants
(compare [Rev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003)).

shortly--Greek, "speedily"; literally, "in," or "with speed." Compare
"the time is at hand," [Rev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006), "shortly"; [Rev
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007), "Behold, I come quickly." Not
that the things prophesied were according to man's computation near; but
this word "shortly" implies a corrective of our estimate of worldly
events and periods. Though a "thousand years" ([Rev
20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)) at least are included, the
time is declared to be at hand. [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008), "speedily." The Israelite Church
hastened eagerly to the predicted end, which premature eagerness
prophecy restrains (compare Dan. 9:1-27). The Gentile Church needs to be
reminded of the transitoriness of the world (which it is apt to make its
home) and the nearness of Christ's advent. On the one hand Revelation
says, "the time is at hand"; on the other, the succession of seals, &c.,
show that many intermediate events must first elapse.

he sent--Jesus Christ sent.

by his angel--joined with "sent." The angel does not come forward to
"signify" things to John until [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001); [Rev
19:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009). Previous to that John
receives information from others. Jesus Christ opens the Revelation,
[Rev 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010); [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001); in [Rev
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001) one of the four living creatures
acts as his informant; in [Rev 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013),
one of the elders; in [Rev 10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008), the
Lord and His angel who stood on the sea and earth. Only at the end ([Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001)) does the one angel stand by Him
(compare [Dan 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016); [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021); [Zac
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019)).

[Revelation 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 1:2</span></span>

bare record of--"testified the word of God" in this book. Where we would
say "testifies," the ancients in epistolary communications use the past
tense. The word of God constitutes his testimony; [Rev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003), "the words of this prophecy."

the testimony of Jesus--"the Spirit of prophecy" ([Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)).

and of all things that, &c.--The oldest manuscripts omit "and."
Translate, "whatsoever things he saw," in apposition with "the word of
God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."

[Revelation 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 1:3</span></span>

he that readeth, and they that hear--namely, the public reader in Church
assemblies, and his hearers. In the first instance, he by whom John sent
the book from Patmos to the seven churches, read it publicly: a usage
most scriptural and profitable. A special blessing attends him who reads
or hears the apocalyptic "prophecy" with a view to keeping the things
therein (as there is but one article to "they that hear and keep those
things," not two classes, but only one is meant: "they who not only
hear, but also keep those things," [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013)); even though he find not the key
to its interpretation, he finds a stimulus to faith, hope, and patient
waiting for Christ. Note: the term "prophecy" has relation to the human
medium or prophet inspired, here John: "Revelation" to the Divine Being
who reveals His will, here Jesus Christ. God gave the revelation to
Jesus: He by His angel revealed it to John, who was to make it known to
the Church.

[Revelation 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 1:4</span></span>

John--the apostle. For none but he (supposing the writer an honest man)
would thus sign himself nakedly without addition. As sole survivor and
representative of the apostles and eye-witnesses of the Lord, he needed
no designation save his name, to be recognized by his readers.

seven churches--not that there were not more churches in that region,
but the number seven is fixed on as representing totality. These seven
represent the universal Church of all times and places. See TRENCH'S
\[Commentary on the Epistles to the Seven Churches in Asia\] interesting
note, [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020), on the number seven.
It is the covenant number, the sign of God's covenant relation to
mankind, and especially to the Church. Thus, the seventh day, sabbath
([Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003); [Eze
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012)). Circumcision, the sign of the
covenant, after seven days ([Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012)). Sacrifices ([Num
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001); [Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029); [Ch2
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021)). Compare also God's acts
typical of His covenant ([Jos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004),
[Jos 6:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#015); [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010)). The feasts ordered by sevens of
time ([Deu 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009), [Deu
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013), [Deu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#015)). It is a combination of three,
the divine number (thus the Trinity: the thrice Holy, [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003); the blessing, [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024)), and four the number of the
organized world in its extension (thus the four elements, the four
seasons, the four winds, the four corners or quarters of the earth, the
four living creatures, emblems of redeemed creaturely life, [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006); [Eze
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005), with four faces and four wings
each; the four beasts and four metals, representing the four world
empires, [Dan 2:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032); [Dan
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003); the four-sided Gospel designed
for all quarters of the world; the sheet tied at four corners, [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011); the four horns, the sum of the
world's forces against the Church, [Zac
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018)). In the Apocalypse, where God's
covenant with His Church comes to its consummation, appropriately the
number seven recurs still more frequently than elsewhere in Scripture.

Asia--Proconsular, governed by a Roman proconsul: consisting of Phrygia,
Mysia, Caria, and Lydia: the kingdom which Attalus III had bequeathed to
Rome.

Grace . . . peace--Paul's apostolical greeting. In his Pastoral Epistles
he inserts "mercy" in addition: so [Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003).

him which is . . . was . . . is to come--a periphrasis for the
incommunicable name JEHOVAH, the self-existing One, unchangeable. In
Greek the indeclinability of the designation here implies His
unchangeableness. Perhaps the reason why "He which is to come" is used,
instead of "He that shall be," is because the grand theme of Revelation
is the Lord's coming ([Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007)). Still
it is THE FATHER as distinguished from "Jesus Christ" ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)) who is here meant. But so one are
the Father and Son that the designation, "which is to come," more
immediately applicable to Christ, is used here of the Father.

the seven Spirits which are before his throne--The oldest manuscripts
omit "are."

before--literally, "in the presence of." The Holy Spirit in His
sevenfold (that is, perfect, complete, and universal) energy.
Corresponding to "the seven churches." One in His own essence, manifold
in His gracious influences. The seven eyes resting on the stone laid by
Jehovah ([Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)). Four is the number
of the creature world (compare the fourfold cherubim); seven the number
of God's revelation in the world.

[Revelation 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 1:5</span></span>

the faithful witness--of the truth concerning Himself and His mission as
Prophet, Priest, and King Saviour. "He was the faithful witness, because
all things that He heard of the Father He faithfully made known to His
disciples. Also, because He taught the way of God in truth, and cared
not for man, nor regarded the persons of men. Also, because the truth
which He taught in words He confirmed by miracles. Also, because the
testimony to Himself on the part of the Father He denied not even in
death. Lastly, because He will give true testimony of the works of good
and bad at the day of judgment" \[RICHARD OF ST. VICTOR in TRENCH\]. The
nominative in Greek standing in apposition to the genitive, "Jesus
Christ," gives majestic prominence to "the faithful witness."

the first-begotten of the dead-- ([Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)). Lazarus rose, to die again.
Christ rose to die no more. The image is not as if the grave was the
womb of His resurrection-birth \[ALFORD\]; but as [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004), treat Christ's resurrection as
the epoch and event which fulfilled the Scripture, [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007), "This day (at the resurrection)
have I begotten Thee." It was then that His divine Sonship as the
God-man was manifested and openly attested by the Father. So our
resurrection and our manifested sonship, or generation, are connected.
Hence "regeneration" is used of the resurrection-state at the
restitution of all things ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)).

the prince--or Ruler. The kingship of the world which the tempter
offered to Jesus on condition of doing homage to him, and so shunning
the cross, He has obtained by the cross. "The kings of the earth"
conspired against the Lord's Anointed ([Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002)): these He shall break in pieces
([Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009)). Those who are wise in time
and kiss the Son shall bring their glory unto Him at His manifestation
as King of kings, after He has destroyed His foes.

Unto him that loved us--The oldest manuscripts read the present, ". . .
loveth us." It is His ever-continuing character, He loveth us, and ever
shall love us. His love rests evermore on His people.

washed us--The two oldest manuscripts read, "freed (loosed as from a
bond) us": so ANDREAS and PRIMASIUS. One very old manuscript, Vulgate,
and Coptic read as English Version, perhaps drawn from [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004). "Loosed us in (virtue of) His
blood," being the harder reading to understand, is less likely to have
come from the transcribers. The reference is thus to Greek, "lutron,"
the ransom paid for our release ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028)). In favor of English Version
reading is the usage whereby the priests, before putting on the holy
garments and ministering, washed themselves: so spiritually believers,
as priests unto God, must first be washed in Christ's blood from every
stain before they can serve God aright now, or hereafter minister as
dispensers of blessing to the subject nations in the millennial kingdom,
or minister before God in heaven.

[Revelation 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 1:6</span></span>

And hath--rather as Greek, "And (He) hath."

made us kings--The oldest manuscripts read, "a kingdom." One oldest
manuscript reads the dative, "for us." Another reads "us," accusative:
so Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS. This seems preferable, "He made
us (to be) a kingdom." So [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006),
"a kingdom of priests"; [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009), "a
royal priesthood." The saints shall constitute peculiarly a kingdom of
God, and shall themselves be kings ([Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)). They shall share His
King-Priest throne in the millennial kingdom. The emphasis thus falls
more on the kingdom than on priests: whereas in English Version reading
it is equally distributed between both. This book lays prominent stress
on the saints' kingdom. They are kings because they are priests: the
priesthood is the continuous ground and legitimization of their
kingship; they are kings in relation to man, priests in relation to God,
serving Him day and night in His temple ([Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)). The priest-kings shall rule,
not in an external mechanical manner, but simply in virtue of what they
are, by the power of attraction and conviction overcoming the heart
\[AUBERLEN\].

priests--who have pre-eminently the privilege of near access to the
king. David's sons were priests (Hebrew), [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018). The distinction of priests and
people, nearer and more remote from God, shall cease; all shall have
nearest access to Him. All persons and things shall be holy to the Lord.

God and his Father--There is but one article to both in the Greek,
therefore it means, "Unto Him who is at once God and His Father."

glory and dominion--Greek, "the glory and the might." The fuller
threefold doxology occurs, [Rev 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009),
[Rev 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011); fourfold, [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025); sevenfold, [Rev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012); [Ch1
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011). Doxology occupies the prominent
place above, which prayer does below. If we thought of God's glory first
(as in the Lord's Prayer), and gave the secondary place to our needs, we
should please God and gain our petitions better than we do.

for ever and ever--Greek, "unto the ages."

[Revelation 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 1:7</span></span>

with clouds--Greek, "the clouds," namely, of heaven. "A cloud received
Him out of their sight" at His ascension ([Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)). His ascension corresponds to the
manner of His coming again ([Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)). Clouds are the symbols of wrath
to sinners.

every eye--His coming shall therefore be a personal, visible appearing.

shall see--It is because they do not now see Him, they will not believe.
Contrast [Joh 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029).

they also--they in particular; "whosoever." Primarily, at His
pre-millennial advent the Jews, who shall "look upon Him whom they have
pierced," and mourn in repentance, and say, "Blessed is He that cometh
in the name of the Lord." Secondarily, and here chiefly, at the general
judgment all the ungodly, not only those who actually pierced Him, but
those who did so by their sins, shall look with trembling upon Him. John
is the only one of the Evangelists who records the piercing of Christ's
side. This allusion identifies him as the author of the Apocalypse. The
reality of Christ's humanity and His death is proved by His having been
pierced; and the water and blood from His side were the antitype to the
Levitical waters of cleansing and blood offerings.

all kindreds . . . shall wail--all the unconverted at the general
judgment; and especially at His pre-millennial advent, the Antichristian
confederacy ([Zac 12:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003), [Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009); [Zac
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001); [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)). Greek, "all the tribes of the
land," or "the earth." See the limitation to "all," [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008). Even the godly while rejoicing
in His love shall feel penitential sorrow at their sins, which shall all
be manifested at the general judgment.

because of--Greek, "at," or "in regard to Him."

Even so, Amen--Gods seal of His own word; to which corresponds the
believer's prayer, [Rev 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020). The
"even so" is Greek; "Amen" is Hebrew. To both Gentiles and Jews His
promises and threats are unchangeable.

[Revelation 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 1:8</span></span>

Greek, "I am the Alpha and the Omega." The first and last letters of the
alphabet. God in Christ comprises all that goes between, as well as the
first and last.

the beginning and the ending--omitted in the oldest manuscripts, though
found in Vulgate and Coptic. Transcribers probably inserted the clause
from [Rev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006). In Christ, Genesis,
the Alpha of the Old Testament, and Revelation, the Omega of the New
Testament, meet together: the last book presenting to us man and God
reconciled in Paradise, as the first book presented man at the beginning
innocent and in God's favor in Paradise. Accomplishing finally what I
begin. Always the same; before the dragon, the beast, false prophet, and
all foes. An anticipatory consolation to the saints under the coming
trials of the Church.

the Lord--The oldest manuscripts read "the Lord God."

Almighty--Hebrew, "Shaddai," and "Jehovah Sabaoth," that is, "of hosts";
commanding all the hosts or powers in heaven and earth, so able to
overcome all His Church's foes. It occurs often in Revelation, but
nowhere else in the New Testament save [Co2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018), a quotation from Isaiah.

[Revelation 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 1:9</span></span>

I John--So "I Daniel" ([Dan 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002); [Dan
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002)). One of the many features of
resemblance between the Old Testament and the New Testament apocalyptic
seers. No other Scripture writer uses the phrase.

also--as well as being an apostle. The oldest manuscripts omit "also."
In his Gospel and Epistles he makes no mention of his name, though
describing himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved." Here, with
similar humility, though naming himself, he does not mention his
apostleship.

companion--Greek, "fellow partaker in the tribulation." Tribulation is
the necessary precursor of the kingdom," therefore "the" is prefixed.
This must be borne with "patient endurance." The oldest manuscripts omit
"in the" before "kingdom." All three are inseparable: the tribulation,
kingdom and endurance.

patience--Translate, "endurance." "Persevering, enduring continuance"
([Act 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)); "the queen of the graces
(virtues)" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

of, &c.--The oldest manuscripts read "IN Jesus," or "Jesus Christ." It
is IN Him that believers have the right to the kingdom, and the
spiritual strength to enable them to endure patiently for it.

was--Greek, "came to be."

in . . . Patmos--now Patmo or Palmosa. See Introduction on this island,
and John's exile to it under Domitian, from which he was released under
Nerva. Restricted to a small spot on earth, he is permitted to penetrate
the wide realms of heaven and its secrets. Thus John drank of Christ's
cup, and was baptized with His baptism ([Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022)).

for--Greek, "for the sake of," "on account of"; so, "because of the word
of God and . . . testimony." Two oldest manuscripts omit the second
"for"; thus "the Word of God" and "testimony of Jesus" are the more
closely joined. Two oldest manuscripts omit "Christ." The Apocalypse has
been always appreciated most by the Church in adversity. Thus the
Asiatic Church from the flourishing times of Constantine less estimated
it. The African Church being more exposed to the cross always made much
of it \[BENGEL\].

[Revelation 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 1:10</span></span>

I was--Greek, "I came to be"; "I became."

in the Spirit--in a state of ecstasy; the outer world being shut out,
and the inner and higher life or spirit being taken full possession of
by God's Spirit, so that an immediate connection with the invisible
world is established. While the prophet "speaks" in the Spirit, the
apocalyptic seer is in the Spirit in his whole person. The spirit only
(that which connects us with God and the invisible world) is active, or
rather recipient, in the apocalyptic state. With Christ this being "in
the Spirit" was not the exception, but His continual state.

on the Lord's day--Though forcibly detained from Church communion with
the brethren in the sanctuary on the Lord's day, the weekly
commemoration of the resurrection, John was holding spiritual communion
with them. This is the earliest mention of the term, "the Lord's day."
But the consecration of the day to worship, almsgiving, and the Lord's
Supper, is implied in [Act 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007); [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002); compare [Joh
20:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019). The name corresponds to "the
Lord's Supper," [Co1 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020). IGNATIUS
seems to allude to "the Lord's day" \[Epistle to the Magnesians, 9\],
and IRENÃ†US \[QuÃ&brvbr;st ad Orthod., 115\] (in JUSTIN MARTYR). JUSTIN
MARTYR \[Apology, 2.98\], &c., "On Sunday we all hold our joint meeting;
for the first day is that on which God, having removed darkness and
chaos, made the world, and Jesus Christ our Saviour rose from the dead.
On the day before Saturday they crucified Him; and on the day after
Saturday, which is Sunday, having appeared to His apostles and
disciples, He taught these things." To the Lord's day PLINY doubtless
refers \[Epistles, Book X., p. 97\], "The Christians on a fixed day
before dawn meet and sing a hymn to Christ as God," &c. TERTULLIAN \[The
Chaplet, 3\], "On the Lord's day we deem it wrong to fast." MELITO,
bishop of Sardis (second century), wrote a book on the Lord's day
\[EUSEBIUS 4.26\]. Also, DIONYSIUS OF CORINTH, in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 4.23,8\]. CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 5. and 7.12\]; ORIGEN \[Against Celsus, 8. 22\]. The
theory that the day of Christ's second coming is meant, is untenable.
"The day of the Lord" is different in the Greek from "the Lord's (an
adjective) day," which latter in the ancient Church always designates
our Sunday, though it is not impossible that the two shall coincide (at
least in some parts of the earth), whence a tradition is mentioned in
JEROME \[Commentary on Matthew, 25\], that the Lord's coming was
expected especially on the Paschal Lord's day. The visions of the
Apocalypse, the seals, trumpets, and vials, &c., are grouped in sevens,
and naturally begin on the first day of the seven, the birthday of the
Church, whose future they set forth \[WORDSWORTH\].

great voice--summoning solemn attention; Greek order, "I heard a voice
behind me great (loud) as (that) of a trumpet." The trumpet summoned to
religious feasts, and accompanies God's revelations of Himself.

[Revelation 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 1:11</span></span>

I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last; and--The oldest
manuscripts, omit all this clause.

write in a book--To this book, having such an origin, and to the other
books of Holy Scripture, who is there that gives the weight which their
importance demands, preferring them to the many books of the world?
\[BENGEL\].

seven churches--As there were many other churches in Proconsular Asia
(for example, Miletus, Magnesia, Tralles), besides the seven specified,
doubtless the number seven is fixed upon because of its mystical
signification, expressing totality and universality. The words, "which
are in Asia" are rejected by the oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, CYPRIAN,
Vulgate, and Syriac; Coptic alone supports them of old authorities.
These seven are representative churches; and, as a complex whole,
ideally complete, embody the chief spiritual characteristics of the
Church, whether as faithful or unfaithful, in all ages. The churches
selected are not taken at random, but have a many-sided completeness.
Thus, on one side we have Smyrna, a Church exposed to persecutions unto
death; on the other Sardis, having a high name for spiritual life and
yet dead. Again, Laodicea, in its own estimate rich and having need of
nothing, with ample talents, yet lukewarm in Christ's cause; on the
other hand, Philadelphia, with but a little strength, yet keeping
Christ's word and having an open door of usefulness set before it by
Christ Himself. Again, Ephesus, intolerant of evil and of false
apostles, yet having left its first love; on the other hand, Thyatira,
abounding in works, love, service, and faith, yet suffering the false
prophetess to seduce many. In another aspect, Ephesus in conflict with
false freedom, that is fleshly licentiousness (the Nicolaitanes); so
also Pergamos in conflict with Balaam-like tempters to fornication and
idol-meats; and on the other side, Philadelphia in conflict with the
Jewish synagogue, that is, legal bondage. Finally, Sardis and Laodicea
without any active opposition to call forth their spiritual energies; a
dangerous position, considering man's natural indolence. In the historic
scheme of interpretation, which seems fanciful, Ephesus (meaning "the
beloved" or "desired" \[STIER\]) represents the waning period of the
apostolic age. Smyrna ("myrrh"), bitter suffering, yet sweet and costly
perfume, the martyr period of the Decian and Diocletian age. Pergamos (a
"castle" or "tower"), the Church possessing earthly power and decreasing
spirituality from Constantine's time until the seventh century. Thyatira
("unwearied about sacrifices"), the Papal Church in the first half of
the Middle Ages; like "Jezebel," keen about its so-called sacrifice of
the mass, and slaying the prophets and witnesses of God. Sardis, from
the close of the twelfth century to the Reformation. Philadelphia
("brotherly love"), the first century of the Reformation. Laodicea, the
Reformed Church after its first zeal had become lukewarm.

see the voice--that is, ascertain whence the voice came; to see who was
it from whom the voice proceeded.

that--Greek, "of what kind it was which." The voice is that of God the
Father, as at Christ's baptism and transfiguration, so here in
presenting Christ as our High Priest.

spake--The oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers read, "was
speaking."

being--"having turned."

seven . . . candlesticks--"lamp-stands" \[KELLY\]. The stand holding the
lamp. In [Exo 25:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031), the seven are
united in ONE candlestick or lamp-stand, that is, six arms and a central
shaft; so [Zac 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002), [Zac
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011). Here the seven are separate
candlesticks, typifying, as that one, the entire Church, but now no
longer as the Jewish Church (represented by the one sevenfold
candlestick) restricted to one outward unity and one place; the several
churches are mutually independent as to external ceremonies and
government (provided all things are done to edification, and schisms or
needless separations are avoided), yet one in the unity of the Spirit
and the Headship of Christ. The candlestick is not light, but the bearer
of light, holding it forth to give light around. The light is the
Lord's, not the Church's; from Him she receives it. She is to be a
light-bearer to His glory. The candlestick stood in the holy place, the
type of the Church on earth, as the holiest place was type of the Church
in heaven. The holy place's only light was derived from the candlestick,
daylight being excluded; so the Lord God is the Church's only light;
hers is the light of grace, not nature. "Golden" symbolizes at once the
greatest preciousness and sacredness; so that in the Zend Avesta,
"golden" is synonymous with heavenly or divine \[TRENCH\].

[Revelation 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 1:13</span></span>

His glorified form as man could be recognized by John, who had seen it
at the Transfiguration.

in the midst--implying Christ's continual presence and ceaseless
activity in the midst of His people on earth. In [Rev
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001), when He appears in heaven, His
insignia undergo a corresponding change yet even there the rainbow
reminds us of His everlasting covenant with them.

seven--omitted in two of the oldest manuscripts, but supported by one.

Son of man--The form which John had seen enduring the agony of
Gethsemane, and the shame and anguish of Calvary, he now sees glorified.
His glory (as Son of man, not merely Son of God) is the result of His
humiliation as Son of man.

down to the foot--a mark of high rank. The garment and girdle seem to be
emblems of His priesthood. Compare [Exo
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#002), [Exo
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#004), [Exo
28:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031); Septuagint. Aaron's robe and
girdle were "for glory and beauty," and combined the insignia of royalty
and priesthood, the characteristics of Christ's antitypical priesthood
"after the order of Melchisedec." His being in the midst of the
candlesticks (only seen in the temple), shows that it is as a
king-priest He is so attired. This priesthood He has exercised ever
since His ascension; and, therefore He here wears its emblems. As Aaron
wore these insignia when He came forth from the sanctuary to bless the
people ([Lev 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004), [Lev
16:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023), the chetoneth, or holy linen
coat), so when Christ shall come again, He shall appear in the similar
attire of "beauty and glory" ([Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002), Margin). The angels are attired
somewhat like their Lord ([Rev 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006)).
The ordinary girding for one actively engaged, was at the loins; but
JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities,3.7.2\], expressly tells us that the Levitical
priests were girt higher up, about the breasts or paps, appropriate to
calm, majestic movement. The girdle bracing the frame together,
symbolizes collected powers. Righteousness and faithfulness are Christ's
girdle. The high priest's girdle was only interwoven with gold, but
Christ's is all of gold; the antitype exceeds the type.

[Revelation 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 1:14</span></span>

--Greek, "But," or "And."

like wool--Greek, "like white wool." The color is the point of
comparison; signifying purity and glory. (So in [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018)). Not age, for hoary hairs are
the sign of decay.

eyes . . . as . . . flame--all-searching and penetrating like fire: at
the same time, also, implying consuming indignation against sin,
especially at His coming "in flaming fire, taking vengeance" on all the
ungodly, which is confirmed as the meaning here, by [Rev
19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).

[Revelation 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 1:15</span></span>

fine brass--Greek, "chalcolibanus," derived by some from two Greek
words, "brass" and "frankincense"; derived by BOCHART from Greek,
"chalcos," "brass," and Hebrew, "libbeen," "to whiten"; hence, "brass,"
which in the furnace has reached a white heat. Thus it answers to
"burnished (flashing, or glowing) brass," [Eze
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007); [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001), "His feet as pillars of fire."
Translate, "Glowing brass, as if they had been made fiery (red-hot) in a
furnace." The feet of the priests were bare in ministering in the
sanctuary. So our great High Priest here.

voice as . . . many waters-- ([Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002)); in [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006), it is "like the voice of a
multitude." As the Bridegroom's voice, so the bride's, [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002); [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006); [Eze
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024), the cherubim, or redeemed
creation. His voice, however, is here regarded in its terribleness to
His foes. Contrast [Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008); [Sol
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002), with which compare [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020).

[Revelation 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 1:16</span></span>

he had--Greek, "having." John takes up the description from time to
time, irrespective of the construction, with separate strokes of the
pencil \[ALFORD\].

in . . . right hand seven stars-- ([Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020); [Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001)). He holds them as a star-studded
"crown of glory," or "royal diadem," in His hand: so [Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003). He is their Possessor and
Upholder.

out of . . . mouth went--Greek, "going forth"; not wielded in the hand.
His WORD is omnipotent in executing His will in punishing sinners. It is
the sword of His Spirit. Reproof and punishment, rather than its
converting winning power, is the prominent point. Still, as He
encourages the churches, as well as threatens, the former quality of the
Word is not excluded. Its two edges (back and front) may allude to its
double efficacy, condemning some, converting others. TERTULLIAN
\[Epistle against Judaizers\], takes them of the Old and the New
Testaments. RICHARD OF ST. VICTOR, "the Old Testament cutting externally
our carnal, the New Testament internally, our spiritual sins."

sword--Greek, "romphaia," the Thracian long and heavy broad sword: six
times in Revelation, once only elsewhere in New Testament, namely, [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035).

sun . . . in his strength--in unclouded power. So shall the righteous
shine, reflecting the image of the Sun of righteousness. TRENCH notices
that this description, sublime as a purely mental conception, would be
intolerable if we were to give it an outward form. With the Greeks,
Ã&brvbr;sthecial taste was the first consideration, to which all others
must give way. With the Hebrews, truth and the full representation
ideally of the religious reality were the paramount consideration, that
representation being designed not to be outwardly embodied, but to
remain a purely mental conception. This exalting of the essence above
the form marks their deeper religious earnestness.

[Revelation 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 1:17</span></span>

So fallen is man that God's manifestation of His glorious presence
overwhelms him.

laid his right hand upon me--So the same Lord Jesus did at the
Transfiguration to the three prostrate disciples, of whom John was one,
saying, Be not afraid. The "touch" of His hand, as of old, imparted
strength.

unto me--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

the first . . . the last-- ([Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004);
[Isa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012)). From eternity, and enduring to
eternity: "the First by creation, the Last by retribution: the First,
because before Me there was no God formed; the Last, because after Me
there shall be no other: the First, because from Me are all things; the
Last, because to Me all things return" \[RICHARD OF ST. VICTOR\].

[Revelation 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 1:18</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "And THE LIVING ONE": connected with last sentence,
[Rev 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).

and was--Greek, "and (yet) I became."

alive for evermore--Greek, "living unto the ages of ages": not merely "I
live," but I have life, and am the source of it to My people. "To Him
belongs absolute being, as contrasted with the relative being of the
creature; others may share, He only hath immortality: being in essence,
not by mere participation, immortal" \[THEODORET in TRENCH\]. One oldest
manuscript, with English Version, reads Amen." Two others, and most of
the oldest versions and Fathers, omit it. His having passed through
death as one of us, and now living in the infinite plenitude of life,
reassures His people, since through Him death is the gate of
resurrection to eternal life.

have . . . keys of hell--Greek, "Hades"; Hebrew, "Sheol." "Hell" in the
sense, the place of torment, answers to a different Greek word, namely,
Gehenna. I can release from the unseen world of spirits and from DEATH
whom I will. The oldest manuscripts read by transposition, "Death and
Hades," or Hell." It is death (which came in by sin, robbing man of his
immortal birthright, [Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012)) that
peoples Hades, and therefore should stand first in order. Keys are
emblems of authority, opening and shutting at will "the gates of Hades"
([Psa 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013); [Isa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010); [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)).

[Revelation 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 1:19</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read, "Write therefore" (inasmuch as I, "the
First and Last," have the keys of death, and vouchsafe to thee this
vision for the comfort and warning of the Church).

things which are--"the things which thou hast seen" are those narrated
in this chapter (compare [Rev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011)).
"The things which are" imply the present state of things in the churches
when John was writing, as represented in the second and third chapters.
"The things which shall be hereafter," the things symbolically
represented concerning the future history of the fourth through
twenty-second chapters. ALFORD translates, "What things they signify";
but the antithesis of the next clause forbids this, "the things which
shall be hereafter," Greek, "which are about to come to pass." The
plural (Greek) "are," instead of the usual Greek construction singular,
is owing to churches and persons being meant by things" in the clause,
"the things which are."

[Revelation 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 1:20</span></span>

in--Greek, "upon My right hand."

the mystery . . . candlesticks--in apposition to, and explaining, "the
things which thou hast seen," governed by "Write." Mystery signifies the
hidden truth, veiled under this symbol, and now revealed; its
correlative is revelation. Stars symbolize lordship ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017); compare [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003), of faithful teachers; [Rev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#010); [Rev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004); [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013)).

angels--not as ALFORD, from ORIGEN \[Homily 13 on Luke, and Homily 20 on
Numbers\], the guardian angels of the churches, just as individuals have
their guardian angels. For how could heavenly angels be charged with the
delinquencies laid here to the charge of these angels? Then, if a human
angel be meant (as the Old Testament analogy favors, [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013), "the Lord's Messenger in the
Lord's message"; [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)), the bishop, or superintendent
pastor, must be the angel. For whereas there were many presbyters in
each of the larger churches (as for example, Ephesus, Smyrna, &c.),
there was but one angel, whom, moreover, the Chief Shepherd and Bishop
of souls holds responsible for the spiritual state of the Church under
him. The term angel, designating an office, is, in accordance with the
enigmatic symbolism of this book, transferred from the heavenly to the
earthly superior ministers of Jehovah; reminding them that, like the
heavenly angels above, they below should fulfil God's mission zealously,
promptly and efficiently. "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in
heaven!"
