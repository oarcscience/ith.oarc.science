### [Judges Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

[Judges 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 10:1</span></span>

TOLA JUDGES ISRAEL IN SHAMIR. ([Jdg
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001).md)

after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel, Tola--that is, "to save."
Deliverance was necessary as well from intestine usurpation as from
foreign aggression.

the son of Puah--He was uncle to Abimelech by the father's side, and
consequently brother of Gideon; yet the former was of the tribe of
Issachar, while the latter was of Manasseh. They were, most probably,
uterine brothers.

dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim--As a central place, he made it the
seat of government.

[Judges 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 10:3</span></span>

Jair, a Gileadite--This judge was a different person from the conqueror
of that northeastern territory, and founder of Havoth-jair, or "Jair's
villages" ([Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md); [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md); [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md); [Ch1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022).md).

[Judges 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 10:4</span></span>

he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts--This is a
characteristic trait of Eastern manners in those early times; and the
grant of a village to each of his thirty sons was a striking proof of
his extensive possessions. His having thirty sons is no conclusive
evidence that he had more than one wife, much less that he had more than
one at a time. There are instances, in this country, of men having as
many children by two successive wives.

[Judges 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 10:6</span></span>

ISRAEL OPPRESSED BY THE PHILISTINES AND AMMONITES. ([Jdg
10:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006).md)

the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord--This
apostasy seems to have exceeded every former one in the grossness and
universality of the idolatry practised.

[Judges 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 10:7</span></span>

Philistines, and . . . the children of Ammon--The predatory incursions
of these two hostile neighbors were made naturally on the parts of the
land respectively contiguous to them. But the Ammonites, animated with
the spirit of conquest, carried their arms across the Jordan; so that
the central and southern provinces of Canaan were extensively desolated.

[Judges 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 10:10</span></span>

THEY CRY TO GOD. ([Jdg 10:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010).md)

The children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned
against thee--The first step of repentance is confession of sin, and the
best proof of its sincerity is given by the transgressor, when he mourns
not only over the painful consequences which have resulted from his
offenses to himself, but over the heinous evil committed against God.

[Judges 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 10:11</span></span>

the Lord said . . . Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians--The
circumstances recorded in this and the following verses were not
probably made through the high priest, whose duty it was to interpret
the will of God.

[Judges 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 10:12</span></span>

Maonites--that is, "Midianites."

[Judges 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 10:16</span></span>

THEY REPENT; GOD PITIES THEM. ([Jdg
10:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016).md)

they put away the strange gods . . . and served the Lord; and his soul
was grieved for the misery of Israel--On their abandonment of idolatry
and return to purity of worship, God graciously abridged the term of
national affliction and restored times of peace.

[Judges 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 10:17</span></span>

the children of Ammon were gathered together--From carrying on guerrilla
warfare, the Ammonites proceeded to a continued campaign. Their settled
aim was to wrest the whole of the trans-jordanic territory from its
actual occupiers. In this great crisis, a general meeting of the
Israelitish tribes was held at Mizpeh. This Mizpeh was in eastern
Manasseh ([Jos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003).md).
