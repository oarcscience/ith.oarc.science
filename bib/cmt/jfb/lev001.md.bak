### [Leviticus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 1:1</span></span>

BURNT OFFERINGS OF THE HERD. (Lev. 1:1-17)

the Lord . . . spake . . . out of the tabernacle--The laws that are
contained in the previous record were delivered either to the people
publicly from Sinai, or to Moses privately, on the summit of that
mountain; but on the completion of the tabernacle, the remainder of the
law was announced to the Hebrew leader by an audible voice from the
divine glory, which surmounted the mercy seat.

[Leviticus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 1:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them--If the subject of
communication were of a temporal nature, the Levites were excluded; but
if it were a spiritual matter, all the tribes were comprehended under
this name ([Deu 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#012).md).

If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord--The directions given
here relate solely to voluntary or freewill offerings--those rendered
over and above such, as being of standing and universal obligation,
could not be dispensed with or commuted for any other kind of offering
([Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md); [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003), Num. 28:11-27, &c..md).

bring your offering of the cattle, &c.--that is, those animals that were
not only tame, innocent and gentle, but useful and adapted for food.
This rule excluded horses, dogs, swine, camels, and asses, which were
used in sacrifice by some heathen nations, beasts and birds of prey, as
also hares and deers.

[Leviticus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 1:3</span></span>

a burnt sacrifice--so called from its being wholly consumed on the
altar; no part of it was eaten either by the priests or the offerer. It
was designed to propitiate the anger of God incurred by original sin, or
by particular transgressions; and its entire combustion indicated the
self-dedication of the offerer--his whole nature--his body and soul--as
necessary to form a sacrifice acceptable to God ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md). This was the most ancient as
well as the most conspicuous mode of sacrifice.

a male without blemish--No animal was allowed to be offered that had any
deformity or defect. Among the Egyptians, a minute inspection was made
by the priest; and the bullock having been declared perfect, a
certificate to that effect being fastened to its horns with wax, was
sealed with his ring, and no other might be substituted. A similar
process of examining the condition of the beasts brought as offerings,
seems to have been adopted by the priests in Israel ([Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027).md).

at the door of the tabernacle--where stood the altar of burnt offering
([Exo 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#006).md). Every other place was
forbidden, under the highest penalty ([Lev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004).md).

[Leviticus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 1:4</span></span>

shall put his hand upon the head--This was a significant act which
implied not only that the offerer devoted the animal to God, but that he
confessed his consciousness of sin and prayed that his guilt and its
punishment might be transferred to the victim.

and it shall be--rather, "that it may be an acceptable atonement."

[Leviticus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 1:5</span></span>

he shall kill the bullock--The animal should be killed by the offerer,
not by the priest, for it was not his duty in case of voluntary
sacrifices; in later times, however, the office was generally performed
by Levites.

before the Lord--on the spot where the hands had been laid upon the
animal's head, on the north side of the altar.

sprinkle the blood--This was to be done by the priests. The blood being
considered the life, the effusion of it was the essential part of the
sacrifice; and the sprinkling of it--the application of the
atonement--made the person and services of the offerer acceptable to
God. The skin having been stripped off, and the carcass cut up, the
various pieces were disposed on the altar in the manner best calculated
to facilitate their being consumed by the fire.

[Leviticus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 1:8</span></span>

the fat--that about the kidneys especially, which is called "suet."

[Leviticus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 1:9</span></span>

but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water, &c.--This part of
the ceremony was symbolical of the inward purity, and the holy walk,
that became acceptable worshippers.

a sweet savour unto the Lord--is an expression of the offerer's piety,
but especially as a sacrificial type of Christ.

[Leviticus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 1:10</span></span>

if his offering be of the flocks--Those who could not afford the expense
of a bullock might offer a ram or a he-goat, and the same ceremonies
were to be observed in the act of offering.

[Leviticus 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 1:14</span></span>

if the burnt sacrifice . . . be of fowls--The gentle nature and cleanly
habits of the dove led to its selection, while all other fowls were
rejected, either for the fierceness of their disposition or the
grossness of their taste; and in this case, there being from the
smallness of the animal no blood for waste, the priest was directed to
prepare it at the altar and sprinkle the blood. This was the offering
appointed for the poor. The fowls were always offered in pairs, and the
reason why Moses ordered two turtledoves or two young pigeons, was not
merely to suit the convenience of the offerer, but according as the
latter was in season; for pigeons are sometimes quite hard and unfit for
eating, at which time turtledoves are very good in Egypt and Palestine.
The turtledoves are not restricted to any age because they are always
good when they appear in those countries, being birds of passage; but
the age of the pigeons is particularly marked that they might not be
offered to God at times when they are rejected by men \[HARMER\]. It is
obvious, from the varying scale of these voluntary sacrifices, that the
disposition of the offerer was the thing looked to--not the costliness
of his offering.
