### [Proverbs Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001)

[Proverbs 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 8:1</span></span>

Contrasted with sensual allurements are the advantages of divine wisdom,
which publicly invites men, offers the best principles of life, and the
most valuable benefits resulting from receiving her counsels. Her
relation to the divine plans and acts is introduced, as in [Pro
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019), though more fully, to commend
her desirableness for men, and the whole is closed by an assurance that
those finding her find God's favor, and those neglecting ruin
themselves. Many regard the passage as a description of the Son of God
by the title, Wisdom, which the older Jews used (and by which He is
called in [Luk 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)), as [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), &c., describes Him by that of
Logos, the Word. But the passage may be taken as a personification of
wisdom: for, (1) Though described as with God, wisdom is not asserted to
be God. (2) The use of personal attributes is equally consistent with a
personification, as with the description of a real person. (3) The
personal pronouns used accord with the gender (feminine) of wisdom
constantly, and are never changed to that of the person meant, as
sometimes occurs in a corresponding use of spirit, which is neuter in
Greek, but to which masculine pronouns are often applied ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014)), when the acts of the Holy
Spirit are described. (4) Such a personification is agreeable to the
style of this book (compare [Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020);
[Pro 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016); [Pro
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008); [Pro
6:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020); [Pro
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)), whereas no prophetical or
other allusions to the Saviour or the new dispensation are found among
the quotations of this book in the New Testament, and unless this be
such, none exist. (5) Nothing is lost as to the importance of this
passage, which still remains a most ornate and also solemn and
impressive teaching of inspiration on the value of wisdom. (Pro. 8:1-36)

The publicity and universality of the call contrast with the secrecy and
intrigues of the wicked ([Pro 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#008),
&c.).

[Proverbs 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 8:7</span></span>

For . . . truth--literally, "My palate shall meditate," or (as Orientals
did) "mutter," my thoughts expressed only to myself are truth.

wickedness--specially falsehood, as opposed to truth.

[Proverbs 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 8:12</span></span>

wisdom and its application.

find . . . inventions--or, "devices," "discreet ways" ([Pro
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 8:13</span></span>

For such is the effect of the fear of God, by which hatred to evil
preserves from it.

froward mouth--or, "speech" ([Pro
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012); [Pro
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014)).

It also gives the elements of good character in counsel.

I . . . strength--or, "As for me, understanding is strength to me," the
source of power ([Ecc 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016)); good
judgment gives more efficiency to actions;

[Proverbs 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 8:15</span></span>

of which a wisely conducted government is an example.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 8:19</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#011); [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 8:22</span></span>

Strictly, God's attributes are part of Himself. Yet, to the poetical
structure of the whole passage, this commendation of wisdom is entirely
consonant. In order of time all His attributes are coincident and
eternal as Himself. But to set forth the importance of wisdom as
devising the products of benevolence and power, it is here assigned a
precedence. As it has such in divine, so should it be desired in human,
affairs (compare [Pro 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019)).

possessed--or, "created"; in either sense, the idea of precedence.

I was set up--ordained, or inaugurated ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)). The other terms carry out the
idea of the earliest antiquity, and illustrate it by the details of
creation \[[Pro 8:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024)\].

[Proverbs 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 8:27</span></span>

when he set . . . depth--marked out the circle, according to the popular
idea of the earth, as circular, surrounded by depths on which the

commandment--better, the shore, that is, of the sea.

foundations--figuratively denotes the solid structure ([Job
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004); [Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 8:30</span></span>

one brought up--an object of special and pleasing regard. The bestowal
of wisdom on men is represented by its finding a delightful residence
and pleasing God.

[Proverbs 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 8:32</span></span>

love death--act as if they did (compare [Pro
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009)).
