### [Ezekiel Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 33:2</span></span>

RENEWAL OF EZEKIEL'S COMMISSION, NOW THAT HE IS AGAIN TO ADDRESS HIS
COUNTRYMEN, AND IN A NEW TONE. (Eze. 33:1-33)

to the children of thy people--whom he had been forbidden to address
from [Eze 24:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#026.md), till Jerusalem was
overthrown, and the "escaped" came with tidings of the judgment being
completed. So now, in [Eze 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md), the
tidings of the fact having arrived, he opens his heretofore closed lips
to the Jews. In the interval he had prophesied as to foreign nations.
The former part of the chapter, at Eze. 33:2-20, seems to have been
imparted to Ezekiel on the evening previous ([Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022).md), being a preparation for the
latter part ([Eze 33:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#023).md) imparted
after the tidings had come. This accounts for the first part standing
without intimation of the date, which was properly reserved for the
latter part, to which the former was the anticipatory introduction
\[FAIRBAIRN\].

watchman-- [Eze 33:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001.md) exhibit
Ezekiel's office as a spiritual watchman; so in [Eze
3:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#016.md); only here the duties of the
earthly watchman (compare [Sa2
18:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024.md); [Kg2
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017).md) are detailed first, and then the
application is made to the spiritual watchman's duty (compare [Isa
21:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md); [Hos
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md); [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md). "A man of their coasts" is a man
specially chosen for the office out of their whole number. So [Jdg
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md), "five men from their coasts";
also the Hebrew of [Gen 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002.md); implying
the care needed in the choice of the watchman, the spiritual as well as
the temporal ([Act 1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md); [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022).md).

[Ezekiel 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 33:3</span></span>

the sword--invaders. An appropriate illustration at the time of the
invasion of Judea by Nebuchadnezzar.

[Ezekiel 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 33:4</span></span>

blood . . . upon his own head--metaphor from sacrificial victims, on the
heads of which they used to lay their hands, praying that their guilt
should be upon the victims.

[Ezekiel 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 33:6</span></span>

his iniquity--his negligence in not maintaining constant watchfulness,
as they who are in warfare ought to do. The thing signified here appears
from under the image.

[Ezekiel 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 33:7</span></span>

I have set thee a watchman--application of the image. Ezekiel's
appointment to be a watchman spiritually is far more solemn, as it is
derived from God, not from the people.

[Ezekiel 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 33:8</span></span>

thou shalt surely die--by a violent death, the earnest of everlasting
death; the qualification being supposed, "if thou dost not repent."

[Ezekiel 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 33:9</span></span>

Blood had by this time been shed ([Eze
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021).md), but Ezekiel was clear.

[Ezekiel 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 33:10</span></span>

be upon us--that is, their guilt remain on us.

pine away in them--if we suffer the penalty threatened for them in [Eze
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023.md), according to the law ([Lev
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039).md).

how should we . . . live?--as Thou dost promise in [Eze
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#005.md) (compare [Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md); [Isa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014).md).

[Ezekiel 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 33:11</span></span>

To meet the Jews' cry of despair in [Eze
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010.md), Ezekiel here cheers them by the
assurance that God has no pleasure in their death, but that they should
repent and live ([Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md). A yearning
tenderness manifests itself here, notwithstanding all their past sins;
yet with it a holiness that abates nothing of its demands for the honor
of God's authority. God's righteousness is vindicated as in [Eze
3:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018.md) and Eze. 18:1-32, by the
statement that each should be treated with the closest adaptation of
God's justice to his particular case.

[Ezekiel 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 33:12</span></span>

not fall . . . in the day that he turneth-- ([Ch2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#014.md); see [Eze
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020.md); [Eze
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024).md).

[Ezekiel 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 33:15</span></span>

give again that he had robbed-- ([Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008).md).

statutes of life--in the obeying of which life is promised ([Lev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005).md). If the law has failed to give
life to man, it has not been the fault of the law, but of man's sinful
inability to keep it ([Rom 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#010.md), [Rom
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md); [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021).md). It becomes life-giving through
Christ's righteous obedience to it ([Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 33:17</span></span>

The way of the Lord--The Lord's way of dealing in His moral government.

[Ezekiel 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 33:21</span></span>

twelfth year . . . tenth month--a year and a half after the capture of
the city ([Jer 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002.md); [Jer
52:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#005).md), in the eleventh year and
fourth month. The one who escaped (as foretold, [Eze
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#026).md) may have been so long on the
road through fear of entering the enemy's country \[HENDERSON\]; or, the
singular is used for the plural in a collective sense, "the escaped
remnant." Compare similar phrases, "the escaped of Moab," [Isa
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009.md); "He that escapeth of them," [Amo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md). Naturally the reopening of the
prophet's mouth for consolation would be deferred till the number of the
escaped remnant was complete: the removal of such a large number would
easily have occupied seventeen or eighteen months.

[Ezekiel 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 33:22</span></span>

in the evening--(see on [Eze 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#002).md).
Thus the capture of Jerusalem was known to Ezekiel by revelation before
the messenger came.

my mouth . . . no more dumb--that is, to my countrymen; as foretold
([Eze 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027)), He spake (Eze. 33:2-20.md)
in the evening before the tidings came.

[Ezekiel 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 33:24</span></span>

they that inhabit . . . wastes of . . . Israel--marking the blindness of
the fraction of Jews under Gedaliah who, though dwelling amidst regions
laid waste by the foe, still cherished hopes of deliverance, and this
without repentance.

Abraham was one . . . but we are many--If God gave the land for an
inheritance to Abraham, who was but one ([Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002).md), much more it is given to us,
who, though reduced, are still many. If he, with 318 servants, was able
to defend himself amid so many foes, much more shall we, so much more
numerous, retain our own. The grant of the land was not for his sole
use, but for his numerous posterity.

inherited the land--not actually possessed it ([Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005).md), but had the right of dwelling
and pasturing his flocks in it \[GROTIUS\]. The Jews boasted similarly
of their Abrahamic descent in [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)
and [Joh 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md).

[Ezekiel 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 33:25</span></span>

eat with the blood--in opposition to the law ([Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md); compare [Gen
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004).md). They did so as an idolatrous
rite.

[Ezekiel 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 33:26</span></span>

Ye stand upon your sword--Your dependence is, not on right and equity,
but on force and arms.

every one--Scarcely anyone refrains from adultery.

[Ezekiel 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 33:27</span></span>

shall fall by the sword--The very object of their confidence would be
the instrument of their destruction. Thinking to "stand" by it, by it
they shall "fall." Just retribution! Some fell by the sword of Ishmael;
others by the Chaldeans in revenge for the murder of Gedaliah (Jer.
40:1-44:30).

caves-- ([Jdg 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md); [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md). In the hilly parts of Judea
there were caves almost inaccessible, as having only crooked and
extremely narrow paths of ascent, with rock in front stretching down
into the valleys beneath perpendicularly \[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews,
1.16.4\].

[Ezekiel 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 33:28</span></span>

most desolate-- ([Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md); [Jer
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#011).md).

none . . . pass through--from fear of wild beasts and pestilence
\[GROTIUS\].

[Ezekiel 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 33:30</span></span>

Not only the remnant in Judea, but those at the Chebar, though less
flagrantly, betrayed the same unbelieving spirit.

talking against thee--Though going to the prophet to hear the word of
the Lord, they criticised, in an unfriendly spirit, his peculiarities of
manner and his enigmatical style ([Eze
20:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#049).md); making these the excuse for
their impenitence. Their talking was not directly "against" Ezekiel, for
they professed to like his ministrations; but God's word speaks of
things as they really are, not as they appear.

by the walls--in the public haunts. In the East groups assemble under
the walls of their houses in winter for conversation.

in the doors--privately.

what is the word--Their motive was curiosity, seeking pastime and
gratification of the ear ([Ti2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003).md);
not reformation of the heart. Compare Johanan's consultation of
Jeremiah, to hear the word of the Lord without desiring to do it (Jer.
42:1-43:13).

[Ezekiel 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 33:31</span></span>

as the people cometh--that is, in crowds, as disciples flock to their
teacher.

sit before thee--on lower seats at thy feet, according to the Jewish
custom of pupils ([Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md); [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md); [Luk
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039.md); [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003).md).

as my people--though they are not.

hear . . . not do-- ([Mat 13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020.md);
[Jam 1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023).md).

they show much love--literally, "make love," that is, act the part of
lovers. Profess love to the Lord ([Mat
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021).md). GESENIUS translates, according
to Arabic idiom, "They do the delights of God," that is, all that is
agreeable to God. Vulgate translates, "They turn thy words into a song
of their mouths."

heart goeth after . . . covetousness--the grand rival to the love of
God; therefore called "idolatry," and therefore associated with impure
carnal love, as both alike transfer the heart's affection from the
Creator to the creature ([Mat 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022.md);
[Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 33:32</span></span>

very lovely song--literally, a "song of loves": a lover's song. They
praise thy eloquence, but care not for the subject of it as a real and
personal thing; just as many do in the modern church \[JEROME\].

play well on an instrument--Hebrew singers accompanied the "voice" with
the harp.

[Ezekiel 33:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eze 33:33</span></span>

when this cometh to pass--when My predictions are verified.

lo, it will come--rather, "lo it is come" (see [Eze
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022).md).

know--experimentally, and to their cost.

Having in the thirty-third chapter laid down repentance as the necessary
preliminary to happier times for the people, He now promises the removal
of the false shepherds as preparatory to the raising up of the Good
Shepherd.
