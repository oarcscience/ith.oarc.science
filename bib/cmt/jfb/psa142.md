Maschil--(See on [Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001), title).
When he was in the cave--either of Adullam ([Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)), or En-gedi ([Sa1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003)). This does not mean that the
Psalm was composed in the cave, but that the precarious mode of life, of
which his refuge in caves was a striking illustration, occasioned the
complaint, which constitutes the first part of the Psalm and furnishes
the reason for the prayer with which it concludes, and which, as the
prominent characteristic, gives its name. ([Psa
142:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001))

with my voice--audibly, because earnestly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 142:2</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008)).

I poured out my complaint--or, "a sad musing."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 142:3</span></span>

thou knewest . . . path--The appeal is indicative of conscious
innocence; knowest it to be right, and that my affliction is owing to
the snares of enemies, and is not deserved (compare [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004); [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002)).

[Psalms 142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 142:4</span></span>

Utter desolation is meant.

right hand--the place of a protector ([Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005)).

cared for--literally, "sought after," to do good.

[Psalms 142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 142:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#014); [Psa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007)).

[Psalms 142:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 142:6</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)).

[Psalms 142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 142:7</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017)).

that I may praise--literally, "for praising," or, "that Thy name may be
praised," that is, by the righteous, who shall surround me with
sympathizing joy ([Psa 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027)).
