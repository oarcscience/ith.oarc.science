### [2 Chronicles Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 36:1</span></span>

JEHOAHAZ, SUCCEEDING, IS DEPOSED BY PHARAOH. ([Ch2
36:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001).md)

the people of the land took Jehoahaz--Immediately after Josiah's
overthrow and death, the people raised to the throne Shallum ([Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015).md), afterwards called Jehoahaz, in
preference to his older brother Eliakim, from whom they expected little
good. Jehoahaz is said ([Kg2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030).md) to
have received at Jerusalem the royal anointing--a ceremony not usually
deemed necessary, in circumstances of regular and undisputed succession.
But, in the case of Jehoahaz, it seems to have been resorted to in order
to impart greater validity to the act of popular election; and, it may
be, to render it less likely to be disturbed by Necho, who, like all
Egyptians, would associate the idea of sanctity with the regal
anointing. He was the youngest son of Josiah, but the popular favorite,
probably on account of his martial spirit ([Eze
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003).md) and determined opposition to the
aggressive views of Egypt. At his accession the land was free from
idolatry; but this prince, instead of following the footsteps of his
excellent father, adopted the criminal policy of his apostatizing
predecessors. Through his influence, directly or indirectly used,
idolatry rapidly increased (see [Kg2
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#032).md).

[2 Chronicles 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 36:2</span></span>

he reigned three months in Jerusalem--His possession of sovereign power
was of but very brief duration; for Necho determined to follow up the
advantage he had gained in Judah; and, deeming it expedient to have a
king of his own nomination on the throne of that country, he deposed the
popularly elected monarch and placed his brother Eliakim or Jehoiakim on
the throne, whom he anticipated to be a mere obsequious vassal. The
course of events seems to have been this: on receiving intelligence
after the battle of the accession of Jehoahaz to the throne, and perhaps
also in consequence of the complaint which Eliakim brought before him in
regard to this matter, Necho set out with a part of his forces to
Jerusalem, while the remainder of his troops pursued their way at
leisure towards Riblah, laid a tribute on the country, raised Eliakim
(Jehoiakim) as his vassal to the throne, and on his departure brought
Jehoahaz captive with him to Riblah. The old expositors mostly assumed
that Necho, after the battle of Megiddo, marched directly against
Carchemish, and then on his return came to Jerusalem. The improbability,
indeed the impossibility, of his doing so appears from this: Carchemish
was from four hundred to five hundred miles from Megiddo, so that within
"three months" an army could not possibly make its way thither, conquer
the fenced city of Carchemish, and then march back a still greater
distance to Jerusalem, and take that city \[KEIL\].

an hundred talents of silver--Â£3418 15s.

and a talent of gold--Â£5475; total amount of tribute, Â£8893 15s.

carried him--Jehoahaz.

to Egypt--There he died ([Jer
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010).md).

[2 Chronicles 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 36:5</span></span>

JEHOIAKIM, REIGNING ILL, IS CARRIED INTO BABYLON. ([Ch2
36:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#005).md)

Jehoiakim . . . did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord--He
followed the course of his idolatrous predecessors; and the people, to a
great extent, disinclined to the reforming policy of his father, eagerly
availed themselves of the vicious license which his lax administration
restored. His character is portrayed with a masterly hand in the
prophecy of Jeremiah ([Jer 22:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md).
As the deputy of the king of Egypt, he departed further than his
predecessor from the principles of Josiah's government; and, in trying
to meet the insatiable cupidity of his master by grinding exactions from
his subjects, he recklessly plunged into all evil.

[2 Chronicles 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 36:6</span></span>

Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon--This refers to the
first expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Palestine, in the lifetime of
his father Nabopolassar, who, being old and infirm, adopted his son as
joint sovereign and despatched him, with the command of his army,
against the Egyptian invaders of his empire. Nebuchadnezzar defeated
them at Carchemish, drove them out of Asia, and reduced all the
provinces west of the Euphrates to obedience--among the rest the kingdom
of Jehoiakim, who became a vassal of the Assyrian empire ([Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md). Jehoiakim at the end of three
years threw off the yoke, being probably instigated to revolt by the
solicitations of the king of Egypt, who planned a new expedition against
Carchemish. But he was completely vanquished by the Babylonian king, who
stripped him of all his possessions between the Euphrates and the Nile
([Kg2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md). Then marching against the
Egyptian's ally in Judah, he took Jerusalem, carried away a portion of
the sacred vessels of the temple, perhaps in lieu of the unpaid tribute,
and deposited them in the temple of his god, Belus, at Babylon ([Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md); [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002).md). Though Jehoiakim had been taken
prisoner (and it was designed at first to transport him in chains to
Babylon), he was allowed to remain in his tributary kingdom. But having
given not long after some new offense, Jerusalem was besieged by a host
of Assyrian dependents. In a sally against them Jehoiakim was killed
(see on [Kg2 24:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md); also [Jer
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md); [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030).md).

[2 Chronicles 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 36:9</span></span>

Jehoiachin was eight years old--called also Jeconiah or Coniah ([Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024).md) --"eight" should have been
"eighteen," as appears from [Kg2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md),
and also from the full development of his ungodly principles and habits
(see [Eze 19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005).md). His reign being of
so short duration cannot be considered at variance with the prophetic
denunciation against his father ([Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030).md). But his appointment by the
people gave umbrage to Nebuchadnezzar, who, "when the year was expired"
([Ch2 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010).md) --that is, in the spring
when campaigns usually began--came in person against Jerusalem, captured
the city, and sent Jehoiachin in chains to Babylon, removing at the same
time all the nobles and most skilful artisans, and pillaging all the
remaining treasures both of the temple and palace (see on [Kg2
24:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008).md).

[2 Chronicles 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 36:11</span></span>

ZEDEKIAH'S REIGN. ([Ch2 36:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#011).md)

Zedekiah--Nebuchadnezzar appointed him. His name, originally Mattaniah,
was, according to the custom of Oriental conquerors, changed into
Zedekiah. Though the son of Josiah ([Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md); [Jer
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002.md); [Jer
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001).md), he is called the brother of
Jehoiachin ([Ch2 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010).md), that is,
according to the latitude of Hebrew style in words expressing affinity,
his relative or kinsman (see [Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018); 2Ki. 25:1-21.md).

[2 Chronicles 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 36:13</span></span>

who had made him swear by God--Zedekiah received his crown on the
express condition of taking a solemn oath of fealty to the king of
Babylon ([Eze 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013).md); so that his
revolt by joining in a league with Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt,
involved the crime of perjury. His own pride and obdurate impiety, the
incurable idolatry of the nation, and their reckless disregard of
prophetic warnings, brought down on his already sadly reduced kingdom
the long threatened judgments of God. Nebuchadnezzar, the executioner of
the divine vengeance, commenced a third siege of Jerusalem, which, after
holding out for a year and a half, was taken in the eleventh year of the
reign of Zedekiah. It resulted in the burning of the temple, with, most
probably, the ark, and in the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah (see on
[Kg2 25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md); [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md); [Eze
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016).md).

[2 Chronicles 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 36:21</span></span>

until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths--The return of every seventh was
to be held as a sabbatic year, a season of rest to all classes, even to
the land itself, which was to be fallow. This divine institution,
however, was neglected--how soon and how long, appears from the prophecy
of Moses (see on [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034).md), and of
Jeremiah in this passage (see [Jer
25:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009).md), which told that for divine
retribution it was now to remain desolate seventy years. As the Assyrian
conquerors usually colonized their conquered provinces, so remarkable a
deviation in Palestine from their customary policy must be ascribed to
the overruling providence of God.

[2 Chronicles 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 36:22</span></span>

CYRUS' PROCLAMATION. ([Ch2 36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022).md)

the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus--(See on [Ezr
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md).
