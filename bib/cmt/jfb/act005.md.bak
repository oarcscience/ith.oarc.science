### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA. ([Act 5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001).md)

kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it--The
coolness with which they planned the deception aggravated the guilt of
this couple.

brought a certain part--pretending it to be the whole proceeds of the
sale.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

why hath Satan filled--"why . . . fill--"why hast thou suffered him to
fill"

thine heart--so criminally entertaining his suggestion? Compare [Act
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md), "why hast thou conceived this
thing in thine heart?" And see [Joh
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md), [Joh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027.md).

to lie to the Holy Ghost--to men under His supernatural illumination.

[Acts 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 5:4</span></span>

While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it
not in thine own power?--from which we see how purely voluntary were all
these sacrifices for the support of the infant community.

not lied to men but God--to men so entirely the instruments of the
directing Spirit that the lie was rather told to Him: language clearly
implying both the distinct personality and the proper divinity of the
Holy Ghost.

[Acts 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 5:5</span></span>

Ananias . . . gave up the ghost . . . great fear came on all that heard
these things--on those without the Christian circle; who, instead of
disparaging the followers of the Lord Jesus, as they might otherwise
have done on the discovery of such hypocrisy, were awed at the manifest
presence of Divinity among them, and the mysterious power of throwing
off such corrupt matter which rested upon the young Church.

[Acts 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 5:6</span></span>

the young men--some of the younger and more active members of the
church, not as office-bearers, nor coming forward now for the first
time, but who probably had already volunteered their services in making
subordinate arrangements. In every thriving Christian community such
volunteers may be expected, and will be found eminently useful.

[Acts 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 5:7</span></span>

Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much--naming the sum.

[Acts 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 5:9</span></span>

How is it that ye have agreed together--(See on [Act
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002).md).

to tempt the Spirit--try whether they could escape detection by that
omniscient Spirit of whose supernatural presence with the apostles they
had had such full evidence.

feet of them that buried thy husband are at the door--How awfully
graphic!

[Acts 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 5:10</span></span>

buried her by her husband--The later Jews buried before sunset of the
day of death.

[Acts 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 5:11</span></span>

And great fear came upon all the church, &c.--This effect on the
Christian community itself was the chief design of so startling a
judgment; which had its counterpart, as the sin itself had, in Achan
(Jos. 7:1-26), while the time--at the commencement of a new career--was
similar.

[Acts 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 5:12</span></span>

THE PROGRESS OF THE NEW CAUSE LEADS TO THE ARREST OF THE APOSTLES--THEY
ARE MIRACULOUSLY DELIVERED FROM PRISON, RESUME THEIR TEACHING, BUT ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE THE SAMHEDRIM. ([Act
5:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012).md)

Solomon's Porch--(See on [Joh 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#023).md).

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

of the rest durst no man join himself, &c.--Of the unconverted none
ventured, after what had taken place, to profess discipleship; but yet
their number continually increased.

[Acts 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 5:15</span></span>

into the streets--"in every street."

on beds and couches--The words denote the softer couches of the rich and
the meaner cribs of the poor \[BENGEL\].

shadow of Peter . . . might overshadow some of them--Compare [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md); [Luk
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#046.md). So Elisha. Now the predicted
greatness of Peter ([Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md), as
the directing spirit of the early Church, was at its height.

[Acts 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 5:17</span></span>

sect of the Sadducees--See on [Act 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)
for the reason why this is specified.

[Acts 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 5:19</span></span>

by night--the same night.

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

all the words of this life--beautiful expression for that Life in the
Risen One which was the burden of their preaching!

[Acts 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 5:21</span></span>

entered into the temple, &c.--How self-possessed! the indwelling Spirit
raising them above fear.

called . . . all the senate, &c.--an unusually general convention,
though hastily summoned.

[Acts 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 5:23</span></span>

the prison . . . shut . . . keepers . . . before the doors, but . . . no
man within--the reverse of the miracle in [Act
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#026.md); a similar contrast to that of
the nets at the miraculous draughts of fishes ([Luk
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006.md); [Joh
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011).md).

[Acts 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 5:24</span></span>

they doubted--"were in perplexity."

[Acts 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 5:26</span></span>

without violence, for they feared, &c.--hardened ecclesiastics, all
unawed by the miraculous tokens of God's presence with the apostles, and
the fear of the mob only before their eyes!

[Acts 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 5:27</span></span>

SECOND APPEARANCE AND TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SAMHEDRIM--ITS RAGE CALMED BY
GAMALIEL--BEING DISMISSED, THEY DEPART REJOICING, AND CONTINUE THEIR
PREACHING. (Acts 5:27-42)

ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine--noble testimony to the
success of their preaching, and (for the reason mentioned on [Act
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004).md) to the truth of their testimony,
from reluctant lips!

[Acts 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 5:28</span></span>

intend to bring this man's blood upon us--They avoid naming Him whom
Peter gloried in holding up \[BENGEL\]. In speaking thus, they seem to
betray a disagreeable recollection of their own recent imprecation, His
blood be upon us," &c. ([Mat 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025).md),
and of the traitor's words as he threw down the money, "I have sinned in
that I have betrayed innocent blood" ([Mat
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#004).md).

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

Then Peter, &c.--(See on [Act 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md),
and [Act 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013), &c..md).

[Acts 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 5:31</span></span>

Prince and a Saviour--the first word expressing that Royalty which all
Israel looked for in Messiah, the second the Saving character of it
which they had utterly lost sight of. Each of these features in our
Lord's work enters into the other, and both make one glorious whole
(compare [Act 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md).

to give--dispensing as a "Prince."

repentance and remission of sins--as a "Saviour"; "repentance" embracing
all that change which issues in the faith which secures "forgiveness"
(compare [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md); [Act
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021).md). How gloriously is Christ here
exhibited; not, as in other places, as the Medium, but as the Dispenser
of all spiritual blessings!

[Acts 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 5:32</span></span>

we are his witnesses . . . and the Holy Ghost--They as competent human
witnesses to facts, and the Holy Ghost as attesting them by undeniable
miracles.

[Acts 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 5:33</span></span>

cut to the heart and took--"were taking."

counsel to slay them--How different this feeling and the effect of it
from that "pricking of the heart" which drew from the first converts on
the day of Pentecost the cry, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
([Act 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037).md). The words used in the two
places are strikingly different.

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

Then stood up . . . Gamaliel--in all probability one of that name
celebrated in the Jewish writings for his wisdom, the son of Simeon
(possibly the same who took the infant Saviour in his arms, [Luk
2:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025).md), and grandson of HILLEL,
another celebrated rabbi. He died eighteen years before the destruction
of Jerusalem \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[Acts 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 5:35</span></span>

Theudas--not the same with a deceiver of that name whom JOSEPHUS
mentions as heading an insurrection some twelve years after this
\[Antiquities, 20.5.1\], but some other of whom he makes no mention.
Such insurrections were frequent.

[Acts 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 5:37</span></span>

Judas of Galilee--(See on [Luk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md),
and [Luk 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001).md) \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 13.1.1\].

[Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 5:38</span></span>

if . . . of men, it will come to naught--This neutral policy was true
wisdom, in the then temper of the council. But individual neutrality is
hostility to Christ, as He Himself teaches ([Luk
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023).md).

[Acts 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 5:40</span></span>

beaten them--for disobeying their orders (compare [Luk
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016).md).

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

departed . . . rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
for his name--"thought worthy by God to be dishonored by man" ([Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md); [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md), [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016).md) \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. This
was their first taste of persecution, and it felt sweet for His sake
whose disciples they were.

[Acts 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 5:42</span></span>

in every house--in private. (See on [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046).md).

ceased not to preach Jesus Christ--that is, Jesus (to be the) Christ.
