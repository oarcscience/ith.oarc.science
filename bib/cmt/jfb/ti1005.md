### [1 Timothy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 5:1</span></span>

GENERAL DIRECTIONS AS TO HOW TIMOTHY SHOULD DEAL WITH DIFFERENT CLASSES
IN THE CHURCH. (1Ti. 5:1-25)

an elder--in age; probably not an elder in the ministry; these latter
are not mentioned till [Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017), "the
elders that rule." Compare [Act 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017),
"your old men," literally, "elders." Contrasted with "the younger men."
As Timothy was admonished so to conduct himself as to give no man reason
to despise his youth ([Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)); so
here he is told to bear in mind his youth, and to behave with the
modesty which becomes a young man in relation to his elders.

Rebuke not--literally, "Strike not hard upon"; Rebuke not sharply: a
different word from "rebuke" in [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002).

entreat--exhort.

as brethren--and therefore equals; not lording it over them ([Pe1
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)).

[1 Timothy 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 5:2</span></span>

with all purity--respectful treatment of the other sex will promote
"purity."

[1 Timothy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 5:3</span></span>

Honour--by setting on the church roll, as fit objects of charitable
sustenance ([Ti1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009), [Ti1
5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017); [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)). So "honor" is used for support
with necessaries ([Mat 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004), [Mat
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006); [Act
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#010)).

widows indeed-- ([Ti1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016)). Those
really desolate; not like those ([Ti1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004)) having children or relations
answerable for their support, nor like those (in [Ti1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006)) "who live in pleasure"; but such
as, from their earthly desolation as to friends, are most likely to
trust wholly in God, persevere in continual prayers, and carry out the
religious duties assigned to Church widows ([Ti1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005)). Care for widows was transferred
from the Jewish economy to the Christian ([Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011); [Deu
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017), [Deu
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019)).

[1 Timothy 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 5:4</span></span>

if any widow have children--not "a widow indeed," as having children who
ought to support her.

nephews--rather, as Greek, "descendants," or "grandchildren"
\[HESYCHIUS\]. "Nephews" in old English meant "grandchildren" \[HOOKER,
Ecclesiastical Polity, 5.20\].

let them--the children and descendants.

learn first--ere it falls to the Church to support them.

to show piety at home--filial piety towards their widowed mother or
grandmother, by giving her sustenance. Literally, "to show piety towards
their own house." "Piety is applied to the reverential discharge of
filial duties; as the parental relation is the earthly representation of
God our heavenly Father's relation to us. "Their own" stands in
opposition to the Church, in relation to which the widow is
comparatively a stranger. She has a claim on her own children, prior to
her claim on the Church; let them fulfil this prior claim which she has
on them, by sustaining her and not burdening the Church.

parents--Greek, (living) "progenitors," that is, their mother or
grandmother, as the case may be. "Let them learn," implies that abuses
of this kind had crept into the Church, widows claiming Church support
though they had children or grandchildren able to support them.

good and--The oldest manuscripts omit. The words are probably inserted
by a transcriber from [Ti1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003).

[1 Timothy 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 5:5</span></span>

widow indeed, and desolate--contrasted with her who has children or
grandchildren to support her ([Ti1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004)).

trusteth in God--perfect tense in Greek, "hath rested, and doth rest her
hope in God." [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005) adds another
qualification in a widow for Church maintenance, besides her being"
desolate" or destitute of children to support her. She must be not one
"that liveth in pleasure" ([Ti1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006)),
but one making God her main hope (the accusative in Greek expresses that
God is the ultimate aim whereto her hope is directed; whereas, [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010), dative expresses hope resting on
God as her present stay \[WIESINGER\]), and continuing constantly in
prayers. Her destitution of children and of all ties to earth would
leave her more unencumbered for devoting the rest of her days to God and
the Church ([Co1 7:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033)). Compare
also "Anna a widow," who remained unmarried after her husband's death
and "departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
prayers day and night" ([Luk 2:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036)).
Such a one, Paul implies, would be the fittest object for the Church's
help ([Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003)); for such a one is
promoting the cause of Christ's Church by her prayers for it. "Ardor in
prayers flows from hoping confidence in God" \[LEO\].

in supplications and prayers--Greek, "in her supplications and prayers";
the former signifies asking under a sense of need, the latter, prayer
(see on [Ti1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001); [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)).

night and day--another coincidence with Luke ([Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007), "cry day and night"); contrast
Satan's accusations "day and night" ([Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)).

[1 Timothy 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 5:6</span></span>

she that liveth in pleasure--the opposite of such a widow as is
described in [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005), and therefore
one utterly undeserving of Church charity. The Greek expresses wanton
prodigality and excess \[TITTMANN\]. The root expresses weaving at a
fast rate, and so lavish excess (see on [Jam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005)).

dead while she liveth--dead in the Spirit while alive in the flesh ([Mat
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)).

[1 Timothy 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 5:7</span></span>

these things--just now spoken ([Ti1
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005)).

that they may be blameless--namely, the widows supported by the Church.

[1 Timothy 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 5:8</span></span>

But--reverting to [Ti1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004), "If any (a
general proposition; therefore including in its application the widow's
children or grandchildren) provide not for his own (relations in
general), and especially for those of his own house (in particular), he
hath (practically) denied the faith." Faith without love and its works
is dead; "for the subject matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the
grace and truth of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit,
as he that loves gives up his heart" \[MACK\]. If in any case a duty of
love is plain, it is in relation to one's own relatives; to fail in so
plain an obligation is a plain proof of want of love, and therefore of
want of faith. "Faith does not set aside natural duties, but strengthens
them" \[BENGEL\].

worse than an infidel--because even an infidel (or unbeliever) is taught
by nature to provide for his own relatives, and generally recognizes the
duty; the Christian who does not so, is worse ([Mat
5:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046)). He has less excuse with his
greater light than the infidel who may break the laws of nature.

[1 Timothy 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 5:9</span></span>

Translate, "As a widow (that is, of the ecclesiastical order of
widowhood; a kind of female presbytery), let none be enrolled (in the
catalogue) who is less than sixty years old." These were not
deaconesses, who were chosen at a younger age (forty was the age fixed
at the Council of Chalcedon), and who had virgins (in a later age called
widows) as well as widows among them, but a band of widows set apart,
though not yet formally and finally, to the service of God and the
Church. Traces of such a class appear in [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041). Dorcas herself was such a one.
As it was expedient (see on [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002);
[Tit 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)) that the presbyter or bishop
should have been but once married, so also in her case. There is a
transition here to a new subject. The reference here cannot be, as in
[Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003), to providing Church
sustenance for them. For the restriction to widows above sixty would
then be needless and harsh, since many widows might be in need of help
at a much earlier age; as also the rule that the widow must not have
been twice married, especially since he himself, below ([Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)) enjoins the younger widows to
marry again; as also that she must have brought up children. Moreover,
[Ti1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010) presupposes some competence,
at least in past times, and so poor widows would be excluded, the very
class requiring charity. Also, [Ti1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011) would then be senseless, for then
their remarrying would be a benefit, not an injury, to the Church, as
relieving it of the burden of their sustenance. TERTULLIAN \[On the
Veiling of Virgins, 9\], HERMAS \[Shepherd, 1.2\], and CHRYSOSTOM
\[Homily, 31\], mention such an order of ecclesiastical widowhood, each
one not less than sixty years old, and resembling the presbyters in the
respect paid to them, and in some of their duties; they ministered with
sympathizing counsel to other widows and to orphans, a ministry to which
their own experimental knowledge of the feelings and sufferings of the
bereaved adapted them, and had a general supervision of their sex. Age
was doubtless a requisite in presbyters, as it is here stated to have
been in presbyteresses, with a view to their influence on the younger
persons of their sex They were supported by the Church, but not the only
widows so supported ([Ti1 5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003)).

wife of one man--in order not to throw a stumbling-block in the way of
Jews and heathen, who regarded with disfavor second marriages (see on
[Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)). This is the force of
"blameless," giving no offense, even in matters indifferent.

[1 Timothy 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 5:10</span></span>

for good works--Greek, "IN honourable (excellent) works"; the sphere or
element in which the good report of her had place ([Tit
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007)). This answers to [Ti1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007), as to the bishop or presbyter,
"He must have a good report of them which are without."

if--if, in addition to being "well reported of."

she . . . brought up children--either her own ([Ti1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012)), or those of others, which is
one of the "good works"; a qualification adapting her for ministry to
orphan children, and to mothers of families.

lodged strangers-- [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002), "given to
hospitality" ([Tit 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008)); in the case
of presbyters.

washed . . . saints' feet--after the example of the Lord ([Joh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014)); a specimen of the universal
spirit of humbly "by love serving one another," which actuated the early
Christians.

relieved the afflicted--whether by pecuniary or other relief.

followed . . . good-- ([Th1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015);
compare instances in [Mat 25:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035)).

[1 Timothy 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 5:11</span></span>

younger--than sixty years old ([Ti1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009)).

refuse--to take on the roll of presbyteress widows.

wax wanton--literally, "over-strong" ([Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016)).

against Christ--rebelling against Christ, their proper Bridegroom
\[JEROME\].

they will--Greek, "they wish"; their desire is to marry again.

[1 Timothy 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 5:12</span></span>

Having--Bringing on themselves, and so having to bear as a burden ([Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010)) judgment from God (compare [Ti1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006)), weighing like a load on them.

cast off their first faith--namely, pledged to Christ and the service of
the Church. There could be no hardship at the age of sixty or upwards in
not marrying again (end of [Ti1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009)),
for the sake of serving better the cause of Christ as presbyteresses;
though, to ordinary widows, no barrier existed against remarriage ([Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039)). This is altogether distinct
from Rome's unnatural vows of celibacy in the case of young marriageable
women. The widow-presbyteresses, moreover, engaged to remain single, not
as though single life were holier than married life (according to Rome's
teaching), but because the interests of Christ's cause made it desirable
(see on [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002)). They had pledged
"their first faith" to Christ as presbyteress widows; they now wish to
transfer their faith to a husband (compare [Co1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032), [Co1
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034)).

[1 Timothy 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 5:13</span></span>

withal--"at the same time, moreover."

learn--usually in a good sense. But these women's "learning" is
idleness, trifling, and busybodies' tattle.

wandering--Greek, "going about."

from house to house--of the members of the Church ([Ti2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006)). "They carry the affairs of this
house to that, and of that to this; they tell the affairs of all to all"
\[THEOPHYLACT\].

tattlers--literally "trifling talkers." In [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010), translated "prating."

busybodies--mischievously busy; inconsiderately curious ([Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011)). [Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019), "curious," the same Greek.
Curiosity usually springs from idleness, which is itself the mother of
garrulity \[CALVIN\].

speaking--not merely "saying." The subject-matter, as well as the form,
is involved in the Greek word \[ALFORD\].

which they ought not-- ([Tit 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011)).

[1 Timothy 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 5:14</span></span>

younger women--rather, as ellipsis ought to be supplied, "the younger
widows," namely younger widows in general, as distinguished from the
older widows taken on the roll of presbyteresses ([Ti1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009)). The "therefore" means seeing
that young widows are exposed to such temptations, "I will," or
"desire," &c. ([Ti1 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011)). The
precept here that they should marry again is not inconsistent with [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040); for the circumstances of the two
cases were distinct (compare [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026)). Here remarriage is recommended
as an antidote to sexual passion, idleness, and the other evils noted in
[Ti1 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011). Of course, where there
was no tendency to these evils, marriage again would not be so
requisite; Paul speaks of what is generally desirable, and supposing
there should be danger of such evils, as was likely. "He does not impose
a law, but points out a remedy, to younger widows" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

bear children-- ([Ti1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015)); thus
gaining one of the qualifications ([Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010)) for being afterwards a
presbyteress widow, should Providence so ordain it.

guide--Greek, "rule the house" in the woman's due place; not usurping
authority over the man ([Ti1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)).

give none occasion--literally, "starting-point": handle of reproach
through the loose conduct of nominal Christians.

the adversary--of Christianity, Jew or Gentile. [Phi
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028); [Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008), "He that is of the contrary
part." Not Satan, who is introduced in a different relation ([Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015)).

to speak reproachfully--literally, "for the sake of reproach" ([Ti1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007); [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005), [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010)). If the handle were given, the
adversary would use it for the sake of reproach. The adversary is eager
to exaggerate the faults of a few, and to lay the blame on the whole
Church and its doctrines \[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 5:15</span></span>

For--For in the case of some this result has already ensued; "Some
(widows) are already turned aside after Satan," the seducer (not by
falling away from the faith in general, but) by such errors as are
stigmatized in [Ti1 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011), sexual
passion, idleness, &c., and so have given occasion of reproach ([Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)). "Satan finds some mischief
still for the idle hands to do."

[1 Timothy 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 5:16</span></span>

If any . . . have widows--of his family, however related to him. Most of
the oldest manuscripts and versions omit "man or," and read, "If any
woman that believeth." But the Received text seems preferable. If,
however, the weightiest authorities are to prevail, the sense will be:
He was speaking of younger widows; He now says, If any believing young
widow have widows related to her needing support, let her relieve them,
thereby casing the Church of the burden, [Ti1
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003) (there it was the children and
grandchildren; here it is the young widow, who, in order to avoid the
evils of idleness and wantonness, the result of idleness, [Ti1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011), [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013); [Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049), is to be diligent in good
works, such as "relieving the afflicted," [Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010), thus qualifying herself for
being afterwards a widow-presbyteress).

let them--rather as Greek, "let him," or "her"; "let such a one" ([Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010)).

be charged--literally, "be burdened" with their support.

widows indeed--really helpless and friendless ([Ti1
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003)).

[1 Timothy 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 5:17</span></span>

The transition from the widow presbyteresses ([Ti1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009)) to the presbyters here, is
natural.

rule well--literally, "preside well," with wisdom, ability, and loving
faithfulness, over the flock assigned to them.

be counted worthy of double honour--that is, the honor which is
expressed by gifts ([Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003), [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018)) and otherwise. If a presbyter as
such, in virtue of his office, is already worthy of honor, he who rules
well is doubly so \[WIESINGER\] ([Co1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014); [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006); [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)). Not literally that a presbyter
who rules well should get double the salary of one who does not rule
well \[ALFORD\], or of a presbyteress widow, or of the deacons
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]. "Double" is used for large in general ([Rev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006)).

specially they who labour in the word and doctrine--Greek, "teaching";
preaching of the word, and instruction, catechetical or otherwise. This
implies that of the ruling presbyters there were two kinds, those who
labored in the word and teaching, and those who did not. Lay presbyters,
so called merely because of their age, have no place here; for both
classes mentioned here alike are ruling presbyters. A college of
presbyters is implied as existing in each large congregation. As in 1Ti.
3:1-16 their qualifications are spoken of, so here the acknowledgments
due to them for their services.

[1 Timothy 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 5:18</span></span>

the scripture-- ([Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004); quoted
before in [Co1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009)).

the ox that treadeth out--Greek, An ox while treading.

The labourer is worthy of his reward--or "hire"; quoted from [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007), whereas [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010) has "his meat," or "food." If
Paul extends the phrase, "Scripture saith," to this second clause, as
well as to the first, he will be hereby recognizing the Gospel of Luke,
his own helper (whence appears the undesigned appositeness of the
quotation), as inspired Scripture. This I think the correct view. The
Gospel according to Luke was probably in circulation then about eight or
nine years. However, it is possible "Scripture saith" applies only to
the passage quoted from [Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004); and
then his quotation will be that of a common proverb, quoted also by the
Lord, which commends itself to the approval of all, and is approved by
the Lord and His apostle.

Against an elder--a presbyter of the Church.

receive not--"entertain not" \[ALFORD\].

but before two or three witnesses--A judicial conviction was not
permitted in [Deu 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015), except on the testimony of at
least two or three witnesses (compare [Mat
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016); [Joh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001); [Jo1
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)). But Timothy's entertaining an
accusation against anyone is a different case, where the object was not
judicially to punish, but to admonish: here he might ordinarily
entertain it without the need of two or three witnesses; but not in the
case of an elder, since the more earnest an elder was to convince
gainsayers ([Tit 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009)), the more
exposed would he be to vexatious and false accusations. How important
then was it that Timothy should not, without strong testimony, entertain
a charge against presbyters, who should, in order to be efficient, be
"blameless" ([Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)). [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021), [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024) imply that Timothy had the power
of judging in the Church. Doubtless he would not condemn any save on the
testimony of two or three witnesses, but in ordinary cases he would cite
them, as the law of Moses also allowed, though there were only one
witness. But in the case of elders, he would require two or three
witnesses before even citing them; for their character for innocence
stands higher, and they are exposed to envy and calumny more than others
"Receive" does not, as ALFORD thinks, include both citation and
conviction, but means only the former.

Them that sin--whether presbyters or laymen.

rebuke before all--publicly before the Church ([Mat
18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015); [Co1
5:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011)). Not until this "rebuke" was
disregarded was the offender to be excommunicated.

others . . . fear--that other members of the Church may have a wholesome
fear of offending ([Deu 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#011); [Act
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011)).

I charge thee--rather as Greek, "I adjure thee"; so it ought to be
translated ([Ti2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001)).

before--"in the presence of God."

Lord--omitted in the oldest manuscripts God the Father, and Christ the
Son, will testify against thee, if thou disregardest my injunction. He
vividly sets before Timothy the last judgment, in which God shall be
revealed, and Christ seen face to face with His angels

elect angels--an epithet of reverence. The objects of divine electing
love ([Pe1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006)). Not only "elect"
(according to the everlasting purpose of God) in contradistinction to
the reprobate angels ([Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)), but
also to mark the excellence of the angels in general (as God's chosen
ministers, "holy angels," "angels of light"), and so to give more
solemnity to their testimony \[CALVIN\] as witnesses to Paul's
adjuration. Angels take part by action and sympathy in the affairs of
the earth ([Luk 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010); [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)).

these things--the injunctions, [Ti1
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019).

without preferring one before another--rather as Greek, "prejudice";
"judging before" hearing all the facts of a case. There ought to be
judgment, but not prejudging. Compare "suddenly," [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022), also [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024).

partiality--in favor of a man, as "prejudice" is bias against a man.
Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "in the way of summoning (brethren)
before a (heathen) judge." But Vulgate and other good authorities favor
the more probable reading in English Version.

[1 Timothy 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti1 5:22</span></span>

Lay hands--that is, ordain ([Ti1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014);
[Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006); [Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)). The connection is with [Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019). The way to guard against
scandals occurring in the case of presbyters is, be cautious as to the
character of the candidate before ordaining him; this will apply to
other Church officers so ordained, as well as to presbyters. Thus, this
clause refers to [Ti1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019), as next
clause, "neither be partaker of other men's sins," refers to [Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020). ELLICOTT and WIESINGER
understand it of receiving back into Church fellowship or absolution, by
laying hands on those who had been "rebuked" ([Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020)) and then excommunicated ([Mat
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017)); [Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020) favors this. But as in [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014), and [Act
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006); [Act
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003); [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006), the laying on of hands is used of
ordination (compare however as to confirmation, [Act
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017)), it seems better to take it so
here.

suddenly--hastily: [Ti1 5:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024) show
that waiting for a time is salutary.

neither be partaker of other men's sins--by negligence in ordaining
ungodly candidates, and so becoming in some degree responsible for their
sins. Or, there is the same transition from the elders to all in general
who may sin, as in [Ti1 5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019). Be
not a partaker in other men's sins by not "rebuking them that sin before
all," as well as those that are candidates for the presbytery, as also
all "that sin."

keep thyself pure--"thyself' is emphatic. "Keep THYSELF" clear of
participation in OTHER men's sin by not failing to rebuke them that sin
([Ti1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020)). Thus the transition is
easy to [Ti1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023), which is concerning
Timothy personally; compare also [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024).

[1 Timothy 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ti1 5:23</span></span>

no longer--as a habit. This injunction to drink wine occasionally is a
modification of the preceding "keep thyself pure." The presbyter and
deacon were enjoined to be "not given to wine" ([Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003), [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)). Timothy seems to have had a
tendency to undue ascetical strictness on this point (compare Note, see
on [Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008); compare the Nazarene vow,
[Num 6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001); John the Baptist, [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015); Rom. 14). Paul therefore
modifies the preceding words, "keep thyself pure," virtually saying,
"Not that I mean to enjoin that kind of purity which consists in
asceticism, nay, be no longer a water-drinker," that is, no longer drink
only water, but use a little wine, as much as is needed for thy health.
So ELLICOTT and WIESINGER. ALFORD thus: Timothy was of a feeble frame
(see on [Co1 16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)), and prone to
timidity in his duties as overseer where vigorous action was needed;
hence Paul exhorts him to take all proper means to raise his bodily
condition above these infirmities. God hereby commands believers to use
all due means for preserving health, and condemns by anticipation the
human traditions which among various sects have denied the use of wine
to the faithful.

[1 Timothy 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti1 5:24</span></span>

Two kinds of sins are specified: those palpably manifest (so the Greek
for "open beforehand" ought to be translated; so in [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014), it is translated "evident";
literally, "before" the eyes, that is, notorious), further explained as
"going before to judgment"; and those which follow after the men ("some
men they, that is, their sins, follow after"), namely, not going
beforehand, loudly accusing, but hidden till they come to the judgment:
so [Ti1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025), the good works are of
two classes: those palpably manifest (translate so, instead of "manifest
beforehand") and "those that are otherwise," that is, not palpably
manifest. Both alike "cannot be hid"; the former class in the case of
bad and good are manifest already; the latter class in the case of both
are not manifest now, but shall be so at the final judgment.

going before to judgment--as heralds; crying sins which accuse their
perpetrator. The connection seems to me this: He had enjoined Timothy,
[Ti1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020), "Rebuke them that sin
before all": and in [Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022),
"Neither be partaker of other men's sins," by ordaining ungodly men;
having then by a digression at the clause, "keep thyself pure," guarded
against an ascetical error of Timothy in fancying purity consisted in
asceticism, and having exhorted him to use wine for strengthening him in
his work, he returns to the subject of his being vigorous as an overseer
in rebuking sin, whether in presbyters or people, and in avoiding
participation in men's sins by ordaining ungodly candidates. He says,
therefore, there are two classes of sins, as there are two classes of
good works: those palpably manifest, and those not so; the former are
those on which thou shouldest act decidedly at once when called on,
whether to rebuke in general, or to ordain ministers in particular; as
to the latter, the final judgment alone can decide; however hidden now
they "cannot be hid" then. This could only be said of the final judgment
([Co1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005); therefore, ALFORD'S
reference of this verse to Timothy's judgment in choosing elders must be
wrong); all judgments before then are fallible. Thus he implies that
Timothy can only be responsible if he connive at manifest, or evident
sins; not that those that are otherwise shall escape judgment at last:
just as in the case of good works, he can only be responsible for taking
into account in his judgments those which are patent to all, not those
secret good works which nevertheless will not remain hidden at the final
judgment.
