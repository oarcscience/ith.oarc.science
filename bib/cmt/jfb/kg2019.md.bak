### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 19:1</span></span>

HEZEKIAH IN DEEP AFFLICTION. ([Kg2
19:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001).md)

when king Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes--The rending of his
clothes was a mode of expressing horror at the daring blasphemy--the
assumption of sackcloth a sign of his mental distress--his entrance into
the temple to pray the refuge of a pious man in affliction--and the
forwarding an account of the Assyrian's speech to Isaiah was to obtain
the prophet's counsel and comfort. The expression in which the message
was conveyed described, by a strong figure, the desperate condition of
the kingdom, together with their own inability to help themselves; and
it intimated also a hope, that the blasphemous defiance of Jehovah's
power by the impious Assyrian might lead to some direct interposition
for the vindication of His honor and supremacy to all heathen gods.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 19:4</span></span>

the living God--"The living God" is a most significant expression taken
in connection with the senseless deities that Rab-shakeh boasted were
unable to resist his master's victorious arms.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 19:6</span></span>

COMFORTED BY ISAIAH. ([Kg2 19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006).md)

Isaiah said . . . Be not afraid--The prophet's answer was most cheering,
as it held out the prospect of a speedy deliverance from the invader.
The blast, the rumor, the fall by the sword, contained a brief
prediction that was soon fulfilled in all the three particulars--namely,
the alarm that hastened his retreat, the destruction that overtook his
army, and the violent death that suddenly ended his career.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 19:8</span></span>

SENNACHERIB SENDS A BLASPHEMOUS LETTER TO HEZEKIAH. ([Kg2
19:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008).md)

So Rab-shakeh . . . found the king of Assyria warring against
Libnah--Whether Lachish had fallen or not, is not said. But Sennacherib
had transferred his battering-rams against the apparently neighboring
fortress of Libnah ([Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md);
compare [Jos 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#031.md); [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042).md), where the chief-cup-bearer
reported the execution of his mission.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 19:9</span></span>

when he heard say of Tirhakah . . ., Behold, he is come out to fight
against thee, &c.--This was the "rumor" to which Isaiah referred \[[Kg2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007.md)\]. Tirhakah reigned in Upper
Egypt, while So (or Sabaco) ruled in Lower Egypt. He was a powerful
monarch, another Sesostris, and both he and Sabaco have left many
monuments of their greatness. The name and figure of Tirhakah receiving
war captives, are still seen in the Egyptian temple of Medinet Abou.
This was the expected succor which was sneered at by Rab-shakeh as "a
bruised reed" ([Kg2 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021).md). Rage
against Hezekiah for allying himself with Egypt, or the hope of being
better able to meet this attack from the south, induced him, after
hearing the rumor of Tirhakah's advance, to send a menacing letter to
Hezekiah, in order that he might force the king of Judah to an immediate
surrender of his capital. This letter, couched in the same vaunting and
imperious style as the speech of Rab-shakeh, exceeded it in blasphemy,
and contained a larger enumeration of conquered places, with the view of
terrifying Hezekiah and showing him the utter hopelessness of all
attempts at resistance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 19:14</span></span>

HEZEKIAH'S PRAYER. (2Ki. 19:14-34)

Hezekiah received the letter . . . and went up into the house of the
Lord--Hezekiah, after reading it, hastened into the temple, spread it in
the childlike confidence of faith before the Lord, as containing taunts
deeply affecting the divine honor, and implored deliverance from this
proud defier of God and man. The devout spirit of this prayer, the
recognition of the Divine Being in the plenitude of His majesty--so
strikingly contrasted with the fancy of the Assyrians as to His merely
local power; his acknowledgment of the conquests obtained over other
lands; and of the destruction of their wooden idols which, according to
the Assyrian practice, were committed to the flames--because their
tutelary deities were no gods; and the object for which he supplicated
the divine interposition--that all the kingdoms of the earth might know
that the Lord was the only God--this was an attitude worthy to be
assumed by a pious theocratic king of the chosen people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 19:20</span></span>

Then Isaiah . . . sent--A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the
prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic
message consisted of three different portions:--First, Sennacherib is
apostrophized ([Kg2 19:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021).md) in a
highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity,
haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot.
Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed ([Kg2
19:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#029).md), and a sign is given him of
the promised deliverance--namely, that for two years the presence of the
enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the
third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and
vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of
Sennacherib's invasion is announced ([Kg2
19:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 19:33</span></span>

shall not come into this city--nor approach near enough to shoot an
arrow, not even from the most powerful engine which throws missiles to
the greatest distance, nor shall he occupy any part of the ground before
the city by a fence, a mantelet, or covering for men employed in a
siege, nor cast (raise) a bank (mound) of earth, overtopping the city
walls, whence he may see and command the interior of the city. None of
these, which were the principal modes of attack followed in ancient
military art, should Sennacherib be permitted to adopt. Though the army
under Rab-shakeh marched towards Jerusalem and encamped at a little
distance with a view to blockade it, they delayed laying siege to it,
probably waiting till the king, having taken Lachish and Libnah, should
bring up his detachment, that with all the combined forces of Assyria
they might invest the capital. So determined was this invader to conquer
Judah and the neighboring countries ([Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007).md), that nothing but a divine
interposition could have saved Jerusalem. It might be supposed that the
powerful monarch who overran Palestine and carried away the tribes of
Israel, would leave memorials of his deeds on sculptured slabs, or
votive bulls. A long and minute account of this expedition is contained
in the Annals of Sennacherib, a translation of which has recently been
made into English, and, in his remarks upon it, COLONEL RAWLINSON says
the Assyrian version confirms the most important features of the
Scripture account. The Jewish and Assyrian narratives of the campaign
are, indeed, on the whole, strikingly illustrative of each other
\[Outlines of Assyrian History\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 19:35</span></span>

AN ANGEL DESTROYS THE ASSYRIANS. ([Kg2
19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md)

in the morning . . . they were all dead corpses--It was the miraculous
interposition of the Almighty that defended Jerusalem. As to the
secondary agent employed in the destruction of the Assyrian army, it is
most probable that it was effected by a hot south wind, the simoon, such
as to this day often envelops and destroys whole caravans. This
conjecture is supported by [Kg2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007.md)
and [Jer 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md). The destruction was
during the night; the officers and soldiers, being in full security,
were negligent; their discipline was relaxed; the camp guards were not
alert, or perhaps they themselves were the first taken off, and those
who slept, not wrapped up, imbibed the poison plentifully. If this had
been an evening of dissolute mirth (no uncommon thing in a camp), their
joy (perhaps for a victory), or "the first night of their attacking the
city," says JOSEPHUS, became, by its effects, one means of their
destruction \[CALMET, Fragments\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 19:36</span></span>

So Sennacherib king of Assyria . . . went and returned--the same way as
he came ([Kg2 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#033).md). The route is
described ([Isa 10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028).md). The early
chariot track near Beyrout is on the rocky edge of Lebanon, which is
skirted by the ancient Lycus (Nahr-el Kelb). On the perpendicular face
of the limestone rock, at different heights, are seen slabs with
Assyrian inscriptions, which having been deciphered, are found to
contain the name of Sennacherib. Thus, by the preservation of these
tablets, the wrath of the Assyrian invaders is made to praise the Lord.

dwelt at Nineveh--This statement implies a considerable period of time,
and his Annals carry on his history at least five years after his
disastrous campaign at Jerusalem. No record of his catastrophe can be
found, as the Assyrian practice was to record victories alone. The
sculptures give only the sunny side of the picture.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 19:37</span></span>

SENNACHERIB SLAIN. ([Kg2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037).md)

as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch--Assarae, or Asshur, the
head of the Assyrian Pantheon, represented not as a vulture-headed
figure (that is now ascertained to be a priest), but as a winged figure
in a circle, which was the guardian deity of Assyria. The king is
represented on the monuments standing or kneeling beneath this figure,
his hand raised in sign of prayer or adoration.

his sons smote him with the sword--Sennacherib's temper, exasperated
probably by his reverses, displayed itself in the most savage cruelty
and intolerable tyranny over his subjects and slaves, till at length he
was assassinated by his two sons, whom, it is said, he intended to
sacrifice to pacify the gods and dispose them to grant him a return of
prosperity. The parricides taking flight into Armenia, a third son,
Esar-haddon, ascended the throne.
