### [Psalms Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 11:1</span></span>

On title, see Introduction. Alluding to some event in his history, as in
[Sa1 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#013.md), the Psalmist avows his
confidence in God, when admonished to flee from his raging persecutors,
whose destruction of the usual foundations of safety rendered all his
efforts useless. The grounds of his confidence are God's supreme
dominion, His watchful care of His people, His hatred to the wicked and
judgments on them, and His love for righteousness and the righteous.
([Psa 11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001).md)

my soul--me ([Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002).md).

Flee--literally, "flee ye"; that is, he and his companion.

as a bird to your mountain--having as such no safety but in flight
(compare [Sa1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020.md); [Lam
3:52](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#052).md).

[Psalms 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 11:2</span></span>

privily--literally, "in darkness," treacherously.

[Psalms 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 11:3</span></span>

Literally, "The foundations (that is, of good order and law) will be
destroyed, what has the righteous done (to sustain them)?" All his
efforts have failed.

[Psalms 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 11:4</span></span>

temple . . . heaven--The connection seems to denote God's heavenly
residence; the term used is taken from the place of His visible earthly
abode ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md); [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md). Thence He inspects men with
close scrutiny.

[Psalms 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 11:5</span></span>

The trial of the righteous results in their approval, as it is
contrasted with God's hatred to the wicked.

[Psalms 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 11:6</span></span>

Their punishment is described by vivid figures denoting abundant,
sudden, furious, and utter destruction (compare [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md); [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md); [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md); [Psa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015).md).

cup--is a frequent figure for God's favor or wrath ([Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md); [Mat
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022).md).

[Psalms 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 11:7</span></span>

his countenance--literally, "their faces," a use of the plural applied
to God, as in [Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md); [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md); [Gen
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007.md); [Isa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008.md), &c., denoting the fulness of His
perfections, or more probably originating in a reference to the trinity
of persons. "Faces" is used as "eyes" ([Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004).md), expressing here God's
complacency towards the upright (compare [Psa
34:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015).md).
