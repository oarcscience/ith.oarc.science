### [Jeremiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 48:1</span></span>

PROPHECY AGAINST MOAB. (Jer. 48:1-47)

Nebo--a mountain and town of Moab; its meaning is "that which
fructifies."

Kiriathaim--a city of Moab, consisting of two cities, as the word
signifies; originally held by the Emim ([Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005).md).

Misgab--meaning "elevation." It lay on an elevation.

[Jeremiah 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 48:2</span></span>

no more praise-- ([Isa 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014).md).

in Heshbon--The foe having taken Heshbon, the chief city of Moab ([Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045).md), in it devise evil against Moab
("it") saying, Come," &c. Heshbon was midway between the rivers Arnon
and Jabbok; it was the residence of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and
afterwards a Levitical city in Gad ([Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026).md). There is a play on words in
the Hebrew, "Heshbon, Hashbu." Heshbon means a place of devising or
counsel. The city, heretofore called the seat of counsel, shall find
other counsellors, namely, those who devise its destruction.

thou shall be cut down . . . Madmen--rather, by a play on words on the
meaning of madmen ("silence"), Thou shalt be brought to silence, so as
well to deserve thy name ([Isa 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md).
Thou shalt not dare to utter a sound.

[Jeremiah 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 48:3</span></span>

Horonaim--the same as the city Avara, mentioned by PTOLEMY. The word
means "double caves" ([Neh 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md); [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 48:4</span></span>

little ones . . . cry--heightening the distress of the scene. The foe
does not spare even infants.

[Jeremiah 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 48:5</span></span>

going up of Luhith . . . going down of Horonaim--Horonaim lay in a
plain, Luhith on a height. To the latter, therefore, the Moabites would
flee with "continual weeping," as a place of safety from the Chaldeans.
Literally, "Weeping shall go up upon weeping."

[Jeremiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 48:6</span></span>

They exhort one another to flee.

heath--or the juniper (see on [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006).md). MAURER translates, "Be like one
naked in the wilderness." But the sense is, Live in the wilderness like
the heath, or juniper; do not "trust in" walls ([Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007).md) \[GROTIUS\]. (Compare [Mat
24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 48:7</span></span>

thy works--namely, fortifications built by thy work. Moab was famous for
its fortresses ([Jer 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018).md). The
antithesis is to [Jer 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006.md), "Be . . .
in the wilderness," where there are no fortified cities.

thou . . . also--like the rest of the surrounding peoples, Judah, &c.

Chemosh--the tutelary god of Moab ([Num
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md); [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md); [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md). When a people were vanquished,
their gods also were taken away by the victors ([Jer
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 48:8</span></span>

the valley . . . shall perish--that is, those dwelling in the valley.

[Jeremiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 48:9</span></span>

Give wings, &c.-- ([Psa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006).md). Unless
it get wings, it cannot escape the foe. "Wings," the Hebrew root meaning
is a "flower" ([Job 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002).md); so the
flower-like plumage of a bird.

[Jeremiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 48:10</span></span>

work of . . . Lord--the divinely appointed utter devastation of Moab. To
represent how entirely this is God's will, a curse is pronounced on the
Chaldeans, the instrument, if they do it negligently (Margin) or by
halves ([Jdg 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023).md); compare Saul's sin
as to Amalek ([Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md), [Sa1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009).md), and Ahab's as to Syria ([Kg1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042).md).

[Jeremiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 48:11</span></span>

settled on . . . lees--(See on [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md); [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012).md). As wine left to settle on its
own lees retains its flavor and strength (which it would lose by being
poured from one vessel into another), so Moab, owing to its never having
been dislodged from its settlements, retains its pride of strength
unimpaired.

emptied from vessel, &c.--To make it fit for use, it used to be filtered
from vessel to vessel.

scent--retaining the image: the bouquet or perfume of the wine.

[Jeremiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 48:12</span></span>

wanderers--rather, "pourers out," retaining the image of [Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md), that is, the Chaldeans who
shall remove Moab from his settlements, as men pour wine from off the
lees into other vessels. "His vessels" are the cities of Moab; the
broken "bottles" the men slain \[GROTIUS\]. The Hebrew and the kindred
Arabic word means, "to turn on one side," so as to empty a vessel
\[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 48:13</span></span>

ashamed--have the shame of disappointment as to the hopes they
entertained of aid from Chemosh, their idol.

Beth-el-- ([Kg1 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027.md), [Kg1
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029).md) --that is, the golden calf set
up there by Jeroboam.

[Jeremiah 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 48:15</span></span>

gone up . . . gone down--in antithesis.

out of her cities--Rather, "Moab . . . and her cities are gone up,"
namely, pass away in the ascending smoke of their conflagration ([Jos
8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#020.md); [Jdg
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040).md). When this took place, the
young warriors would go down from the burning citadels only to meet
their own slaughter \[GROTIUS\]. English Version is somewhat favored by
the fact that "gone out" is singular, and "cities" plural. The
antithesis favors GROTIUS.

[Jeremiah 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 48:16</span></span>

near--to the prophet's eye, though probably twenty-three years elapsed
between the utterance of the prophecy in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
([Kg2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md) and its fulfilment in the
fifth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 48:17</span></span>

bemoan--Not that Moab deserves pity, but this mode of expression
pictures more vividly the grievousness of Moab's calamities.

all ye that know his name--those at a greater distance whom the fame of
Moab's "name" had reached, as distinguished from those "about him," that
is, near.

strong staff . . . rod--Moab is so called as striking terror into and
oppressing other peoples ([Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md);
[Isa 14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004).md); also because of its
dignity and power ([Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md); [Zac
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 48:18</span></span>

([Isa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001).md).

dost inhabit--now so securely settled as if in a lasting habitation.

thirst--Dibon, being situated on the Arnon, abounded in water ([Isa
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009).md). In sad contrast with this, and
with her "glory" in general, she shall be reduced not only to shame, but
to the want of the commonest necessaries ("thirst") in the arid
wilderness ([Jer 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 48:19</span></span>

Aroer--on the north bank of the Arnon, a city of Ammon ([Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012).md). As it was on "the way" of the
Moabites who fled into the desert, its inhabitants "ask" what is the
occasion of Moab's flight, and so learn the lot that awaits themselves
(compare [Sa1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#013.md), [Sa1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 48:20</span></span>

Answer of the fleeing Moabites to the Ammonite inquirers ([Jer
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#019.md); [Isa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002).md). He enumerates the Moabite
cities at length, as it seemed so incredible that all should be so
utterly ruined. Many of them were assigned to the Levites, while Israel
stood.

in Arnon--the north boundary between Moab and Ammon ([Jer
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#019.md); [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 48:21</span></span>

plain-- ([Jer 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008).md). Not only the
mountainous regions, but also the plain, shall be wasted.

Holon--(Compare [Jos 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#051).md).

Jahazah-- ([Num 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md); [Isa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004).md).

Mephaath-- ([Jos 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md); [Jos
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#037).md).

[Jeremiah 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 48:22</span></span>

Beth-diblathaim--"the house of Diblathaim": Almon-diblathaim ([Num
33:46](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046).md); "Diblath" ([Eze
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#013).md); not far from Mount Nebo ([Num
33:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046).md).

[Jeremiah 48:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 48:23</span></span>

Beth-gamul--meaning "the city of camels."

Beth-meon--"the house of habitation": Beth-baalmeon ([Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017).md). Now its ruins are called Miun.

[Jeremiah 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 48:24</span></span>

Kerioth-- ([Jos 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025.md); [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002).md).

Bozrah--(See on [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md); at one
time under the dominion of Edom, though belonging originally to Moab
([Gen 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md); [Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md). Others think the Bozrah in Edom
distinct from that of Moab. "Bezer" ([Jos
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036).md).

[Jeremiah 48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 48:25</span></span>

horn--the emblem of strength and sovereignty: it is the horned animal's
means of offense and defense ([Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md), [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md); [Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 48:26</span></span>

drunken--(see on [Jer 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md); [Jer
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017).md). Intoxicated with the cup of
divine wrath, so as to be in helpless distraction.

magnified . . . against . . . Lord--boasted arrogantly against God's
people, that whereas Israel was fallen, Moab remained flourishing.

wallow in . . . vomit--following up the image of a drunken man, that is,
shall be so afflicted by God's wrath as to disgorge all his past pride,
riches, and vainglory, and fall in his shameful abasement.

he also . . . derision--He in his disaster shall be an object of
derision to us, as we in ours have been to him ([Jer
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027).md). Retribution in kind.

[Jeremiah 48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 48:27</span></span>

([Zep 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md).

a derision--The Hebrew has the article: referring to [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md), "Was not Israel (the whole
nation) the object of derision to thee?" Therefore, Moab is to suffer as
formerly for its exultation over the calamity ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006).md) of the ten tribes under the
Assyrian Shalmaneser (Isa. 15:1-16:14), so now for its exultation over
the fall of Judah, under the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar. God takes up His
people's cause as His own ([Oba
1:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013).md).

was he . . . among thieves-- ([Jer
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026).md). Proverbial. What did Israel do
to deserve such derision? Was he detected in theft, that thou didst so
exult over him in speaking of him? Though guilty before God, Israel was
guiltless towards thee.

since--"since ever" thou didst begin speaking of him.

skippedst for joy--at Israel's calamity \[CALVIN\]; or, "thou didst
shake thy head" in "derision" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 48:28</span></span>

Doves often have their nests in the "sides" of caverns. No longer shalt
thou have cities to shelter thee: thou shalt have to flee for shelter to
caves and deserts ([Psa 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006.md), [Psa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#008.md); [Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 48:29</span></span>

pride-- ([Isa 16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006).md). Moab was the
trumpeter of his own fame. Jeremiah adds "loftiness and arrogancy" to
Isaiah's picture, so that Moab had not only not been bettered by the
chastisement previously endured as foretold by Isaiah, but had even
become worse; so that his guilt, and therefore his sentence of
punishment, are increased now. Six times Moab's pride (or the synonyms)
are mentioned, to show the exceeding hatefulness of his sin.

[Jeremiah 48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 48:30</span></span>

I know--Moab's "proud arrogancy" ([Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029).md) or "wrath," against My people,
is not unknown to Me.

it shall not be so--The result shall not be so as he thinks: his lies
shall not so effect what he aims at by them. CALVIN translates, "his
lies are not right (that is, his vauntings are vain because God will not
give them effect); they shall not do so" as they project in their minds,
for God will set at naught their plans.

[Jeremiah 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 48:31</span></span>

I will cry . . . for . . . Moab--Not that it deserves pity, but the
prophet's "crying" for it vividly represents the greatness of the
calamity.

Kir-heres--Kir-hareseth, in [Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md);
see on [Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md). It means "the city
of potters," or else "the city of the sun" \[GROTIUS\]. Here "the men of
Kir-heres" are substituted for "the foundations of Kir-hareseth," in
[Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md). The change answers probably
to the different bearing of the disaster under Nebuchadnezzar, as
compared with that former one under Shalmaneser.

[Jeremiah 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 48:32</span></span>

with the weeping--with the same weeping as Jazer, now vanquished, wept
with for the destruction of its vines. The same calamity shall befall
thee, Sibmah, as befell Jazer. The Hebrew preposition here is different
from that in [Isa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md), for which
reason MAURER translates, "with more than the weeping of Jazer." English
Version understands it of the continuation of the weeping; after they
have wept for Jazer, fresh subject of lamentation will present itself
for the wasting of the vine-abounding Sibmah.

plants . . . gone over . . . sea of Jazer--As the Septuagint reads
"cities of Jazer," and as no traces of a lake near Jazer are found, the
reading of English Version is doubtful. Retaining the present reading,
we avoid the difficulty by translating \[GROTIUS\], "Thy plants (that
is, citizens: alluding to the 'vine') are gone over the sea (that is,
shall be transported beyond the sea to Cyprus, and such distant lands
subject to Babylon; and this, too, in summertime), whereas Jazer (that
is, the men of Jazer) reached the sea" (shore only, but are not
transported beyond the sea); so that worse shall befall thee than
befalls Jazer.

spoiler--Nebuzara-dan.

[Jeremiah 48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 48:33</span></span>

the plentiful field--rather, "Carmel": as the parallel "land of Moab"
requires, though in [Isa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010.md), it is
"the plentiful field." Joy is taken away as from the nearer regions
(Canaan and Palestine), so from the farther "land of Moab"; what has
happened to Judah shall befall Moab, too ([Jer
48:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026).md) \[MAURER\]. However, Moab
alone seems to be spoken of here; nor does the parallelism forbid
"plentiful field" answering to "Moab." English Version is therefore
better.

shouting--repeated; as at the conclusion of the vintage, men sing over
and over again the same cry of joy. A shouting shall be heard, but not
the joyous shouting of laborers treading the grapes, but the terrible
battle cry of the foe.

[Jeremiah 48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 48:34</span></span>

From the cry of Heshbon, &c.--Those who fly from Heshbon on its capture
shall continue the cry even as far as Elealeh . . . . There will be
continued cries in all quarters, from one end to the other, everywhere
slaughter and wasting.

as an heifer of three years old--Moab heretofore not having known
foreign yoke, and in its full strength, is compared to an heifer of
three years old, never yet yoked, nor as yet worn out with many
birth-givings (compare Note, see on [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005).md).

waters . . . of Nimrim--that is, the well-watered and therefore
luxuriant pastures of Nimrim.

desolate--The Hebrew is stronger: not merely shall be "desolate," but
desolation itself multiplied: plural, "desolations." The most fertile
tracts shall be dried up.

[Jeremiah 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 48:35</span></span>

him that offereth--namely, whole burnt offerings as the Hebrew requires
\[GROTIUS\]. Compare the awful burnt offering of the king of Moab ([Kg2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027).md).

high places-- ([Isa 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 48:36</span></span>

(See on [Isa 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md); [Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011).md).

like pipes--a plaintive instrument, therefore used at funerals and in
general mourning.

riches . . . gotten--literally, the abundance . . . that which is over
and above the necessaries of life. GROTIUS translates, "They who have
been left remaining shall perish"; they who have not been slain by the
enemy shall perish by disease and famine.

[Jeremiah 48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 48:37</span></span>

(See on [Jer 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md); [Isa
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md).

upon all . . . hands--that is, arms, in which such cuttings used to be
made in token of grief (compare [Zac
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038.md)

vessel . . . no pleasure--(See [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028).md); a vessel cast aside by the
potter as refuse, not answering his design.

[Jeremiah 48:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 48:39</span></span>

it--Moab.

How . . . how--prodigious, yet sure to happen.

turned the back--not daring to show her face.

derision . . . dismaying to all--a derision to some; a dismaying to
others in beholding such a judgment of God, fearing a like fate for
themselves.

[Jeremiah 48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 48:40</span></span>

he--Nebuzara-dan, the captain of Nebuchadnezzar.

as . . . eagle--not to bear them "on eagles' wings" ([Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md); [Deu
32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).md), as God does His people, but
to pounce on them as a prey ([Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md); [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md).

as . . . woman in . . . pangs-- ([Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 48:42</span></span>

[Jeremiah 48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 48:44</span></span>

When thou thinkest thou hast escaped one kind of danger, a fresh one
will start up.

under . . . shadow of Heshbon--They thought that they would be safe in
Heshbon.

because of the force--that is, "they that fled because of the force" of
the enemy: they that fled from it. GLASSIUS translates, "through want of
strength." So the Hebrew particle is translated ([Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024).md), "faileth of fatness," that
is, "faileth through want of fatness"; also [Lam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009.md).

but a fire, &c.--copied in part from Sihon's hymn of victory ([Num
21:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027).md). The old "proverb" shall
hold good again. As in ancient times Sihon, king of the Amorites, issued
forth from his city, Heshbon, as a devouring "flame" and consumed Moab,
so now the Chaldeans, making Heshbon their starting-point, shall advance
to the destruction of Moab.

midst of Sihon--that is, the city of Sihon.

corner of Moab--that is, Moab from one corner to the other.

crown of . . . head--the most elevated points of Moab. Making some
alterations, he here copies Balaam's prophecy ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md). Margin there translates
"princes" for corners; if so, "crown of . . . head" here refers to the
nobles.

tumultuous ones--sons of tumult; those who have tumultuously revolted
from Babylon. Heshbon passed from the Amorite to the Israelite sway.
Moab had wrested it from Israel and helped the Chaldeans against the
Jews; but revolting from Babylon, they brought ruin on themselves in
turn.

[Jeremiah 48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jer 48:46</span></span>

Copied from [Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029.md).

Restoration promised to Moab, for the sake of righteous Lot, their
progenitor ([Gen 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037.md); [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md); [Psa
89:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030).md). Compare as to Egypt, [Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026.md); Ammon, [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md); Elam, [Jer
49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md). Gospel blessings, temporal and
spiritual, to the Gentiles in the last days, are intended.

The event of the prophecy as to Ammon preceded that as to Moab (see on
[Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003).md); and in [Eze
21:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md), the destruction of Ammon is
subjoined to the deposition of Zedekiah.
