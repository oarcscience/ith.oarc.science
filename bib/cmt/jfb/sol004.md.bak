### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 4:1</span></span>

Contrast with the bride's state by nature ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md) her state by grace ([Sol
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001).md), "perfect through His
comeliness put upon her" ([Eze 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014.md);
[Joh 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003).md). The praise of Jesus
Christ, unlike that of the world, hurts not, but edifies; as His, not
ours, is the glory ([Joh 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md); [Rev
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010).md). Seven features of beauty are
specified ([Sol 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001).md) ("lips" and
"speech" are but one feature, [Sol
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003).md), the number for perfection. To
each of these is attached a comparison from nature: the resemblances
consist not so much in outward likeness, as in the combined sensations
of delight produced by contemplating these natural objects.

doves'--the large melting eye of the Syrian dove appears especially
beautiful amid the foliage of its native groves: so the bride's "eyes
within her locks" ([Luk 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044).md). MAURER
for "locks," has "veil"; but locks suit the connection better: so the
Hebrew is translated ([Isa 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002).md). The
dove was the only bird counted "clean" for sacrifice. Once the heart was
"the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Grace makes the change.

eyes-- ([Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); contrast [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md); [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md). Chaste and guileless
("harmless," [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md), Margin; [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047).md). John the Baptist, historically,
was the "turtledove" ([Sol 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012).md), with
eye directed to the coming Bridegroom: his Nazarite unshorn hair answers
to "locks" ([Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md), [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036).md).

hair . . . goats--The hair of goats in the East is fine like silk. As
long hair is her glory, and marks her subjection to man ([Co1
11:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#006).md), so the Nazarite's hair
marked his subjection and separation unto God. (Compare [Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017.md), with [Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md). Jesus Christ cares for the
minutest concerns of His saints ([Mat
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#030).md).

appear from--literally, "that lie down from"; lying along the hillside,
they seem to hang from it: a picture of the bride's hanging tresses.

Gilead--beyond Jordan: there stood "the heap of witness" ([Gen
31:48](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#048).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 4:2</span></span>

even shorn--the Hebrew is translated ([Kg1
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#025).md), "of one size"; so the point of
comparison to teeth is their symmetry of form; as in "came up from the
washing," the spotless whiteness; and in "twins," the exact
correspondence of the upper and lower teeth: and in "none barren," none
wanting, none without its fellow. Faith is the tooth with which we eat
the living bread ([Joh 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054).md). Contrast the teeth of sinners
([Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md); [Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014).md); also their end ([Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md); [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030).md). Faith leads the flock to the
washing ([Zac 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md).

none . . . barren-- ([Pe2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008).md). He who
is begotten of God begets instrumentally other sons of God.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 4:3</span></span>

thread--like a delicate fillet. Not thick and white as the leper's lips
(type of sin), which were therefore to be "covered," as "unclean" ([Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md).

scarlet--The blood of Jesus Christ ([Isa
6:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md) cleanses the leprosy, and
unseals the lips ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md); [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md). Rahab's scarlet thread was a
type of it ([Jos 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#018).md).

speech--not a separate feature from the lips ([Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md); [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006).md). Contrast "uncircumcised lips"
([Exo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012).md). MAURER and BURROWES
translate, "thy mouth."

temples--rather, the upper part of the cheek next the temples: the seat
of shamefacedness; so, "within thy locks," no display ([Co1
11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md), [Co1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#015).md). Mark of true penitence ([Ezr
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006.md); [Eze
16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063).md). Contrast [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md).

pomegranate--When cut, it displays in rows seeds pellucid, like crystal,
tinged with red. Her modesty is not on the surface, but within, which
Jesus Christ can see into.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 4:4</span></span>

neck--stately: in beautiful contrast to the blushing temples ([Sol
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003).md); not "stiff" ([Isa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md), as that of unbroken nature; nor
"stretched forth" wantonly ([Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md); nor burdened with the legal
yoke ([Lam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md); [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md); but erect in gospel freedom
([Isa 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002).md).

tower of David--probably on Zion. He was a man of war, preparatory to
the reign of Solomon, the king of peace. So warfare in the case of Jesus
Christ and His saints precedes the coming rest. Each soul won from Satan
by Him is a trophy gracing the bride ([Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022).md); (each hangs on Him, [Isa
22:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023).md); also each victory of her
faith. As shields adorn a temple's walls ([Eze
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#011).md), so necklaces hang on the
bride's neck ([Jdg 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md); [Kg1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 4:5</span></span>

breasts--The bust is left open in Eastern dress. The breastplate of the
high priest was made of "two" pieces, folded one on the other, in which
were the Urim and Thummim (lights and perfection). "Faith and love" are
the double breastplate ([Th1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008).md),
answering to "hearing the word" and "keeping it," in a similar
connection with breasts ([Luk
12:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027).md).

roes--He reciprocates her praise ([Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md). Emblem of love and satisfaction
([Pro 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019).md).

feed-- ([Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002).md).

among the lilies--shrinking from thorns of strife, worldliness, and
ungodliness ([Sa2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md); [Mat
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007).md). Roes feed among, not on the
lilies: where these grow, there is moisture producing green pasturage.
The lilies represent her white dress ([Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 4:6</span></span>

Historically, the hill of frankincense is Calvary, where, "through the
eternal Spirit He offered Himself"; the mountain of myrrh is His
embalmment ([Joh 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039).md) till the
resurrection "daybreak." The third Canticle occupies the one cloudless
day of His presence on earth, beginning from the night ([Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md) and ending with the night of His
departure ([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006).md). His promise is
almost exactly in the words of her prayer ([Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md), (the same Holy Ghost breathing
in Jesus Christ and His praying people), with the difference that she
then looked for His visible coming. He now tells her that when He shall
have gone from sight, He still is to be met with spiritually in prayer
([Psa 68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016.md); [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).md), until the everlasting day
break, when we shall see face to face ([Co1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#010.md), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 4:7</span></span>

Assurance that He is going from her in love, not in displeasure ([Joh
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#006).md).

all fair--still stronger than [Sol
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015.md); [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md).

no spot--our privilege ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md);
[Col 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010).md); our duty ([Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 4:8</span></span>

Invitation to her to leave the border mountains (the highest worldly
elevation) between the hostile lands north of Palestine and the Promised
Land ([Psa 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md); [Phi
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013).md).

Amana--south of Anti-Libanus; the river Abana, or Amana, was near
Damascus ([Kg2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012).md).

Shenir--The whole mountain was called Hermon; the part held by the
Sidonians was called Sirion; the part held by the Amorites, Shenir ([Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009).md). Infested by the devouring lion
and the stealthy and swift leopard ([Psa
76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md); [Eph
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md); [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md). Contrasted with the mountain of
myrrh, &c. ([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md); [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).md); the good land ([Isa
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#009).md).

with me--twice repeated emphatically. The presence of Jesus Christ makes
up for the absence of all besides ([Luk
18:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#029.md); [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010).md). Moses was permitted to see
Canaan from Pisgah; Peter, James, and John had a foretaste of glory on
the mount of transfiguration.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 4:9</span></span>

sister . . . spouse--This title is here first used, as He is soon about
to institute the Supper, the pledge of the nuptial union. By the term
"sister," carnal ideas are excluded; the ardor of a spouse's love is
combined with the purity of a sister's ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); compare [Mar
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#035).md).

one--Even one look is enough to secure His love ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Luk
23:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040).md). Not merely the Church
collectively, but each one member of it ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010.md), [Mat
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#014.md); [Luk
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007.md), [Luk
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024.md), [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032).md).

chain--necklace ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017).md), answering to the "shields"
hanging in the tower of David ([Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004).md). Compare the "ornament" ([Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004).md); "chains" ([Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md); [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 4:10</span></span>

love--Hebrew, "loves"; manifold tokens of thy love.

much better--answering to her "better" ([Sol
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002).md), but with increased force. An
Amoebean pastoral character pervades the Song, like the classic Amoebean
idylls and eclogues.

wine--The love of His saints is a more reviving cordial to Him than
wine; for example, at the feast in Simon's house ([Luk
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036.md), [Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047.md); [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032.md); compare [Zac
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#007).md).

smell of . . . ointments than all spices--answering to her praise ([Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md) with increased force. Fragrant,
as being fruits of His Spirit in us ([Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 4:11</span></span>

drop--always ready to fall, being full of honey, though not always ([Pro
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019).md) actually dropping ([Sol
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013.md); [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md); [Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034).md).

honeycomb-- ([Pro 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md); [Pro
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024).md).

under thy tongue--not always on, but under, the tongue, ready to fall
([Psa 55:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#021).md). Contrast her former
state ([Psa 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md); [Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013).md). "Honey and milk" were the glory
of the good land. The change is illustrated in the penitent thief.
Contrast [Mat 27:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#044.md) with [Luk
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039.md), &c. It was literally with "one"
eye, a sidelong glance of love "better than wine," that he refreshed
Jesus Christ ([Sol 4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009).md). "To-day
shalt thou be with Me (compare [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008).md) in Paradise" ([Sol
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012).md), is the only joyous sentence of
His seven utterances on the cross.

smell of . . . garments--which are often perfumed in the East ([Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008).md). The perfume comes from Him on
us ([Psa 133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002).md). We draw nigh to God
in the perfumed garment of our elder brother ([Gen
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027.md); see [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023).md).

Lebanon--abounding in odoriferous trees ([Hos
14:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 4:12</span></span>

The Hebrew has no "is." Here she is distinct from the garden ([Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001).md), yet identified with it ([Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016).md) as being one with Him in His
sufferings. Historically the Paradise, into which the soul of Jesus
Christ entered at death; and the tomb of Joseph, in which His body was
laid amid "myrrh," &c. ([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006).md),
situated in a nicely kept garden (compare "gardener," [Joh
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015).md); "sealed" with a stone ([Mat
27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066).md); in which it resembles "wells"
in the East ([Gen 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003.md), [Gen
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#008).md). It was in a garden of light
Adam fell; in a garden of darkness, Gethsemane, and chiefly that of the
tomb, the second Adam retrieved us. Spiritually the garden is the gospel
kingdom of heaven. Here all is ripe; previously ([Sol
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013).md) it was "the tender grape." The
garden is His, though He calls the plants hers ([Sol
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013).md) by His gift ([Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003), end.md).

spring . . . fountain--Jesus Christ ([Joh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010).md) sealed, while He was in the
sealed tomb: it poured forth its full tide on Pentecost ([Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). Still He is a sealed
fountain until the Holy Ghost opens it to one ([Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003).md). The Church also is "a garden
enclosed" ([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md); [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), &c..md). Contrast [Psa
80:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md). So "a spring" ([Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md); [Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011).md); "sealed" ([Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019).md). As wives in the East are
secluded from public gaze, so believers ([Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md); [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003).md). Contrast the open streams which
"pass away" ([Job 6:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015.md); [Pe2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 4:13</span></span>

orchard--Hebrew, "a paradise," that is, a pleasure-ground and orchard.
Not only flowers, but fruit trees ([Joh

camphire--not camphor ([Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014).md),
hennah, or cypress blooms.

calamus--"sweet cane" ([Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md);
[Jer 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020).md).

myrrh and aloes--Ointments are associated with His death, as well as
with feasts ([Joh 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#007).md). The bride's
ministry of "myrrh and aloes" is recorded ([Joh
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039).md).

of--This pleasure-ground is not dependent on mere reservoirs; it has a
fountain sufficient to water many "gardens" (plural).

living-- ([Jer 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md); [Joh
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md); [Joh
7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md).

from Lebanon--Though the fountain is lowly, the source is lofty; fed by
the perpetual snows of Lebanon, refreshingly cool ([Jer
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014).md), fertilizing the gardens of
Damascus. It springs upon earth; its source is heaven. It is now not
"sealed," but open "streams" ([Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md)

Awake--literally, "arise." All besides is ready; one thing alone is
wanted--the breath of God. This follows rightly after His death ([Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md); [Act
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001).md). It is His call to the Spirit
to come ([Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016).md); in [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md), compared to "the wind";
quickening ([Joh 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md); [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009).md). Saints offer the same prayer
([Psa 85:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006.md); [Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002).md). The north wind "awakes," or
arises strongly, namely, the Holy Ghost as a reprover ([Joh
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008).md); the south wind "comes"
gently, namely, the Holy Ghost as the comforter ([Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016).md). The west wind brings rain from
the sea ([Kg1 18:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044.md); [Luk
12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054).md). The east wind is tempestuous
([Job 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md); [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md) and withering ([Gen
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#023).md). These, therefore, are not
wanted; but first the north wind clearing the air ([Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md); [Pro
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023).md), and then the warm south wind
([Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017).md); so the Holy Ghost first
clearing away mists of gloom, error, unbelief, sin, which intercept the
light of Jesus Christ, then infusing spiritual warmth ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006).md), causing the graces to exhale
their odor.

Let my beloved, &c.--the bride's reply. The fruit was now at length
ripe; the last passover, which He had so desired, is come ([Luk
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007.md), [Luk
22:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015.md), [Luk
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#018).md), the only occasion in which He
took charge of the preparations.

his--answering to Jesus Christ's "My." She owns that the garden is His,
and the fruits in her, which she does not in false humility deny ([Psa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md); [Act
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#019.md); [Co1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010).md) are His ([Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md); [Phi
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011).md).
