### [Luke Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md)

[Luke 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 19:2</span></span>

ZACCHEUS THE PUBLICAN. ([Luk 19:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001).md)

chief among the publicans--farming a considerable district, with others
under him.

rich--Ill-gotten riches some of it certainly was. (See on [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008)..md)

[Luke 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 19:3</span></span>

who he was--what sort of person. Curiosity then was his only motive,
though his determination not to be baulked was overruled for more than
he sought.

[Luke 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 19:4</span></span>

sycamore--the Egyptian fig, with leaves like the mulberry.

[Luke 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 19:5</span></span>

looked up,--in the full knowledge of who was in the tree, and
preparatory to addressing him.

Zaccheus--whom he had never seen in the flesh, nor probably heard of.
"He calleth His own sheep by name and leadeth them out" ([Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003).md).

make haste, and come down--to which he literally responded--"he made
haste and came down."

for to-day, &c.--Our Lord invites Himself, and in "royal" style, which
waits not for invitations, but as the honor is done to the subject, not
the sovereign, announces the purpose of royalty to partake of the
subject's hospitalities. Manifestly our Lord speaks as knowing how the
privilege would be appreciated.

to-day . . . abide--(Compare [Joh
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039).md), probably over night.

[Luke 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 19:6</span></span>

joyfully--Whence this so sudden "joy" in the cold bosom of an avaricious
publican? The internal revolution was as perfect as instantaneous. "He
spake and it was done." "Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and
the tongue of the dumb sing" ([Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006).md).

[Luke 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 19:7</span></span>

to be guest--or lodge: something more than "eating with" such ([Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002).md).

a sinner--that was one but a minute ago, but now is not. This mighty
change, however, was all unknown to them. But they shall know it
presently. "Sinner" would refer both to his office, vile in the eyes of
a Jew, and to his character, which it is evident was not good.

[Luke 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 19:8</span></span>

stood--before all.

said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord--Mark how frequently Luke uses this
title, and always where lordly authority, dignity, or power is intended.

if I have--that is, "so far as I have," for evidently the "if" is so
used (as in [Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008).md).

taken by false accusation--defrauded, overcharged ([Luk
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012).md).

fourfold--The Roman law required this; the Jewish law, but the principal
and a fifth more ([Num 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#007).md). There was
no demand made for either; but, as if to revenge himself on his hitherto
reigning sin (see on [Joh 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028).md), and
to testify the change he had experienced, besides surrendering the half
of his fair gains to the poor, he voluntarily determines to give up all
that was ill-gotten, quadrupled. He gratefully addressed this to the
"Lord," to whom he owed the wonderful change.

[Luke 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 19:9</span></span>

Jesus said unto him--but also before all.

This day, &c.--memorable saying! Salvation already come, but not a day
old.

to this house--so expressed probably to meet the taunt, "He is gone to
be guest," &c. The house is no longer polluted; it is now fit to receive
Me. But salvation to a house is an exceedingly precious idea, expressing
the new air that would henceforth breathe in it, and the new impulses
from its head which would reach its members ([Psa
118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md); [Act
16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015.md), [Act
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#031).md).

son of Abraham--He was that by birth, but here it means a partaker of
his faith, being mentioned as the sufficient explanation of salvation
having come to him.

[Luke 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 19:10</span></span>

lost--and such "lost" ones as this Zaccheus. (See on [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032)..md) What encouragement is there in
this narrative to hope for unexpected conversions?

[Luke 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 19:12</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE POUNDS. (Luke 19:11-27)

a far country--said to put down the notion that He was just on His way
to set up His kingdom, and to inaugurate it by His personal presence.

to receive . . . a kingdom--be invested with royalty; as when Herod went
to Rome and was there made king; a striking expression of what our Lord
went away for and received, "sitting down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high."

to return--at His second coming.

[Luke 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 19:13</span></span>

Occupy--"negotiate," "do business," with the resources entrusted.

[Luke 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 19:14</span></span>

his citizens--His proper subjects; meaning the Jews, who expressly
repudiating our Lord's claims said, "We have no king but CÃ&brvbr;sar"
([Joh 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015).md). In Christendom, these
correspond to infidel rejecters of Christianity, as distinguished from
professed Christians.

[Luke 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 19:15</span></span>

(See on [Mat 25:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#019)..md)

ten . . . five cities--different degrees of future gracious reward,
proportioned to the measure of present fidelity.

[Luke 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 19:27</span></span>

bring hither, &c.--(Compare [Sa1
15:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032).md). Referring to the awful
destruction of Jerusalem, but pointing to the final destruction of all
that are found in open rebellion against Christ.

[Luke 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 19:29</span></span>

CHRIST'S TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM AND TEARS OVER IT. (Luke
19:28-44)

Bethphage--"house of figs," a village which with Bethany lay along the
further side of Mount Olivet, east of Jerusalem.

[Luke 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 19:30</span></span>

whereon, &c.--(See on [Joh 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041).md).

[Luke 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 19:31</span></span>

the Lord hath need, &c.--He both knew all and had the key of the human
heart. (See on [Luk 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005)..md) Perhaps the
owner was a disciple.

[Luke 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 19:35</span></span>

set Jesus on--He allowing this, as befitting the state He was for the
first and only time assuming.

[Luke 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 19:37</span></span>

whole multitude, &c.--The language here is very grand, intended to
express a burst of admiration far wider and deeper than ever had been
witnessed before.

[Luke 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 19:38</span></span>

Blessed be the King, &c.--Mark ([Mar
11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009).md) more fully, "Hosanna," that
is, "Save now," the words of [Psa
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), which were understood to refer
to Messiah; and so they add, "to the Son of David, blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord ([Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026).md), Hosanna in the highest." This
was the very loftiest style in which He could be saluted as the promised
Deliverer.

peace, &c.--(See on [Luk 2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013).md).

[Luke 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 19:40</span></span>

the stones, &c.--Hitherto the Lord had discouraged all demonstrations in
His favor; latterly He had begun an opposite course; on this one
occasion He seems to yield His whole soul to the wide and deep acclaim
with a mysterious satisfaction, regarding it as so necessary a part of
the regal dignity in which as Messiah He for this last time entered the
city, that if not offered by the vast multitude, it would have been
wrung out of the stones rather than be withheld ([Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011).md).

[Luke 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 19:41</span></span>

when beheld . . . wept--Compare [Lam
3:51](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#051.md), "Mine eye affecteth mine heart";
the heart again affecting the eye. Under this sympathetic law of the
relation of mind and body, Jesus, in His beautiful, tender humanity, was
constituted even as we. What a contrast to the immediately preceding
profound joy! He yielded Himself alike freely to both. (See on [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037)..md)

[Luke 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 19:42</span></span>

at least in this, &c.--even at this moving moment. (See on [Luk
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009)..md)

thy peace--thinking perhaps of the name of the city. ([Heb
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#002).md) \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. How
much is included in this word!

now . . . hid--It was His among His last open efforts to "gather them,"
but their eyes were judicially closed.

[Luke 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 19:43</span></span>

a trench--a rampart; first of wood, and when this was burnt, a built
wall, four miles in circuit, built in three days--so determined were
they. This "cut off all hope of escape," and consigned the city to
unparalleled horrors. (See JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 6.2; 12.3,4.) All
here predicted was with dreadful literally fulfilled.

[Luke 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 19:45</span></span>

SECOND CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE AND SUBSEQUENT TEACHING. ([Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045).md)

As the first cleansing was on His first visit to Jerusalem ([Joh
2:13-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013).md), so this second cleansing was
on His last.

den of thieves--banded together for plunder, reckless of principle. The
mild term "house of merchandise," used on the former occasion, was now
unsuitable.

[Luke 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 19:47</span></span>

sought--continued seeking, that is, daily, as He taught.

[Luke 19:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 19:48</span></span>

were very attentive to hear him--hung upon His words.
