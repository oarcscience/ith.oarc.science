### [Daniel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)

[Daniel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 11:1</span></span>

This chapter is an enlargement of the eighth: THE OVERTHROW OF PERSIA BY
GRECIA: THE FOUR DIVISIONS OF ALEXANDER'S KINGDOM: CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE
KINGS OF THE SOUTH AND OF THE NORTH, THE PTOLEMIES AND SELEUCIDÃ†:
ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES. (Dan. 11:1-45)

I--the angel ([Dan 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018)).

first year of Darius--Cyaxares II; the year of the conquest of Babylon
([Dan 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031)). Cyrus, who wielded the
real power, though in name subordinate to Darius, in that year
promulgated the edict for the restoration of the Jews, which Daniel was
at the time praying for ([Dan 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001),
[Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021), [Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023)).

stood--implying promptness in helping ([Psa
94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016)).

strengthen him--namely, Michael; even as Michael ([Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021), " strengtheneth himself with
me") helped the angel, both joining their powers in behalf of Israel
\[ROSENMULLER\]. Or, Darius, the angel "confirming him" in his purpose
of kindness to Israel.

[Daniel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 11:2</span></span>

three kings in Persia--Cambyses, Pseudo-Smerdis, and Darius Hystaspes.
(Ahasuerus, Artaxerxes, and Darius, in [Ezr
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006), [Ezr
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024)). The Ahasuerus of Esther (see on
[Dan 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)) is identified with Xerxes,
both in Greek history and in Scripture, appearing proud, self-willed,
careless of contravening Persian customs, amorous, facile, and
changeable ([Dan 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)).

fourth . . . riches . . . against . . . Grecia--Xerxes, whose riches
were proverbial. Persia reached its climax and showed its greatest power
in his invasion of Greece, 480 B.C. After his overthrow at Salamis,
Persia is viewed as politically dead, though it had an existence.
Therefore, [Dan 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003), without noticing
Xerxes' successors, proceeds at once to Alexander, under whom, first,
the third world kingdom, Grecia, reached its culmination, and assumed an
importance as to the people of God.

stir up all--Four years were spent in gathering his army out of all
parts of his vast empire, amounting to two millions six hundred and
forty-one thousand men. \[PRIDEAUX, Connexion, 1.4, 1.410\].

[Daniel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 11:3</span></span>

mighty king . . . do according to his will--answering to the he-goat's
"notable horn" ([Dan 8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#006), [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021)). Alexander invaded Persia 334
B.C., to avenge the wrongs of Greece on Persia for Xerxes' past invasion
(as Alexander said in a letter to Darius Codomanus, ARRIAN, Alexander.
2.14.7).

[Daniel 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 11:4</span></span>

kingdom . . . divided toward . . . four winds--the fourfold division of
Alexander's kingdom at his death ([Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008), [Dan
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022)), after the battle of Ipsus, 301
B.C.

not to his posterity--(See on [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008); [Dan
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022)).

nor according to his dominion--None of his successors had so wide a
dominion as Alexander himself.

others besides those--besides Alexander's sons, Hercules by Barsine,
Darius daughter, and Alexander by Roxana, who were both slain
\[MAURER\]. Rather, besides the four successors to the four chief
divisions of the empire, there will be other lesser chiefs who shall
appropriate smaller fragments of the Macedonian empire \[JEROME\].

[Daniel 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 11:5</span></span>

Here the prophet leaves Asia and Greece and takes up Egypt and Syria,
these being in continual conflict under Alexander's successors,
entailing misery on Judea, which lay between the two. Holy Scripture
handles external history only so far as it is connected with God's
people, Israel \[JEROME\]. TREGELLES puts a chasm between the fourth and
fifth verses, making the transition to the final Antichrist here,
answering to the chasm (in his view) at [Dan
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022).

king of . . . south--literally, "of midday": Egypt ([Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008), [Dan
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042)), PTOLEMY Soter, son of Lagus.
He took the title "king," whereas Lagus was but "governor."

one of his princes--Seleucus, at first a satrap of PTOLEMY Lagus, but
from 312 B.C. king of the largest empire after that of Alexander (Syria,
Babylon, Media, &c.), and called therefore Nicator, that is,
"conqueror." Connect the words thus, "And one of his (PTOLEMY'S)
princes, even he (Seleucus) shall be strong above him" (above PTOLEMY,
his former master).

[Daniel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 11:6</span></span>

in . . . end of years--when the predicted time shall be consummated
([Dan 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013), Margin; [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017); [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013)).

king's daughter of the south--Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus
of Egypt. The latter, in order to end his war with Antiochus Theus,
"king of the north" (literally, "midnight": the prophetical phrase for
the region whence came affliction to Israel, [Jer
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013); [Joe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020)), that is, Syria, gave Berenice
to Antiochus, who thereupon divorced his former wife, Laodice, and
disinherited her son, Seleucus Callinicus. The designation, "king of the
north" and "of the south," is given in relation to Judea, as the
standpoint. Egypt is mentioned by name ([Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008), [Dan
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042)), though Syria is not; because
the former was in Daniel's time a flourishing kingdom, whereas Syria was
then a mere dependency of Assyria and Babylon: an undesigned proof of
the genuineness of the Book of Daniel.

agreement--literally, "rights," that is, to put things to rights between
the belligerents.

she shall not retain the power of the arm--She shall not be able to
effect the purpose of the alliance, namely, that she should be the
mainstay of peace. Ptolemy having died, Antiochus took back Laodice, who
then poisoned him, and caused Berenice and her son to be put to death,
and raised her own son, Seleucus Nicator, to the throne.

neither shall he stand--The king of Egypt shall not gain his point of
setting his line on the throne of Syria.

his arm--that on which he relied. Berenice and her offspring.

they that brought her--her attendants from Egypt.

he that begat her--rather as Margin, "the child whom she brought forth"
\[EWALD\]. If English Version (which MAURER approves) be retained, as
Ptolemy died a natural death, "given up" is not in his case, as in
Berenice's, to be understood of giving up to death, but in a general
sense, of his plan proving abortive.

he that strengthened her in these times--Antiochus Theus, who is to
attach himself to her (having divorced Laodice) at the times predicted
\[GEJER\].

[Daniel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 11:7</span></span>

a branch of her roots . . . in his estate--Ptolemy Euergetes, brother of
Berenice, succeeding in the place (Margin) of Philadelphus, avenged her
death by overrunning Syria, even to the Euphrates.

deal against them--He shall deal with the Syrians at his own pleasure.
He slew Laodice.

[Daniel 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 11:8</span></span>

carry . . . into Egypt their gods, &c.--Ptolemy, on hearing of a
sedition in Egypt, returned with forty thousand talents of silver,
precious vessels, and twenty-four hundred images, including Egyptian
idols, which Cambyses had carried from Egypt into Persia. The idolatrous
Egyptians were so gratified, that they named him Euergetes, or
"benefactor."

continue more years--Ptolemy survived Seleucus four years, reigning in
all forty-six years. MAURER translates, "Then he for several years shall
desist from (contending with) the king of the north" (compare [Dan
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009)).

[Daniel 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 11:9</span></span>

come into his kingdom--Egypt: not only with impunity, but with great
spoil.

[Daniel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 11:10</span></span>

his sons--the two sons of the king of the north, Seleucus Callinicus,
upon his death by a fall from his horse, namely, Seleucus Ceraunus and
Antiochus the Great.

one shall . . . come--Ceraunus having died, Antiochus alone prosecuted
the war with Ptolemy Philopater, Euergetes' son, until he had recovered
all the parts of Syria subjugated by Euergetes.

pass through--like an "overflowing" torrent ([Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022), [Dan
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#026), [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040); [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008)). Antiochus penetrated to Dura
(near CÃ&brvbr;sarea), where he gave Ptolemy a four months' truce.

return--renew the war at the expiration of the truce (so [Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013)).

even to his fortress--Ptolemy's; Raphia, a border-fortress of Egypt
against incursions by way of Edom and Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, near Gaza;
here Antiochus was vanquished.

[Daniel 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 11:11</span></span>

the king of the south . . . moved with choler--at so great losses, Syria
having been wrested from him, and his own kingdom imperilled, though
otherwise an indolent man, to which his disasters were owing, as also to
the odium of his subjects against him for having murdered his father,
mother, and brother, whence in irony they called him Philopater,
"father-lover."

he shall set forth a great multitude--Antiochus, king of Syria, whose
force was seventy thousand infantry and five thousand cavalry.

but . . . multitude . . . given into his hand--into Ptolemy's hands; ten
thousand of Antiochus' army were slain, and four thousand made captives.

[Daniel 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 11:12</span></span>

when he hath taken away--that is, subdued "the multitude" of Antiochus.

heart . . . lifted up--instead of following up his victory by making
himself master of the whole of Syria, as he might, he made peace with
Antiochus, and gave himself up to licentiousness \[POLYBIUS, 87; JUSTIN,
30.4\], and profaned the temple of God by entering the holy place
\[GROTIUS\].

not be strengthened by it--He shall lose the power gained by his victory
through his luxurious indolence.

[Daniel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 11:13</span></span>

return--renew the war.

after certain years--fourteen years after his defeat at Raphia.
Antiochus, after successful campaigns against Persia and India, made war
with Ptolemy Epiphanes, son of Philopater, a mere child.

[Daniel 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 11:14</span></span>

many stand up against the king of the south--Philip, king of Macedon,
and rebels in Egypt itself, combined with Antiochus against Ptolemy.

robbers of thy people--that is, factious men of the Jews shall exalt
themselves, so as to revolt from Ptolemy, and join themselves to
Antiochus; the Jews helped Antiochus army with provisions, when on his
return from Egypt he besieged the Egyptian garrison left in Jerusalem
\[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 12:3.3\].

to establish the vision--Those turbulent Jews unconsciously shall help
to fulfil the purpose of God, as to the trials which await Judea,
according to this vision.

but they shall fall--Though helping to fulfil the vision, they shall
fail in their aim, of making Judea independent.

[Daniel 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 11:15</span></span>

king of . . . north--Antiochus the Great.

take . . . fenced cities--Scopas, the Egyptian general, met Antiochus at
Paneas, near the sources of the Jordan, and was defeated, and fled to
Sidon, a strongly "fenced city," where he was forced to surrender.

chosen people--Egypt's choicest army was sent under Eropus, Menocles,
and Damoxenus, to deliver Scopas, but in vain \[JEROME\].

[Daniel 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 11:16</span></span>

he that cometh against him--Antiochus coming against Ptolemy Epiphanes.

glorious land--Judea ([Dan 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041), [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045); [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006), [Eze
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#015)).

by his hand shall be consumed--literally, "perfected," that is,
completely brought under his sway. JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 12:3.3\]
shows that the meaning is not, that the Jews should be utterly consumed:
for Antiochus favored them for taking his part against Ptolemy, but that
their land should be subjected to him \[LENGKERKE\]. GROTIUS translates,
"shall be perfected by him," that is, shall flourish under him. English
Version gives a good sense; namely, that Judea was much "consumed" or
"desolated" by being the arena of conflict between the combatants, Syria
and Egypt. TREGELLES refers ([Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014)), "robbers of thy people," to
the Gentiles, once oppressors, attempting to restore the Jews to their
land by mere human effort, whereas this is to be effected only by divine
interposition: their attempt is frustrated ([Dan
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016)) by the wilful king, who makes
Judea the scene of his military operations.

[Daniel 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 11:17</span></span>

set his face--purpose steadfastly. Antiochus purpose was, however,
turned from open assault to wile, by his war with the Romans in his
endeavor to extend his kingdom to the limits it had under Seleucus
Nicator.

upright one--Jasher, or Jeshurun ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002)); the epithet applied by the
Hebrews to their nation. It is here used not in praise; for in [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014) (see on [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014)) they are called "robbers," or
"men of violence, factious": it is the general designation of Israel, as
having God for their God. Probably it is used to rebuke those who ought
to have been God's "upright ones" for confederating with godless heathen
in acts of violence (the contrast to the term in [Dan
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#014) favors this).

thus shall he do--Instead of at once invading Ptolemy's country with his
"whole strength," he prepares his way for doing so by the following
plan: he gives to Ptolemy Epiphanes his daughter Cleopatra in marriage,
promising CÅ“lo-Syria and Judea as a dowry, thus securing his neutrality
in the war with Rome: he hoped through his daughter to obtain Syria,
Cilicia, and Lycia, and even Egypt itself at last; but Cleopatra favored
her husband rather than her father, and so defeated his scheme
\[JEROME\]. "She shall not stand on his side."

[Daniel 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 11:18</span></span>

isles--He "took many" of the isles in the Ã†gean in his war with the
Romans, and crossed the Hellespont.

prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach . . . to
cease--Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, the Roman general, by routing Antiochus
at Magnesia (190 B.C.), caused the reproach which he offered Rome by
inflicting injuries on Rome's allies, to cease. He did it for his own
glory.

without his own reproach--with untarnished reputation.

[Daniel 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 11:19</span></span>

Then he shall turn . . . toward . . . his own land--Compelled by Rome to
relinquish all his territory west of the Taurus, and defray the expenses
of the war, he garrisoned the cities left to him.

stumble . . . not be found--Attempting to plunder the temple of Jupiter
at Elymais by night, whether through avarice, or the want of money to
pay the tribute imposed by Rome (a thousand talents), he was slain with
his soldiers in an insurrection of the inhabitants \[JUSTIN, 32.2\].

[Daniel 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 11:20</span></span>

in his estate--in Antiochus' stead: his successor, Seleucus Philopater,
his son.

in the glory of the kingdom--that is, inheriting it by hereditary right.
MAURER translates, "one who shall cause the tax gatherer (Heliodorus) to
pass through the glory of the kingdom," that is, Judea, "the glorious
land" ([Dan 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016), [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041); [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)). Simon, a Benjamite, in spite
against Onias III, the high priest, gave information of the treasures in
the Jewish temple; and Seleucus having reunited to Syria CÅ“lo-Syria and
Palestine, the dowry formerly given by Antiochus the Great to Cleopatra,
Ptolemy's wife, sent Heliodorus to Jerusalem to plunder the temple. This
is narrated in 2 Maccabees 3:4, &c. Contrast [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008), "No oppressor shall pass through
. . . any more."

within few days . . . destroyed--after a reign of twelve years, which
were "few" compared with the thirty-seven years of Antiochus' reign.
Heliodorus, the instrument of Seleucus' sacrilege, was made by God the
instrument of his punishment. Seeking the crown, in the absence at Rome
of Seleucus' only son and heir, Demetrius, he poisoned Seleucus. But
Antiochus Epiphanes, Seleucus' brother, by the help of Eumenes, king of
Pergamos, succeeded to the throne, 175 B.C.

neither in anger, nor in battle--not in a popular outbreak, nor in open
battle.

[Daniel 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 11:21</span></span>

vile--Antiochus called Epiphanes, that is, "the illustrious," for
vindicating the claims of the royal line against Heliodorus, was
nicknamed, by a play of sounds, Epimanes, that is, "the madman," for his
mad freaks beneath the dignity of a king. He would carouse with the
lowest of the people, bathe with them in the public baths, and foolishly
jest and throw stones at passers-by \[POLYBIUS, 26.10\]. Hence, as also
for his crafty supplanting of Demetrius, the rightful heir, from the
throne, he is termed "vile."

they shall not give . . . kingdom: but . . . by flatteries--The nation
shall not, by a public act, confer the kingdom on him, but he shall
obtain it by artifice, "flattering" Eumenes and Attalus of Pergamos to
help him, and, as he had seen candidates at Rome doing, canvassing the
Syrian people high and low, one by one, with embraces \[LIVY, 41.20\].

[Daniel 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 11:22</span></span>

shall they be overflown . . . before him--Antiochus Epiphanes shall
invade Egypt with overwhelming forces.

prince of the covenant--Ptolemy Philometer, the son of Cleopatra,
Antiochus' sister, who was joined in covenant with him. Ptolemy's
guardians, while he was a boy, sought to recover from Epiphanes
CÅ“lo-Syria and Palestine, which had been promised by Antiochus the
Great as Cleopatra's dowry in marrying Ptolemy Epiphanes. Hence arose
the war. Philometer's generals were vanquished, and Pelusium, the key of
Egypt, taken by Antiochus, 171 B.C.

[Daniel 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 11:23</span></span>

TREGELLES notes three divisions in the history of the "vile person,"
which is continued to the end of the chapter: (1) His rise ([Dan
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021)). (2) The time from his
making the covenant to the taking away of the daily sacrifice and
setting up of the abomination of desolation ([Dan
11:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023)). (3) His career of
blasphemy, to his destruction ([Dan
11:32-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032)); the latter two periods
answering to the "week" of years of his "covenant with many" (namely, in
Israel) ([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)), and the last
being the closing half week of the ninth chapter. But the context so
accurately agrees with the relations of Antiochus to Ptolemy that the
primary reference seems to be to the "league" between them.
Antitypically, Antichrist's relations towards Israel are probably
delineated. Compare [Dan 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011), [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025), with [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022) here, "prince of the covenant."

work deceitfully--Feigning friendship to young Ptolemy, as if he wished
to order his kingdom for him, he took possession of Memphis and all
Egypt ("the fattest places," [Dan
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034)) as far as Alexandria.

with a small people--At first, to throw off suspicion, his forces were
small.

[Daniel 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 11:24</span></span>

peaceably--literally, "unexpectedly"; under the guise of friendship he
seized Ptolemy Philometer.

he shall do that which his fathers have not done--His predecessors,
kings of Syria, had always coveted Egypt, but in vain: he alone made
himself master of it.

scatter among them . . . prey--among his followers (1 Maccabees 1:19).

forecast his devices against . . . strongholds--He shall form a studied
scheme for making himself master of the Egyptian fortresses. He gained
them all except Alexandria, which successfully resisted him. Retaining
to himself Pelusium, he retired to Judea, where, in revenge for the joy
shown by the Jews at the report of his death, which led them to a
revolt, he subdued Jerusalem by storm or stratagem.

for a time--His rage shall not be for ever; it is but for a time limited
by God. CALVIN makes "for a time" in antithesis to "unexpectedly," in
the beginning of the verse. He suddenly mastered the weaker cities: he
had to "forecast his plans" more gradually ("for a time") as to how to
gain the stronger fortresses.

[Daniel 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 11:25</span></span>

A fuller detail of what was summarily stated ([Dan
11:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022)). This is the first of
Antiochus' three ([Dan 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029)) open
invasions of Egypt.

against the king of the south--against Ptolemy Philometer. Subsequently,
Ptolemy Physcon (the Gross), or Euergetes II, was made king by the
Egyptians, as Ptolemy Philometer was in Antiochus hands.

great army--as distinguished from the "small people" ([Dan

"devices" against him (see [Dan

maladministered his affairs. Antiochus, when checked at last at
Alexandria, left Ptolemy Philometer at Memphis as king, pretending that
his whole object was to support Philometer's claims against the usurper
Physcon.

The phrase is used of overflowing numbers, usually in a victorious
sense, but here in the sense of defeat, the very numbers which
ordinarily ensure victory, hastening the defeat through mismanagement.

death"). Antiochus, when he might have slain all in the battle near
Pelusium, rode around and ordered the enemy to be taken alive, the fruit
of which policy was, he soon gained Pelusium and all Egypt \[DIODORUS
SICULUS, 26.77\].

Jerusalem, the metropolis of Jehovah's covenant-people, slew eighty
thousand, took forty thousand prisoners, and sold forty thousand as
slaves (2 Maccabees 5:5-14).

the high priest, he entered the sanctuary with blasphemies, took away
the gold and silver vessels, sacrificed swine on the altar, and

suspecting Antiochus' designs with Physcon, hired mercenaries from
Greece. Whereupon Antiochus advanced with a fleet and an army, demanding
the cession to him of Cyprus, Pelusium, and the country adjoining the
Pelusiac mouth of the Nile.

Popilius Loenas, the Roman ambassador, met him at Eleusis, four miles
from Alexandria, and presented him the decree of the senate; on
Antiochus replying that he would consider what he was to do, Popilius
drew a line round him with a rod and said, "I must have a reply to give
to the senate before you leave this circle." Antiochus submitted, and
retired from Egypt; and his fleets withdrew from Cyprus.

this latter" expedition \[GROTIUS\].

indignation against the holy covenant--Indignant that meantime God's
worship had been restored at Jerusalem, he gives vent to his wrath at
the check given him by Rome, on the Jews.

intelligence with them that forsake the . . . covenant--namely, with the
apostates in the nation (1 Maccabees 1:11-15). Menelaus and other Jews
instigated the king against their religion and country, learning from
Greek philosophy that all religions are good enough to keep the masses
in check. These had cast off circumcision and the religion of Jehovah
for Greek customs. Antiochus, on his way home, sent Apollonius (167
B.C.) with twenty-two thousand to destroy Jerusalem, two years after its
capture by himself. Apollonius slew multitudes, dismantled and pillaged
the city. They then, from a fortress which they built commanding the
temple, fell on and slew the worshippers; so that the temple service was
discontinued. Also, Antiochus decreed that all, on pain of death, should
conform to the Greek religion, and the temple was consecrated to Jupiter
Olympius. Identifying himself with that god, with fanatical haughtiness
he wished to make his own worship universal (1 Maccabees 1:41; 2
Maccabees 6:7). This was the gravest peril which ever heretofore
threatened revealed religion, the holy people, and the theocracy on
earth, for none of the previous world rulers had interfered with the
religious worship of the covenant-people, when subject to them ([Dan
4:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031); [Dan
6:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#027); [Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002), [Ezr
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004); [Ezr
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012); [Neh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018)). Hence arose the need of such a
forewarning of the covenant-people as to him--so accurate, that
PORPHYRY, the adversary of revelation, saw it was hopeless to deny its
correspondence with history, but argued from its accuracy that it must
have been written subsequent to the event. But as Messianic events are
foretold in Daniel, the Jews, the adversaries of Jesus, would never have
forged the prophecies which confirm His claims. The ninth chapter was to
comfort the faithful Jews, in the midst of the "abominations" against
"the covenant," with the prospect of Messiah who would "confirm the
covenant." He would show by bringing salvation, and yet abolishing
sacrifices, that the temple service which they so grieved after, was not
absolutely necessary; thus the correspondence of phraseology would
suggest comfort (compare [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)
with [Dan 11:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)).

[Daniel 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 11:31</span></span>

arms--namely, of the human body; not weapons; human forces.

they--Antiochus' hosts confederate with the apostate Israelites; these
latter attain the climax of guilt, when they not only, as before,
"forsake the covenant" ([Dan 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)),
but "do wickedly against" it ([Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032)), turning complete heathens.
Here Antiochus' actings are described in language which reach beyond him
the type to Antichrist the antitype \[JEROME\] (just as in Psa. 72:1-20
many things are said of Solomon the type, which are only applicable to
Christ the Antitype); including perhaps Rome, Mohammed, and the final
personal Antichrist. SIR ISAAC NEWTON refers the rest of the chapter
from this verse to the Romans, translating, "after him arms (that is,
the Romans) shall stand up"; at the very time that Antiochus left Egypt,
the Romans conquered Macedon, thus finishing the reign of Daniel's third
beast; so here the prophet naturally proceeds to the fourth beast.
JEROME'S view is simpler; for the narrative seems to continue the
history of Antiochus, though with features only in type applicable to
him, fully to Antichrist.

sanctuary of strength--not only naturally a place of strength, whence it
held out to the last against the besiegers, but chiefly the spiritual
stronghold of the covenant-people ([Psa
48:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001), [Psa
48:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012)). Apollonius "polluted" it
with altars to idols and sacrifices of swine's flesh, after having
"taken away the daily sacrifice" (see on [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011)).

place . . . abomination that maketh desolate--that is, that pollutes the
temple ([Dan 8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012)). Or rather, "the
abomination of the desolater," Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Maccabees 1:29,
37-49). Compare [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027), wherein the
antitypical desolating abomination of Rome (the eagle standard, the bird
of Jupiter, sacrificed to by Titus' soldiers within the sacred
precincts, at the destruction of Jerusalem), of Mohammed and of the
final Antichrist, is foretold. 1 Maccabees 1:54, uses the very phrase,
"the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty-fifth year,
they set up the abomination of desolation on the altar"; namely, an
idol-altar and image of Jupiter Olympius, erected upon Jehovah's altar
of burnt offerings. "Abomination" is the common name for an idol in the
Old Testament. The Roman emperor Adrian's erection of a temple to
Jupiter Capitolinus where the temple of God had stood, A.D. 132; also
the erection of the Mohammedan mosque of Omar in the same place (it is
striking, Mohammedanism began to prevail in A.D. 610, only about three
years of the time when Popery assumed the temporal power); and the
idolatry of the Church of Rome in the spiritual temple, and the final
blasphemy of the personal Antichrist in the literal temple ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)) may all be antitypically referred
to here under Antiochus the type, and the Old Testament Antichrist.

sorely persecuted, even to death ([Heb
11:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035); 2 Maccabees 6, 7). Their
enemies took advantage of the Sabbath to slay them on the day when they
would not fight. TREGELLES thinks, from comparison with [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035), it is the people who "fall,"
not those of understanding. But [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035) makes the latter "fall," not an
unmeaning repetition; in [Dan 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033)
they fall (die) by persecution; in [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035) they fall (spiritually) for a
time by their own weakness.

caused some to be roasted alive (2 Maccabees 7:3-5).

many days--rather, "certain days," as in [Dan
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027). JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities,
12:7.6,7\] tells us the persecution lasted for three years (1 Maccabees
1:59; 4:54; 2 Maccabees 10:1-7).

[Daniel 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#034)

a little help--The liberty obtained by the Maccabean heroes for the Jews
was of but short duration. They soon fell under the Romans and
Herodians, and ever since every attempt to free them from Gentile rule
has only aggravated their sad lot. The period of the world times
(Gentile rule) is the period of depression of the theocracy, extending
from the exile to the millennium \[ROOS\]. The more immediate reference
seems to be, the forces of Mattathias and his five sons were originally
few (1 Maccabees 2:1-5).

many shall cleave to them--as was the case under Judas Maccabeus, who
was thus able successfully to resist Antiochus.

with flatteries--Those who had deserted the Jewish cause in persecution,
now, when success attended the Jewish arms, joined the Maccabean
standard, for example, Joseph, the son of Zecharias, Azarias, &c. (1
Maccabees 5:55-57; 2 Maccabees 12:40; 13:21). MAURER explains it, of
those who through fear of the Maccabees' severity against apostates
joined them, though ready, if it suited their purpose, to desert them (1
Maccabees 2:44; 3:58).

fall for a time; not finally ([Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031); [Luk

patiently for "the end" of "the time" of trial; "for it is (to last) yet
for a time appointed" by God.

[Daniel 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">dan 11:36</span></span>

The wilful king here, though primarily Antiochus, is antitypically and
mainly Antichrist, the seventh head of the seven-headed and ten-horned
beast of Rev. 13:1-18, and the "beast" of Armageddon ([Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013), [Rev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016); [Rev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019)). Some identify him with the
revived French emperorship, the eighth head of the beast ([Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)), who is to usurp the kingly, as
the Pope has the priestly, dignity of Christ--the false Messiah of the
Jews, who will "plant his tabernacle between the seas in the holy
mountain," "exalting himself above every god" ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004); [Rev
13:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005)). This last clause only in part
holds good of Antiochus; for though he assumed divine honors,
identifying himself with Jupiter Olympius, yet it was for that god he
claimed them; still it applies to him as the type.

speak marvellous things against . . . God of gods--so [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025), as to the "little horn," which
seemingly identifies the two (compare [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025)). Antiochus forbade the worship
of Jehovah by a decree "marvellous" for its wickedness: thus he was a
type of Antichrist. Compare [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008),
"a mouth speaking great things."

indignation . . . accomplished--God's visitation of wrath on the Jews
for their sins ([Dan 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019)).

that . . . determined-- ([Dan 9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026);
[Dan 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021)).

[Daniel 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">dan 11:37</span></span>

Neither . . . regard . . . the desire of women--(Compare [Eze
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016), [Eze
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#018)). The wife, as the desire of
man's eyes, is the symbol of the tenderest relations ([Sa2
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026)). Antiochus would set at naught
even their entreaties that he should cease from his attack on Jehovah's
worship \[POLANUS\]. MAURER refers it to Antiochus' attack on the temple
of the Syrian Venus, worshipped by women (1 Maccabees 6:1, &c.; 2
Maccabees 1:13). NEWTON refers it to Rome's "forbidding to marry."
ELLIOTT rightly makes the antitypical reference be to Messiah. Jewish
women desired to be mothers with a view to Him, the promised seed of the
woman ([Gen 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#023); [Luk
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025), [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028)).

nor regard any god-- ([Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)).

[Daniel 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">dan 11:38</span></span>

God of forces--probably Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom Antiochus began to
erect a temple at Antioch \[LIVY, 41.20\]. Translate, "He shall honor
the god of fortresses on his basis," that is, the base of the statue.
NEWTON translates, "And the god 'Mahuzzim' (guardians, that is, saints
adored as 'protectors' in the Greek and Roman churches) shall he honor."

honour with gold, &c.--Compare [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004) as to Antiochus' antitype,
Antichrist.

[Daniel 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">dan 11:39</span></span>

NEWTON translates, "to be defenders of Mahuzzim (the monks and priests
who uphold saint worship), together with the strange god whom he shall
acknowledge, he shall multiply honor." English Version is better: He
shall do (exploits) in the most strongholds (that is, shall succeed
against them) with a strange god (under the auspices of a god which he
worshipped not before, namely, Jupiter Capitolinus, whose Worship he
imported into his empire from Rome). Antiochus succeeded against
Jerusalem, Sidon, Pelusium, Memphis.

cause them--Antiochus "caused" his followers and the apostates "to rule
over many" Jews, having "divided their land" (Judea), "for gain" (that
is, as a reward for their compliance).

[Daniel 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">dan 11:40</span></span>

The difficulty of reconciling this with Antiochus' history is that no
historian but PORPHYRY mentions an expedition of his into Egypt towards
the close of his reign. This [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040), therefore, may be a
recapitulation summing up the facts of the first expedition to Egypt
(171-170 B.C.), in [Dan 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022), [Dan
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#025); and [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041), the former invasion of Judea,
in [Dan 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028); [Dan
11:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042), the second and third
invasions of Egypt (169 and 168 B.C.) in [Dan
11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023), [Dan
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#029). AUBERLEN takes rather
PORPHYRY'S statement, that Antiochus, in the eleventh year of his reign
(166-165 B.C.), invaded Egypt again, and took Palestine on his way. The
"tidings" ([Dan 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#044)) as to the
revolt of tributary nations then led him to the East. PORPHYRY'S
statement that Antiochus starting from Egypt took Arad in Judah, and
devastated all PhÅ“nicia, agrees with [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045); then he turned to check
Artaxias, king of Armenia. He died in the Persian town Tabes, 164 B.C.,
as both POLYBIUS and PORPHYRY agree. Doubtless, antitypically, the final
Antichrist, and its predecessor Mohammed, are intended, to whom the
language may be more fully applicable than to Antiochus the type. The
Saracen Arabs "of the south" "pushed at" the Greek emperor Heraclius,
and deprived him of Egypt and Syria. But the Turks of "the north" not
merely pushed at, but destroyed the Greek empire; therefore more is said
of them than of the Saracens. Their "horsemen" are specified, being
their chief strength. Their standards still are horse tails. Their
"ships," too, often gained the victory over Venice, the great naval
power of Europe in that day. They "overflowed" Western Asia, and then
"passed over" into Europe, fixing their seat of empire at Constantinople
under Mohammed II \[NEWTON\].

[Daniel 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">dan 11:41</span></span>

Antiochus, according to PORPHYRY, marching against Ptolemy, though he
turned from his course to wreak his wrath on the Jews, did not meddle
with Edom, Moab, and Ammon on the side of Judea. In 1 Maccabees 4:61;
5:3; &c., it is stated that he used their help in crushing the Jews, of
whom they were the ancient enemies. Compare [Isa
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014), as to Israel's future
retribution, just as the Maccabees made war on them as the friends of
Antiochus (1 Maccabees 5:1-68). Antitypically, the Turks under Selim
entered Jerusalem on their way to Egypt, and retain "the glorious land"
of Palestine to this day. But they never could conquer the Arabs, who
are akin to Edom, Moab, and Ammon ([Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012)). So in the case of the final
Antichrist.

Egypt . . . Libyans . . . Ethiopians--The latter two, being the allies
of the first, served under Antiochus when he conquered Egypt.
Antitypically, Egypt, though it held out long under the Mamelukes, in
A.D. 1517 fell under the Turks. Algiers, Tunis, and other parts of
Africa, are still under them.

tidings out of the east and out of the north--Artaxias, king of Armenia,
his vassal, had revolted in the north, and Arsaces, leader of the
Parthians, in the east (1 Maccabees 3:10, &c., 1 Maccabees 3:37;
TACITUS, Histories, 5.8). In 147 B.C. Antiochus went on the expedition
against them, on the return from which he died.

great fury--at the Jews, on account of their successes under Judas
Maccabeus, whence he desired to replenish his treasury with means to
prosecute the war with them; also at Artaxias and Arsaces, and their
respective followers. DE BURGH makes the "tidings" which rouse his fury,
to be concerning the Jews' restoration; such may be the antitypical
reference.

tabernacles of . . . palace--his palace-like military tents, such as
Oriental princes travel with. See on [Dan
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040), as to the time of Antiochus'
attack on Judea, and his subsequent "end" at Tabes, which was caused by
chagrin both at hearing that his forces under Lysias were overcome by
the Jews, and at the failure of his expedition against the temple of
Elymais (2 Maccabees 9:5).

holy mountain--Jerusalem and Mount Zion. The desolation of the sanctuary
by Antiochus, and also the desecration of the consecrated ground round
Jerusalem by the idolatrous Roman ensigns, as also by the Mohammedan
mosque, and, finally, by the last Antichrist, are referred to. So the
last Antichrist is to sit upon "the mount of the congregation" ([Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)), but "shall be brought down to
hell" (compare Note, see on [Dan 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026);
[Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)).

Compare [Dan 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004), [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013); as [Dan
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006) refer to [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025), that is, to the time of
Antichrist, so the subsequent [Dan
12:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#008) treat of the time of Antiochus
(compare [Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011) with [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)), thus putting together in one
summary view the two great periods of distress. The political
resurrection of the Jews under the Maccabees is the starting-point of
transition to the literal resurrection about to follow the destruction
of Antichrist by Christ's coming in glory. The language passes here from
the nearer to the more remote event, to which alone it is fully
applicable.
