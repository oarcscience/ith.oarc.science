### [Psalms Chapter 122](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 122:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 122:1</span></span>

This Psalm might well express the sacred joy of the pilgrims on entering
the holy city, where praise, as the religious as well as civil
metropolis, is celebrated, and for whose prosperity, as representing the
Church, prayer is offered. ([Psa
122:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001).md)

Our feet shall stand--literally, "are standing."

[Psalms 122:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 122:2</span></span>

gates--(Compare [Psa 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014.md); [Psa
87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 122:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 122:3</span></span>

compact together--all parts united, as in David's time.

[Psalms 122:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 122:4</span></span>

testimony--If "unto" is supplied, this may denote the ark ([Exo
25:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010).md); otherwise the act of going
is denoted, called a testimony in allusion to the requisition ([Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md), with which it was a
compliance.

[Psalms 122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 122:5</span></span>

there are set thrones--or, "do sit, thrones," used for the occupants,
David's sons ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md).

[Psalms 122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 122:6</span></span>

Let peace--including prosperity, everywhere prevail.

[Psalms 122:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 122:8</span></span>

In the welfare of the city, as its civil, and especially the religious
relations, was involved that of Israel.

now--as in [Psa 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 122:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 122:9</span></span>

Let me say--house of . . . God--in wider sense, the Church, whose
welfare would be promoted by the good of Jerusalem.
