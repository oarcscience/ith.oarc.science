### [Numbers Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 31:1</span></span>

THE MIDIANITES SPOILED AND BALAAM SLAIN. (Num. 31:1-54)

the Lord spake unto Moses, Avenge the children of Israel of the
Midianites--a semi-nomad people, descended from Abraham and Keturah,
occupying a tract of country east and southeast of Moab, which lay on
the eastern coast of the Dead Sea. They seem to have been the principal
instigators of the infamous scheme of seduction, planned to entrap the
Israelites into the double crime of idolatry and licentiousness \[[Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md), [Num
25:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#017.md)\] by which, it was hoped, the
Lord would withdraw from that people the benefit of His protection and
favor. Moreover, the Midianites had rendered themselves particularly
obnoxious by entering into a hostile league with the Amorites ([Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021).md). The Moabites were at this time
spared in consideration of Lot ([Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009).md) and because the measure of their
iniquities was not yet full. God spoke of avenging "the children of
Israel" \[[Num 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002.md)\]; Moses spoke of
avenging the Lord \[[Num 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003.md)\], as
dishonor had been done to God and an injury inflicted on His people. The
interests were identical. God and His people have the same cause, the
same friends, and the same assailants. This, in fact, was a religious
war, undertaken by the express command of God against idolaters, who had
seduced the Israelites to practise their abominations.

[Numbers 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 31:3</span></span>

Arm some of yourselves--This order was issued but a short time before
the death of Moses. The announcement to him of that approaching event
\[[Num 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002.md)\] seems to have
accelerated, rather than retarded, his warlike preparations.

[Numbers 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 31:5</span></span>

there were delivered--that is, drafted, chosen, an equal amount from
each tribe, to prevent the outbreak of mutual jealousy or strife.
Considering the numerical force of the enemy, this was a small quota to
furnish. But the design was to exercise their faith and animate them to
the approaching invasion of Canaan.

[Numbers 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 31:6</span></span>

Moses sent . . . Eleazar the priest, to the war--Although it is not
expressly mentioned, it is highly probable that Joshua was the general
who conducted this war. The presence of the priest, who was always with
the army ([Deu 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002).md), was necessary to
preside over the Levites, who accompanied the expedition, and to inflame
the courage of the combatants by his sacred services and counsels.

holy instruments--As neither the ark nor the Urim and Thummim were
carried to the battlefield till a later period in the history of Israel,
the "holy instruments" must mean the "trumpets" ([Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009).md). And this view is agreeable to
the text, by simply changing "and" into "even," as the Hebrew particle
is frequently rendered.

[Numbers 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 31:7</span></span>

they slew all the males--This was in accordance with a divine order in
all such cases ([Deu 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#013).md). But the
destruction appears to have been only partial--limited to those who were
in the neighborhood of the Hebrew camp and who had been accomplices in
the villainous plot of Baal-peor ([Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).md), while a large portion of the
Midianites were absent on their pastoral wanderings or had saved
themselves by flight. (Compare [Jdg
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001).md).

[Numbers 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 31:8</span></span>

the kings of Midian--so called, because each was possessed of absolute
power within his own city or district; called also dukes or princes of
Sihon ([Jos 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021).md), having been
probably subject to that Amorite ruler, as it is not uncommon in the
East to find a number of governors or pachas tributary to one great
king.

Zur--father of Cozbi ([Num 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#015).md).

Balaam also . . . they slew with the sword--This unprincipled man, on
his dismissal from Balak, set out for his home in Mesopotamia ([Num
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025).md). But, either diverging from his
way to tamper with the Midianites, he remained among them without
proceeding farther, to incite them against Israel and to watch the
effects of his wicked counsel; or, learning in his own country that the
Israelites had fallen into the snare which he had laid and which he
doubted not would lead to their ruin, he had, under the impulse of
insatiable greed, returned to demand his reward from the Midianites. He
was an object of merited vengeance. In the immense slaughter of the
Midianitish people--in the capture of their women, children, and
property and in the destruction of all their places of refuge--the
severity of a righteous God fell heavily on that base and corrupt race.
But, more than all others, Balaam deserved and got the just reward of
his deeds. His conduct had been atrociously sinful, considering the
knowledge he possessed, and the revelations he had received, of the will
of God. For any one in his circumstances to attempt defeating the
prophecies he had himself been the organ of uttering, and plotting to
deprive the chosen people of the divine favor and protection, was an act
of desperate wickedness, which no language can adequately characterize.

[Numbers 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 31:13</span></span>

Moses, and Eleazar the priest, . . . went forth to meet them without the
camp--partly as a token of respect and congratulation on their victory,
partly to see how they had executed the Lord's commands, and partly to
prevent the defilement of the camp by the entrance of warriors stained
with blood.

[Numbers 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 31:14</span></span>

And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host--The displeasure of
the great leader, though it appears the ebullition of a fierce and
sanguinary temper, arose in reality from a pious and enlightened regard
to the best interests of Israel. No order had been given for the
slaughter of the women, and in ancient war they were commonly reserved
for slaves. By their antecedent conduct, however, the Midianitish women
had forfeited all claims to mild or merciful treatment; and the sacred
character, the avowed object of the war ([Num
31:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002).md), made their slaughter
necessary without any special order. But why "kill every male among the
little ones"? It was designed to be a war of extermination, such as God
Himself had ordered against the people of Canaan, whom the Midianites
equalled in the enormity of their wickedness.

[Numbers 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 31:19</span></span>

abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person . .
. purify both yourselves and your captives--Though the Israelites had
taken the field in obedience to the command of God, they had become
defiled by contact with the dead. A process of purification was to be
undergone, as the law required ([Lev
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md); [Num
19:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009).md), and this purifying ceremony
was extended to dress, houses, tents, to everything on which a dead body
had lain, which had been touched by the blood-stained hands of the
Israelitish warriors, or which had been the property of idolaters. This
became a standing ordinance in all time coming ([Lev
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#028.md); [Lev
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#033.md); [Lev
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#012).md).

[Numbers 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 31:25</span></span>

Take the sum of the prey that was taken--that is, of the captives and
cattle, which, having been first lumped together according to ancient
usage ([Exo 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009.md); [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030).md), were divided into two equal
parts: the one to the people at large, who had sustained a common injury
from the Midianites and who were all liable to serve: and the other
portion to the combatants, who, having encountered the labors and perils
of war, justly received the largest share. From both parts, however, a
certain deduction was taken for the sanctuary, as a thank offering to
God for preservation and for victory. The soldiers had greatly the
advantage in the distribution; for a five-hundredth part only of their
half went to the priest, while a fiftieth part of the congregation's
half was given to the Levites.

[Numbers 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 31:32</span></span>

the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had
caught--Some of the captives having been killed ([Num
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017).md) and part of the cattle taken
for the support of the army, the total amount of the booty remaining was
in the following proportions:

Prey Total Amount Half to Soldiers Deducted to God Half to Congregation
Deducted to Levites

Sheep 675,000 337,500 675 337,500 6,750

Beeves 72,000 36,000 72 36,000 720

Asses 61,000 30,500 61 30,500 610

Persons 32,000 16,000 32 16,000 320

[Numbers 31:48](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 31:48</span></span>

officers . . . said . . . there lacketh not one man of us--A victory so
signal, and the glory of which was untarnished by the loss of a single
Israelitish soldier, was an astonishing miracle. So clearly betokening
the direct interposition of Heaven, it might well awaken the liveliest
feelings of grateful acknowledgment to God ([Psa
44:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002).md). The oblation they brought for
the Lord "was partly an atonement" or reparation for their error ([Num
31:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#014).md), for it could not possess
any expiatory virtue, and partly a tribute of gratitude for the
stupendous service rendered them. It consisted of the "spoil," which,
being the acquisition of individual valor, was not divided like the
"prey," or livestock, each soldier retaining it in lieu of pay; it was
offered by the "captains" alone, whose pious feelings were evinced by
the dedication of the spoil which fell to their share. There were jewels
to the amount of 16,750 shekels, equal to Â£87,869 16s. 5d. sterling.
