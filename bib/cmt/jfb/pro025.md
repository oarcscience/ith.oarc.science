### [Proverbs Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

[Proverbs 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 25:1</span></span>

(Pro. 25:1-28)

The character of these proverbs sustains the title (see Introduction).

also--refers to the former part of the book.

copied out--literally, "transferred," that is, from some other book to
this; not given from memory.

[Proverbs 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 25:2</span></span>

God's unsearchableness impresses us with awe (compare [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015); [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)). But kings, being finite,
should confer with wise counsellors;

[Proverbs 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 25:3</span></span>

Ye wisely keeping state secrets, which to common men are as inaccessible
heights and depths.

[Proverbs 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 25:4</span></span>

As separating impurities from ore leaves pure silver, so taking from a
king wicked counsellors leaves a wise and beneficent government.

[Proverbs 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 25:5</span></span>

before--or, "in presence of," as courtiers stood about a king.

[Proverbs 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 25:6</span></span>

Do not intrude into the presence of the king, for the elevation of the
humble is honorable, but the humbling of the proud disgraceful ([Luk
14:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008)).

[Proverbs 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 25:8</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#030)).

lest . . . shame--lest you do what you ought not, when shamed by defeat,
or "lest thou art shut out from doing any thing."

[Proverbs 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 25:9</span></span>

(Compare [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025), Margin).

secret--that is, of your opponent, for his disadvantage, and so you be
disgraced, not having discussed your difficulties with him.

[Proverbs 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 25:11</span></span>

a word fitly--literally, "quickly," as wheels roll, just in time. The
comparison as apples . . . silver gives a like sense.

apples, &c.--either real apples of golden color, in a silver network
basket, or imitations on silver embroidery.

[Proverbs 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 25:12</span></span>

Those who desire to know and do rightly, most highly esteem good counsel
([Pro 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009); [Pro
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031)). The listening ear is better
than one hung with gold.

[Proverbs 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 25:13</span></span>

Snow from mountains was used to cool drinks; so refreshing is a faithful
messenger ([Pro 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 25:14</span></span>

clouds--literally, "vapors" ([Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013)), clouds only in appearance.

a false gift--promised, but not given.

[Proverbs 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 25:15</span></span>

Gentleness and kindness overcome the most powerful and obstinate.

long forbearing--or, "slowness to anger" ([Pro
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029); [Pro
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#018)).

[Proverbs 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 25:16</span></span>

A comparison, as a surfeit of honey produces physical disgust, so your
company, however agreeable in moderation, may, if excessive, lead your
friend to hate you.

[Proverbs 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 25:18</span></span>

A false witness is as destructive to reputation, as such weapons to the
body ([Pro 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#028)).

beareth . . . witness--literally, "answereth questions," as before a
judge, against his neighbor.

[Proverbs 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 25:19</span></span>

Treachery annoys as well as deceives.

[Proverbs 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 25:20</span></span>

Not only is the incongruity of songs (that is, joyful) and sadness
meant, but an accession of sadness, by want of sympathy, is implied.

[Proverbs 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 25:21</span></span>

(Compare [Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044); [Rom
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020)). As metals are melted by
heaping coals upon them, so is the heart softened by kindness.

[Proverbs 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 25:23</span></span>

Better, "As the north wind bringeth forth ([Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002)) or produces rain, so does a
concealed or slandering tongue produce anger."

[Proverbs 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 25:24</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009), [Pro
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 25:25</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013)).

good news--that is, of some loved interest or absent friend, the more
grateful as coming from afar.

[Proverbs 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 25:26</span></span>

From troubled fountains and corrupt springs no healthy water is to be
had, so when the righteous are oppressed by the wicked, their power for
good is lessened or destroyed.

[Proverbs 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 25:27</span></span>

Satiety surfeits ([Pro 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016)); so men
who are self-glorious find shame.

is not glory--"not" is supplied from the first clause, or "is grievous,"
in which sense a similar word is used ([Pro
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002)).

[Proverbs 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 25:28</span></span>

Such are exposed to the incursions of evil thoughts and successful
temptations.
