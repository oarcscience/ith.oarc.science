Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 3:1</span></span>

(Isa. 3:1-26)

For--continuation of [Isa 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md).

Lord of hosts--therefore able to do as He says.

doth--present for future, so certain is the accomplishment.

stay . . . staff--the same Hebrew word, the one masculine, the other
feminine, an Arabic idiom for all kinds of support. What a change from
the previous luxuries ([Isa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007).md)!
Fulfilled in the siege by Nebuchadnezzar and afterwards by Titus ([Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md); [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 3:2</span></span>

Fulfilled ([Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014).md).

prudent--the Hebrew often means a "soothsayer" ([Deu
18:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010).md); thus it will mean, the
diviners, on whom they rely, shall in that day fail. It is found in a
good sense ([Pro 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010).md), from which
passage the Jews interpret it a king; "without" whom Israel long has
been ([Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md).

ancient--old and experienced ([Kg1
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 3:3</span></span>

captain of fifty--not only captains of thousands, and centurions of a
hundred, but even semi-centurions of fifty, shall fail.

honourable--literally, "of dignified aspect."

cunning--skilful. The mechanic's business will come to a standstill in
the siege and subsequent desolation of the state; artisans are no mean
"stay" among a nation's safeguards.

eloquent orator--rather, as Vulgate, "skilled in whispering," that is,
incantation ([Psa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005).md). See [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md), below; and on "prudent," see on
[Isa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md).

[Isaiah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 3:4</span></span>

children--in ability for governing; antithesis to the "ancient" (see
[Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md); [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016).md).

babes--in warlike might; antithesis to "the mighty" and "man of war."

[Isaiah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 3:5</span></span>

The anarchy resulting under such imbecile rulers ([Isa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004).md); unjust exactions mutually; the
forms of respect violated ([Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032).md).

base--low-born. Compare the marks of "the last days" ([Ti2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 3:6</span></span>

Such will be the want of men of wealth and ability, that they will "take
hold of" ([Isa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001).md) the first man whom
they meet, having any property, to make him "ruler."

brother--one having no better hereditary claim to be ruler than the
"man" supplicating him.

Thou hast clothing--which none of us has. Changes of raiment are wealth
in the East ([Kg2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005).md).

ruin--Let our ruined affairs be committed to thee to retrieve.

[Isaiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 3:7</span></span>

swear--literally, "lift up," namely, his hand; the gesture used in
solemn attestation. Or, his voice, that is, answer; so Vulgate.

healer--of the body politic, incurably diseased ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md).

neither . . . clothing--so as to relieve the people and maintain a
ruler's dignity. A nation's state must be bad indeed, when none among
men, naturally ambitious, is willing to accept office.

[Isaiah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 3:8</span></span>

Reason given by the prophet, why all shrink from the government.

eyes of his glory--to provoke His "glorious" Majesty before His "eyes"
(compare [Isa 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md); [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md). The Syriac and LOWTH, by a
slight change of the Hebrew, translate, "the cloud of His glory," the
Shekinah.

[Isaiah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 3:9</span></span>

show--The Hebrew means, "that which may be known by their countenances"
\[GESENIUS and WEISS\]. But MAURER translates, "Their respect for
person"; so Syriac and Chaldee. But the parallel word "declare" favors
the other view. KIMCHI, from the Arabic, translates "their hardness"
([Job 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003), Margin.md), or impudence of
countenance ([Jer 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003).md). They have lost
not only the substance of virtue, but its color.

witness--literally, "corresponds" to them; their look answers to their
inner character ([Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005).md).

declare-- ([Jde 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013).md). "Foaming out
their own shame"; so far from making it a secret, "glorying" in it ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md).

unto themselves--Compare "in themselves" ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md); [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 3:10</span></span>

The faithlessness of many is no proof that all are faithless. Though
nothing but croaking of frogs is heard on the surface of the pool, we
are not to infer there are no fish beneath \[BENGEL\]. (See [Isa
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019).md).

fruit of doings-- ([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md) in a
good sense ([Gal 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014).md). Not salvation by works, but by
fruit-bearing faith ([Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md); [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md). GESENIUS and WEISS translate,
Declare as to the righteous that, &c. MAURER, "Say that the righteous is
blessed."

[Isaiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 3:11</span></span>

ill--antithesis to "well" ([Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md);
emphatic ellipsis of the words italicized. "Ill!"

hands--his conduct; "hands" being the instrument of acts ([Ecc
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 3:12</span></span>

(See [Isa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004).md).

oppressors--literally, "exactors," that is, exacting princes ([Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017).md). They who ought to be
protectors are exactors; as unqualified for rule as "children," as
effeminate as "women." Perhaps it is also implied that they were under
the influence of their harem, the women of their court.

lead--Hebrew, "call thee blessed"; namely, the false prophets, who
flatter the people with promises of safety in sin; as the political
"rulers" are meant in the first clause.

way of thy paths-- ([Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md). The
right way set forth in the law. "Destroy"--Hebrew, "Swallow up," that
is, cause so utterly to disappear that not a vestige of it is left.

[Isaiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 3:13</span></span>

standeth up--no longer sitting in silence.

plead--indignant against a wicked people ([Isa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md); [Eze
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035).md).

[Isaiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 3:14</span></span>

ancients--Hence they are spoken of as "taken away" ([Isa
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md).

vineyard--the Jewish theocracy ([Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md); [Psa
80:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009).md).

eaten up--"burnt"; namely, by "oppressive exactions" ([Isa
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012).md). Type of the crowning guilt of
the husbandmen in the days of Jesus Christ ([Mat
21:34-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034).md).

spoil . . . houses-- ([Mat 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 3:15</span></span>

What right have ye to beat, &c. ([Psa
94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md); [Mic
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002).md).

grind--by exactions, so as to leave them nothing.

faces--persons; with the additional idea of it being openly and palpably
done. "Presence," equivalent to "face" (Hebrew).

[Isaiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 3:16</span></span>

Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, &c.--Luxury had become great
in Uzziah's prosperous reign ([Ch2
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005).md).

stretched forth--proudly elevated ([Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md).

wanton--rather, "making the eyes to glance about," namely, wantonly
([Pro 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013).md) \[MAURER\]. But LOWTH,
"falsely setting off the eyes with paint." Women's eyelids in the East
are often colored with stibium, or powder of lead (see on [Job
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#014.md); [Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030), Margin.md).

mincing--tripping with short steps.

tinkling--with their ankle-rings on both feet, joined by small chains,
which sound as they walk, and compel them to take short steps; sometimes
little bells were attached ([Isa 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md),
[Isa 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 3:17</span></span>

smite with a scab--literally, "make bald," namely, by disease.

discover--cause them to suffer the greatest indignity that can befall
female captives, namely to be stripped naked, and have their persons
exposed ([Isa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003.md); compare with [Isa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 3:18</span></span>

bravery--the finery.

tinkling--(See [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md).

cauls--network for the head. Or else, from an Arabic root, "little
suns," answering to the "tires" or neck-ornaments, "like the moon" ([Jdg
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021).md). The chumarah or crescent is
also worn in front of the headdress in West Asia.

[Isaiah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 3:19</span></span>

chains--rather, pendants, hanging about the neck, and dropping on the
breast.

mufflers--veils covering the face, with apertures for the eyes, close
above and loosely flowing below. The word radically means "tremulous,"
referring to the changing effect of the spangles on the veil.

[Isaiah 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 3:20</span></span>

bonnets--turbans.

ornaments of the legs--the short stepping-chains from one foot to
another, to give a measured gait; attached to the "tinkling ornaments"
([Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016).md).

headbands--literally, "girdles."

tablets--rather, "houses of the breath," that is, smelling boxes
\[Vulgate\].

earrings--rather, amulets suspended from the neck or ears, with magic
formulÃ&brvbr; inscribed; the root means to "whisper" or "conjure."

[Isaiah 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 3:21</span></span>

nose jewels--The cartilage between the nostrils was bored to receive
them; they usually hung from the left nostril.

[Isaiah 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 3:22</span></span>

Here begin entire articles of apparel. Those before were single
ornaments.

changeable--from a root, "to put off"; not worn commonly; put on and off
on special occasions. So, dress-clothes ([Zac
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004).md).

mantles--fuller tunics with sleeves, worn over the common one, reaching
down to the feet.

wimples--that is, mufflers, or hoods. In [Rut
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015.md), "veils"; perhaps here, a broad
cloak, or shawl, thrown over the head and body.

crisping pins--rather, money bags ([Kg2
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 3:23</span></span>

glasses--mirrors of polished metal ([Exo
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008).md). But the Septuagint, a
transparent, gauze-like, garment.

hoods--miters, or diadems ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md);
[Zac 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005).md).

veils--large enough to cover the head and person. Distinct from the
smaller veils ("mufflers") above ([Gen
24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065).md). Token of woman's subjection
([Co1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 3:24</span></span>

stink--arising from ulcers ([Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012).md).

girdle--to gird up the loose Eastern garments, when the person walked.

rent--the Septuagint, better, a "rope," an emblem of poverty; the poor
have nothing else to gird up their clothes with.

well-set hair-- ([Pe1 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003).md).

baldness-- ([Isa 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#017).md).

stomacher--a broad plaited girdle.

sackcloth-- ([Sa2 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031).md).

burning--a sunburnt countenance, owing to their hoods and veils being
stripped off, while they had to work as captives under a scorching sun
([Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 3:25</span></span>

Thy men--of Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 3:26</span></span>

gates--The place of concourse personified is represented mourning for
the loss of those multitudes which once frequented it.

desolate . . . sit upon . . . ground--the very figure under which Judea
was represented on medals after the destruction by Titus: a female
sitting under a palm tree in a posture of grief; the motto, JudÃ&brvbr;a
capta ([Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md), where, as here primarily, the
destruction by Nebuchadnezzar is alluded to).

that day--the calamitous period described in previous chapter.

seven--indefinite number among the Jews. So many men would be slain,
that there would be very many more women than men; for example, seven
women, contrary to their natural bashfulness, would sue to (equivalent
to "take hold of," [Isa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006).md) one man
to marry them.

eat . . . own bread--foregoing the privileges, which the law ([Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010).md) gives to wives, when a man has
more than one.

reproach--of being unwedded and childless; especially felt among the
Jews, who were looking for "the seed of the woman," Jesus Christ,
described in [Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md); [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md), [Isa
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md); [Luk
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md).
