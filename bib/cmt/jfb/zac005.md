### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

[Zechariah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 5:1</span></span>

SIXTH VISION. THE FLYING ROLL. The fraudulent and perjuring
transgressors of the law shall be extirpated from Judea. ([Zac
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001))

flying roll--of papyrus, or dressed skins, used for writing on when
paper was not known. It was inscribed with the words of the curse ([Deu
27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015); Deu. 28:15-68). Being
written implied that its contents were beyond all escape or repeal ([Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009)). Its "flying" shows that its
curses were ready swiftly to visit the transgressors. It was unrolled,
or else its dimensions could not have been seen ([Zac
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002)). Being open to all, none could
say in excuse he knew not the law and the curses of disobedience. As the
previous visions intimated God's favor in restoring the Jewish state, so
this vision announces judgment, intimating that God, notwithstanding His
favor, did not approve of their sins. Being written on both sides, "on
this and on that side" ([Zac 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)),
VATABLUS connects it with the two tables of the law ([Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015)), and implies its
comprehensiveness. One side denounced "him that sweareth falsely ([Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004)) by God's name," according to the
third commandment of the first table, duty to God; the other side
denounced theft, according to the eighth commandment, which is in the
second table, duty to one's neighbor.

[Zechariah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 5:2</span></span>

length . . . twenty cubits . . . breadth . . . ten cubits--thirty feet
by fifteen, the dimensions of the temple porch ([Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003)), where the law was usually read,
showing that it was divinely authoritative in the theocracy. Its large
size implies the great number of the curses contained. The Hebrew for
"roll" or "volume" is used of the law ([Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007)).

[Zechariah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 5:3</span></span>

curse . . . earth-- ([Mal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006)). The
Gentiles are amenable to the curse of the law, as they have its
substance, so far as they have not seared and corrupted conscience,
written on their hearts ([Rom 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015)).

cut off--literally, "cleared away."

as on this side . . . as on that side--both sides of the roll
\[VATABLUS\]. From this place . . . from this place (repeated twice, as
"the house" is repeated in [Zac 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004))
\[MAURER\]; so "hence" is used, [Gen
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#017) (or, "on this and on that side,"
that is, on every side) \[HENDERSON\]. None can escape, sin where he
may: for God from one side to the other shall call all without exception
to judgment \[CALVIN\]. God will not spare even "this place," Jerusalem,
when it sins \[PEMBELLUS\]. English Version seems to take VATABLUS'
view.

according to it--according as it is written.

[Zechariah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 5:4</span></span>

The "theft" immediately meant is similar sacrilege to that complained of
in [Neh 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010); [Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008). They robbed God by neglecting to
give Him His due in building His house, while they built their own
houses, forswearing their obligations to Him; therefore, the "houses"
they build shall be "consumed" with God's "curse." Probably literal
theft and perjury accompanied their virtual theft and perjury as to the
temple of God ([Mal 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005)). Stealing and
perjury go together; for the covetous and fraudulent perjure themselves
by God's name without scruple (see [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009)).

enter . . . the house--In vain they guard and shut themselves up who
incur the curse; it will inevitably enter even when they think
themselves most secure.

consume . . . timber . . . stones--not leaving a vestige of it. So the
"stones" and "timber" of the house of a leper (type of the sinner) were
to be utterly removed ([Lev 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#015);
compare [Kg1 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038)).

The "ephah" is the Hebrew dry measure containing about thirty-seven
quarts. Alluding to the previous vision as to theft and perjury: the
ephah which, by falsification of the measure, they made the instrument
of defrauding, shall be made the instrument of their punishment
\[GROTIUS\]. Compare "this is their resemblance" ([Zac
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006)), that is, this is a
representation of what the Jews have done, and what they shall suffer.
Their total dispersion ("the land of Shinar" being the emblem of the
various Gentile lands of their present dispersion) is herein fortetold,
when the measure (to which the ephah alludes) of their sins should be
full. The former vision denounces judgment on individuals; this one, on
the whole state: but enigmatically, not to discourage their present
building \[PEMBELLUS\]. Rather, the vision is consolatory after the
preceding one \[CALVIN\]. Idolatry and its kindred sins, covetousness
and fraud (denounced in the vision of the roll), shall be removed far
out of the Holy Land to their own congenial soil, never to return (so
[Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009); [Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021); [Jer
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020); [Zep
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013)). For more than two thousand
years, ever since the Babylonian exile, the Jews have been free from
idolatry; but the full accomplishment of the prophecy is yet future,
when all sin shall be purged from Israel on their return to Palestine,
and conversion to Christ.

[Zechariah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 5:5</span></span>

SEVENTH VISION. THE WOMAN IN THE EPHAH. Wickedness and idolatry removed
from the Holy Land to Babylon, there to mingle with their kindred
elements. ([Zac 5:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005))

went forth--The interpreting angel had withdrawn after the vision of the
roll to receive a fresh revelation from the Divine Angel to communicate
to the prophet.

[Zechariah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 5:6</span></span>

This is their resemblance--literally, "eye" (compare [Eze
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004), [Eze
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016)). HENGSTENBERG translates, "Their
(the people's) eye" was all directed to evil. But English Version is
better. "This is the appearance (that is, an image) of the Jews in all
the land" (not as English Version, "in all the earth"), that is, of the
wicked Jews.

This--Here used of what was within the ephah, not the ephah itself.

[Zechariah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 5:7</span></span>

lifted up--The cover is lifted off the ephah to let the prophet see the
female personification of "wickedness" within, about to be removed from
Judea. The cover being "of lead," implies that the "woman" cannot escape
from the ponderous load which presses her down.

talent--literally, "a round piece": hence a talent, a weight of one
hundred twenty-five pounds troy.

woman--for comparison of "wickedness" to a woman, [Pro
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016); [Pro
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003). In personifying abstract terms,
the feminine is used, as the idea of giving birth to life is associated
with woman.

[Zechariah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 5:8</span></span>

wickedness--literally, "the wickedness": implying wickedness in its
peculiar development. Compare "the man of sin," [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).

cast it--that is, her, Wickedness, who had moved more freely while the
heavy lid was partially lifted off.

weight--literally, "stone," that is, round mass.

[Zechariah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 5:9</span></span>

The agents to carry away the "woman," are, consistently with the image,
"women." God makes the wicked themselves the agents of punishing and
removing wickedness. "Two" are employed, as one is not enough to carry
such a load \[MAURER\]. Or, the Assyrians and Babylonians, who carried
away idolatry in the persons, respectively, of Israel and Judah
\[HENDERSON\]. As two "anointed ones" ([Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014)) stand by the Lord as His
ministers, so two winged women execute His purpose here in removing the
embodiment of "wickedness": answering to the "mystery of iniquity" (the
Septuagint here in Zechariah uses the same words as Paul and "the man of
sin," whom the Lord shall destroy with the spirit of His mouth and the
brightness of His coming, [Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003),
[Th2 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)). Their "wings" express
velocity. The "stork" has long and wide wings, for which reason it is
specified; also it is a migratory bird. The "wind" helps the rapid
motion of the wings. The being "lifted up between heaven and earth"
implies open execution of the judgment before the eyes of all. As the
"woman" here is removed to Babylon as her own dwelling, so the woman in
the Apocalypse of St. John is Babylon ([Rev
17:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003)).

[Zechariah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 5:11</span></span>

To build . . . house in . . . Shinar--Babylonia ([Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010)), the capital of the God-opposed
world kingdoms, and so representing in general the seat of irreligion.
As the "building of houses" in Babylon ([Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005), [Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028)) by the Jews themselves
expressed their long exile there, so the building of an house for
"wickedness" there implies its permanent stay.

set . . . upon her own base--fixed there as in its proper place.
"Wickedness" being cast out of Judah, shall for ever dwell with the
antichristian apostates (of whom Babylon is the type), who shall reap
the fruit of it, which they deserve.
