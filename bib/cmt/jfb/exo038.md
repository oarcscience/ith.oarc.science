### [Exodus Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001)

[Exodus 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 38:1</span></span>

FURNITURE OF THE TABERNACLE. (Exo. 38:1-31)

the altar of burnt offering--The repetitions are continued, in which may
be traced the exact conformity of the execution to the order.

[Exodus 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 38:8</span></span>

laver of brass . . . of the looking glasses of the women--The word
mirrors should have been used, as those implements, usually round,
inserted into a handle of wood, stone, or metal, were made of brass,
silver, or bronze, highly polished \[WILKINSON\]. It was customary for
the Egyptian women to carry mirrors with them to the temples; and
whether by taking the looking glasses of the Hebrew women Moses designed
to put it out of their power to follow a similar practice at the
tabernacle, or whether the supply of brass from other sources in the
camp was exhausted, it is interesting to learn how zealously and to a
vast extent they surrendered those valued accompaniments of the female
toilet.

of the women assembling . . . at the door--not priestesses but women of
pious character and influence, who frequented the courts of the sacred
building ([Luk 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037)), and whose
parting with their mirrors, like the cutting the hair of the Nazarites,
was their renouncing the world for a season \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Exodus 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 38:9</span></span>

the court--It occupied a space of one hundred and fifty feet by
seventy-five, and it was enclosed by curtains of fine linen about eight
feet high, suspended on brazen or copper pillars. Those curtains were
secured by rods fastened to the top, and kept extended by being fastened
to pins stuck in the ground.

[Exodus 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 38:10</span></span>

hooks--The hooks of the pillars in the court were for hanging up the
carcasses of the sacrificial beasts--those on the pillars at the entry
of the tabernacle were for hanging the sacerdotal robes and other things
used in the service.

[Exodus 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 38:11</span></span>

sockets--mortices or holes in which the end of the pillars stood.

[Exodus 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 38:17</span></span>

chapiters--or capitals of the pillars, were wooden posts which ran along
their top, to which were attached the hooks for the hangings.

[Exodus 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 38:18</span></span>

the height in the breadth--or, "in the measure." The sense is that the
hangings of the court gate, which was twenty cubits wide, were of the
same height as the hangings all round the court \[WALL\].

[Exodus 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 38:21</span></span>

This is the sum of the tabernacle--Having completed his description of
the component parts of the tabernacle, the inspired historian digresses
into a statement respecting the gold and silver employed in it, the
computation being made according to an order of Moses--by the Levites,
under the direction of Ithamar, Aaron's youngest son.

[Exodus 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 38:24</span></span>

twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty
shekels--equivalent to Â£150,00 sterling.

[Exodus 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 38:25</span></span>

the silver of them that were numbered--603,550 men at half a shekel each
would contribute 301,775 shekels; which at 2s. 4d. each, amounts to
Â£35,207 sterling. It may seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites
should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be
remembered that they were enriched first by the spoils of the Egyptians,
and afterwards by those of the Amalekites. Besides, it is highly
probable that during their sojourn they traded with the neighboring
nations who bordered on the wilderness \[HEWLETT\].
