### [Joel Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

[Joel](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

JOEL (meaning "one to whom Jehovah is God," that is, worshipper of
Jehovah) seems to have belonged to Judah, as no reference occurs to
Israel; whereas he speaks of Jerusalem, the temple, the priests, and the
ceremonies, as if he were intimately familiar with them (compare [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), [Joe
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md), [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md); [Joe
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md), [Joe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006.md), [Joe
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016.md), [Joe
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#020).md). His predictions were
probably delivered in the early days of Joash 870-865 B.C.; for no
reference is made in them to the Babylonian, Assyrian, or even the
Syrian invasion; and the only enemies mentioned are the Philistines,
PhÅ“nicians, Edomites, and Egyptians ([Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004.md), [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019).md). Had he lived after Joash, he
would doubtless have mentioned the Syrians among the enemies whom he
enumerates since they took Jerusalem and carried off immense spoil to
Damascus ([Ch2 24:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023).md). No idolatry
is mentioned; and the temple services, the priesthood, and other
institutions of the theocracy, are represented as flourishing. This all
answers to the state of things under the high priesthood of Jehoiada,
through whom Joash had been placed on the throne and who lived in the
early years of Joash ([Kg2 11:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md);
[Kg2 12:2-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002.md); [Ch2
24:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#004).md). He was the son of Pethuel.

The first chapter describes the desolation caused by an inroad of
locusts--one of the instruments of divine judgment mentioned by Moses
([Deu 28:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038).md) and by Solomon ([Kg1
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#037).md). The second chapter ([Joe
2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md): the appearance of them, under
images of a hostile army suggesting that the locusts were symbols and
forerunners of a more terrible scourge, namely, foreign enemies who
would consume all before them. (The absence of mention of personal
injury to the inhabitants is not a just objection to the figurative
interpretation; for the figure is consistent throughout in attributing
to the locusts only injury to vegetation, thereby injuring indirectly
man and beast). [Joe 2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012.md) :
exhortation to repentance, the result of which will be: God will deliver
His people, the former and latter rains shall return to fertilize their
desolated lands, and these shall be the pledge of the spiritual
outpouring of grace beginning with Judah, and thence extending to "all
flesh." Joel 2:18-3:21 : God's judgments on Judah's enemies, whereas
Judah shall be established for ever.

Joel's style is pre-eminently pure. It is characterized by smoothness
and fluency in the rhythms, roundness in the sentences, and regularity
in the parallelisms. With the strength of Micah it combines the
tenderness of Jeremiah, the vividness of Nahum, and the sublimity of
Isaiah. As a specimen of his style take the second chapter wherein the
terrible aspect of the locusts, their rapidity, irresistible progress,
noisy din, and instinct-taught power of marshalling their forces for
their career of devastation, are painted with graphic reality.
