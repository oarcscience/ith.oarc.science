### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

PROPHECY OF THE SEVENTY YEARS CAPTIVITY; AND AFTER THAT THE DESTRUCTION
OF BABYLON, AND OF ALL THE NATIONS THAT OPPRESSED THE JEWS. (Jer.
25:1-38)

fourth year of Jehoiakim--called the third year in [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md). But probably Jehoiakim was set on
the throne by Pharaoh-necho on his return from Carchemish about July,
whereas Nebuchadnezzar mounted the throne January 21, 604 B.C.; so that
Nebuchadnezzar's first year was partly the third, partly the fourth, of
Jehoiakim's. Here first Jeremiah gives specific dates. Nebuchadnezzar
had previously entered Judea in the reign of his father Nabopolassar.

[Jeremiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 25:3</span></span>

From the thirteenth year of Josiah, in which Jeremiah began to prophesy
([Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001).md), to the end of Josiah's
reign, was nineteen years ([Kg2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001).md)
of Jehoahaz' reign, with the not quite complete four years of Jehoiakim
([Jer 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001).md), added to the nineteen
years, make up twenty-three years in all.

[Jeremiah 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 25:4</span></span>

rising early--(See on [Jer 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013).md). "The
prophets" refer to Urijah, Zephaniah, Habakkuk, &c. It aggravates their
sin, that God sent not merely one but many messengers, and those
messengers, prophets; and, that during all those years specified,
Jeremiah and his fellow prophets spared no effort, late and early.

[Jeremiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 25:5</span></span>

Turn . . . dwell--In Hebrew there is expressed by sameness of sounds the
correspondence between their turning to God and God's turning to them to
permit them to dwell in their land: Shubu . . . shebu, "Return" . . . so
shall ye "remain."

every one from . . . evil--Each must separately repent and turn from his
own sin. None is excepted, lest they should think their guilt extenuated
because the evil is general.

[Jeremiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 25:6</span></span>

He instances one sin, idolatry, as representative of all their sins; as
nothing is dearer to God than a pure worship of Himself.

[Jeremiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 25:7</span></span>

Though ye provoke Me to anger ([Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md), yet it is not I, but
yourselves, whom ye thereby hurt ([Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md); [Pro
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 25:9</span></span>

the north--(see on [Jer 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014).md). The
Medes and other northern peoples, confederate with Babylon, are included
with the Chaldeans.

my servant--My agent for punishing ([Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md); [Jer
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010.md); compare [Jer
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002).md). Compare [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); Cyrus, "My shepherd." God makes
even unbelievers unconsciously to fulfil His designs. A reproof to the
Jews, who boasted that they were the servants of God; yet a heathen king
is to be more the servant of God than they, and that as the agent of
their punishment.

[Jeremiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 25:10</span></span>

([Jer 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md); [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023).md). The land shall be so desolated
that even in the houses left standing there shall be no inhabitant; a
terrible stillness shall prevail; no sound of the hand-mill (two
circular stones, one above the other, for grinding corn, worked by two
women, [Exo 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md); [Mat
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041.md); in daily use in every house,
and therefore forbidden to be taken in pledge, [Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006).md); no night-light, so universal in
the East that the poorest house has it, burning all night.

candle--lamp ([Job 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md); [Job
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 25:11</span></span>

seventy years-- ([Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007).md). The exact
number of years of Sabbaths in four hundred ninety years, the period
from Saul to the Babylonian captivity; righteous retribution for their
violation of the Sabbath ([Lev
26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md); [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md). The seventy years probably
begin from the fourth year of Jehoiakim, when Jerusalem was first
captured, and many captives, as well as the treasures of the temple,
were carried away; they end with the first year of Cyrus, who, on taking
Babylon, issued an edict for the restoration of the Jews ([Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md). Daniel's seventy prophetic weeks
are based on the seventy years of the captivity (compare [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md), [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 25:13</span></span>

all . . . written in this book, which Jeremiah . . . prophesied against
all . . . nations--It follows from this, that the prophecies against
foreign nations (forty-sixth through fifty-first chapters) must have
been already written. Hence the Septuagint inserts here those
prophecies. But if they had followed immediately ([Jer
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013).md), there would have been no
propriety in the observation in the verse. The very wording of the
reference shows that they existed in some other part of the book, and
not in the immediate context. It was in this very year, the fourth of
Jehoiakim ([Jer 36:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001).md), that Jeremiah
was directed to write in a regular book for the first time all that he
had prophesied against Judah and foreign "nations" from the beginning of
his ministry. Probably, at a subsequent time, when he completed the
whole work, including the forty-sixth through fifty-first chapters,
Jeremiah himself inserted the clause, "all that is written in this book,
which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations." The prophecies
in question may have been repeated, as others in Jeremiah, more than
once; so in the original smaller collection they may have stood in an
earlier position; and, in the fuller subsequent collection, in their
later and present position.

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

serve themselves-- ([Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md); [Jer
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md); [Jer
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#010).md). Avail themselves of their
services as slaves.

them also--the Chaldees, who heretofore have made other nations their
slaves, shall themselves also in their turn be slaves to them. MAURER
translates, "shall impose servitude on them, even them."

recompense them--namely, the Chaldees and other nations against whom
Jeremiah had prophesied ([Jer 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013).md),
as having oppressed the Jews.

their deeds--rather, "deed," namely, their bad treatment of the Jews
([Jer 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md); [Jer
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), [Jer
51:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024.md); compare [Ch2
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 25:15</span></span>

wine cup--Compare [Jer 13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md), as to
this image, to express stupefying judgments; also [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md); [Jer
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md). Jeremiah often embodies the
imagery of Isaiah in his prophecies ([Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md); [Isa
51:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); [Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md); [Rev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006).md). The wine cup was not literally
given by Jeremiah to the representatives of the different nations; but
only in symbolical vision.

[Jeremiah 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 25:16</span></span>

be moved--reel ([Nah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 25:18</span></span>

Jerusalem--put first: for "judgment begins at the house of God"; they
being most guilty whose religious privileges are greatest ([Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017).md).

kings--Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah.

as it is this day--The accomplishment of the curse had already begun
under Jehoiakim. This clause, however, may have been inserted by
Jeremiah at his final revision of his prophecies in Egypt.

[Jeremiah 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 25:19</span></span>

Pharaoh--put next after Jerusalem, because the Jews had relied most on
him, and Egypt and Judea stood on a common footing ([Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md), [Jer
46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 25:20</span></span>

mingled people--mercenary foreign troops serving under Pharaoh-hophra in
the time of Jeremiah. The employment of these foreigners provoked the
native Egyptians to overthrow him. Psammetichus, father of
Pharaoh-necho, also had given a settlement in Egypt to Ionian and Carian
adventurers \[HERODOTUS, 2.152, 154\]. See on [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md); [Isa
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md). The term is first found in [Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md).

Uz--in the geographical order here, between Egypt and the states along
the Mediterranean; therefore not the "Uz" of [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001) (north of Arabia-Deserta.md), but the
northern part of Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, between the sea and Idumea ([Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md); see [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md), [Gen
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#028).md).

remnant of Ashdod--called a "remnant," because Ashdod had lost most of
its inhabitants in the twenty-nine years siege by Psammetichus. Compare
also see on [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md). Gath is not
mentioned because it was overthrown in the same war.

[Jeremiah 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 25:21</span></span>

Edom . . . Moab . . . Ammon--joined together, as being related to Israel
(see Jer. 48:1-49:39).

[Jeremiah 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 25:22</span></span>

all the kings of Tyrus--the petty kings of the various dependencies of
Tyre.

isles--a term including all maritime regions ([Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 25:23</span></span>

Dedan--north of Arabia ([Gen 25:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003).md).

Tema . . . Buz--neighboring tribes north of Arabia ([Job
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002).md).

all . . . in . . . utmost corners--rather, "having the hair cut in
angles," a heathenish custom (see on [Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 25:24</span></span>

mingled people--not in the same sense as in [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md); the "motley crowd," so called
in contempt (compare [Jer 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md), [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md); [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037).md). By a different pointing it may
be translated the "Arabs"; but the repetition of the name is not likely.
BLANEY thinks there were two divisions of what we call Arabia, the west
(Araba) and the east. The west included Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a and the
parts on the sea bordering on Egypt, the land of Cush; the east,
Arabia-Felix and Deserta. The latter are "the mixed race" inhabiting the
desert.

[Jeremiah 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 25:25</span></span>

Zimri--perhaps the Zabra mentioned by PTOLEMY between Mecca and Medina.
Zimran also, as Dedan, was one of Abraham's sons by Keturah ([Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002).md).

Elam--properly, west of Persia; but used for Persia in general.

[Jeremiah 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 25:26</span></span>

Sheshach--Babylon; as the parallelism in [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md) proves. In the Cabalistic system
(called Athbash, the first Hebrew letter in the alphabet being expressed
by the last) Sheshach would exactly answer to Babel. Jeremiah may have
used this system (as perhaps in [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041).md) for concealment at the time of
this prediction, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, while Nebuchadnezzar
was before Jerusalem. In [Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md)
there can be no concealment, as Babylon is expressly mentioned.
MICHAELIS more simply explains the term "brazen-gated" (compare [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002).md); others, "the house of a
prince." Rather, it comes from the Babylonian goddess, Shach, by
reduplication of the first letter; from her Misael was named Meshach by
the Babylonians. The term Shace was applied to a festival at Babylon,
alluded to in [Jer 51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md), [Jer
51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md); [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md). It was during this feast that
Cyrus took Babylon \[HERODOTUS, 1\]. Thus Jeremiah mystically denotes
the time of its capture by this term \[GLASSIUS\].

[Jeremiah 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 25:27</span></span>

rise no more--The heathen nations in question should fall to rise no
more. The Jews should fall but for a time, and then rise again.
Therefore, the epithet is given, "the God of Israel."

[Jeremiah 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 25:28</span></span>

if they refuse to take the cup--No effort of theirs to escape
destruction will avail.

[Jeremiah 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 25:29</span></span>

If I spared not Mine elect people on account of sin, much less will I
spare you ([Eze 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md); [Oba
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md); [Luk
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017).md).

be unpunished--"be treated as innocent."

[Jeremiah 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 25:30</span></span>

roar--image from a destructive lion ([Isa
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md); [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md).

upon his habitation--rather, "His pasturage"; keeping up the image of a
lion roaring against the flock in the pasture. The roar was first to go
forth over Judea wherein were "the sheep of His pasture" ([Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003).md), and thence into heathen lands.

shout . . . tread . . . grapes-- ([Jer
48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md); [Isa
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009).md).

[Jeremiah 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 25:31</span></span>

controversy--cause at issue ([Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002).md).

plead with all flesh-- ([Isa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016).md).
God shows the whole world that He does what is altogether just in
punishing.

[Jeremiah 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 25:32</span></span>

from the coasts--rather, "from the uttermost regions." Like a storm
which arises in one region and then diffuses itself far and wide, so
God's judgments shall pass "from nation to nation," till all has been
fulfilled; no distance shall prevent the fulfilment.

not be lamented-- ([Jer 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md), [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006).md).

neither gathered--to their fathers, in their ancestral tombs ([Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002).md).

dung-- ([Psa 83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 25:34</span></span>

shepherds--princes ([Jer 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022).md). Here
he returns to the Jews and their rulers, using the same image as in [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md), "pasture" (see on [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030).md).

wallow yourselves--Cover yourselves as thickly with ashes, in token of
sorrow, as one who rolls in them ([Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md); [Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030).md) \[MAURER\].

principal--leaders. The Septuagint translates "rams," carrying out the
image (compare [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), Margin; [Zac
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003).md).

days of your slaughter . . . of . . . dispersions--rather, "your days
for slaughter (that is, the time of your being slain), and your
dispersions (not 'of your dispersions'), are accomplished (are come)."

pleasant vessel--Ye were once a precious vessel, but ye shall fall, and
so be a broken vessel (see on [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028).md). "Your past excellency shall
not render you safe now. I will turn to your ignominy whatever glory I
conferred on you" \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 25:35</span></span>

Literally, "Flight shall fail the shepherds . . . escaping (shall fail)
the principal," &c. ([Amo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014).md). The
leaders will be the first objects for slaughter; escape by flight will
be out of their power.

[Jeremiah 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 25:37</span></span>

habitations--rather, carrying out the image "pastures" (see on [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030).md). The pasturages where,
peaceably and without incursion of wild beasts, the flocks have fed,
shall be destroyed; that is, the regions where, heretofore, there was
peace and security (alluding to the name Salem, or Jerusalem,
"possessing peace").

[Jeremiah 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 25:38</span></span>

his covert--the temple, where heretofore, like a lion, as its defender,
by the mere terror of His voice He warded off the foe; but now He leaves
it a prey to the Gentiles \[CALVIN\].

fierceness of . . . oppressor--rather, as the Hebrew, for "oppressor" is
an adjective feminine, the word "sword" is understood, which, in [Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md), is expressed (indeed, some
manuscripts and the Septuagint read "sword" instead of "fierceness"
here; probably interpolated from [Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md), "the oppressing sword." The
Hebrew for "oppressing" means also a "dove": there may be, therefore, a
covert allusion to the Chaldean standard bearing a dove on it, in honor
of Semiramis, the first queen, said in popular superstition to have been
nourished by doves when exposed at birth, and at death to have been
transformed into a dove. Her name may come from a root referring to the
