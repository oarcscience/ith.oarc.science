### [Ezekiel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 7:2</span></span>

LAMENTATION OVER THE COMING RUIN OF ISRAEL; THE PENITENT REFORMATION OF
A REMNANT; THE CHAIN SYMBOLIZING THE CAPTIVITY. (Eze. 7:1-27)

An end, the end--The indefinite "an" expresses the general fact of God
bringing His long-suffering towards the whole of Judea to an end; "the,"
following, marks it as more definitely fixed ([Amo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 7:4</span></span>

thine abominations--the punishment of thine abominations.

shall be in the midst of thee--shall be manifest to all. They and thou
shall recognize the fact of thine abominations by thy punishment which
shall everywhere befall thee, and that manifestly.

[Ezekiel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 7:5</span></span>

An evil, an only evil--a peculiar calamity such as was never before;
unparalleled. The abruptness of the style and the repetitions express
the agitation of the prophet's mind in foreseeing these calamities.

[Ezekiel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 7:6</span></span>

watcheth for thee--rather, "waketh for thee." It awakes up from its past
slumber against thee ([Psa 78:65-66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065).md).

[Ezekiel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 7:7</span></span>

The morning--so Chaldean and Syriac versions (compare [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002).md). Ezekiel wishes to awaken them
from their lethargy, whereby they were promising to themselves an
uninterrupted night ([Th1 5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005).md), as
if they were never to be called to account \[CALVIN\]. The expression,
"morning," refers to the fact that this was the usual time for
magistrates giving sentence against offenders (compare [Eze
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md), below; [Psa
101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008.md); [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012).md). GESENIUS, less probably,
translates, "the order of fate"; thy turn to be punished.

not the sounding again--not an empty echo, such as is produced by the
reverberation of sounds in "the mountains," but a real cry of tumult is
coming \[CALVIN\]. Perhaps it alludes to the joyous cries of the
grape-gatherers at vintage on the hills \[GROTIUS\], or of the idolaters
in their dances on their festivals in honor of their false gods
\[TIRINUS\]. HAVERNICK translates, "no brightness."

[Ezekiel 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 7:8</span></span>

Repetition of [Eze 7:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003.md); sadly
expressive of accumulated woes by the monotonous sameness.

[Ezekiel 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 7:10</span></span>

rod . . . blossomed, pride . . . budded--The "rod" is the Chaldean
Nebuchadnezzar, the instrument of God's vengeance ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Jer
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020).md). The rod sprouting (as the word
ought to be translated), &c., implies that God does not move
precipitately, but in successive steps. He as it were has planted the
ministers of His vengeance, and leaves them to grow till all is ripe for
executing His purpose. "Pride" refers to the insolence of the Babylonian
conqueror ([Jer 50:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031).md). The
parallelism ("pride" answering to "rod") opposes JEROME'S view, that
"pride" refers to the Jews who despised God's threats; (also CALVIN'S,
"though the rod grew in Chaldea, the root was with the Jews"). The "rod"
cannot refer, as GROTIUS thought, to the tribe of Judah, for it
evidently refers to the "smiteth" ([Eze
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009).md) as the instrument of smiting.

[Ezekiel 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 7:11</span></span>

Violence (that is, the violent foe) is risen up as a rod of (that is, to
punish the Jews') wickedness ([Zac
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008).md).

theirs--their possessions, or all that belongs to them, whether children
or goods. GROTIUS translates from a different Hebrew root, "their
nobles," literally, "their tumultuous trains" (Margin) which usually
escorted the nobles. Thus "nobles" will form a contrast to the general
"multitude."

neither . . . wailing-- ([Jer 16:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md);
[Jer 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033).md). GESENIUS translates, "nor
shall there be left any beauty among them." English Version is supported
by the old Jewish interpreters. So general shall be the slaughter, none
shall be left to mourn the dead.

[Ezekiel 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 7:12</span></span>

let not . . . buyer rejoice--because he has bought an estate at a
bargain price.

nor . . . seller mourn--because he has had to sell his land at a
sacrifice through poverty. The Chaldeans will be masters of the land, so
that neither shall the buyer have any good of his purchase, nor the
seller any loss; nor shall the latter ([Eze
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013).md) return to his inheritance at the
jubilee year (see [Lev 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013).md).
Spiritually this holds good now, seeing that "the time is short"; "they
that rejoice should be as though they rejoiced not, and they that buy as
though they possessed not": Paul ([Co1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030).md) seems to allude to Ezekiel here.
[Jer 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015.md), [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md), [Jer
32:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043.md), seems to contradict Ezekiel
here. But Ezekiel is speaking of the parents, and of the present;
Jeremiah, of the children, and of the future. Jeremiah is addressing
believers, that they should hope for a restoration; Ezekiel, the
reprobate, who were excluded from hope of deliverance.

[Ezekiel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 7:13</span></span>

although they were yet alive--although they should live to the year of
jubilee.

multitude thereof--namely, of the Jews.

which shall not return--answering to "the seller shall not return"; not
only he, but the whole multitude, shall not return. CALVIN omits "is"
and "which": "the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return"
void ([Isa 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).md).

neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life--No
hardening of one's self in iniquity will avail against God's threat of
punishment. FAIRBAIRN translates, "no one by his iniquity shall
invigorate his life"; referring to the jubilee, which was regarded as a
revivification of the whole commonwealth, when, its disorders being
rectified, the body politic sprang up again into renewed life. That for
which God thus provided by the institution of the jubilee and which is
now to cease through the nation's iniquity, let none think to bring
about by his iniquity.

[Ezekiel 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 7:14</span></span>

They have blown the trumpet--rather, "Blow the trumpet," or, "Let them
blow the trumpet" to collect soldiers as they will, "to make all ready"
for encountering the foe, it will be of no avail; none will have the
courage to go to the battle (compare [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001).md), \[CALVIN\].

[Ezekiel 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 7:15</span></span>

No security should anywhere be found ([Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025).md). Fulfilled ([Lam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020).md); also at the Roman invasion
([Mat 24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 7:16</span></span>

([Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006).md).

like doves--which, though usually frequenting the valleys, mount up to
the mountains when fearing the bird-catcher ([Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001).md). So Israel, once dwelling in its
peaceful valleys, shall flee from the foe to the mountains, which, as
being the scene of its idolatries, were justly to be made the scene of
its flight and shame. The plaintive note of the dove ([Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md) represents the mournful
repentance of Israel hereafter ([Zac
12:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 7:17</span></span>

shall be weak as water--literally, "shall go (as) waters"; incapable of
resistance ([Jos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md); [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md); [Isa
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 7:18</span></span>

cover them--as a garment.

baldness--a sign of mourning ([Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md); [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037.md); [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 7:19</span></span>

cast . . . silver in . . . streets--just retribution; they had abused
their silver and gold by converting them into idols, "the
stumbling-block of their iniquity" ([Eze
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md), that is, an occasion of
sinning); so these silver and gold idols, so far from "being able to
deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath" (see [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004).md), shall, in despair, be cast by
them into the streets as a prey to the foe, by whom they shall be
"removed" (GROTIUS translates as the Margin, "shall be despised as an
unclean thing"); or rather, as suits the parallelism, "shall be put away
from them" by the Jews \[CALVIN\]. "They (the silver and gold) shall not
satisfy their souls," that is, their cravings of appetite and other
needs.

[Ezekiel 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 7:20</span></span>

beauty of his ornament--the temple of Jehovah, the especial glory of the
Jews, as a bride glories in her ornaments (the very imagery used by God
as to the temple, [Eze 16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010).md).
Compare [Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021.md) : "My sanctuary,
the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes."

images . . . therein--namely, in the temple ([Eze
8:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003).md).

set it far from them--God had "set" the temple (their "beauty of
ornament") "for His majesty"; but they had set up "abominations
therein"; therefore God, in just retribution, "set it far from them,"
(that is, removed them far from it, or took it away from them
\[VATABLUS\]). The Margin translates, "Made it unto them an unclean
thing" (compare Margin on [Eze 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md),
"removed"); what I designed for their glory they turned to their shame,
therefore I will make it turn to their ignominy and ruin.

[Ezekiel 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 7:21</span></span>

strangers--barbarous and savage nations.

[Ezekiel 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 7:22</span></span>

pollute my secret place--just retribution for the Jews' pollution of the
temple. "Robbers shall enter and defile" the holy of holies, the place
of God's manifested presence, entrance into which was denied even to the
Levites and priests and was permitted to the high priest only once a
year on the great day of atonement.

[Ezekiel 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 7:23</span></span>

chain--symbol of the captivity (compare [Jer
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002).md). As they enchained the land with
violence, so shall they be chained themselves. It was customary to lead
away captives in a row with a chain passed from the neck of one to the
other. Therefore translate as the Hebrew requires, "the chain," namely,
that usually employed on such occasions. CALVIN explains it, that the
Jews should be dragged, whether they would or no, before God's tribunal
to be tried as culprits in chains. The next words favor this: "bloody
crimes," rather, "judgment of bloods," that is, with blood sheddings
deserving the extreme judicial penalty. Compare [Jer
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md) : "Her judgment reacheth unto
heaven."

[Ezekiel 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 7:24</span></span>

worst of the heathen--literally, "wicked of the nations"; the giving up
of Israel to their power will convince the Jews that this is a final
overthrow.

pomp of . . . strong--the pride wherewith men "stiff of forehead"
despise the prophet.

holy places--the sacred compartments of the temple ([Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md); [Jer
51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051).md) \[CALVIN\]. God calls it "their
holy places," because they had so defiled it that He regarded it no
longer as His. However, as the defilement of the temple has already been
mentioned ([Eze 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020.md), [Eze
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022).md), and "their sacred places" are
introduced as a new subject, it seems better to understand this of the
places dedicated to their idols. As they defiled God's sanctuary, He
will defile their self-constituted "sacred places."

[Ezekiel 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 7:25</span></span>

peace, and . . . none-- ([Th1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 7:26</span></span>

Mischief . . . upon . . . mischief-- ([Deu
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023.md); [Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020).md). This is said because the Jews
were apt to fancy, at every abatement of suffering, that their
calamities were about to cease; but God will accumulate woe on woe.

rumour--of the advance of the foe, and of his cruelty ([Mat
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006).md).

seek a vision--to find some way of escape from their difficulties ([Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md). So Zedekiah consulted Jeremiah
([Jer 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md); [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014).md).

law shall perish--fulfilled ([Eze
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001.md), [Eze
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003.md); [Psa
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md); [Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md); compare [Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011).md); God will thus set aside the
idle boast, "The law shall not perish from the priest" ([Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018).md).

ancients--the ecclesiastical rulers of the people.

[Ezekiel 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 7:27</span></span>

people of the land--the general multitude, as distinguished from the
"king" and the "prince." The consternation shall pervade all ranks. The
king, whose duty it was to animate others and find a remedy for existing
evils, shall himself be in the utmost anxiety; a mark of the desperate
state of affairs.

clothed with desolation--Clothing is designed to keep off shame; but in
this case shame shall be the clothing.

after their way--because of their wicked ways.

deserts--literally, "judgments," that is, what just judgment awards to
them; used to imply the exact correspondence of God's judgment with the
judicial penalties they had incurred: they oppressed the poor and
deprived them of liberty; therefore they shall be oppressed and lose
their own liberty.

This eighth chapter begins a new stage of Ezekiel's prophecies and
continues to the end of the eleventh chapter. The connected visions at
Eze. 3:12-7:27 comprehended Judah and Israel; but the visions (Eze.
8:1-11:25) refer immediately to Jerusalem and the remnant of Judah under
Zedekiah, as distinguished from the Babylonian exiles.
