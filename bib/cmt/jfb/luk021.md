### [Luke Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)

[Luke 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 21:1</span></span>

THE WIDOW'S TWO MITES. ([Luk 21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001))

looked up--He had "sat down over against the treasury" ([Mar
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041)), probably to rest, for He had
continued long standing as he taught in the temple court ([Mar
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027)), and "looking up He saw"--as in
Zaccheus' case, not quite casually.

the rich, &c.--"the people," says [Mar
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041) "cast money into the treasury,
and many rich east in much"; that is, into chests deposited in one of
the courts of the temple to receive the offerings of the people towards
its maintenance ([Kg2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009); [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)).

[Luke 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 21:2</span></span>

two mites--"which make a farthing" ([Mar
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042)), the smallest Jewish coin. "She
might have kept one" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 21:3</span></span>

And he said--"to His disciples," whom He "called to Him" ([Mar
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043)), to teach from it a great
future lesson.

more than . . . all--in proportion to her means, which is God's standard
([Co2 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012)).

[Luke 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 21:4</span></span>

of their abundance--their superfluity; what they had to spare," or
beyond what they needed.

of her penury--or "want" ([Mar 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044))
--her deficiency, of what was less than her own wants required, "all the
living she had." Mark ([Mar 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044))
still more emphatically, "all that she had--her whole subsistence."
Note: (1) As temple offerings are needed still for the service of Christ
at home and abroad, so "looking down" now, as then "up," Me "sees" who
"cast in," and how much. (2) Christ's standard of commendable offering
is not our superfluity, but our deficiency--not what will never be
missed, but what costs us some real sacrifice, and just in proportion to
the relative amount of that sacrifice. (See [Co2
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001).)

[Luke 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 21:5</span></span>

CHRIST'S PROPHECY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM AND WARNINGS TO
PREPARE FOR HIS SECOND COMING, SUGGESTED BY IT--HIS DAYS AND NIGHTS
DURING HIS LAST WEEK. (Luke 21:5-38)

(See on [Mat 24:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001).)

[Luke 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 21:8</span></span>

the time--of the Kingdom, in its full glory.

go . . . not . . . after them--"I come not so very soon" ([Th2
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)) \[STIER\].

[Luke 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 21:9</span></span>

not terrified--(See [Luk 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019); [Isa
8:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011)).

end not by and by--or immediately, not yet ([Mat
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006); [Mar
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007)): that is, "Worse must come
before all is over."

[Luke 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 21:10</span></span>

Nation, &c.--Matthew and Mark ([Mat
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008); [Mar
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008)) add, "All these are the
beginning of sorrows," or travail pangs, to which heavy calamities are
compared ([Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031), &c.).

[Luke 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 21:12</span></span>

brought before, &c.--The book of Acts verifies all this.

[Luke 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 21:13</span></span>

for a testimony--an opportunity of bearing testimony.

[Luke 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 21:18</span></span>

not a hair . . . perish--He had just said ([Luk
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#016)) they should be put to death;
showing that this precious promise is far above immunity from mere
bodily harm, and furnishing a key to the right interpretation of the
ninety-first Psalm, and such like. Matthew adds the following ([Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012)): "And because iniquity shall
abound, the love of many," the many or, the most--the generality of
professed disciples--"shall wax cold." But he that endureth to the end
shall be saved. Sad illustrations of the effect of abounding iniquity in
cooling the love of faithful disciples we have in the Epistle of James,
written about this period referred to, and too frequently ever since
([Heb 10:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)). "And this gospel of the kingdom
shall be preached in all the world for a witness, and then shall the end
come" ([Mat 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014)). God never sends
judgment without previous warning; and there can be no doubt that the
Jews, already dispersed over most known countries, had nearly all heard
the Gospel "as a witness," before the end of the Jewish state. The same
principle was repeated and will repeat itself to the end.

[Luke 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 21:20</span></span>

by armies--encamped armies, that is, besieged: "the abomination of
desolation" (meaning the Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous,
pagan, unclean power) "spoken of by Daniel the prophet" ([Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)) "standing where it ought not"
([Mar 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014)). "Whoso readeth \[that
prophecy\] let him understand" ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)).

Then . . . flee, &c.--EUSEBIUS says the Christians fled to Pella, at the
north extremity of Perea, being "prophetically directed"; perhaps by
some prophetic intimation still more explicit than this, which still
would be their chart.

[Luke 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 21:23</span></span>

woe unto--"alas for."

with child, &c.--from the greater suffering it would involve; as also
"flight in winter, and on the sabbath," which they were to "pray"
against ([Mat 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#020)), the one as more
trying to the body, the other to the soul. "For then shall be
tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever
shall be"--language not unusual in the Old Testament for tremendous
calamities, though of this it may perhaps be literally said, "And except
those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved, but for
the elect's sake those days shall be shortened" ([Mat
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)). But for this merciful
"shortening," brought about by a remarkable concurrence of causes, the
whole nation would have perished, in which there yet remained a remnant
to be afterwards gathered out. Here in Matthew and Mark ([Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Mar
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022)) are some particulars about
"false Christs," who should, "if possible"--a precious clause--"deceive
the very elect." (Compare [Th2 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009);
[Rev 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013).)

[Luke 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 21:24</span></span>

Jerusalem . . . trodden down . . . until, &c.--Implying (1) that one day
Jerusalem shall cease to be "trodden down by the Gentiles" ([Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002)), as then by pagan so now by
Mohammedan unbelievers; (2) that this shall be at the "completion" of
"the times of the Gentiles," which from [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025) (taken from this) we conclude to
mean till the Gentiles have had their full time of that place in the
Church which the Jews in their time had before them--after which, the
Jews being again "grafted into their own olive tree," one Church of Jew
and Gentile together shall fill the earth (Rom. 11:1-36). What a vista
this opens up!

[Luke 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 21:25</span></span>

signs, &c.--Though the grandeur of this language carries the mind over
the head of all periods but that of Christ's second coming, nearly every
expression will be found used of the Lord's coming in terrible national
judgments, as of Babylon, &c.; and from [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028), [Luk
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#032), it seems undeniable that its
immediate reference was to the destruction of Jerusalem, though its
ultimate reference beyond doubt is to Christ's final coming.

[Luke 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 21:28</span></span>

redemption--from the oppression of ecclesiastical despotism and legal
bondage by the total subversion of the Jewish state and the firm
establishment of the evangelical kingdom ([Luk
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#031)). But the words are of far wider
and more precious import. Matthew ([Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)) says, "And then shall appear
the sign of the Son of man in heaven," evidently something distinct from
Himself, mentioned immediately after. What this was intended to mean,
interpreters are not agreed. But as before Christ came to destroy
Jerusalem, some appalling portents were seen in the air, so before His
personal appearing it is likely that something analogous will be
witnessed, though of what nature it is vain to conjecture.

[Luke 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 21:32</span></span>

This generation--not "this nation," as some interpret it, which, though
admissible in itself, seems very unnatural here. It is rather as in [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027).

[Luke 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 21:34</span></span>

surfeiting, and drunkenness--All animal excesses, quenching
spirituality.

cares of this life--(See on [Mar 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#007);
[Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019)).

[Luke 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 21:36</span></span>

Watch . . . pray, &c.--the two great duties which in prospect of trial
are constantly enjoined. These warnings, suggested by the need of
preparedness for the tremendous calamities approaching, and the total
wreck of the existing state of things, are the general improvement of
the whole discourse, carrying the mind forward to Judgment and Vengeance
of another kind and on a grander and more awful scale--not
ecclesiastical or political but personal, not temporal but eternal--when
all safety and blessedness will be found to lie in being able to "STAND
BEFORE THE SON OF MAN" in the glory of His personal appearing.

[Luke 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 21:37</span></span>

abode in the mount--that is, at Bethany ([Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017)).
