### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 12:1</span></span>

THE COMPANIES THAT CAME TO DAVID AT ZIKLAG. (1Ch. 12:1-22)

Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag--There are three lists
given in this chapter, arranged, apparently, according to the order of
time when the parties joined the standard of David.

while he yet kept himself close because of Saul--that is, when the
king's jealousy had driven him into exile from the court and the
country.

Ziklag--(See on [Sa1 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006).md). It was
during his retirement in that Philistine town that he was joined in
rapid succession by the heroes who afterwards contributed so much to the
glory of his reign.

[1 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 12:2</span></span>

of Saul's brethren of Benjamin--that is, of the tribe of Benjamin
(compare [Ch1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029).md), but some of them
might be relatives of the king. This movement to which the parties were
led, doubtless by the secret impulse of the Spirit, was of vast
importance to the cause of David, as it must have been founded on their
observation of the evident withdrawal of God's blessing from Saul, and
His favoring presence with David, to whom it was universally known the
Divine King of Israel had given the crown in reversion. The accession of
the Benjamites who came first and their resolution to share his fortunes
must have been particularly grateful to David. It was a public and
emphatic testimony by those who had enjoyed the best means of
information to the unblemished excellence of his character, as well as a
decided protest against the grievous wrong inflicted by causelessly
outlawing a man who had rendered such eminent services to his country.

[1 Chronicles 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 12:4</span></span>

Ismaiah the Gibeonite--It appears that not only the Canaanites who were
admitted into the congregation (Jos. 9:1-27), but people of the tribe of
Benjamin, were among the inhabitants of Gibeon. The mention of "the
Gederathite," probably from Gederah ([Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036).md), in the lowlands of Judah; of
the Korhites ([Ch1 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#006).md), from Korah
([Ch1 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#043).md), and of Gedor ([Ch1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#007).md), a town in Judah, to the
southwest of Beth-lehem (compare [Ch1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#004).md), shows that this first list
contains men of Judah as well as Benjamin \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 12:8</span></span>

of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David--that is, from the
service of Saul and from the rest of the Gadites who remained steadfast
adherents of his cause.

into the hold--or fortress, that is, of Ziklag, which was in the
wilderness of Judah.

whose faces were like the faces of lions, &c.--A fierce, lion-like
countenance ([Sa2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023).md), and great
agility in pursuit ([Sa2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018).md), were
qualities of the highest estimation in ancient warfare.

[1 Chronicles 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 12:14</span></span>

one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
thousand--David, while at Ziklag, had not so large an amount of forces
as to give to each of these the command of so many men. Another meaning,
therefore, must obviously be sought, and excluding was, which is a
supplement by our translators, the import of the passage is, that one of
the least could discomfit a hundred, and the greatest was worth a
thousand ordinary men; a strong hyperbole to express their uncommon
valor.

[1 Chronicles 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 12:15</span></span>

These are they that went over Jordan in the first month--that is, in
spring, when the swollen river generally fills up the banks of its
channel (see on [Jos 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014.md); [Jos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md); [Jos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010).md).

they put to flight all them of the valleys--This was probably done at
the time of their separating themselves and their purpose being
discovered, they had to cut their passage through the opposing adherents
of Saul, both on the eastern and western banks. The impossibility of
taking the fords at such a time, and the violent rapidity of the
current, make this crossing of the Jordan--in whatever way these Gadites
accomplished it--a remarkable feat.

[1 Chronicles 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 12:16</span></span>

the children of Benjamin and Judah--It is probable that the Benjamites
invited the Judahites to accompany them, in order to prevent David being
suspicious of them. Their anticipations, as the result showed, were well
founded. He did suspect them, but the doubts of David as to their object
in repairing to him, were promptly dispelled by Amasai or Amasa, who, by
the secret impulse of the Spirit, assured him of their strong attachment
and their zealous service from a unanimous conviction that his cause was
owned and blessed of God ([Sa1
18:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#012).md).

[1 Chronicles 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 12:19</span></span>

there fell some of Manasseh--The period of their accession is fixed as
the time when David came with the Philistines against Saul to battle.

but they helped them not--(See on [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004).md).

[1 Chronicles 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 12:20</span></span>

As he went to Ziklag--If those Manassites joined him on his return to
Ziklag, after his dismissal from the Philistine army, then their arrival
took place before the battle of Gilboa could have been fought (compare
[Sa1 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#011).md). Convinced of the
desperate state of Saul's affairs, they abandoned him, and resolved to
transfer their allegiance to David. But some learned men think that they
came as fugitives from that disastrous field \[CALMET and EWALD\].

captains of the thousands . . . of Manasseh--Those seven were commanders
of the large military divisions of their tribe.

[1 Chronicles 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 12:21</span></span>

they helped David against the band--that is, the Amalekites who had
pillaged Ziklag in David's absence. This military expedition was made by
all his men ([Sa1 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#009).md), who, as
David's early helpers, are specially distinguished from those who are
mentioned in the latter portion of the chapter.

[1 Chronicles 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 12:22</span></span>

the host of God--that is, a great and powerful army.

[1 Chronicles 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 12:23</span></span>

THE ARMIES THAT CAME TO HIM AT HEBRON. (1Ch. 12:23-40)

these are the numbers of the bands . . . that came to David to
Hebron--after the death of Ish-bosheth (see on [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001).md).

to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lord--
([Ch1 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#014.md); [Ch1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#003.md), [Ch1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010).md). The account commences with the
southern tribes, Levi being associated with Judah and Simeon, as the
great majority of the leading men in this tribe resided in Judah; and,
after recounting the representatives of the northern tribes, it
concludes with those on the east of Jordan.

[1 Chronicles 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 12:27</span></span>

Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites--not the high priest, for that was
Abiathar ([Sa1 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009).md), but the leader
of the Aaronite warriors, supposed to be the father of Benaiah ([Ch1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022).md).

[1 Chronicles 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 12:29</span></span>

Benjamin . . . three thousand--This small number shows the unpopularity
of the movement in this tribe; and, indeed, it is expressly stated that
the mass of the population had, even after Ish-bosheth's death,
anxiously endeavored to secure the crown in the family of Saul.

[1 Chronicles 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 12:32</span></span>

children of Issachar, . . . that had understanding of the times,
&c.--Jewish writers say that the people of this tribe were eminent for
their acquirements in astronomical and physical science; and the object
of the remark was probably to show that the intelligent and learned
classes were united with the military, and had declared for David.

[1 Chronicles 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 12:33</span></span>

Zebulun . . . could keep rank--that is, were more disciplined soldiers
than the rest.

not of double heart--Though their numbers were large, all were in a high
degree well affected to David.

[1 Chronicles 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 12:38</span></span>

all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king--that
is, entertained a unanimous desire for his elevation.

[1 Chronicles 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 12:39</span></span>

there they were with David three days, eating and drinking--According to
the statements made in the preceding verses, the number of armed
warriors assembled in Hebron on this occasion amounted to three hundred
thousand. Supplies of provisions were abundantly furnished, not only by
the people of the neighborhood, but from distant parts of the country,
for all wished the festivities to be on a scale of liberality and
magnificence suitable to the auspicious occasion.
