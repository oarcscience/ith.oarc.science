### [Isaiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 26:1</span></span>

CONNECTED WITH THE TWENTY-FOURTH AND TWENTY-FIFTH CHAPTERS. SONG OF
PRAISE OF ISRAEL AFTER BEING RESTORED TO THEIR OWN LAND. (Isa. 26:1-21)

strong city--Jerusalem, strong in Jehovah's protection: type of the new
Jerusalem ([Psa 48:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001).md), contrasted
with the overthrow of the ungodly foe ([Isa
26:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md), [Isa
26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md); [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), [Rev
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010), &c..md).

salvation . . . walls-- ([Isa 60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018.md);
[Jer 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023.md); [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md). MAURER translates, "Jehovah
makes His help serve as walls" ([Isa
33:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020), &c..md).

bulwarks--the trench with the antemural earthworks exterior to the wall.

[Isaiah 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 26:2</span></span>

Address of the returning people to the gates of Jerusalem (type of the
heavenly city, [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md); ([Psa
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md), [Psa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md); [Psa
118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019).md). Antitypically ([Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md); [Rev
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025.md), [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md).

righteous nation--that had not apostatized during the captivity. HORSLEY
translates, "The nation of the Just One," namely, the Jews.

[Isaiah 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 26:3</span></span>

mind . . . stayed-- ([Psa 112:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#007).md).
Jesus can create "perfect peace" within thy mind, though storms of trial
rage without ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md); [Mar
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039).md); as a city kept securely by a
strong garrison within, though besieged without (so [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007).md). "Keep," literally, "guard as
with a garrison." HORSLEY translates, (God's) workmanship (the Hebrew
does not probably mean "mind," but "a thing formed," [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010).md), so constantly "supported"; or
else "formed and supported (by Thee) Thou shalt preserve (it, namely,
the righteous nation) in perpetual peace."

[Isaiah 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 26:4</span></span>

Lord JEHOVAH--Hebrew, Jah, Jehovah. The union of the two names expresses
in the highest degree God's unchanging love and power (compare [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).md). This passage, and [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md); [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md); [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md), are the four in which the
English Version retains the JEHOVAH of the original. MAURER translates,
"For JAH (the eternal unchangeable One, [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).md) is JEHOVAH, the rock of ages"
(compare [Isa 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017.md); [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); [Sa1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 26:5</span></span>

lofty city--Babylon; representative of the stronghold of the foes of
God's people in all ages ([Isa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md),
[Isa 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md); [Isa
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 26:6</span></span>

poor-- ([Isa 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004).md), the once afflicted
Jewish captives. "Foot shall tread," is figurative for exulting in the
fall of God's enemies ([Rev 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 26:7</span></span>

uprightness--rather, "is direct," that is, is directed by God to a
prosperous issue, however many be their afflictions in the meantime (as
in the case of the Jewish exiles); the context requires this sense ([Psa
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md); [Pro
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md); [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005).md), \[MAURER\]: thus "way" means
God's dealings with the righteous ([Psa
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023).md).

most upright-- ([Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md).

dost weigh-- ([Sa1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003.md); [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021).md). Rather, "thou dost make plain
and level" \[MAURER\], removing all obstacles ([Isa
40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 26:8</span></span>

way of thy judgments--We have waited for Thy proceeding to punish the
enemy ([Isa 26:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md) \[MAURER\].
HORSLEY translates [Isa 26:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md), "The
path of the Just One is perfectly even; an even road Thou wilt level for
the Just One, even the path of Thy laws, O Jehovah. We have expected
Thee."

name . . . remembrance--the manifested character of God by which He
would be remembered ([Isa 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md); [Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 26:9</span></span>

With, . . . soul . . . I--literally, "I . . . my soul," in apposition;
the faithful Jews here speak individually. The overthrow of the foe and
the restoration of the Jews are to follow upon prayer on the part of the
latter and of all God's people ([Isa
62:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md), [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md); [Psa
102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013).md).

in the night-- ([Psa 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006.md); [Sol
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001).md).

world . . . learn . . . righteousness--the remnant left after judgments
([Psa 58:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 26:10</span></span>

uprightness--rather, as in [Isa 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md),
"prosperity," answering to "favor" in the parallelism, and in antithesis
to "judgments in the earth" ([Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md); where prosperity attends the
wicked as well as the just, "he will not learn righteousness," therefore
judgments must be sent that he may "learn" it \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 26:11</span></span>

lifted up--to punish the foes of God's people. They who will not see
shall be made to "see" to their cost ([Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012).md).

their envy at the people--that is, "Thy people." LOWTH translates, "They
shall see with confusion Thy zeal for Thy people."

fire of . . . enemies--that is, the fire to which Thine enemies are
doomed ([Isa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 26:12</span></span>

peace--God's favor, including all blessings, temporal and spiritual,
opposed to their previous trials ([Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 26:13</span></span>

other lords--temporal; heathen kings ([Ch2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008.md); [Ch2
28:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md), Nebuchadnezzar, &c. Spiritual
also, idols and lusts ([Rom 6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016).md).

by thee only--It is due to Thee alone, that we again worship Thee as our
Lord \[MAURER\]. "(We are) Thine only, we will celebrate Thy name"
\[HORSLEY\]. The sanctifying effect of affliction ([Psa
71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md); [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md), [Psa
119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071).md).

[Isaiah 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 26:14</span></span>

They--The "other lords" or tyrants ([Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013).md).

shall not live--namely, again.

deceased--Hebrew, "Rephaim"; powerless, in the land of shades ([Isa
14:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md).

therefore--that is, inasmuch as. Compare "therefore" ([Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); [Gen
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 26:15</span></span>

hast--prophetical preterite ([Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md).

hast removed . . . far . . . ends of . . . earth--rather, "Thou hast
extended far all the borders of the land" \[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 26:16</span></span>

visited--sought.

poured out-- ([Psa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008).md), as a vessel
emptying out all its contents.

prayer--literally, "a whispered prayer," Margin, "a secret sighing" to
God for help (compare [Jer 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md); [Deu
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 26:17</span></span>

An image of anguish accompanied with expectation, to be followed by joy
that will cause the anguish utterly to be forgotten. Zion, looking for
deliverance, seemingly in vain, but really about to be gloriously saved
([Mic 4:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md); [Mic
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md); [Joh
16:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 26:18</span></span>

brought forth wind--MICHAELIS explains this of the disease
empneumatosis. Rather, "wind" is a figure for that which proves an
abortive effort. The "we" is in antithesis to "Thy," "my" ([Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019).md), what we vainly attempt, God
will accomplish.

not wrought . . . deliverance in . . . earth--literally, "the land
(Judea) is not made security," that is, is not become a place of
security from our enemies.

neither . . . world fallen--The "world" at large, is in antithesis to
"the earth," that is, Judea. The world at enmity with the city of God
has not been subdued. But MAURER explains "fallen," according to Arabic
idiom, of the birth of a child, which is said to fall when being born;
"inhabitants of the world (Israel, [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004); not the world in general.md) are
not yet born"; that is, the country as yet lies desolate, and is not yet
populated.

[Isaiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 26:19</span></span>

In antithesis to [Isa 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md), "They
(Israel's foes) shall not live"; "Thy (Jehovah's) dead men (the Jews)
shall live," that is, primarily, be restored, spiritually ([Isa
54:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md), civilly and nationally ([Isa
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015).md); whereas Thy foes shall not;
ultimately, and in the fullest scope of the prophecy, restored to life
literally ([Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md); [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md).

together with my dead body--rather, "my dead body," or "bodies" (the
Jewish nation personified, which had been spiritually and civilly dead;
or the nation, as a parent, speaking of the bodies of her children
individually, see on [Isa 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md), "I,"
"My"): Jehovah's "dead" and "my dead" are one and the same \[HORSLEY\].
However, as Jesus is the antitype to Israel ([Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015).md), English Version gives a true
sense, and one ultimately contemplated in the prophecy: Christ's dead
body being raised again is the source of Jehovah's people (all, and
especially believers, the spiritual Israelites) also being raised ([Co1
15:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020).md).

Awake-- ([Eph 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014).md), spiritually.

in dust--prostate and dead, spiritually and nationally; also literally
([Isa 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md); [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001).md).

dew--which falls copiously in the East and supplies somewhat the lack of
rain ([Hos 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005).md).

cast out . . . dead--that is, shall bring them forth to life again.

[Isaiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 26:20</span></span>

enter . . . chambers--When God is about to take vengeance on the
ungodly, the saints shall be shut in by Him in a place of safety, as
Noah and his family were in the days of the flood ([Gen
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016).md), and as Israel was commanded not
to go out of doors on the night of the slaying of the Egyptian
first-born ([Exo 12:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md); [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md); [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003).md). The saints are calmly and
confidently to await the issue ([Exo
14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 26:21</span></span>

([Mic 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md).

disclose . . . blood-- ([Gen 4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md);
[Job 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018.md); [Eze
24:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007).md). All the innocent blood shed,
and all other wrongs done, so long seemingly with impunity, shall then
be avenged ([Rev 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006).md).

At the time when Israel shall be delivered, and the ungodly nations
punished, God shall punish also the great enemy of the Church.
