### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

([Hos 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md) shows this prophecy was
uttered after the league made with Egypt ([Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004)).md)

Israel . . . called my son out of Egypt--BENGEL translates, "From the
time that he (Israel) was in Egypt, I called him My son," which the
parallelism proves. So [Hos 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md) and
[Hos 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md) use "from . . . Egypt," for
"from the time that thou didst sojourn in Egypt." [Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md) also shows that Israel was called
by God, "My son," from the time of his Egyptian sojourn ([Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md). God is always said to have led
or brought forth, not to have "called," Israel from Egypt. [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md), therefore, in quoting this
prophecy (typically and primarily referring to Israel, antitypically and
fully to Messiah), applies it to Jesus' sojourn in Egypt, not His return
from it. Even from His infancy, partly spent in Egypt, God called Him
His son. God included Messiah, and Israel for Messiah's sake, in one
common love, and therefore in one common prophecy. Messiah's people and
Himself are one, as the Head and the body. [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md) calls Him "Israel." The same
general reason, danger of extinction, caused the infant Jesus, and
Israel in its national infancy (compare Gen. 42:1-43:34; [Gen
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#018.md); [Gen
46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003.md); [Eze
16:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md) to sojourn in Egypt. So He, and
His spiritual Israel, are already called "God's sons" while yet in the
Egypt of the world.

[Hosea 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 11:2</span></span>

As they called them--"they," namely, monitors sent by Me. "Called," in
[Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md), suggests the idea of the
many subsequent calls by the prophets.

went from them--turned away in contempt ([Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027).md).

Baalim--images of Baal, set up in various places.

[Hosea 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 11:3</span></span>

taught . . . to go--literally "to use his feet." Compare a similar
image, [Deu 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md); [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md), [Deu
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md), [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md); [Deu
32:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md); [Neh
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md); [Amo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010.md). God bore them as a parent does
an infant, unable to supply itself, so that it has no anxiety about
food, raiment, and its going forth. [Act
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#018.md), which probably refers to this
passage of Hosea; He took them by the arms, to guide them that they
might not stray, and to hold them up that they might not stumble.

knew not that I healed them--that is, that My design was to restore them
spiritually and temporally ([Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026).md).

[Hosea 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 11:4</span></span>

cords of a man--parallel to "bands of love"; not such cords as oxen are
led by, but humane methods, such as men employ when inducing others, as
for instance, a father drawing his child, by leading-strings, teaching
him to go ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md).

I was . . . as they that take off the yoke on their jaws . . . I laid
meat--as the humane husbandman occasionally loosens the straps under the
jaws by which the yoke is bound on the neck of oxen and lays food before
them to eat. An appropriate image of God's deliverance of Israel from
the Egyptian yoke, and of His feeding them in the wilderness.

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

He shall not return into . . . Egypt--namely, to seek help against
Assyria (compare [Hos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011).md), as Israel
lately had done ([Kg2 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md), after
having revolted from Assyria, to whom they had been tributary from the
times of Menahem ([Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md). In a
figurative sense, "he shall return to Egypt" ([Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003).md), that is, to Egypt-like bondage;
also many Jewish fugitives were literally to return to Egypt, when the
Holy Land was to be in Assyrian and Chaldean hands.

Assyrian shall be his king--instead of having kings of their own, and
Egypt as their auxiliary.

because they refused to return--just retribution. They would not return
(spiritually) to God, therefore they shall not return (corporally) to
Egypt, the object of their desire.

[Hosea 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 11:6</span></span>

abide--or, "fall upon" \[CALVIN\].

branches--villages, which are the branches or dependencies of the cities
\[CALVIN\]. GROTIUS translates, "his bars" (so [Lam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009).md), that is, the warriors who were
the bulwarks of the state. Compare [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018), "rulers" (Margin.md), "shields"
([Psa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009).md).

because of their own counsels--in worshipping idols, and relying on
Egypt (compare [Hos 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006).md).

[Hosea 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 11:7</span></span>

bent to backsliding--Not only do they backslide, and that too from ME,
their "chief good," but they are bent upon it. Though they (the
prophets) called them (the Israelites) to the Most High (from their
idols), "none would exalt (that is, extol or honor) Him." To exalt God,
they must cease to be "bent on backsliding," and must lift themselves
upwards.

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

as Admah . . . Zeboim--among the cities, including Sodom and Gomorrah,
irretrievably overthrown ([Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023).md).

heart is turned within me--with the deepest compassion, so as not to
execute My threat ([Lam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md); compare
[Gen 43:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030.md); [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026).md). So the phrase is used of a new
turn given to the feeling ([Psa
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025).md).

repentings--God speaks according to human modes of thought ([Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md). God's seeming change is in
accordance with His secret everlasting purpose of love to His people, to
magnify His grace after their desperate rebellion.

[Hosea 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 11:9</span></span>

I will not return to destroy Ephraim--that is I will no more, as in past
times, destroy Ephraim. The destruction primarily meant is probably that
by Tiglath-pileser, who, as the Jewish king Ahaz' ally against Pekah of
Israel and Rezin of Syria, deprived Israel of Gilead, Galilee, and
Naphtali ([Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). The ulterior
reference is to the long dispersion hereafter, to be ended by God's
covenant mercy restoring His people, not for their merits, but of His
grace.

God, . . . not man--not dealing as man would, with implacable wrath
under awful provocation ([Isa 55:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md);
[Mal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md). I do not, like man, change
when once I have made a covenant of everlasting love, as with Israel
([Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md). We measure God by the
human standard, and hence are slow to credit fully His promises; these,
however, belong to the faithful remnant, not to the obstinately
impenitent.

in the midst of thee--as peculiarly thy God ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md).

not enter into the city--as an enemy: as I entered Admah, Zeboim, and
Sodom, utterly destroying them, whereas I will not utterly destroy thee.
Somewhat similarly JEROME: "I am not one such as human dwellers in a
city, who take cruel vengeance; I save those whom I correct." Thus "not
man," and "in the midst of thee," are parallel to "into the city."
Though I am in the midst of thee, it is not as man entering a rebellious
city to destroy utterly. MAURER needlessly translates, "I will not come
in wrath."

[Hosea 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 11:10</span></span>

he shall roar like a lion--by awful judgments on their foes ([Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md); [Jer
25:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md); [Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016).md), calling His dispersed
"children" from the various lands of their dispersion.

shall tremble--shall flock in eager agitation of haste.

from the west-- ([Zac 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007).md). Literally,
"the sea." Probably the Mediterranean, including its "isles of the sea,"
and maritime coast. Thus as [Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)
specifies regions of Africa and Asia, so here Europe. [Isa
11:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md), is parallel, referring to
the very same regions. On "children," see [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md).

[Hosea 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 11:11</span></span>

tremble--flutter in haste.

dove--no longer "a silly dove" ([Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011).md), but as "doves flying to their
windows" ([Isa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008).md).

in their houses-- ([Eze 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#026).md).
Literally, "upon," for the Orientals live almost as much upon their
flat-roofed houses as in them.

[Hosea 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 11:12</span></span>

MAURER joins this verse with the twelfth chapter. But as this verse
praises Judah, whereas [Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md)
censures him, it must belong rather to the eleventh chapter and a new
prophecy begins at the twelfth chapter. To avoid this, MAURER translates
this verse as a censure, "Judah wanders with God," that is, though
having the true God, he wanders after false gods.

ruleth with God--to serve God is to reign. Ephraim wished to rule
without God (compare [Co1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008).md); nay,
even, in order to rule, cast off God's worship \[RIVETUS\]. In Judah was
the legitimate succession of kings and priests.

with the saints--the holy priests and Levites \[RIVETUS\]. With the
fathers and prophets who handed down the pure worship of God. Israel's
apostasy is the more culpable, as he had before him the good example of
Judah, which he set at naught. The parallelism ("with GOD") favors
Margin, "With THE MOST HOLY ONE."
