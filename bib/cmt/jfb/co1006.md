### [1 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 6:1</span></span>

LITIGATION OF CHRISTIANS IN HEATHEN COURTS CENSURED: ITS VERY EXISTENCE
BETRAYS A WRONG SPIRIT: BETTER TO BEAR WRONG NOW, AND HEREAFTER THE
DOERS OF WRONG SHALL BE SHUT OUT OF HEAVEN. ([Co1
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001).md)

Dare--This word implies treason against Christian brotherhood
\[BENGEL\].

before the unjust--The Gentile judges are here so termed by an epithet
appropriate to the subject in question, namely, one concerning justice.
Though all Gentiles were not altogether unjust, yet in the highest view
of justice which has regard to God as the Supreme Judge, they are so:
Christians, on the other hand, as regarding God as the only Fountain of
justice, should not expect justice from them.

before . . . saints--The Jews abroad were permitted to refer their
disputes to Jewish arbitrators \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 14.10,17\]. So
the Christians were allowed to have Christian arbitrators.

[1 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 6:2</span></span>

Do ye not know--as a truth universally recognized by Christians.
Notwithstanding all your glorying in your "knowledge," ye are acting
contrary to it ([Co1 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md); [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md). The oldest manuscripts have "Or"
before "know ye not"; that is, "What! (expressing surprise) know ye
not," &c.

saints . . . judge--that is, "rule," including judgment: as assessors of
Christ. [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md), "judging," that
is, "ruling over." (Compare [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md); [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022.md), [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md); [Rev
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md). There is a distinction drawn by
able expositors between the saints who judge or rule, and the world
which is ruled by them: as there is between the elected ([Mat
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023).md) twelve apostles who sit on
thrones judging, and the twelve tribes of Israel that are judged by
them. To reign, and to be saved, are not necessarily synonymous. As
Jehovah employed angels to carry the law into effect when He descended
on Sinai to establish His throne in Israel, so at His coming the saints
shall administer the kingdom for, and under, Him. The nations of the
earth, and Israel the foremost, in the flesh, shall, in this view, be
the subjects of the rule of the Lord and His saints in glorified bodies.
The mistake of the Chiliasts was that they took the merely carnal view,
restricting the kingdom to the terrestrial part. This part shall have
place with the accession of spiritual and temporal blessings such as
Christ's presence must produce. Besides this earthly glory, there shall
be the heavenly glory of the saints reigning in transfigured bodies, and
holding such blessed intercourse with mortal men, as angels had with men
of old, and as Christ, Moses, and Elias, in glory had with Peter, James,
and John, in the flesh at the transfiguration ([Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md); [Pe2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md). But here the "world" seems
to be the unbelieving world that is to be "condemned" ([Co1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022).md), rather than the whole world,
including the subject nations which are to be brought under Christ's
sway; however, it may include both those to be condemned, with the bad
angels, and those about to be brought into obedience to the sway of
Christ with His saints. Compare [Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md), [Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md), "all nations," "these my
brethren" on the thrones with Him. The event will decide the truth of
this view.

judged by you--or, before you (compare [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022).md).

smallest matters--The weightiest of earthly questions at issue are
infinitely small compared with those to be decided on the judgment-day.

[1 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 6:3</span></span>

judge angels--namely, bad angels. We who are now "a spectacle to angels"
shall then "judge angels." The saints shall join in approving the final
sentence of the Judge on them ([Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006).md). Believers shall, as
administrators of the kingdom under Jesus, put down all rule that is
hostile to God. Perhaps, too, good angels shall then receive from the
Judge, with the approval of the saints, higher honors.

[1 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 6:4</span></span>

judgments--that is, cases for judgment.

least esteemed--literally, "those of no esteem." Any, however low in the
Church, rather than the heathen ([Co1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md). Questions of earthly property
are of secondary consequence in the eyes of true Christians, and are
therefore delegated to those in a secondary position in the Church.

[1 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 6:5</span></span>

your shame--Thus he checks their puffed-up spirit ([Co1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002.md); compare [Co1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034).md). To shame you out of your
present unworthy course of litigation before the heathen, I have said
([Co1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004).md), "Set the least esteemed in
the Church to judge." Better even this, than your present course.

Is it so?--Are you in such a helpless state that, &c.?

not a wise man--though ye admire "wisdom" so much on other occasions
([Co1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005.md), [Co1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022).md). Paul alludes probably to the
title, "cachain," or wise man, applied to each Rabbi in Jewish councils.

no, not one--not even one, amidst so many reputed among you for wisdom
([Co1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md); [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006).md).

shall be able--when applied to.

brethren--literally, "brother"; that is, judge between brother and
brother. As each case should arise, the arbitrator was to be chosen from
the body of the church, such a wise person as had the charism, or gift,
of church government.

[1 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 6:6</span></span>

But--emphatically answering the question in the end of [Co1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md) in the negative. Translate, "Nay,"
&c.

[1 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 6:7</span></span>

utterly a fault--literally, "a shortcoming" (not so strong as sin). Your
going to law at all is a falling short of your high privileges, not to
say your doing so before unbelievers, which aggravates it.

rather take wrong-- ([Pro 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md); [Mat
5:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039).md); that is, "suffer yourselves
to be wronged."

[1 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 6:8</span></span>

ye--emphatic. Ye, whom your Lord commanded to return good for evil, on
the contrary, "do wrong (by taking away) and defraud" (by retaining what
is entrusted to you; or "defraud" marks the effect of the "wrong" done,
namely, the loss inflicted). Not only do ye not bear, but ye inflict
wrongs.

[1 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 6:9</span></span>

unrighteous--Translate, "Doers of wrong": referring to [Co1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008.md) (compare [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021).md).

kingdom of God--which is a kingdom of righteousness ([Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017).md).

fornicators--alluding to [Co1 5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md);
also below, [Co1 6:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md).

effeminate--self-polluters, who submit to unnatural lusts.

[1 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 6:11</span></span>

ye are washed--The Greek middle voice expresses, "Ye have had yourselves
washed." This washing implies the admission to the benefits of Christ's
salvation generally; of which the parts are; (1) Sanctification, or the
setting apart from the world, and adoption into the Church: so
"sanctified" is used [Co1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md); [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md). Compare [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md), where it rather seems to mean the
setting apart of one as consecrated by the Spirit in the eternal purpose
God. (2) Justification from condemnation through the righteousness of
God in Christ by faith ([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md). So
PARÃ†US. The order of sanctification before justification shows that it
must be so taken, and not in the sense of progressive sanctification.
"Washed" precedes both, and so must refer to the Christian's outward new
birth of water, the sign of the inward setting apart to the Lord by the
inspiration of the Spirit as the seed of new life ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md); [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md). Paul (compare the Church of
England Baptismal Service), in charity, and faith in the ideal of the
Church, presumes that baptism realizes its original design, and that
those outwardly baptized inwardly enter into vital communion with Christ
([Gal 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027).md). He presents the grand
ideal which those alone realized in whom the inward and the outward
baptism coalesced. At the same time he recognizes the fact that this in
many cases does not hold good ([Co1
6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008).md), leaving it to God to decide
who are the really "washed," while he only decides on broad general
principles.

in the name of . . . Jesus, and by the Spirit--rather, "in the Spirit,"
that is, by His in-dwelling. Both clauses belong to the three--"washed,
sanctified, justified."

our God--The "our" reminds the that amidst all his reproofs God is still
the common God of himself and them.

[1 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 6:12</span></span>

REFUTATION OF THE ANTINOMIAN DEFENSE OF FORNICATION AS IF IT WAS LAWFUL
BECAUSE MEATS ARE SO. ([Co1 6:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012).md)

All things are lawful unto me--These, which were Paul's own words on a
former occasion (to the Corinthians, compare [Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md), and [Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023).md), were made a pretext for
excusing the eating of meats offered to idols, and so of what was
generally connected with idolatry ([Act
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029).md), "fornication" (perhaps in the
letter of the Corinthians to Paul, [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md). Paul's remark had referred only
to things indifferent: but they wished to treat fornication as such, on
the ground that the existence of bodily appetites proved the lawfulness
of their gratification.

me--Paul giving himself as a sample of Christians in general.

but I--whatever others do, I will not, &c.

lawful . . . brought under the power--The Greek words are from the same
root, whence there is a play on the words: All things are in my power,
but I will not be brought under the power of any of them (the "all
things"). He who commits "fornication," steps aside from his own
legitimate power or liberty, and is "brought under the power" of an
harlot ([Co1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md); compare [Co1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004).md). The "power" ought to be in the
hands of the believer, not in the things which he uses \[BENGEL\]; else
his liberty is forfeited; he ceases to be his own master ([Joh
8:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034.md); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md); [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019).md). Unlawful things ruin thousands;
"lawful" things (unlawfully used), ten thousands.

[1 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 6:13</span></span>

The argument drawn from the indifference of meats ([Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md); [Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md), [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md); compare [Mar
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018.md); [Col
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020).md) to that of fornication does
not hold good. Meats doubtless are indifferent, since both they and the
"belly" for which they are created are to be "destroyed" in the future
state. But "the body is not (created) for fornication, but for the Lord;
and the Lord for the body" (as its Redeemer, who hath Himself assumed
the body): "And God hath raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us"
(that is our bodies): therefore the "body" is not, like the "belly,"
after having served a temporary use, to be destroyed: Now "he that
committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body" ([Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018).md). Therefore fornication is not
indifferent, since it is a sin against one's own body, which, like the
Lord for whom it is created, is not to be destroyed, but to be raised to
eternal existence. Thus Paul gives here the germ of the three subjects
handled in subsequent sections: (1) The relation between the sexes. (2)
The question of meats offered to idols. (3) The resurrection of the
body.

shall destroy--at the Lord's coming to change the natural bodies of
believers into spiritual bodies ([Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052).md). There is a real essence
underlying the superficial phenomena of the present temporary
organization of the body, and this essential germ, when all the
particles are scattered, involves the future resurrection of the body
incorruptible.

[1 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 6:14</span></span>

([Rom 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md).

raised up--rather, "raised," to distinguish it from "will raise up us";
the Greek of the latter being a compound, the former a simple verb.
Believers shall be raised up out of the rest of the dead (see on [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011).md); the first resurrection ([Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005).md).

us--Here he speaks of the possibility of his being found in the grave
when Christ comes; elsewhere, of his being possibly found alive ([Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017).md). In either event, the Lord's
coming rather than death is the great object of the Christian's
expectation ([Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md).

[1 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 6:15</span></span>

Resuming the thought in [Co1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md),
"the body is for the Lord" ([Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md); [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md), [Eph
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015.md); [Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030).md).

shall I then--such being the case.

take--spontaneously alienating them from Christ. For they cannot be at
the same time "the members of an harlot," and "of Christ" \[BENGEL\]. It
is a fact no less certain than mysterious, that moral and spiritual ruin
is caused by such sins; which human wisdom (when untaught by revelation)
held to be actions as blameless as eating and drinking \[CONYBEARE and
HOWSON\].

[1 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 6:16</span></span>

Justification of his having called fornicators "members of an harlot"
([Co1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015).md).

joined--by carnal intercourse; literally, "cemented to": cleaving to.

one body--with her.

saith he--God speaking by Adam ([Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md); [Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005).md). "He which made them at the
beginning said," &c. ([Eph 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031).md).

[1 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 6:17</span></span>

one spirit--with Him. In the case of union with a harlot, the fornicator
becomes one "body" with her (not one "spirit," for the spirit which is
normally the organ of the Holy Spirit in man, is in the carnal so
overlaid with what is sensual that it is ignored altogether). But the
believer not only has his body sanctified by union with Christ's body,
but also becomes "one spirit" with Him ([Joh
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md); [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md); [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md); compare [Eph
5:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md); [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md).

[1 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 6:18</span></span>

Flee--The only safety in such temptations is flight ([Gen
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012.md); [Job
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001).md).

Every sin--The Greek is forcible. "Every sin whatsoever that a man
doeth." Every other sin; even gluttony, drunkenness, and self-murder are
"without," that is, comparatively external to the body ([Mar
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018.md); compare [Pro
6:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030).md). He certainly injures, but he
does not alienate the body itself; the sin is not terminated in the
body; he rather sins against the perishing accidents of the body (as the
"belly," and the body's present temporary organization), and against the
soul than against the body in its permanent essence, designed "for the
Lord." "But" the fornicator alienates that body which is the Lord's, and
makes it one with a harlot's body, and so "sinneth against his own
body," that is, against the verity and nature of his body; not a mere
effect on the body from without, but a contradiction of the truth of the
body, wrought within itself \[ALFORD\].

[1 Corinthians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 6:19</span></span>

What? know ye not? &c.--Proof that "he that fornicates sinneth against
his own body" ([Co1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018).md).

your body--not "bodies." As in [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md), he represented the whole company
of believers (souls and bodies), that is, the Church, as "the temple of
God," the Spirit; so here, the body of each individual of the Church is
viewed as the ideal "temple of the Holy Ghost." So [Joh
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023.md), which proves that not only the
Church, but also each member of it, is "the temple of the Holy Ghost."
Still though many the several members form one temple, the whole
collectively being that which each is in miniature individually. Just as
the Jews had one temple only, so in the fullest sense all Christian
churches and individual believers form one temple only. Thus "YOUR
\[plural\] body" is distinguished here from "HIS OWN \[particular or
individual\] body" ([Co1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018).md). In
sinning against the latter, the fornicator sins against "your (ideal)
body," that of "Christ," whose "members your bodies" are ([Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015).md). In this consists the sin of
fornication, that it is a sacrilegious desecration of God's temple to
profane uses. The unseen, but much more efficient, Spirit of God in the
spiritual temple now takes the place of the visible Shekinah in the old
material temple. The whole man is the temple; the soul is the inmost
shrine; the understanding and heart, the holy place; and the body, the
porch and exterior of the edifice. Chastity is the guardian of the
temple to prevent anything unclean entering which might provoke the
indwelling God to abandon it as defiled \[TERTULLIAN, On the Apparel of
Women\]. None but God can claim a temple; here the Holy Ghost is
assigned one; therefore the Holy Ghost is God.

not your own--The fornicator treats his body as if it were "his own," to
give to a harlot if he pleases ([Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md); compare [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020).md). But we have no right to
alienate our body which is the Lord's. In ancient servitude the person
of the servant was wholly the property of the master, not his own.
Purchase was one of the ways of acquiring a slave. Man has sold himself
to sin ([Kg1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md); [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md). Christ buys him to Himself, to
serve Him ([Rom 6:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016).md).

[1 Corinthians 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 6:20</span></span>

bought with a price--Therefore Christ's blood is strictly a ransom paid
to God's justice by the love of God in Christ for our redemption ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md); [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).md). While He thus took off our
obligation to punishment, He laid upon us a new obligation to obedience
([Co1 7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022).md). If we accept Him as
our Prophet to reveal God to us, and our Priest to atone for us, we must
also accept Him as our King to rule over us as wholly His, presenting
every token of our fealty ([Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013).md).

in your body--as "in" a temple (compare [Joh
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#032.md); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md).

and in your spirit, which are God's--not in the oldest manuscripts and
versions, and not needed for the sense, as the context refers mainly to
the "body" ([Co1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md), [Co1
6:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018).md). The "spirit" is incidentally
mentioned in [Co1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017.md), which perhaps
gave rise to the interpolation, at first written in the Margin,
afterwards inserted in the text.
