### [Habakkuk Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001)

[Habakkuk](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hab 0:0</span></span>

HABAKKUK, from a Hebrew root meaning to "embrace," denoting a "favorite"
(namely, of God) and a "struggler" (for his country's good). Some
ancient authors represent him as belonging to the tribe of Levi; others
\[PSEUDO EPIPHANIUS\], to that of Simeon. The inscription to Bel and the
dragon in the Septuagint asserts the former; and [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019) perhaps favors this. EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 7.29\] states that in his time Habakkuk's tomb
was shown at Ceila in Palestine.

The time seems to have been about 610 B.C. For the Chaldeans attacked
Jerusalem in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim, 605 B.C.
([Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001); [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006); [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002); [Jer
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)). And Habakkuk ([Hab
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005), &c.) speaks of the Chaldeans as
about to invade Judah, but not as having actually done so. In the second
chapter he proceeds to comfort his people by foretelling the humiliation
of their conquerors, and that the vision will soon have its fulfilment.
In the third chapter the prophet in a sublime ode celebrates the
deliverances wrought by Jehovah for His people in times past, as the
ground of assurance, notwithstanding all their existing calamities, that
He will deliver them again. [Hab 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016)
shows that the invader is still coming, and not yet arrived; so that the
whole refers to the invasion in Jehoiakim's times, not those under
Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. The Apocryphal appendix to Daniel states that
he lived to see the Babylonian exile (588 B.C.), which accords with his
prophesying early in Jehoiakim's reign, about 610 B.C.

The position of the book immediately after Nahum is appropriate; as
Nahum treated of the judgments of the Lord on Assyria, for its violence
against Israel, so Habakkuk, those inflicted by, and on, the Chaldeans
for the same reason.

The style is poetical and sublime. The parallelisms are generally
regular. Borrowed ideas occur (compare [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019), with [Psa
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006), with [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004); [Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014), with [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009)). The ancient catalogues imply
that his book is part of the canon of Scripture. In the New Testament,
[Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017) quotes [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004) (though not naming him); compare
also [Gal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011); [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038). [Act
13:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040) quotes [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005). One or two Hebrew words peculiar
to Habakkuk occur ([Hab 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006), [Hab
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016)).
