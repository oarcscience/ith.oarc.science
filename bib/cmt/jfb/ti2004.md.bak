### [2 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 4:1</span></span>

SOLEMN CHARGE TO TIMOTHY TO DO HIS DUTY ZEALOUSLY, FOR TIMES OF APOSTASY
ARE AT HAND, AND THE APOSTLE IS NEAR HIS TRIUMPHANT END: REQUESTS HIM TO
COME AND BRING MARK WITH HIM TO ROME, AS LUKE ALONE IS WITH HIM, THE
OTHERS HAVING GONE: ALSO HIS CLOAK AND PARCHMENTS: WARNS HIM AGAINST
ALEXANDER: TELLS WHAT BEFELL HIM AT HIS FIRST DEFENSE: GREETINGS:
BENEDICTION. (2Ti. 4:1-22)

charge--Greek, "adjure."

therefore--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

the Lord Jesus Christ--The oldest manuscripts read simply, "Christ
Jesus."

shall judge--His commission from God is mentioned, [Act
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md); his resolution to do so, [Pe1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md); the execution of his commission,
here.

at his appearing--The oldest manuscripts read, "and" for "at"; then
translate, "(I charge thee before God . . . ) and by His appearing."

and his kingdom--to be set at His appearing, when we hope to reign with
Him. His kingdom is real now, but not visible. It shall then be both
real and visible ([Luk 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#018.md), [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md); [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007.md); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md); [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006).md). Now he reigns in the midst of
His enemies expecting till they shall be overthrown ([Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md); [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013).md). Then He shall reign with His
adversaries prostrate.

[2 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 4:2</span></span>

Preach--literally, "proclaim as a herald." The term for the discourses
in the synagogue was daraschoth; the corresponding Greek term (implying
dialectial style, dialogue, and discussion, [Act
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md), [Act
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md); [Act
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md), [Act
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019).md) is applied in Acts to
discourses in the Christian Church. JUSTIN MARTYR \[Apology, 2\],
describes the order of public worship, "On Sunday all meet and the
writings of the apostles and prophets are read; then the president
delivers a discourse; after this all stand up and pray; then there is
offered bread and wine and water; the president likewise prays and gives
thanks, and the people solemnly assent, saying, Amen." The bishops and
presbyters had the right and duty to preach, but they sometimes called
on deacons, and even laymen, to preach. EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical
History, 6.19\]; in this the Church imitated the synagogue ([Luk
4:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md); [Act
13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015).md).

be instant--that is, urgent, earnest, in the whole work of the ministry.

in season, out of season--that is, at all seasons; whether they regard
your speaking as seasonable or unseasonable. "Just as the fountains,
though none may draw from them, still flow on; and the rivers, though
none drink of them, still run; so must we do all on our part in
speaking, though none give heed to us" \[CHRYSOSTOM, Homily, 30, vol.
5., p. 221\]. I think with CHRYSOSTOM, there is included also the idea
of times whether seasonable or unseasonable to Timothy himself; not
merely when convenient, but when inconvenient to thee, night as well as
day ([Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031).md), in danger as well as
in safety, in prison and when doomed to death as well as when at large,
not only in church, but everywhere and on all occasions, whenever and
wherever the Lord's work requires it.

reprove--"convict," "confute."

with, &c.--Greek, "IN (the element in which the exhortation ought to
have place) all long-suffering ([Ti2
2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md); [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010).md) and teaching"; compare [Ti2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md), "apt to teach." The Greek for
"doctrine" here is didache, but in [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md), didascalia. "Didascalia" is what
one receives; "didache" is what is communicated \[TITTMANN\].

[2 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 4:3</span></span>

they--professing Christians.

sound doctrine--Greek, "the sound (see on [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010)) doctrine (didascalias.md)" or
"teaching," namely, of the Gospel. Presently follows the concrete,
"teachers."

after their own lusts--Instead of regarding the will of God they dislike
being interrupted in their lusts by true teachers.

heap--one on another: an indiscriminate mass of false teachers. Variety
delights itching ears. "He who despises sound teaching, leaves sound
teachers; they seek instructors like themselves" \[BENGEL\]. It is the
corruption of the people in the first instance, that creates priestcraft
([Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001).md).

to themselves--such as will suit their depraved tastes; populus vult
decipi, et decipiatur--"the people wish to be deceived, so let them be
deceived." "Like priest, like people" ([Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md); [Hos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md).

itching--like to hear teachers who give them mere pleasure ([Act
17:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019).md), and do not offend by truths
grating to their ears. They, as it were, tickle with pleasure the levity
of the multitude \[CICERO\], who come as to a theater to hear what will
delight their ears, not to learn \[SENECA, Epistles, 10.8\] what will do
them good. "Itch in the ear is as bad in any other part of the body, and
perhaps worse" \[SOUTH\].

[2 Timothy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 4:4</span></span>

The ear brooks not what is opposed to the man's lusts.

turned--Greek, "turned aside" ([Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).md). It is a righteous retribution,
that when men turn away from the truth, they should be turned to fables
([Jer 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019).md).

fables-- ([Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).md).

[2 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 4:5</span></span>

I am no longer here to withstand these things; be thou a worthy
successor of me, no longer depending on me for counsel, but thine own
master, and swimming without the corks \[CALVIN\]; follow my steps,
inherit their result, and the honor of their end \[ALFORD\].

watch thou--literally, "with the wakefulness of one sober."

in all things--on all occasions and under all circumstances ([Tit
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007).md).

endure affliction--suffer hardships \[ALFORD\].

evangelist--a missionary bishop preacher, and teacher.

make full proof of--fulfil in all its requirements, leaving nothing
undone ([Act 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md); [Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017).md).

[2 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 4:6</span></span>

Greek, "For I am already being offered"; literally, as a libation;
appropriate to the shedding of his blood. Every sacrifice began with an
initiatory libation on the victim's head (compare Note, see on [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md). A motive to stimulate Timothy
to faithfulness--the departure and final blessedness of Paul; it is the
end that crowns the work \[BENGEL\]. As the time of his departure was
indicated to Peter, so to Paul ([Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014).md).

my departure--literally, "loosing anchor" (see on [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).md). Dissolution.

[2 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 4:7</span></span>

"I have striven the good strife"; the Greek is not restricted to a
fight, but includes any competitive contest, for example, that of the
racecourse ([Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md) \[ALFORD\]; [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md), &c.; [Heb
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md).

kept the faith--the Christian faith committed to me as a believer and an
apostle (compare [Ti2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md); [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010).md).

[2 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 4:8</span></span>

a crown--rather as Greek, "the crown." The "henceforth" marks the
decisive moment; he looks to his state in a threefold aspect: (1) The
past "I have fought"; (2) The immediate present; "there is laid up for
me." (3) The future "the Lord will give in that day" \[BENGEL\].

crown--a crown, or garland, used to be bestowed at the Greek national
games on the successful competitor in wrestling, running, &c. (compare
[Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010).md).

of righteousness--The reward is in recognition of righteousness wrought
in Paul by God's Spirit; the crown is prepared for the righteous; but it
is a crown which consists in righteousness. Righteousness will be its
own reward ([Rev 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011).md). Compare [Exo
39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030.md). A man is justified gratuitously
by the merits of Christ through faith; and when he is so justified God
accepts his works and honors them with a reward which is not their due,
but is given of grace. "So great is God's goodness to men that He wills
that their works should be merits, though they are merely His own gifts"
\[POPE CELESTINE I., Epistles, 12\].

give--Greek, "shall award" in righteous requital as "Judge" ([Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md); [Co2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md); [Th2
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006).md).

in that day--not until His appearing ([Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012).md). The partakers of the first
resurrection may receive a crown also at the last day, and obtain in
that general assembly of all men, a new award of praise. The favorable
sentence passed on the "brethren" of the Judge, who sit with Him on His
throne, is in [Mat 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md), taken for
granted as already awarded, when that affecting those who benefited them
is being passed \[BENGEL\]. The former, the elect Church who reign with
Christ in the millennium, are fewer than the latter. The righteous
heavenly Judge stands in contrast to the unrighteous earthly judges who
condemned Paul.

me--individual appropriation. Greek, "not only to me."

them that love--Greek, "have loved, and do love"; habitual love and
desire for Christ's appearing, which presupposes faith (compare [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). Compare the sad contrast, [Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md), "having loved this present
world."

[2 Timothy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 4:9</span></span>

([Ti2 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md); [Ti2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md), [Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)..md) Timothy is asked to come to be a
comfort to Paul, and also to be strengthened by Paul, for carrying on
the Gospel work after Paul's decease.

[2 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 4:10</span></span>

Demas--once a "fellow laborer" of Paul, along with Mark and Luke ([Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md). His motive for forsaking Paul
seems to have been love of worldly ease, safety, and comforts at home,
and disinclination to brave danger with Paul ([Mat
13:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020).md). CHRYSOSTOM implies that
Thessalonica was his home.

Galatia--One oldest manuscript supports the reading "Gaul." But most
oldest manuscripts, &c., "Galatia."

Titus--He must have therefore left Crete after "setting in order" the
affairs of the churches there ([Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md).

Dalmatia--part of the Roman province of Illyricum on the coast of the
Adriatic. Paul had written to him ([Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).md) to come to him in the winter to
Nicopolis (in Epirus), intending in the spring to preach the Gospel in
the adjoining province of Dalmatia. Titus seems to have gone thither to
carry out the apostle's intention, the execution of which was
interrupted by his arrest. Whether he went of his own accord, as is
likely, or was sent by Paul, which the expression "is departed" hardly
accords with, cannot be positively decided. Paul here speaks only of his
personal attendants having forsaken him; he had still friends among the
Roman Christians who visited him ([Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021).md), though they had been afraid to
stand by him at his trial ([Ti2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016).md).

[2 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 4:11</span></span>

Take--Greek, "take up" on thy journey ([Act
20:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013).md). John Mark was probably in,
or near, Colosse, as in the Epistle to the Colossians ([Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md), written two years before this,
he is mentioned as about to visit them. Timothy was now absent from
Ephesus and somewhere in the interior of Asia Minor; hence he would be
sure to fall in with Mark on his journey.

he is profitable to me for the ministry--Mark had been under a cloud for
having forsaken Paul at a critical moment in his missionary tour with
Barnabas ([Act 15:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md); [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md), [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013).md). Timothy had subsequently
occupied the same post in relation to Paul as Mark once held. Hence
Paul, appropriately here, wipes out the past censure by high praise of
Mark and guards against Timothy's making self-complacent comparisons
between himself and Mark, as though he were superior to the latter
(compare [Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md). Demas
apostatizes. Mark returns to the right way, and is no longer
unprofitable, but is profitable for the Gospel ministry ([Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011).md).

[2 Timothy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 4:12</span></span>

And--Greek, "But." Thou art to come to me, but Tychicus I have sent to
Ephesus to supply thy place (if thou so willest it) in presiding over
the Church there in thy absence (compare [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).md). It is possible Tychicus was the
bearer of this Epistle, though the omission of "to thee" is rather
against this view.

[2 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 4:13</span></span>

cloak . . . I left--probably obliged to leave it in a hurried departure
from Troas.

Carpus--a faithful friend to have been entrusted with so precious
deposits. The mention of his "cloak," so far from being unworthy of
inspiration, is one of those graphic touches which sheds a flood of
light on the last scene of Paul's life, on the confines of two worlds;
in this wanting a cloak to cover him from the winter cold, in that
covered with the righteousness of saints, "clothed upon with his house
from heaven" \[GAUSSEN\]. So the inner vesture and outer garment of
Jesus, Paul's master, are suggestive of most instructive thought ([Joh
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#002).md).

books--He was anxious respecting these that he might transmit them to
the faithful, so that they might have the teaching of his writings when
he should be gone.

especially the parchments--containing perhaps some of his inspired
Epistles themselves.

[2 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 4:14</span></span>

Alexander the coppersmith--or "smith" in general. Perhaps the same as
the Alexander (see on [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md) at
Ephesus. Excommunicated then he subsequently was restored, and now
vented his personal malice because of his excommunication in accusing
Paul before the Roman judges, whether of incendiarism or of introducing
a new religion. See my Introduction. He may have been the Alexander put
forward by the Jews in the tumult at Ephesus ([Act
19:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033).md).

reward--The oldest manuscripts read, "shall reward," or "requite him."
Personal revenge certainly did not influence the apostle ([Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016), end.md).

[2 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 4:15</span></span>

our words--the arguments of us Christians for our common faith.
Believers have a common cause.

[2 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 4:16</span></span>

At my first answer--that is, "defense" in court, at my first public
examination. Timothy knew nothing of this, it is plain, till Paul now
informs him. But during his former imprisonment at Rome, Timothy was
with him ([Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007).md). This must have been, therefore,
a second imprisonment. He must have been set free before the persecution
in A.D. 64, when the Christians were accused of causing the
conflagration in Rome; for, had he been a prisoner then, he certainly
would not have been spared. The tradition \[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical
History, 2.251\] that he was finally beheaded, accords with his not
having been put to death in the persecution, A.D. 64, when burning to
death was the mode by which the Christians were executed, but
subsequently to it. His "first" trial in his second imprisonment seems
to have been on the charge of complicity in the conflagration; his
absence from Rome may have been the ground of his acquittal on that
charge; his final condemnation was probably on the charge of introducing
a new and unlawful religion into Rome.

stood with me--Greek, "came forward with me" \[ALFORD\] as a friend and
advocate.

may it not be laid to their charge--The position of "their," in the
Greek, is emphatic. "May it not be laid to THEIR charge," for they were
intimidated; their drawing back from me was not from bad disposition so
much as from fear; it is sure to be laid to the charge of those who
intimidated them. Still Paul, like Stephen, would doubtless have offered
the same prayer for his persecutors themselves ([Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060).md).

[2 Timothy 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 4:17</span></span>

the Lord--the more because men deserted me.

stood with me--stronger than "came forward with me" (Greek, [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016).md).

strengthened--Greek, "put strength in me."

by me--"through me"; through my means. One single occasion is often of
the greatest moment.

the preaching--"the Gospel proclamation."

might be fully known--might be fully made (see on [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005).md).

that all the Gentiles--present at my trial, "might hear" the Gospel
proclaimed then. Rome was the capital of the Gentile world, so that a
proclamation of the truth to the Romans was likely to go forth to the
rest of the Gentile world.

I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion--namely, Satan, the
roaring, devouring lion ([Luk 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md);
[Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md). I was prevented falling
into his snare ([Ti2 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md); [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009).md); [Ti2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md) agrees with this interpretation,
"The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work," namely, both from evil
and the evil one, as the Greek of the Lord's Prayer expresses it. It was
not deliverance from Nero (who was called the lion) which he rejoiced
in, for he did not fear death ([Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006).md), but deliverance from the
temptation, through fear, to deny His Lord: so ALFORD.

[2 Timothy 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 4:18</span></span>

And the Lord shall, &c.--Hope draws its conclusions from the past to the
future \[BENGEL\].

will preserve me--literally, "will save" ([Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021).md), "will bring me safe to." Jesus
is the Lord and the Deliverer ([Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010).md): He saves from evil; He gives
good things.

heavenly kingdom--Greek, "His kingdom which is a heavenly one."

to whom, &c.--Greek, "to whom be the glory unto the ages of ages." The
very hope produces a doxology: how much greater will be the doxology
which the actual enjoyment shall produce! \[BENGEL\].

[2 Timothy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 4:19</span></span>

Prisca and Aquila-- ([Act 18:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md); [Rom
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md), written from Ephesus, where
therefore Aquila and Priscilla must then have been).

household of Onesiphorus--If he were dead at the time, the "household"
would not have been called "the household of Onesiphorus." He was
probably absent (see on [Ti2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016).md).

[2 Timothy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 4:20</span></span>

In order to depict his desertion, he informs Timothy that Erastus, one
of his usual companions ([Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md),
possibly the same Erastus as in [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), though how he could leave his
official duties for missionary journeys is not clear), stayed behind at
Corinth, his native place, or usual residence, of which city he was
"chamberlain," or city steward and treasurer ([Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023).md); and Trophimus he left behind
at Miletus sick. (On his former history, see on [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029).md). This verse is irreconcilable
with the imprisonment from which he writes being the first: for he did
not pass by Corinth or Miletus on his way to Rome when about to be
imprisoned for the first time. As Miletus was near Ephesus, there is a
presumption that Timothy was not at Ephesus when Paul wrote, or he would
not need to inform Timothy of Trophimus lying sick in his immediate
neighborhood. However, Trophimus may not have been still at Miletus at
the time when Paul wrote, though he had left him there on his way to
Rome. Prisca and Aquila were most likely to be at Ephesus ([Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).md), and he desires Timothy to
salute them: so also Onesiphorus' household ([Ti2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018).md). Paul had not the power of
healing at will ([Act 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012).md), but as
the Lord allowed him.

before winter--when a voyage, according to ancient usages of navigation,
would be out of the question: also, Paul would need his "cloak" against
the winter ([Ti2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013).md).

Pudens . . . Claudia--afterwards husband and wife (according to MARTIAL
\[Epigrams, 4.13; 11.54\]), he a Roman knight, she a Briton, surnamed
Rufina. TACITUS \[On Agriculture, 14\], mentions that territories in
southeast Britain were given to a British king; Cogidunus, in reward for
his fidelity to Rome, A.D. 52, while Claudius was emperor. In 1772 a
marble was dug up at Chichester, mentioning Cogidunus with the surname
Claudius, added from his patron, the emperor's name; and Pudens in
connection with Cogidunus, doubtless his father-in-law. His daughter
would be Claudia, who seems to have been sent to Rome for education, as
a pledge of the father's fidelity. Here she was under the protection of
Pomponia, wife of Aulus Plautius, conqueror of Britain. Pomponia was
accused of foreign superstitions, A.D. 57 \[TACITUS, Annals, 3.32\],
probably Christianity. She probably was the instrument of converting
Claudia, who took the name Rufina from her, that being a cognomen of the
Pomponian gens (compare [Rom 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md),
Rufus, a Christian). Pudens in MARTIAL and in the Chichester
inscription, appears as a pagan; but perhaps he or his friends concealed
his Christianity through fear. Tradition represents Timothy, a son of
Pudens, as taking part in converting the Britons.

Linus--put third; therefore not at this time yet, as he was afterwards,
bishop. His name being here inserted between Pudens and Claudia, implies
the two were not yet married. "Eubulus" is identified by some with
Aristobulus, who, with his converts, is said to have been among the
first evangelists of Britain. Paul himself, says CLEMENT, "visited the
farthest west \[perhaps Britain, certainly Spain\], and was martyred
under the rulers at Rome," who were Nero's vicegerents in his absence
from the city.

Grace be with you--plural in oldest manuscripts, "with YOU," that is,
thee and the members of the Ephesian and neighboring churches.
