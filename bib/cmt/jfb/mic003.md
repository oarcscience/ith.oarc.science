### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

THE SINS OF THE PRINCES, PROPHETS, AND PRIESTS: THE CONSEQUENT
DESOLATION OF ZION. ([Mic 3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001).md)

princes--magistrates or judges.

Is it not for you?--Is it not your special function ([Jer
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004).md)?

judgment--justice. Ye sit in judgment on others; surely then ye ought to
know the judgment for injustice which awaits yourselves ([Rom
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001).md).

[Micah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 3:2</span></span>

pluck off their skin . . . flesh--rob their fellow countrymen of all
their substance ([Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md); [Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014).md).

[Micah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 3:3</span></span>

pot . . . flesh within . . . caldron--manifold species of cruel
oppressions. Compare [Eze 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md), &c.,
containing, as to the coming punishment, the same figure as is here used
of the sin: implying that the sin and punishment exactly correspond.

[Micah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 3:4</span></span>

Then--at the time of judgment, which Micah takes for granted, so certain
is it (compare [Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003).md).

they cry . . . but he will not hear--just as those oppressed by them had
formerly cried, and they would not hear. Their prayer shall be rejected,
because it is the mere cry of nature for deliverance from pain, not that
of repentance for deliverance from sin.

ill in their doings--Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well.

[Micah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 3:5</span></span>

Here he attacks the false prophets, as before he had attacked the
"princes."

make my people err--knowingly mislead My people by not denouncing their
sins as incurring judgment.

bite with . . . teeth, and cry, Peace--that is, who, so long as they are
supplied with food, promise peace and prosperity in their prophecies.

he that putteth not into their mouths, they . . . prepare war against
him--Whenever they are not supplied with food, they foretell war and
calamity.

prepare war--literally, "sanctify war," that is, proclaim it as a holy
judgment of God because they are not fed (see on [Jer
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md); compare [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003.md); [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014).md).

[Micah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 3:6</span></span>

night . . . dark--Calamities shall press on you so overwhelming as to
compel you to cease pretending to divine ([Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004).md). Darkness is often the image of
calamity ([Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009).md).

[Micah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 3:7</span></span>

cover their lips--The Orientals prided themselves on the moustache and
beard ("upper lip," Margin). To cover it, therefore, was a token of
shame and sorrow ([Lev 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md), [Eze
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022).md). "They shall be so ashamed of
themselves as not to dare to open their mouths or boast of the name of
prophet" \[CALVIN\].

there is no answer of God--They shall no more profess to have responses
from God, being struck dumb with calamities ([Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006).md).

[Micah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 3:8</span></span>

I--in contrast to the false prophets ([Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md), [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007).md).

full of power--that which "the Spirit of Jehovah" imparts for the
discharge of the prophetical function ([Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md); [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049.md); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).md).

judgment--a sense of justice \[MAURER\]; as opposed to the false
prophets' speaking to please men, not from a regard to truth. Or,
"judgment" to discern between graver and lighter offenses, and to
denounce punishments accordingly \[GROTIUS\].

might--moral intrepidity in speaking the truth at all costs ([Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007).md).

to declare unto Jacob his . . . sin-- ([Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001).md). Not to flatter the sinner as
the false prophets do with promises of peace.

[Micah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 3:9</span></span>

Hear--resumed from [Mic 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001.md). Here
begins the leading subject of the prophecy: a demonstration of his
assertion that he is "full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah" ([Mic
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008).md).

[Micah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 3:10</span></span>

They--change of person from "ye" ([Mic
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009).md); the third person puts them to a
greater distance as estranged from Him. It is, literally, "Whosoever
builds," singular.

build up Zion with blood--build on it stately mansions with wealth
obtained by the condemnation and murder of the innocent ([Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md); [Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027.md); [Hab
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012).md).

[Micah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 3:11</span></span>

heads thereof--the princes of Jerusalem.

judge for reward--take bribes as judges ([Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003).md).

priests teach for hire--It was their duty to teach the law and to decide
controversies gratuitously ([Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011.md); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md); compare [Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md); [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).md).

prophets . . . divine--that is, false prophets.

Is not the Lord among us?--namely in the temple ([Isa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md); [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md), [Jer
7:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008).md).

[Micah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 3:12</span></span>

[Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md) quotes this verse. The
Talmud and MAIMONIDES record that at the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans under Titus, Terentius Rufus, who was left in command of the
army, with a ploughshare tore up the foundations of the temple.

mountain of the house--the height on which the temple stands.

as the high places of the forest--shall become as heights in a forest
overrun with wild shrubs and brushwood.
