### [Philippians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 1:1</span></span>

INSCRIPTION. THANKSGIVING AND PRAYERS FOR THE FLOURISHING SPIRITUAL
STATE OF THE PHILIPPIANS. HIS OWN STATE AT ROME, AND THE RESULT OF HIS
IMPRISONMENT IN SPREADING THE GOSPEL. EXHORTATION TO CHRISTIAN
CONSISTENCY. (Phi. 1:1-30)

Timotheus--mentioned as being well known to the Philippians ([Act
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md), [Act
16:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010).md), and now present with Paul.
Not that Timothy had any share in writing the Epistle; for Paul
presently uses the first person singular, "I," not "we" ([Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003).md). The mention of his name implies
merely that Timothy joined in affectionate remembrances to them.

servants of Jesus Christ--The oldest manuscripts read the order, "Christ
Jesus." Paul does not call himself "an apostle," as in the inscriptions
of other Epistles; for the Philippians needed not to be reminded of his
apostolic authority. He writes rather in a tone of affectionate
familiarity.

all--so [Phi 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md), [Phi
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md), [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md); [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md), [Phi
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md). It implies comprehensive
affection which desired not to forget any one among them "all."

bishops--synonymous with "presbyters" in the apostolical churches; as
appears from the same persons being called "elders of the Church" at
Ephesus ([Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017).md), and "overseers"
([Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md), Greek, "bishops." And
[Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md), compare with [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md). This is the earliest letter of
Paul where bishops and deacons are mentioned, and the only one where
they are separately addressed in the salutation. This accords with the
probable course of events, deduced alike from the letters and history.
While the apostles were constantly visiting the churches in person or by
messengers, regular pastors would be less needed; but when some were
removed by various causes, provision for the permanent order of the
churches would be needed. Hence the three pastoral letters, subsequent
to this Epistle, give instruction as to the due appointment of bishops
and deacons. It agrees with this new want of the Church, when other
apostles were dead or far away, and Paul long in prison, that bishops
and deacons should be prominent for the first time in the opening
salutation. The Spirit thus intimated that the churches were to look up
to their own pastors, now that the miraculous gifts were passing into
God's ordinary providence, and the presence of the inspired apostles,
the dispensers of those gifts, was to be withdrawn \[PALEY, "HorÃ&brvbr;
PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. "Presbyter," implied the rank; "bishop," the duties of
the office \[NEANDER\]. Naturally, when the apostles who had the chief
supervision were no more, one among the presbyters presided and received
the name "bishop," in the more restricted and modern sense; just as in
the Jewish synagogue one of the elders presided as "ruler of the
synagogue." Observe, the apostle addresses the Church (that is, the
congregation) more directly than its presiding ministers ([Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md); [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md); [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024.md); [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011).md). The bishops managed more the
internal, the deacons the external, affairs of the Church. The plural
number shows there was more than one bishop or presbyter, and more than
one deacon in the Church at Philippi.

[Philippians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 1:2</span></span>

Grace . . . peace--The very form of this salutation implies the union of
Jew, Greek, and Roman. The Greek salutation was "joy" (chairein), akin
to the Greek for "grace" (charis). The Roman was "health," the
intermediate term between grace and peace. The Hebrew was "peace,"
including both temporal and spiritual prosperity. Grace must come first
if we are to have true peace.

from . . . from--Omit the second "from": as in the Greek, "God our
Father" and "the Lord Jesus Christ," are most closely connected.

[Philippians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 1:3</span></span>

Translate, "In all my remembrance of you."

[Philippians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 1:4</span></span>

making request--Translate, "making my request."

for you all--The frequent repetition in this Epistle of "all" with
"you," marks that Paul desires to declare his love for all alike, and
will not recognize any divisions among them.

with joy--the characteristic feature in this Epistle, as love is in that
to the Ephesians (compare [Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md);
[Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md), [Phi
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), [Phi
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028.md); [Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md), [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004).md). Love and joy are the two
first-fruits of the Spirit. Joy gives especial animation to prayers. It
marked his high opinion of them, that there was almost everything in
them to give him joy, and almost nothing to give him pain.

[Philippians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 1:5</span></span>

Ground of his "thanking God" ([Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003)): "For your (continued.md) fellowship
(that is, real spiritual participation) in (literally, 'in regard to')
the Gospel from the first day (of your becoming partakers in it) until
now." Believers have the fellowship of the Son of God ([Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009).md) and of the Father ([Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003).md) in the Gospel, by becoming
partakers of "the fellowship of the Holy Ghost" ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014).md), and exercise that fellowship
by acts of communion, not only the communion of the Lord's Supper, but
holy liberality to brethren and ministers ([Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md), [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md), "communicated . . . concerning
giving"; [Co2 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006.md); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016), "To communicate forget not".md).

[Philippians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 1:6</span></span>

confident--This confidence nerves prayers and thanksgivings ([Phi
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003).md).

this very thing--the very thing which he prays for ([Phi
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004).md) is the matter of his believing
confidence ([Mar 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024.md); [Jo1
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014).md). Hence the result is sure.

he which hath begun--God ([Phi 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013).md).

a good work--Any work that God begins, He will surely finish ([Sa1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012).md). Not even men begin a work at
random. Much more the fact of His beginning the work is a pledge of its
completion ([Isa 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012).md). So as to the
particular work here meant, the perfecting of their fellowship in the
Gospel ([Phi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md); [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024.md); [Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md); [Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md); [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md), [Rom
8:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md); [Rom
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md) [Heb
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024).md). As God cast not off Israel for
ever, though chastening them for a time, so He will not cast off the
spiritual Israel ([Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md); [Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md); [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).md).

perform it until--"perfect it up to" \[ALFORD, ELLICOTT, and others\].

the day of . . . Christ-- ([Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010).md).
The Lord's coming, designed by God in every age of the Church to be
regarded as near, is to be the goal set before believers' minds rather
than their own death.

[Philippians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 1:7</span></span>

meet--Greek, "just."

to think this--to have the prayerful confidence I expressed ([Phi
1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004).md).

of you--literally, "in behalf of you." Paul's confident prayer in their
behalf was that God would perfect His own good work of grace in them.

because, &c.--Punctuate and translate, "Because I have you in my heart
(so [Phi 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md); otherwise the Greek and
the words immediately following in the verse, favor the Margin, 'Ye have
me in your heart . . . being partakers of my grace') (both, in my bonds,
and in my defense and confirmation of the Gospel), you (I say) all being
fellow partakers of my grace." This last clause thus assigns the reason
why he has them in his heart (that is, cherished in his love, [Co2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002.md); [Co2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003).md), even in his bonds, and in his
defense and confirmation of the Gospel (such as he was constantly making
in private, [Act 28:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017.md); his
self-defense and confirmation of the Gospel being necessarily conjoined,
as the Greek implies; compare [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017).md), namely, "inasmuch as ye are
fellow partakers of my grace": inasmuch as ye share with me in "the
fellowship of the Gospel" ([Phi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005).md),
and have manifested this, both by suffering as I do for the Gospel's
sake ([Phi 1:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028).md), and by imparting
to me of your substance ([Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015).md).
It is natural and right for me thus confidently to pray in your behalf.
(ELLICOTT, and others translate, "To be thus minded for you all"),
because of my having you in my warmest remembrances even in my bonds,
since you are sharers with me in the Gospel grace. Bonds do not bind
love.

[Philippians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 1:8</span></span>

Confirmation of [Phi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md).

record--that is, witness.

in the bowels of Jesus Christ--"Christ Jesus" is the order in the oldest
manuscripts. My yearning love (so the Greek implies) to you is not
merely from natural affection, but from devotedness to Christ Jesus.
"Not Paul, but Jesus Christ lives in Paul; wherefore Paul is not moved
in the bowels (that is, the tender love, [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md) of Paul, but of Jesus Christ"
\[BENGEL\]. All real spiritual love is but a portion of Christ's love
which yearns in all who are united to Him \[ALFORD\].

[Philippians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 1:9</span></span>

The subject of his prayer for them ([Phi
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004).md).

your love--to Christ, producing love not only to Paul, Christ's
minister, as it did, but also to one another, which it did not
altogether as much as it ought ([Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md); [Phi
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002).md).

knowledge--of doctrinal and practical truth.

judgment--rather, "perception"; "perceptive sense." Spiritual
perceptiveness: spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, spiritual feeling,
spiritual taste. Christianity is a vigorous plant, not the hotbed growth
of enthusiasm. "Knowledge" and "perception" guard love from being
ill-judged.

[Philippians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 1:10</span></span>

Literally, "With a view to your proving (and so approving and embracing)
the things that excel" ([Rom 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018).md);
not merely things not bad, but the things best among those that are
good; the things of more advanced excellence. Ask as to things, not
merely, Is there no harm, but is there any good, and which is the best?

sincere--from a Greek root. Examined in the sunlight and found pure.

without offence--not stumbling; running the Christian race without
falling through any stumbling-block, that is, temptation, in your way.

till--rather, "unto," "against"; so that when the day of Christ comes,
ye may be found pure and without offense.

[Philippians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 1:11</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read the singular, "fruit." So [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md) (see on [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022).md); regarding the works of
righteousness, however manifold, as one harmonious whole, "the fruit of
the Spirit" ([Eph 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009).md) [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md), "the fruit of righteousness"
([Heb 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011).md); [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md), "fruit unto holiness."

which are--"which is by (Greek, 'through') Jesus Christ." Through His
sending to us the Spirit from the Father. "We are wild and useless olive
trees till we are grafted into Christ, who, by His living root, makes us
fruit-bearing branches" \[CALVIN\].

[Philippians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 1:12</span></span>

understand--Greek, "know." The Philippians probably had feared that his
imprisonment would hinder the spread of the Gospel; he therefore removes
this fear.

the things which happened unto me--Greek, "the things concerning me."

rather--so far is my imprisonment from hindering the Gospel. Faith takes
in a favorable light even what seems adverse \[BENGEL\] ([Phi
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019.md), [Phi
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md); [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md).

[Philippians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 1:13</span></span>

my bonds in Christ--rather as Greek, "So that my bonds have become
manifest in Christ," that is, known, as endured in Christ's cause.

palace--literally, "PrÃ&brvbr;torium," that is, the barrack of the
PrÃ&brvbr;torian guards attached to the palace of Nero, on the Palatine
hill at Rome; not the general PrÃ&brvbr;torian camp outside of the city;
for this was not connected with "CÃ&brvbr;sar's household," which [Phi
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md) shows the PrÃ&brvbr;torium here
meant was. The emperor was "PrÃ&brvbr;tor," or Commander-in-Chief;
naturally then the barrack of his bodyguard was called the
PrÃ&brvbr;torium. Paul seems now not to have been at large in his own
hired house, though chained to a soldier, as in [Act
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016.md), [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md), [Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md), but in strict custody in the
PrÃ&brvbr;torium; a change which probably took place on Tigellinus
becoming PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect. See Introduction.

in all other places--so CHRYSOSTOM. Or else, "TO all the rest," that is,
"manifest to all the other" PrÃ&brvbr;torian soldiers stationed
elsewhere, through the instrumentality of the PrÃ&brvbr;torian household
guards who might for the time be attached to the emperor's palace, and
who relieved one another in succession. Paul had been now upwards of two
years a prisoner, so that there was time for his cause and the Gospel
having become widely known at Rome.

[Philippians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 1:14</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "And that ([Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013).md) most of the brethren in the
Lord," &c. "In the Lord," distinguishes them from "brethren after the
flesh," Jewish fellow countrymen. ELLICOTT translates, "Trusting in the
Lord."

by my bonds--encouraged by my patience in bearing my bonds.

much more bold--Translate as Greek, "are more abundantly bold."

[Philippians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 1:15</span></span>

"Some indeed are preaching Christ even for envy, that is, to carry out
the envy which they felt towards Paul, on account of the success of the
Gospel in the capital of the world, owing to his steadfastness in his
imprisonment; they wished through envy to transfer the credit of its
progress from him to themselves. Probably Judaizing teachers (Rom.
14:1-23; [Co1 3:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md), &c.; [Co2
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001).md).

some also of--rather, "for"

good will--answering to "the brethren" ([Phi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014).md); some being well disposed to
him.

[Philippians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 1:16</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts transpose these verses, and read, "These (last)
indeed out of love (to Christ and me), knowing (the opposite of
'thinking' below) that I am set (that is, appointed by God, [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003).md) for the defense of the Gospel
([Phi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007), not on my own account.md). But
the others out of contention (or rather, 'a factious spirit'; 'cabal'; a
spirit of intrigue, using unscrupulous means to compass their end;
'self-seeking' \[ALFORD\]) proclaim (the Greek is not the same as that
for 'preach,' but, 'announce') Christ, not sincerely (answering to 'but
of a spirit of intrigue,' or 'self-seeking'). Literally, 'not purely';
not with a pure intention; the Jewish leaven they tried to introduce was
in order to glorify themselves ([Gal
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md); however, see on [Phi
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018)), thinking (but in vain.md) to raise
up (so the oldest manuscripts read) tribulation to my bonds." Their
thought was, that taking the opportunity of my being laid aside, they
would exalt themselves by their Judaizing preaching, and depreciate me
and my preaching, and so cause me trouble of spirit in my bonds; they
thought that I, like themselves, sought my own glory, and so would be
mortified at their success over mine. But they are utterly mistaken; "I
rejoice" at it ([Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018).md), so far am
I from being troubled at it.

[Philippians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 1:18</span></span>

What follows from this? Does this trouble me as they thought it would?
"Notwithstanding" their unkind thought to me, and self-seeking
intention, the cause I have at heart is furthered "every way" of
preaching, "whether in pretense (with a by motive, [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016).md) or in truth (out of true 'love'
to Christ, [Phi 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017).md), Christ is
proclaimed; and therein I do rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice." From
this it would seem that these self-seeking teachers in the main
"proclaimed Christ," not "another Gospel," such as the Judaizers in
Galatia taught ([Gal 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).md); though
probably having some of the Jewish leaven (see on [Phi
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015).md), their chief error was their
self-seeking envious motive, not so much error of doctrine; had there
been vital error, Paul would not have rejoiced. The proclamation of
CHRIST," however done, roused attention, and so was sure to be of
service. Paul could thus rejoice at the good result of their bad
intentions ([Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md); [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007).md).

[Philippians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 1:19</span></span>

turn to my salvation--"turn out to me for, (or unto) salvation." This
proclamation of Christ every way will turn out to my spiritual good.
Christ, whose interests are my interests, being glorified thereby; and
so the coming of His kingdom being furthered, which, when it does come,
will bring completed "SALVATION" ([Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md) to me and all whose "earnest
expectation" ([Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md) is that
Christ may be magnified in them. So far is their preaching from causing
me, as they thought, tribulation in my bonds ([Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016).md). Paul plainly quotes and applies
to himself the very words of the Septuagint ([Job
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016).md), "This shall turn out to my
salvation," which belong to all God's people of every age, in their
tribulation (compare [Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015).md).

through your prayer and the supply--The Greek intimately joins the two
nouns together, by having but one preposition and one article: "Through
your prayer and (the consequent) supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
(obtained for me through your prayer)."

[Philippians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 1:20</span></span>

According to my earnest expectation--The Greek expresses, "expectation
with uplifted head ([Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md) and
outstretched neck." [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md) is the
only other place in the New Testament that the word occurs. TITTMANN
says, in both places it implies not mere expectation, but the anxious
desire of an anticipated prosperous issue in afflictive circumstances.
The subject of his earnest expectation which follows, answers to "my
salvation" ([Phi 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019).md).

in nothing I shall be ashamed--in nothing have reason to be ashamed of
"my work for God, or His work in me" \[ALFORD\]. Or, "in nothing be
disappointed in my hope, but that I may fully obtain it" \[ESTIUS\]. So
"ashamed" is used in [Rom 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md).

all boldness--"all" is opposed to "in nothing," as "boldness" is the
opposite to "ashamed."

so now also--when "my body" is "in bonds" ([Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017).md).

Christ--not Paul, "shall be magnified."

life, or by death--Whatever be the issue, I cannot lose; I must be the
gainer by the event. Paul was not omniscient; in the issue of things
pertaining to themselves, the apostles underwent the same probation of
faith and patience as we.

[Philippians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 1:21</span></span>

For--in either event ([Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md) I
must be the gainer, "For to me," &c.

to live is Christ--whatever life, time, and strength, I have, is
Christ's; Christ is the sole object for which I live ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md).

to die is gain--not the act of dying, but as the Greek ("to have died")
expresses, the state after death. Besides the glorification of Christ by
my death, which is my primary object ([Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md), the change of state caused by
death, so far from being a matter of shame ([Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md) or loss, as my enemies suppose,
will be a positive "gain" to me.

[Philippians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 1:22</span></span>

Rather as Greek, "But if to live in the flesh (if), this (I say, the
continuance in life which I am undervaluing) be the fruit of my labor
(that is, be the condition in which the fruit of my ministerial labor is
involved), then what I shall choose I know not (I cannot determine with
myself, if the choice were given me, both alternatives being great goods
alike)." So ALFORD and ELLICOTT. BENGEL takes it as English Version,
which the Greek will bear by supposing an ellipsis, "If to live in the
flesh (be my portion), this (continuing to live) is the fruit of my
labor," that is, this continuance in life will be the occasion of my
bringing in "the fruit of labor," that is, will be the occasion of
"labors" which are their own "fruit" or reward; or, this my continuing
"to live" will have this "fruit," namely, "labors" for Christ. GROTIUS
explains "the fruit of labor" as an idiom for "worthwhile"; If I live in
the flesh, this is worth my while, for thus Christ's interest will be
advanced, "For to me to live is Christ" ([Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md); compare [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030.md); [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013).md). The second alternative, namely,
dying, is taken up and handled, [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md), "If I be offered."

[Philippians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 1:23</span></span>

For--The oldest manuscripts read, "But." "I know not ([Phi
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022).md), BUT am in a strait (am
perplexed) betwixt the two (namely, 'to live' and 'to die'), having the
desire for departing (literally, 'to loose anchor,' [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006).md) and being with Christ; FOR (so
the oldest manuscripts) it is by far better"; or as the Greek, more
forcibly, "by far the more preferable"; a double comparative. This
refutes the notion of the soul being dormant during its separation from
the body. It also shows that, while he regarded the Lord's advent as at
all times near, yet that his death before it was a very possible
contingency. The partial life eternal is in the interval between death
and Christ's second advent; the perfectional, at that advent \[BISHOP
PEARSON\]. To depart is better than to remain in the flesh; to be with
Christ is far, far better; a New Testament hope ([Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024).md), \[BENGEL\].

[Philippians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">phi 1:24</span></span>

to abide--to continue somewhat longer.

for you--Greek, "on your account"; "for your sake." In order to be of
service to you, I am willing to forego my entrance a little sooner into
blessedness; heaven will not fail to be mine at last.

[Philippians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 1:25</span></span>

Translate, "And being confident of this."

I know, &c.--by prophetical intimations of the Spirit. He did not yet
know the issue, as far as human appearances were concerned ([Phi
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023).md). He doubtless returned from his
first captivity to Philippi ([Heb
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019.md); [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022).md).

joy of faith--Greek, "joy in your faith."

[Philippians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 1:26</span></span>

Translate, "That your matter of glorying (or rejoicing) may abound in
Christ Jesus in me (that is, in my case; in respect to me, or for me who
have been granted to your prayers, [Phi
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019).md) through my presence again among
you." ALFORD makes the "matter of glorying," the possession of the
Gospel, received from Paul, which would abound, be assured and
increased, by his presence among them; thus, "in me," implies that Paul
is the worker of the material of abounding in Christ Jesus. But "my
rejoicing over you" ([Phi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016).md),
answers plainly to "your rejoicing in respect to me" here.

[Philippians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 1:27</span></span>

Only--Whatever happens as to my coming to you, or not, make this your
one only care. By supposing this or that future contingency, many
persuade themselves they will be such as they ought to be, but it is
better always without evasion to perform present duties under present
circumstances \[BENGEL\].

let your conversation be--(Compare [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). The Greek implies, "Let your
walk as citizens (namely, of the heavenly state; 'the city of the living
God,' [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md), 'the heavenly
Jerusalem,' 'fellow citizens of the saints,' [Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).md) be," &c.

I . . . see . . . hear--so [Phi 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md).
"Hear," in order to include both alternatives, must include the meaning
know.

your affairs--your state.

in one spirit--the fruit of partaking of the Holy Spirit ([Eph
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003).md).

with one mind--rather as Greek, "soul," the sphere of the affections;
subordinate to the "Spirit," man's higher and heavenly nature. "There is
sometimes natural antipathies among believers; but these are overcome,
when there is not only unity of spirit, but also of soul" \[BENGEL\].

striving together--with united effort.

[Philippians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">phi 1:28</span></span>

terrified--literally, said of horses or other animals startled or
suddenly scared; so of sudden consternation in general.

which--your not being terrified.

evident token of perdition--if they would only perceive it ([Th2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005).md). It attests this, that in
contending hopelessly against you, they are only rushing on to their own
perdition, not shaking your united faith and constancy.

to you of salvation--The oldest manuscripts read, "of your salvation";
not merely your temporal safety.

[Philippians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 1:29</span></span>

For--rather, a proof that this is an evident token from God of your
salvation, "Because," &c.

it is given--Greek, "it has been granted as a favor," or "gift of
grace." Faith is the gift of God ([Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md), not wrought in the soul by the
will of man, but by the Holy Ghost ([Joh
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).md).

believe on him--"To believe Him," would merely mean to believe He speaks
the truth. "To believe on Him," is to believe in, and trust through, Him
to obtain eternal salvation. Suffering for Christ is not only not a mark
of God's anger, but a gift of His grace.

[Philippians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 1:30</span></span>

ye saw in me-- ([Act 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md), [Act
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md), &c.; [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002).md). I am "in nothing terrified by
mine adversaries" ([Phi 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029).md), so
ought not ye. The words here, "ye saw . . . and . . . hear," answer to
"I come and see you, or else . . . hear" ([Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md).
