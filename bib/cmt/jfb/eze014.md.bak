### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 14:1</span></span>

HYPOCRITICAL INQUIRERS ARE ANSWERED ACCORDING TO THEIR HYPOCRISY. THE
CALAMITIES COMING ON THE PEOPLE; BUT A REMNANT IS TO ESCAPE. (Eze.
14:1-23)

elders--persons holding that dignity among the exiles at the Chebar.
GROTIUS refers this to Seraiah and those sent with him from Judea ([Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md). The prophet's reply, first,
reflecting on the character of the inquirers, and, secondly, foretelling
the calamities coming on Judea, may furnish an idea of the subject of
their inquiry.

sat before me--not at once able to find a beginning of their speech;
indicative of anxiety and despondency.

[Ezekiel 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 14:3</span></span>

heart . . . face--The heart is first corrupted, and then the outward
manifestation of idol-worship follows; they set their idols before their
eyes. With all their pretense of consulting God now, they have not even
put away their idols outwardly; implying gross contempt of God. "Set
up," literally, "aloft"; implying that their idols had gained the
supreme ascendancy over them.

stumbling-block of . . . iniquity--See [Pro
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md), [Pro
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#023), "Let not them (God's laws.md)
depart from thine eyes, then . . . thy foot shall not stumble." Instead
of God's law, which (by being kept before their eyes) would have saved
them from stumbling, they set up their idols before their eyes, which
proved a stumbling-block, causing them to stumble ([Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019).md).

inquired of at all--literally, "should I with inquiry be inquired of" by
such hypocrites as they are? ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); [Pro
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029.md); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 14:4</span></span>

and cometh--and yet cometh, reigning himself to be a true worshipper of
Jehovah.

him that cometh--so the Hebrew Margin reads. But the Hebrew text reading
is, "according to it, according to the multitude of his idols"; the
anticipative clause with the pronoun not being pleonastic, but
increasing the emphasis of the following clause with the noun. "I will
answer," literally, reflexively, "I will Myself (or for Myself) answer
him."

according to . . . idols--thus, "answering a fool according to his
folly"; making the sinner's sin his punishment; retributive justice
([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Pro
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#005).md).

[Ezekiel 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 14:5</span></span>

That I may take--that is, unveil and overtake with punishment the
dissimulation and impiety of Israel hid in their own heart. Or, rather,
"That I may punish them by answering them after their own hearts";
corresponding to "according to the multitude of his idols" (see on [Eze
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004).md); an instance is given in [Eze
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009.md); [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md), God giving them up in wrath to
their own lie.

idols--though pretending to "inquire" of Me, "in their hearts" they are
"estranged from Me," and love "idols."

[Ezekiel 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 14:6</span></span>

Though God so threatened the people for their idolatry ([Eze
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#005).md), yet He would rather they should
avert the calamity by "repentance."

turn yourselves--CALVIN translates, "turn others" (namely, the stranger
proselytes in the land). As ye have been the advisers of others (see
[Eze 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007.md), "the stranger that
sojourneth in Israel") to idolatry, so bestow at least as much pains in
turning them to the truth; the surest proof of repentance. But the
parallelism to [Eze 14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md) favors
English Version. Their sin was twofold: (1) "In their heart" or inner
man; (2) "Put before their face," that is, exhibited outwardly. So their
repentance is generally expressed by "repent," and is then divided into:
(1) "Turn yourselves (inwardly) from your idols"; (2) "Turn away your
faces (outwardly) from all your abominations." It is not likely that an
exhortation to convert others should come between the two affecting
themselves.

[Ezekiel 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 14:7</span></span>

stranger--the proselyte, tolerated in Israel only on condition of
worshipping no God but Jehovah ([Lev
17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#008).md).

inquire of him concerning me--that is, concerning My will.

by myself--not by word, but by deed, that is, by judgments, marking My
hand and direct agency; instead of answering him through the prophet he
consults. FAIRBAIRN translates, as it is the same Hebrew as in the
previous clause, "concerning Me," it is natural that God should use the
same expression in His reply as was used in the consultation of Him. But
the sense, I think, is the same. The hypocrite inquires of the prophet
concerning God; and God, instead of replying through the prophet,
replies for Himself concerning Himself.

[Ezekiel 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 14:8</span></span>

And I will set my face against that man--(See on [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md).

and will make him a sign--literally, "I will destroy him so as to become
a sign"; it will be no ordinary destruction, but such as will make him
be an object pointed at with wonder by all, as Korah, &c. ([Num
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md); [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037).md).

[Ezekiel 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 14:9</span></span>

I the Lord have deceived that prophet--not directly, but through Satan
and his ministers; not merely permissively, but by overruling their evil
to serve the purposes of His righteous judgment, to be a touchstone to
separate the precious from the vile, and to "prove" His people ([Deu
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003.md); [Kg1
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#023.md); [Jer
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md); [Th2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011).md). Evil comes not from God,
though God overrules it to serve His will ([Job
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016.md); [Jam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003).md). This declaration of God is
intended to answer their objection, "Jeremiah and Ezekiel are but two
opposed to the many prophets who announce 'peace to us." "Nay, deceive
not yourselves, those prophets of yours are deluding you, and I permit
them to do so as a righteous judgment on your wilful blindness."

[Ezekiel 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 14:10</span></span>

As they dealt deceitfully with God by seeking answers of peace without
repentance, so God would let them be dealt with deceitfully by the
prophets whom they consulted. God would chastise their sin with a
corresponding sin; as they rejected the safe directions of the true
light, He would send the pernicious delusions of a false one; prophets
would be given them who should re-echo the deceitfulness that already
wrought in their own bosom, to their ruin \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The people had
themselves alone to blame, for they were long ago forewarned how to
discern and to treat a false prophet ([Deu
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003).md); the very existence of such
deceivers among them was a sign of God's judicial displeasure (compare
in Saul's case, [Sa1 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md); [Sa1
28:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006).md). They and the prophet, being
dupes of a common delusion, should be involved in a common ruin.

[Ezekiel 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 14:11</span></span>

Love was the spring of God's very judgments on His people, who were
incurable by any other process ([Eze
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027).md).

[Ezekiel 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 14:12</span></span>

The second part of the chapter: the effect which the presence of a few
righteous persons was to have on the purposes of God (compare [Gen
18:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#024).md). God had told Jeremiah that
the guilt of Judah was too great to be pardoned even for the
intercession of Moses and Samuel ([Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md); [Jer
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002.md); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001).md), which had prevailed formerly
([Exo 32:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md); [Num
14:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md); [Sa1
7:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008).md), implying the extraordinary
heinousness of their guilt, since in ordinary cases "the effectual
fervent prayer of a righteous man (for others) availeth much" ([Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).md). Ezekiel supplements Jeremiah by
adding that not only those two once successful intercessors, but not
even the three pre-eminently righteous men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, could
stay God's judgments by their righteousness.

[Ezekiel 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 14:13</span></span>

staff of . . . bread--on which man's existence is supported as on a
staff ([Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md); [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md); [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md); [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md). I will send a famine.

[Ezekiel 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 14:14</span></span>

Noah, Daniel . . . Job--specified in particular as having been saved
from overwhelming calamities for their personal righteousness. Noah had
the members of his family alone given to him, amidst the general wreck.
Daniel saved from the fury of the king of Babylon the three youths ([Dan
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#017.md), [Dan
2:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048).md). Though his prophecies mostly
were later than those of Ezekiel, his fame for piety and wisdom was
already established, and the events recorded in Dan. 1:1-2:49 had
transpired. The Jews would naturally, in their fallen condition, pride
themselves on one who reflected such glory on his nation at the heathen
capital, and would build vain hopes (here set aside) on his influence in
averting ruin from them. Thus the objection to the authenticity of
Daniel from this passage vanishes. "Job" forms the climax (and is
therefore put out of chronological order), having not even been left a
son or a daughter, and having had himself to pass through an ordeal of
suffering before his final deliverance, and therefore forming the most
simple instance of the righteousness of God, which would save the
righteous themselves alone in the nation, and that after an ordeal of
suffering, but not spare even a son or daughter for their sake ([Eze
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#016.md), [Eze
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#018.md), [Eze
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020.md); compare [Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md); [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md); [Jer
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011).md).

deliver . . . souls by . . . righteousness-- ([Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004).md); not the righteousness of works,
but that of grace, a truth less clearly understood under the law ([Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 14:15</span></span>

The argument is cumulative. He first puts the case of the land sinning
so as to fall under the judgment of a famine ([Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013).md); then ([Eze
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015).md) "noisome beasts" ([Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022).md); then "the sword"; then, worst
of all, "pestilence." The three most righteous of men should deliver
only themselves in these several four cases. In [Eze
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md) he concentrates the whole in one
mass of condemnation. If Noah, Daniel, Job, could not deliver the land,
when deserving only one judgment, "how much more" when all four
judgments combined are justly to visit the land for sin, shall these
three righteous men not deliver it.

[Ezekiel 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 14:19</span></span>

in blood--not literally. In Hebrew, "blood" expresses every premature
kind of death.

[Ezekiel 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 14:21</span></span>

How much more--literally, "Surely shall it be so now, when I send," &c.
If none could avert the one only judgment incurred, surely now, when all
four are incurred by sin, much more impossible it will be to deliver the
land.

[Ezekiel 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 14:22</span></span>

Yet . . . a remnant--not of righteous persons, but some of the guilty
who should "come forth" from the destruction of Jerusalem to Babylon, to
lead a life of hopeless exile there. The reference here is to judgment,
not mercy, as [Eze 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023.md) shows.

ye shall see their . . . doings; and . . . be comforted--Ye, the exiles
at the Chebar, who now murmur at God's judgment about to be inflicted on
Jerusalem as harsh, when ye shall see the wicked "ways" and character of
the escaped remnant, shall acknowledge that both Jerusalem and its
inhabitants deserved their fate; his recognition of the righteousness of
the judgment will reconcile you to it, and so ye shall be "comforted"
under it \[CALVIN\]. Then would follow mercy to the elect remnant,
though that is not referred to here, but in [Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md).

[Ezekiel 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 14:23</span></span>

they shall comfort you--not in words, but by your recognizing in their
manifest guilt, that God had not been unjustly severe to them and the
city.

This chapter represents, in the way of a brief introduction, what the
sixteenth chapter details minutely.
