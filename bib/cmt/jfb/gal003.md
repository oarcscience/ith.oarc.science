### [Galatians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)

[Galatians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 3:1</span></span>

REPROOF OF THE GALATIANS FOR ABANDONING FAITH FOR LEGALISM.
JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH VINDICATED: THE LAW SHOWN TO BE SUBSEQUENT TO THE
PROMISE: BELIEVERS ARE THE SPIRITUAL SEED OF ABRAHAM, WHO WAS JUSTIFIED
BY FAITH. THE LAW WAS OUR SCHOOLMASTER TO BRING US TO CHRIST, THAT WE
MIGHT BECOME CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH. (Gal. 3:1-29)

that ye should not obey the truth--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

bewitched--fascinated you so that you have lost your wits. THEMISTIUS
says the Galatians were naturally very acute in intellect. Hence, Paul
wonders they could be so misled in this case.

you--emphatical. "You, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
graphically set forth (literally, in writing, namely, by vivid
portraiture in preaching) among you, crucified" (so the sense and Greek
order require rather than English Version). As Christ was "crucified,"
so ye ought to have been by faith "crucified with Christ," and so "dead
to the law" ([Gal 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019).md). Reference
to the "eyes" is appropriate, as fascination was supposed to be
exercised through the eyes. The sight of Christ crucified ought to have
been enough to counteract all fascination.

[Galatians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 3:2</span></span>

"Was it by the works of the law that ye received the Spirit (manifested
by outward miracles, [Gal 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md); [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md); and by spiritual graces, [Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md); [Gal
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md), or by the hearing of faith?"
The "only" implies, "I desire, omitting other arguments, to rest the
question on this alone"; I who was your teacher, desire now to "learn"
this one thing from you. The epithet "Holy" is not prefixed to "Spirit"
because that epithet is a joyous one, whereas this Epistle is stern and
reproving \[BENGEL\].

hearing of faith--Faith consists not in working, but in receiving ([Rom
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md).

[Galatians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 3:3</span></span>

begun--the Christian life ([Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

in the Spirit--Not merely was Christ crucified "graphically set forth"
in my preaching, but also "the Spirit" confirmed the word preached, by
imparting His spiritual gifts. "Having thus begun" with the receiving
His spiritual gifts, "are ye now being made perfect" (so the Greek),
that is, are ye seeking to be made perfect with "fleshly" ordinances of
the law? \[ESTIUS\]. Compare [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). Having begun in the Spirit, that
is, the Holy Spirit ruling your spiritual life as its "essence and
active principle" \[ELLICOTT\], in contrast to "the flesh," the element
in which the law works \[ALFORD\]. Having begun your Christianity in the
Spirit, that is, in the divine life that proceeds from faith, are ye
seeking after something higher still (the perfecting of your
Christianity) in the sensuous and the earthly, which cannot possibly
elevate the inner life of the Spirit, namely, outward ceremonies?
\[NEANDER\]. No doubt the Galatians thought that they were going more
deeply into the Spirit; for the flesh may be easily mistaken for the
Spirit, even by those who have made progress, unless they continue to
maintain a pure faith \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 3:4</span></span>

Have ye suffered so many things--namely, persecution from Jews and from
unbelieving fellow countrymen, incited by the Jews, at the time of your
conversion.

in vain--fruitlessly, needlessly, since ye might have avoided them by
professing Judaism \[GROTIUS\]. Or, shall ye, by falling from grace,
lose the reward promised for all your sufferings, so that they shall be
"in vain" ([Gal 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011.md); [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002.md), [Co1
15:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017.md), [Co1
15:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029.md); [Th2
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md); [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008).md)?

yet--rather, "If it be really (or 'indeed') in vain" \[ELLICOTT\]. "If,
as it must be, what I have said, 'in vain,' is really the fact"
\[ALFORD\]. I prefer understanding it as a mitigation of the preceding
words. I hope better things of you, for I trust you will return from
legalism to grace; if so, as I confidently expect, you will not have
"suffered so many things in vain" \[ESTIUS\]. For "God has given you the
Spirit and has wrought mighty works among you" ([Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md); [Heb
10:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032).md) \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 3:5</span></span>

He . . . that ministereth--or "supplieth," God ([Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010).md). He who supplied and supplies to
you the Spirit still, to the present time. These miracles do not prove
grace to be in the heart ([Mar
9:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038).md). He speaks of these miracles
as a matter of unquestioned notoriety among those addressed; an
undesigned proof of their genuineness (compare 1Co. 12:1-31).

worketh miracles among you--rather, "IN you," as [Gal
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#008.md); [Mat
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#002.md); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md); at your conversion and since
\[ALFORD\].

doeth he it by the works of the law--that is, as a consequence resulting
from (so the Greek) the works of the law (compare [Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002).md). This cannot be because the law
was then unknown to you when you received those gifts of the Spirit.

[Galatians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 3:6</span></span>

The answer to the question in [Gal 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md)
is here taken for granted, It was by the hearing of faith: following
this up, he says, "Even as Abraham believed," &c. ([Gen
15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#004.md); [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003).md). God supplies unto you the Spirit
as the result of faith, not works, just as Abraham obtained
justification by faith, not by works ([Gal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md), [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md); [Gal
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md), [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md), [Gal
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028).md). Where justification is, there
the Spirit is, so that if the former comes by faith, the latter must
also.

[Galatians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 3:7</span></span>

they which are of faith--as the source and starting-point of their
spiritual life. The same phrase is in the Greek of [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md).

the same--these, and these alone, to the exclusion of all the other
descendants of Abraham.

children--Greek, "sons" ([Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029).md).

[Galatians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 3:8</span></span>

And--Greek, "Moreover."

foreseeing--One great excellency of Scripture is, that in it all points
liable ever to be controverted, are, with prescient wisdom, decided in
the most appropriate language.

would justify--rather, "justifieth." Present indicative. It is now, and
at all times, God's one way of justification.

the heathen--rather, "the Gentiles"; or "the nations," as the same Greek
is translated at the end of the verse. God justifieth the Jews, too, "by
faith, not by works." But he specifies the Gentiles in particular here,
as it was their case that was in question, the Galatians being Gentiles.

preached before the gospel--"announced beforehand the Gospel." For the
"promise" was substantially the Gospel by anticipation. Compare [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md); [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). A proof that "the old fathers did
not look only for transitory promises" \[Article VII, Church of
England\]. Thus the Gospel, in its essential germ, is older than the law
though the full development of the former is subsequent to the latter.

In thee--not "in thy seed," which is a point not here raised; but
strictly "in thee," as followers of thy faith, it having first shown the
way to justification before God \[ALFORD\]; or "in thee," as Father of
the promised seed, namely, Christ ([Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md), who is the Object of faith
([Gen 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md); [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md), and imitating thy faith (see
on [Gal 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009).md).

all nations--or as above, "all the Gentiles" ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md); [Gen
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md); [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018).md).

be blessed--an act of grace, not something earned by works. The blessing
of justification was to Abraham by faith in the promise, not by works.
So to those who follow Abraham, the father of the faithful, the
blessing, that is, justification, comes purely by faith in Him who is
the subject of the promise.

[Galatians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 3:9</span></span>

they--and they alone.

of faith--(See on [Gal 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md),
beginning).

with--together with.

faithful--implying what it is in which they are "blessed together with
him," namely, faith, the prominent feature of his character, and of
which the result to all who like him have it, is justification.

[Galatians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 3:10</span></span>

Confirmation of [Gal 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md). They who
depend on the works of the law cannot share the blessing, for they are
under the curse "written," [Deu 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md),
Septuagint. PERFECT obedience is required by the words, "in all things."
CONTINUAL obedience by the word, "continueth." No man renders this
obedience (compare [Rom 3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md). It
is observable, Paul quotes Scripture to the Jews who were conversant
with it, as in Epistle to the Hebrews, as said or spoken; but to the
Gentiles, as written. So Matthew, writing for Jews, quotes it as "said,"
or "spoken"; Mark and Luke, writing for Gentiles, as "written" ([Mat
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md); [Mar
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md); [Luk
2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022).md) \[TOWNSON\].

[Galatians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 3:11</span></span>

by the law--Greek, "IN the law." Both in and by are included. The
syllogism in this verse and [Gal 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md),
is, according to Scripture, "The just shall live by faith." But the law
is not of faith, but of doing, or works (that is, does not make faith,
but works, the conditional ground of justifying). Therefore "in," or "by
the law, no man is justified before God" (whatever the case may be
before men, [Rom 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002).md) --not even if he
could, which he cannot, keep the law, because the Scripture element and
conditional mean of justification is faith.

The just shall live by faith-- ([Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004).md). Not as BENGEL and ALFORD, "He
who is just by faith shall live." The Greek supports English Version.
Also the contrast is between "live by faith" (namely, as the ground and
source of his justification), and "live in them," namely, in his doings
or works ([Gal 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012).md), as the
conditional element wherein he is justified.

[Galatians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 3:12</span></span>

doeth--Many depended on the law although they did not keep it; but
without doing, saith Paul, it is of no use to them ([Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md), [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), [Rom
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md); [Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005).md).

[Galatians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 3:13</span></span>

Abrupt exclamation, as he breaks away impatiently from those who would
involve us again in the curse of the law, by seeking justification in
it, to "Christ," who "has redeemed us from its curse." The "us" refers
primarily to the Jews, to whom the law principally appertained, in
contrast to "the Gentiles" ([Gal 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md);
compare [Gal 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003).md). But it is not
restricted solely to the Jews, as ALFORD thinks; for these are the
representative people of the world at large, and their "law" is the
embodiment of what God requires of the whole world. The curse of its
non-fulfilment affects the Gentiles through the Jews; for the law
represents that righteousness which God requires of all, and which,
since the Jews failed to fulfil, the Gentiles are equally unable to
fulfil. [Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md), "As many as are of
the works of the law, are under the curse," refers plainly, not to the
Jews only, but to all, even Gentiles (as the Galatians), who seek
justification by the law. The Jews' law represents the universal law
which condemned the Gentiles, though with less clear consciousness on
their part (Rom. 2:1-29). The revelation of God's "wrath" by the law of
conscience, in some degree prepared the Gentiles for appreciating
redemption through Christ when revealed. The curse had to be removed
from off the heathen, too, as well as the Jews, in order that the
blessing, through Abraham, might flow to them. Accordingly, the "we," in
"that we might receive the promise of the Spirit," plainly refers to
both Jews and Gentiles.

redeemed us--bought us off from our former bondage ([Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005).md), and "from the curse" under which
all lie who trust to the law and the works of the law for justification.
The Gentile Galatians, by putting themselves under the law, were
involving themselves in the curse from which Christ has redeemed the
Jews primarily, and through them the Gentiles. The ransom price He paid
was His own precious blood ([Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); compare [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md); [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).md).

being made--Greek, "having become."

a curse for us--Having become what we were, in our behalf, "a curse,"
that we might cease to be a curse. Not merely accursed (in the
concrete), but a curse in the abstract, bearing the universal curse of
the whole human race. So [Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md),
"Sin for us," not sinful, but bearing the whole sin of our race,
regarded as one vast aggregate of sin. See Note there. "Anathema" means
"set apart to God," to His glory, but to the person's own destruction.
"Curse," an execration.

written-- ([Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023).md). Christ's
bearing the particular curse of hanging on the tree, is a sample of the
"general" curse which He representatively bore. Not that the Jews put to
death malefactors by hanging; but after having put them to death
otherwise, in order to brand them with peculiar ignominy, they hung the
bodies on a tree, and such malefactors were accursed by the law (compare
[Act 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039).md). God's providence ordered it so
that to fulfil the prophecy of the curse and other prophecies, Jesus
should be crucified, and so hang on the tree, though that death was not
a Jewish mode of execution. The Jews accordingly, in contempt, call Him
Tolvi, "the hanged one," and Christians, "worshippers of the hanged
one"; and make it their great objection that He died the accursed death
\[TRYPHO, in Justin Martyr, p. 249\] ([Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md). Hung between heaven and earth
as though unworthy of either!

[Galatians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 3:14</span></span>

The intent of "Christ becoming a curse for us"; "To the end that upon
the Gentiles the blessing of Abraham (that is, promised to Abraham,
namely, justification by faith) might come in Christ Jesus" (compare
[Gal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008).md).

that we might receive the promise of the Spirit--the promised Spirit
([Joe 2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049).md). This clause follows not the
clause immediately preceding (for our receiving the Spirit is not the
result of the blessing of Abraham coming on the Gentiles), but "Christ
hath redeemed us," &c.

through faith--not by works. Here he resumes the thought in [Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md). "The Spirit from without, kindles
within us some spark of faith Whereby we lay hold of Christ, and even of
the Spirit Himself, that He may dwell within us" \[FLACIUS\].

[Galatians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 3:15</span></span>

I speak after the manner of men--I take an illustration from a merely
human transaction of everyday occurrence.

but a man's covenant--whose purpose it is far less important to
maintain.

if it be confirmed--when once it hath been ratified.

no man disannulleth--"none setteth aside," not even the author himself,
much less any second party. None does so who acts in common equity. Much
less would the righteous God do so. The law is here, by personification,
regarded as a second person, distinct from, and subsequent to, the
promise of God. The promise is everlasting, and more peculiarly belongs
to God. The law is regarded as something extraneous, afterwards
introduced, exceptional and temporary ([Gal
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md), [Gal
3:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021).md).

addeth--None addeth new conditions "making" the covenant "of none
effect" ([Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md). So legal Judaism
could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and
man, already established by the promises to Abraham; it could not add as
a new condition the observance of the law, in which case the fulfilment
of the promise would be attached to a condition impossible for man to
perform. The "covenant" here is one of free grace, a promise afterwards
carried into effect in the Gospel.

[Galatians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 3:16</span></span>

This verse is parenthetical. The covenant of promise was not "spoken"
(so Greek for "made") to Abraham alone, but "to Abraham and his seed";
to the latter especially; and this means Christ (and that which is
inseparable from Him, the literal Israel, and the spiritual, His body,
the Church). Christ not having come when the law was given, the covenant
could not have been then fulfilled, but awaited the coming of Him, the
Seed, to whom it was spoken.

promises--plural, because the same promise was often repeated ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md), [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md), [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md); [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018).md), and because it involved many
things; earthly blessings to the literal children of Abraham in Canaan,
and spiritual and heavenly blessings to his spiritual children; but both
promised to Christ, "the Seed" and representative Head of the literal
and spiritual Israel alike. In the spiritual seed there is no
distinction of Jew or Greek; but to the literal seed, the promises still
in part remain to be fulfilled ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md). The covenant was not made with
"many" seeds (which if there had been, a pretext might exist for
supposing there was one seed before the law, another under the law; and
that those sprung from one seed, say the Jewish, are admitted on
different terms, and with a higher degree of acceptability, than those
sprung from the Gentile seed), but with the one seed; therefore, the
promise that in Him "all the families of the earth shall be blessed"
([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md), joins in this one Seed,
Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of
acceptability, namely, by grace through faith ([Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013).md); not to some by promise, to
others by the law, but to all alike, circumcised and uncircumcised,
constituting but one seed in Christ ([Rom
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016).md). The law, on the other hand,
contemplates the Jews and Gentiles as distinct seeds. God makes a
covenant, but it is one of promise; whereas the law is a covenant of
works. Whereas the law brings in a mediator, a third party ([Gal
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019).md), God makes His covenant of
promise with the one seed, Christ ([Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007).md), and embraces others only as
they are identified with, and represented by, Christ.

one . . . Christ--not in the exclusive sense, the man Christ Jesus, but
"Christ" (Jesus is not added, which would limit the meaning), including
His people who are part of Himself, the Second Adam, and Head of
redeemed humanity. [Gal 3:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md) prove
this, "Ye are all ONE in Christ Jesus" (Jesus is added here as the

continued . . . of God--"ratified by God" ([Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015).md).

in Christ--rather, "unto Christ" (compare [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md). However, Vulgate and the old
Italian versions translate as English Version. But the oldest
manuscripts omit the words altogether.

the law which was--Greek, "which came into existence four hundred thirty
years after" ([Exo 12:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040).md). He does
not, as in the case of "the covenant," add "enacted by God" ([Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017).md). The dispensation of "the
promise" began with the call of Abraham from Ur into Canaan, and ended
on the last night of his grandson Jacob's sojourn in Canaan, the land of
promise. The dispensation of the law, which engenders bondage, was
beginning to draw on from the time of his entrance into Egypt, the land
of bondage. It was to Christ in him, as in his grandfather Abraham, and
his father Isaac, not to him or them as persons, the promise was spoken.
On the day following the last repetition of the promise orally ([Gen
46:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001).md), at Beer-sheba, Israel passed
into Egypt. It is from the end, not from the beginning of the
dispensation of promise, that the interval of four hundred thirty years
between it and the law is to be counted. At Beer-sheba, after the
covenant with Abimelech, Abraham called on the everlasting God, and the
well was confirmed to him and his seed as an everlasting possession.
Here God appeared to Isaac. Here Jacob received the promise of the
blessing, for which God had called Abraham out of Ur, repeated for the
last time, on the last night of his sojourn in the land of promise.

cannot--Greek, "doth not disannul."

make . . . of none effect--The promise would become so, if the power of
conferring the inheritance be transferred from it to the law ([Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014).md).

[Galatians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 3:18</span></span>

the inheritance--all the blessings to be inherited by Abraham's literal
and spiritual children, according to the promise made to him and to his
Seed, Christ, justification and glorification ([Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009).md).

but God, &c.--The Greek order requires rather, "But to Abraham it was by
promise that God hath given it." The conclusion is, Therefore the
inheritance is not of, or from the law ([Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014).md).

"Wherefore then serveth the law?" as it is of no avail for
justification, is it either useless, or contrary to the covenant of God?
\[CALVIN\].

added--to the original covenant of promise. This is not inconsistent
with [Gal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md), "No man addeth
thereto"; for there the kind of addition meant, and therefore denied, is
one that would add new conditions, inconsistent with the grace of the
covenant of promise. The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as
doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, "because of
(or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions," that is, to
bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it ([Rom
7:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md); to make men more fully
conscious of their "sins," by being perceived as transgressions of the
law, and so to make them long for the promised Saviour. This accords
with [Gal 3:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md); [Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md). The meaning can hardly be "to
check transgressions," for the law rather stimulates the corrupt heart
to disobey it ([Rom 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md); [Rom
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013).md).

till the seed--during the period up to the time when the seed came. The
law was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation ([Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md); Greek, "the law came in
additionally and incidentally"), intervening between the promise and its
fulfilment in Christ.

come--(Compare "faith came," [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023).md).

the promise-- ([Rom 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021).md).

ordained--Greek, "constituted" or "disposed."

by angels--as the instrumental enactors of the law \[ALFORD\] God
delegated the law to angels as something rather alien to Him and severe
([Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Heb
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); compare [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), "He came with ten thousands of
saints," that is, angels, [Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017).md).
He reserved "the promise" to Himself and dispensed it according to His
own goodness.

in the hand of a mediator--namely, Moses. [Deu
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#005.md), "I stood between the Lord and
you": the very definition of a mediator. Hence the phrase often recurs,
"By the hand of Moses." In the giving of the law, the "angels" were
representatives of God; Moses, as mediator, represented the people.

[Galatians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 3:20</span></span>

"Now a mediator cannot be of one (but must be of two parties whom he
mediates between); but God is one" (not two: owing to His essential
unity not admitting of an intervening party between Him and those to be
blessed; but as the ONE Sovereign, His own representative, giving the
blessing directly by promise to Abraham, and, in its fulfilment, to
Christ, "the Seed," without new condition, and without a mediator such
as the law had). The conclusion understood is, Therefore a mediator
cannot appertain to God; and consequently, the law, with its inseparable
appendage of a mediator, cannot be the normal way of dealing of God, the
one, and unchangeable God, who dealt with Abraham by direct promise, as
a sovereign, not as one forming a compact with another party, with
conditions and a mediator attached thereto. God would bring man into
immediate communion with Him, and not have man separated from Him by a
mediator that keeps back from access, as Moses and the legal priesthood
did ([Exo 19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012.md), [Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017.md), [Exo
19:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021.md); [Heb
12:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019).md). The law that thus
interposed a mediator and conditions between man and God, was an
exceptional state limited to the Jews, and parenthetically preparatory
to the Gospel, God's normal mode of dealing, as He dealt with Abraham,
namely, face to face directly; by promise and grace, and not conditions;
to all nations united by faith in the one seed ([Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md), [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md), [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md), and not to one people to the
exclusion and severance from the ONE common Father, of all other
nations. It is no objection to this view, that the Gospel, too, has a
mediator ([Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005).md). For Jesus is not
a mediator separating the two parties in the covenant of promise or
grace, as Moses did, but ONE in both nature and office with both God and
man (compare "God in Christ," [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md): representing the whole
universal manhood ([Co1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md), [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md), [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047).md), and also bearing in Him "all
the fulness of the Godhead." Even His mediatorial office is to cease
when its purpose of reconciling all things to God shall have been
accomplished ([Co1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md); and God's
ONENESS ([Zac 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009).md), as "all in all,"
shall be fully manifested. Compare [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md), where the two mediators--Moses,
the severing mediator of legal conditions, and Jesus, the uniting
mediator of grace--are contrasted. The Jews began their worship by
reciting the Schemah, opening thus, "Jehovah our God is ONE Jehovah";
which words their Rabbis (as JARCHIUS) interpret as teaching not only
the unity of God, but the future universality of His Kingdom on earth
([Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md). Paul ([Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030).md) infers the same truth from the
ONENESS of God (compare [Eph 4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004).md).
He, as being One, unites all believers, without distinction, to Himself
([Gal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md); compare [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011).md) in direct communion. The unity
of God involves the unity of the people of God, and also His dealing
directly without intervention of a mediator.

[Galatians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 3:21</span></span>

"Is the law (which involves a mediator) against the promises of God
(which are without a mediator, and rest on God alone and immediately)?
God forbid."

life--The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally
impart spiritual life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the
disposition. If the law had been a law capable of giving life, "verily
(in very reality, and not in the mere fancy of legalists) righteousness
would have been by the law (for where life is, there righteousness, its
condition, must also be)." But the law does not pretend to give life,
and therefore not righteousness; so there is no opposition between the
law and the promise. Righteousness can only come through the promise to
Abraham, and through its fulfilment in the Gospel of grace.

[Galatians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 3:22</span></span>

But--as the law cannot give life or righteousness \[ALFORD\]. Or the
"But" means, So far is righteousness from being of the law, that the
knowledge of sin is rather what comes of the law \[BENGEL\].

the scripture--which began to be written after the time of the promise,
at the time when the law was given. The written letter was needed SO as
PERMANENTLY to convict man of disobedience to God's command. Therefore

Scripture."

concluded--"shut up," under condemnation, as in a prison. Compare [Isa

wherewith Christ makes free," which follows, [Gal

3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md), [Gal

all that appertains to him.

3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md); [Rom

gift; not something earned by the works of the law ([Rom

just spoken of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 3:23</span></span>

faith--namely, that just mentioned ([Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022).md), of which Christ is the object.

kept--Greek, "kept in ward": the effect of the "shutting up" ([Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md); [Gal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002.md); [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006).md).

unto--"with a view to the faith," &c. We were, in a manner, morally
forced to it, so that there remained to us no refuge but faith. Compare
the phrase, [Psa 78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md), Margin; [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md).

which should afterwards, &c.--"which was afterwards to be revealed."

"So that the law hath been (that is, hath turned out to be) our
schoolmaster (or "tutor," literally, "pedagogue": this term, among the
Greeks, meant a faithful servant entrusted with the care of the boy from
childhood to puberty, to keep him from evil, physical and moral, and
accompany him to his amusements and studies) to guide us unto Christ,"
with whom we are no longer "shut up" in bondage, but are freemen.
"Children" (literally, infants) need such tutoring ([Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003).md).

might be--rather, "that we may be justified by faith"; which we could
not be till Christ, the object of faith, had come. Meanwhile the law, by
outwardly checking the sinful propensity which was constantly giving
fresh proof of its refractoriness--as thus the consciousness of the
power of the sinful principle became more vivid, and hence the sense of
need both of forgiveness of sin and freedom from its bondage was
awakened--the law became a "schoolmaster to guide us unto Christ"
\[NEANDER\]. The moral law shows us what we ought to do, and so we learn
our inability to do it. In the ceremonial law we seek, by animal
sacrifices, to answer for our not having done it, but find dead victims
no satisfaction for the sins of living men, and that outward purifying
will not cleanse the soul; and that therefore we need an infinitely
better Sacrifice, the antitype of all the legal sacrifices. Thus
delivered up to the judicial law, we see how awful is the doom we
deserve: thus the law at last leads us to Christ, with whom we find
righteousness and peace. "Sin, sin! is the word heard again and again in
the Old Testament. Had it not there for centuries rung in the ear, and
fastened on the conscience, the joyful sound, "grace for grace," would
not have been the watchword of the New Testament. This was the end of
the whole system of sacrifices" \[THOLUCK\].

"But now that faith is come," &c. Moses the lawgiver cannot bring us
into the heavenly Canaan though he can bring us to the border of it. At
that point he is superseded by Joshua, the type of Jesus, who leads the
true Israel into their inheritance. The law leads us to Christ, and
there its office ceases.

children--Greek, "sons."

by--Greek, "through faith." "Ye all" (Jews and Gentiles alike) are no
longer "children" requiring a tutor, but SONS emancipated and walking at
liberty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gal 3:27</span></span>

baptized into Christ-- ([Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003).md).

have put on Christ--Ye did, in that very act of being baptized into
Christ, put on, or clothe yourselves with, Christ: so the Greek
expresses. Christ is to you the toga virilis (the Roman garment of the
full-grown man, assumed when ceasing to be a child) \[BENGEL\]. GATAKER
defines a Christian, "One who has put on Christ." The argument is, By
baptism ye have put on Christ; and therefore, He being the Son of God,
ye become sons by adoption, by virtue of His Sonship by generation. This
proves that baptism, where it answers to its ideal, is not a mere empty
sign, but a means of spiritual transference from the state of legal
condemnation to that of living union with Christ, and of sonship through
Him in relation to God ([Rom 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014).md).
Christ alone can, by baptizing with His Spirit, make the inward grace
correspond to the outward sign. But as He promises the blessing in the
faithful use of the means, the Church has rightly presumed, in charity,
that such is the case, nothing appearing to the contrary.

[Galatians 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gal 3:28</span></span>

There is in this sonship by faith in Christ, no class privileged above
another, as the Jews under the law had been above the Gentiles ([Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011).md).

bond nor free--Christ alike belongs to both by faith; whence he puts
"bond" before "free." Compare Note, see on [Co1
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md); [Eph
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008.md).

neither male nor female--rather, as Greek, "there is not male and
female." There is no distinction into male and female. Difference of sex
makes no difference in Christian privileges. But under the law the male
sex had great privileges. Males alone had in their body circumcision,
the sign of the covenant (contrast baptism applied to male and female
alike); they alone were capable of being kings and priests, whereas all
of either sex are now "kings and priests unto God" ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md); they had prior right to
inheritances. In the resurrection the relation of the sexes shall cease
([Luk 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035).md).

one--Greek, "one man"; masculine, not neuter, namely "one new man" in
Christ ([Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).md).

[Galatians 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 3:29</span></span>

and heirs--The oldest manuscripts omit "and." Christ is "Abraham's seed"
([Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md): ye are "one in Christ"
([Gal 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028).md), and one with Christ, as
having "put on Christ" ([Gal 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027).md);
therefore YE are "Abraham's seed," which is tantamount to saying (whence
the "and" is omitted), ye are "heirs according to the promise" (not "by
the law," [Gal 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018).md); for it was to
Abraham's seed that the inheritance was promised ([Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md). Thus he arrives at the same
truth which he set out with ([Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007).md). But one new "seed" of a
righteous succession could be found. One single faultless grain of human
nature was found by God Himself, the source of a new and imperishable
seed: "the seed" ([Psa 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030).md) who
receive from Him a new nature and name ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); [Isa
53:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md). In Him the lineal descent from
David becomes extinct. He died without posterity. But He lives and shall
reign on David's throne. No one has a legal claim to sit upon it but
Himself, He being the only living direct representative ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md). His spiritual seed derive
their birth from the travail of His soul, being born again of His word,
which is the incorruptible seed ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); [Rom
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md).
