### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 5:1</span></span>

THE TRIBES ANOINT DAVID KING OVER ISRAEL. ([Sa2
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001).md)

Then came all the tribes of Israel--a combined deputation of the leading
authorities in every tribe. \[See on [Ch1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001.md).\] David possessed the first and
indispensable qualification for the throne; namely, that of being an
Israelite ([Deu 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015).md). Of his
military talent he had furnished ample proof. And the people's desire
for his assumption of the government of Israel was further increased by
their knowledge of the will and purpose of God, as declared by Samuel
([Sa1 16:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 5:3</span></span>

King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord--(see on
[Sa1 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017).md). This formal declaration
of the constitution was chiefly made at the commencement of a new
dynasty, or at the restoration of the royal family after a usurpation
([Kg2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017).md), though circumstances
sometimes led to its being renewed on the accession of any new sovereign
([Kg1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004).md). It seems to have been
accompanied by religious solemnities.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 5:6</span></span>

HE TAKES ZION FROM THE JEBUSITES. ([Sa2
5:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006).md)

the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites--The first
expedition of David, as king of the whole country, was directed against
this place, which had hitherto remained in the hands of the natives. It
was strongly fortified and deemed so impregnable that the blind and lame
were sent to man the battlements, in derisive mockery of the Hebrew
king's attack, and to shout, "David cannot come in hither." To
understand the full meaning and force of this insulting taunt, it is
necessary to bear in mind the depth and steepness of the valley of
Gihon, and the lofty walls of the ancient Canaanitish fortress.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 5:7</span></span>

the stronghold of Zion--Whether Zion be the southwestern hill commonly
so-called, or the peak now level on the north of the temple mount, it is
the towering height which catches the eye from every quarter--"the hill
fort," "the rocky hold" of Jerusalem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 5:8</span></span>

Whosoever getteth up to the gutter--This is thought by some to mean a
subterranean passage; by others a spout through which water was poured
upon the fire which the besiegers often applied to the woodwork at the
gateways, and by the projections of which a skilful climber might make
his ascent good; a third class render the words, "whosoever dasheth them
against the precipice" ([Ch1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 5:9</span></span>

David dwelt in the fort, &c.--Having taken it by storm, he changed its
name to "the city of David," to signify the importance of the conquest,
and to perpetuate the memory of the event.

David built round about from Millo and inward--probably a row of stone
bastions placed on the northern side of Mount Zion, and built by David
to secure himself on that side from the Jebusites, who still lived in
the lower part of the city. The house of Millo was perhaps the principal
corner tower of that fortified wall.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 5:11</span></span>

Hiram . . . sent carpenters, and masons--The influx of Tyrian architects
and mechanics affords a clear evidence of the low state to which,
through the disorders of long-continued war, the better class of
artisans had declined in Israel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 5:13</span></span>

ELEVEN SONS BORN TO HIM. ([Sa2
5:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013).md)

David took him more concubines and wives--In this conduct David
transgressed an express law, which forbade the king of Israel to
multiply wives unto himself ([Deu
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 5:17</span></span>

HE SMITES THE PHILISTINES. ([Sa2
5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017).md)

when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over
Israel--During the civil war between the house of Saul and David, those
restless neighbors had remained quiet spectators of the contest. But
now, jealous of David, they resolved to attack him before his government
was fully established.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 5:18</span></span>

valley of Rephaim--that is, "of giants," a broad and fertile plain,
which descends gradually from the central mountains towards the
northwest. It was the route by which they marched against Jerusalem. The
"hold" to which David went down "was some fortified place where he might
oppose the progress of the invaders," and where he signally defeated
them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 5:21</span></span>

there they left their images--probably their "lares" or household
deities, which they had brought into the field to fight for them. They
were burnt as ordained by law ([Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 5:22</span></span>

the Philistines came up yet again--The next year they renewed their
hostile attempt with a larger force, but God manifestly interposed in
David's favor.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 5:24</span></span>

the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees--now generally
thought not to be mulberry trees, but some other tree, most probably the
poplar, which delights in moist situations, and the leaves of which are
rustled by the slightest movement of the air \[ROYLE\].
