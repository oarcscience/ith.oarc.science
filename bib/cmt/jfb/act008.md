### [Acts Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md)

[Acts 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 8:1</span></span>

PERSECUTION CONTINUED, IN WHICH SAUL TAKES A PROMINENT PART--HOW
OVERRULED FOR GOOD. ([Act 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).md)

Saul was consenting unto his death--The word expresses hearty approval.

they were all scattered abroad--all the leading Christians, particularly
the preachers, agreeably to their Lord's injunctions ([Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023).md), though many doubtless
remained, and others (as appears by [Act
9:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026).md) soon returned.

except the apostles--who remained, not certainly as being less exposed
to danger, but, at whatever risk, to watch over the infant cause where
it was most needful to cherish it.

[Acts 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 8:2</span></span>

and devout men--pious Jews, probably, impressed with admiration for
Stephen and secretly inclined to Christianity, but not yet openly
declared.

[Acts 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 8:3</span></span>

Saul . . . entering into every house--like as inquisitor \[BENGEL\].

haling men and women, &c.--See his own affecting confessions afterwards
([Act 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Act
26:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md); [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md); [Gal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md); [Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md); [Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md).

[Acts 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 8:4</span></span>

they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching--Though
solemnly enjoined to do this ([Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).md), they would probably have
lingered at Jerusalem, but for this besom of persecution which swept
them out. How often has the rage of Christ's enemies thus "turned out
rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel" (see [Phi
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012).md).

[Acts 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 8:5</span></span>

SUCCESS OF PHILIP'S PREACHING IN SAMARIA--CASE OF SIMON MAGUS. (Acts
8:5-25)

Then Philip--not the apostle of that name, as was by some of the Fathers
supposed; for besides that the apostles remained at Jerusalem, they
would in that case have had no occasion to send a deputation of their
own number to lay their hands on the baptized disciples \[GROTIUS\]. It
was the deacon of that name, who comes next after Stephen in the
catalogue of the seven, probably as being the next most prominent. The
persecution may have been directed especially against Stephen's
colleagues \[MEYER\].

the city of Samaria--or "a city of Samaria"; but the former seems more
likely. "It furnished the bridge between Jerusalem and the world"
\[BAUMGARTEN\].

[Acts 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 8:6</span></span>

the people with one accord gave heed to . . . Philip--the way being
prepared perhaps by the fruits of our Lord's sojourn, as He Himself
seems to intimate (see on [Joh
4:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#031).md). But "we may mark the
providence of God in sending a Grecian, or a Hellenistic Jew, to a
people who from national antipathy would have been unlikely to attend to
a native of Judea" \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 8:8</span></span>

great joy in that city--over the change wrought on it by the Gospel, as
well as the cures which attested its divine character.

[Acts 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 8:9</span></span>

used sorcery--magical arts.

some great one . . . the great power of God--a sort of incarnation of
divinity.

[Acts 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 8:10</span></span>

To whom all gave heed . . . because of long time he had bewitched
them--This, coupled with the rapidity with which they deserted him and
attached themselves to Philip, shows the ripeness of Samaria for some
religious change.

[Acts 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 8:12</span></span>

were baptized, both men and women--the detection of Simon's frauds
helping to extend and deepen the effects of Philip's preaching.

[Acts 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 8:13</span></span>

Then Simon himself believed also--Left without followers, he thinks it
best to join the man who had fairly outstripped him, not without a touch
of real conviction.

and . . . was baptized--What a light does this throw on what is called
Baptismal Regeneration!

he continued with Philip--"was in constant attendance upon" him.

[Acts 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 8:14</span></span>

the apostles . . . sent Peter and John--showing that they regarded Peter
as no more than their own equal.

[Acts 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 8:15</span></span>

prayed . . . they might receive the Holy Ghost. (For only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus)--As the baptism of adults
presupposed "the renewing of the Holy Ghost" ([Tit
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013).md), of which the profession of
faith had to be taken for evidence, this communication of the Holy Ghost
by the laying on of the apostles' hands was clearly a superadded thing;
and as it was only occasional, so it was invariably attended with
miraculous manifestations (see [Act
10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md), where it followed Peter's
preaching; and [Act 19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md), where, as
here, it followed the laying on of hands). In the present case an
important object was served by it--"the sudden appearance of a body of
baptized disciples in Samaria, by the agency of one who was not an
apostle, requiring the presence and power of apostles to perform their
special part as the divinely appointed founders of the Church"
\[ALFORD\]. Beautiful, too, was the spectacle exhibited of Jew and
Samaritan, one in Christ.

[Acts 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 8:18</span></span>

offered them money--Hence the term simony, to denote trafficking in
sacred things, but chiefly the purchase of ecclesiastical offices.

[Acts 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 8:19</span></span>

that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost--Spiritual
ambition here shows itself the key to this wretched man's character.

[Acts 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 8:20</span></span>

Thy money perish with thee--that is, "Accursed be thou and thy money
with thee." It is the language of mingled horror and indignation, not
unlike our Lord's rebuke of Peter himself ([Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023).md).

[Acts 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 8:21</span></span>

Thou hast neither part nor lot . . . thy heart is not fight, &c.--This
is the fidelity of a minister of Christ to one deceiving himself in a
very awful manner.

[Acts 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 8:22</span></span>

Repent . . . pray . . . if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be
forgiven--this expression of doubt being designed to impress upon him
the greatness of his sin, and the need of alarm on his part.

[Acts 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 8:23</span></span>

in the gall of bitterness and . . . bond of iniquity--expressing both
the awfulness of his condition and the captivity to it in which he was
held.

[Acts 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 8:24</span></span>

Pray ye to the Lord for me--Peter had urged him to pray for himself: he
asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in
the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar
interest with heaven.

that none of these things dome upon me--not that the thought of his
wicked heart might be forgiven him, but only that the evils threatened
might be averted from him. While this throws great light on Peter's view
of his melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine,
still retained its hold of him. (Tradition represents him as turning out
a great heresiarch, mingling Oriental or Grecian philosophy with some
elements of Christianity.)

[Acts 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 8:25</span></span>

and they--Peter and John.

when they had . . . preached--in the city where Philip's labors had been
so richly blessed.

returned . . . and preached . . . in many villages of the
Samaritans--embracing the opportunity of their journey back to Jerusalem
to fulfil their Lord's commission to the whole region of Samaria ([Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).md).

[Acts 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 8:26</span></span>

THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH. ([Act 8:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026).md)

the angel of the Lord--rather, "an angel."

go . . . south, the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza--There
was such a road, across Mount Hebron, which Philip might take without
going to Jerusalem (as VON RAUMER'S'S PalÃ&brvbr;stina shows).

which is desert--that is, the way; not Gaza itself, which was the
southernmost city of Palestine, in the territory of the ancient
Philistines. To go from a city, where his hands had been full of work,
so far away on a desert road, could not but be staggering to the faith
of Philip, especially as he was kept in ignorance of the object of the
journey. But like Paul, he "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision";
and like Abram, "he went out not knowing whither he went" ([Act
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md); [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008).md).

[Acts 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 8:27</span></span>

a man of Ethiopia--Upper Egypt, Meroe.

an eunuch of great authority--Eunuchs were generally employed for
confidential offices in the East, and to some extent are still.

Candace--the family name of the queens of Upper Egypt, like Pharaoh,
CÃ&brvbr;sar, &c. (as appears from classic authors).

had come to Jerusalem to worship--that is, to keep the recent feast of
Pentecost, as a Gentile proselyte to the Jewish faith. (See [Isa
56:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md), and [Joh
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020).md).

[Acts 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 8:28</span></span>

Was returning--Having come so far, he not only stayed out the days of
the festival, but prolonged his stay till now. It says much for his
fidelity and value to his royal mistress that he had such liberty. But
the faith in Jehovah and love of His worship and word, with which he was
imbued, sufficiently explain this.

and sitting in his chariot, read Esaias--Not contented with the
statutory services in which he had joined, he beguiles the tedium of the
journey homeward by reading the Scriptures. But this is not all; for as
Philip "heard him read the prophet Esaias," he must have been reading
aloud and not (as is customary still in the East) so as merely to be
audible, but in a louder voice than he would naturally have used if
intent on his own benefit only: evidently therefore he was reading to
his charioteer.

[Acts 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 8:29</span></span>

the Spirit said--by an unmistakable voice within, as in [Act
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#019.md); [Act
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md).

go near and join this chariot--This would reveal to Philip the hitherto
unknown object of his journey, and encourage him to expect something.

[Acts 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 8:30</span></span>

Understandest thou what thou readest?--To one so engaged this would be
deemed no rude question, while the eager appearance of the speaker, and
the question itself, would indicate a readiness to supply any want of
insight that might be felt.

[Acts 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 8:31</span></span>

How can I, except some man guide me?--Beautiful expression at once of
humility and docility; the invitation to Philip which immediately
followed, to "come up and sit with him," being but the natural
expression of this.

[Acts 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 8:32</span></span>

The place . . . was this, He was led as a sheep, &c.--One cannot but
wonder that this, of all predictions of Messiah's sufferings in the Old
Testament the most striking, should have been that which the eunuch was
reading before Philip joined him. He could hardly miss to have heard at
Jerusalem of the sufferings and death of Jesus, and of the existence of
a continually increasing party who acknowledged Him to be the Messiah.
But his question to Philip, whether the prophet in this passage meant
himself or some other man, clearly shows that he had not the least idea
of any connection between this prediction and those facts.

[Acts 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 8:34</span></span>

And the eunuch answered, I pray thee, &c.--The respect with which he
here addresses Philip was prompted by his reverence for one whom he
perceived to be his superior in divine things; his own worldly position
sinking before this.

[Acts 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 8:35</span></span>

Then Philip opened his mouth--(See on [Mat
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002).md).

began at the same scripture--founding on it as his text.

preached unto him Jesus--showing Him to be the glorious Burden of this
wonderful prediction, and interpreting it in the light of the facts of
His history.

[Acts 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 8:36</span></span>

See, here is water--more simply, "Behold water!" as if already his mind
filled with light and his soul set free, he was eagerly looking out for
the first water in which he might seal his reception of the truth and be
enrolled among the visible disciples of the Lord Jesus.

what doth hinder me to be baptized?--Philip had probably told him that
this was the ordained sign and seal of discipleship, but the eunuch's
question was likely the first proposal of its application in this case.
([Act 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037.md) is wanting in the principal
manuscripts and most venerable versions of the New Testament. It seems
to have been added from the formularies for baptism which came into
current use).

[Acts 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 8:38</span></span>

they went down both into the water, and he baptized him, &c.--probably
laving the water upon him, though the precise mode is neither certain
nor of any consequence.

[Acts 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 8:39</span></span>

the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip--To deny \[as MEYER,
OLSHAUSEN, BLOOMFIELD\] the miraculous nature of Philip's disappearance,
is vain. It stands out on the face of the words, as just a repetition of
what we read of the ancient prophets, in [Kg1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#012.md); [Kg2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016.md). And the same word (as BENGEL
remarks) is employed to express a similar idea in [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md), [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md).

the eunuch saw him no more--nor, perhaps, for very joy, cared to see him
\[BENGEL\].

and he went on his way rejoicing--He had found Christ, and the key to
the Scriptures; his soul was set free, and his discipleship sealed; he
had lost his teacher, but gained what was infinitely better: He felt
himself a new man, and "his joy was full." Tradition says he was the
first preacher of the Gospel in Ethiopia; and how, indeed, could he
choose but "tell what the Lord had done for his soul?" Yet there is no
certainty as to any historical connection between his labors and the
introduction of Christianity into that country.

[Acts 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 8:40</span></span>

Philip was found--that is, "found himself," "made his appearance": an
expression confirming the miraculous manner of his transportation.

at Azotus--the ancient Ashdod.

preached in all the cities--along the coast, proceeding northward.

till he came to CÃ&brvbr;sarea--fifty-five miles northwest of Jerusalem,
on the Mediterranean, just south of Mount Carmel; and so named by Herod,
who rebuilt it, in honor of CÃ&brvbr;sar Augustus. Henceforth we lose
sight of zealous and honored Philip, as by and by we shall lose sight
even of Peter. As the chariot of the Gospel rolls on, other agents are
raised up, each suited to his work. But "he that soweth and he that
reapeth shall rejoice together." (See on [Joh
4:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#031).md).
