### [Judges Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

[Judges 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 4:1</span></span>

DEBORAH AND BARAK DELIVER ISRAEL FROM JABIN AND SISERA. (Jdg. 4:1-17)

The children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when
Ehud was dead--The removal of the zealous judge Ehud again left his
infatuated countrymen without the restraint of religion.

[Judges 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 4:2</span></span>

Jabin king of Canaan--"Jabin," a royal title (see on [Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md). The second Jabin built a new
capital on the ruins of the old ([Jos
11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#010).md). The northern Canaanites had
recovered from the effect of their disastrous overthrow in the time of
Joshua, and now triumphed in their turn over Israel. This was the
severest oppression to which Israel had been subjected. But it fell
heaviest on the tribes in the north, and it was not till after a
grinding servitude of twenty years that they were awakened to view it as
the punishment of their sins and to seek deliverance from God.

[Judges 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 4:4</span></span>

And Deborah, a prophetess--A woman of extraordinary knowledge, wisdom,
and piety, instructed in divine knowledge by the Spirit and accustomed
to interpret His will; who acquired an extensive influence, and was held
in universal respect, insomuch that she became the animating spirit of
the government and discharged all the special duties of a judge, except
that of military leader.

the wife of Lapidoth--rendered by some, "a woman of splendors."

[Judges 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 4:5</span></span>

she dwelt under the palm tree--or, collectively, "palm-grove." It is
common still in the East to administer justice in the open air, or under
the canopy of an umbrageous tree.

[Judges 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 4:6</span></span>

she sent and called Barak--by virtue of her official authority as judge.

Kedesh-naphtali--situated on an eminence, little north of the Sea of
Galilee, and so called to distinguish it from another Kedesh in
Issachar.

Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded?--a Hebrew form of making an
emphatic communication.

Go and draw toward mount Tabor--an isolated mountain of Galilee,
northeast corner of the plain of Esdraelon. It was a convenient place of
rendezvous, and the enlistment is not to be considered as limited to ten
thousand, though a smaller force would have been inadequate.

[Judges 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 4:8</span></span>

Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go--His
somewhat singular request to be accompanied by Deborah was not
altogether the result of weakness. The Orientals always take what is
dearest to the battlefield along with them; they think it makes them
fight better. The policy of Barak, then, to have the presence of the
prophetess is perfectly intelligible as it would no less stimulate the
valor of the troops, than sanction, in the eyes of Israel, the uprising
against an oppressor so powerful as Jabin.

[Judges 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 4:9</span></span>

the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman--This was a
prediction which Barak could not understand at the time; but the strain
of it conveyed a rebuke of his unmanly fears.

[Judges 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 4:11</span></span>

Now Heber the Kenite . . . pitched his tent--It is not uncommon, even in
the present day, for pastoral tribes to feed their flocks on the
extensive commons that lie in the heart of inhabited countries in the
East (see on [Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md).

plain of Zaanaim--This is a mistranslation for "the oaks of the
wanderers." The site of the encampment was under a grove of oaks, or
terebinths, in the upland valley of Kedesh.

[Judges 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 4:13</span></span>

the river of Kishon--The plain on its bank was chosen as the battlefield
by Sisera himself, who was unconsciously drawn thither for the ruin of
his army.

[Judges 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 4:14</span></span>

Barak went down from mount Tabor--It is a striking proof of the full
confidence Barak and his troops reposed in Deborah's assurance of
victory, that they relinquished their advantageous position on the hill
and rushed into the plain in face of the iron chariots they so much
dreaded.

[Judges 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 4:15</span></span>

the Lord discomfited Sisera--Hebrew, "threw his army into confusion";
men, horses, and chariots being intermingled in wild confusion. The
disorder was produced by a supernatural panic (see on [Jdg
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020).md).

so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
feet--His chariot being probably distinguished by its superior size and
elegance, would betray the rank of its rider, and he saw therefore that
his only chance of escape was on foot.

[Judges 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 4:16</span></span>

But Barak pursued . . . unto Harosheth--Broken and routed, the main body
of Sisera's army fled northward; others were forced into the Kishon and
drowned (see on [Jdg 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021).md).

[Judges 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 4:17</span></span>

Sisera fled . . . to the tent of Jael--According to the usages of
nomadic people, the duty of receiving the stranger in the sheik's
absence devolves on his wife, and the moment the stranger is admitted
into his tent, his claim to be defended or concealed from his pursuers
is established.

[Judges 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 4:19</span></span>

she . . . gave him drink, and covered him--Sisera reckoned on this as a
pledge of his safety, especially in the tent of a friendly sheik. This
pledge was the strongest that could be sought or obtained, after he had
partaken of refreshments, and been introduced in the inner or women's
apartment.

[Judges 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 4:20</span></span>

he said unto her, . . . when any man doth come and enquire of thee and
say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No--The privacy of the
harem, even in a tent, cannot be intruded on without express permission.

[Judges 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 4:21</span></span>

Then Jael took a nail of the tent--most probably one of the pins with
which the tent ropes are fastened to the ground. Escape was almost
impossible for Sisera. But the taking of his life by the hand of Jael
was murder. It was a direct violation of all the notions of honor and
friendship that are usually held sacred among pastoral people, and for
which it is impossible to conceive a woman in Jael's circumstances to
have had any motive, except that of gaining favor with the victors.
Though predicted by Deborah \[[Jdg
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md)\], it was the result of divine
foreknowledge only--not the divine appointment or sanction; and though
it is praised in the song \[[Jdg
5:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md)\], the eulogy must be
considered as pronounced not on the moral character of the woman and her
deed, but on the public benefits which, in the overruling providence of
God, would flow from it.
