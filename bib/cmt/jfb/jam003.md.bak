Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [James Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

[James 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 3:1</span></span>

DANGER OF EAGERNESS TO TEACH, AND OF AN UNBRIDLED TONGUE: TRUE WISDOM
SHOWN BY UNCONTENTIOUS MEEKNESS. (Jam. 3:1-18)

be not--literally, "become not": taking the office too hastily, and of
your own accord.

many--The office is a noble one; but few are fit for it. Few govern the
tongue well ([Jam 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).md), and only such
as can govern it are fit for the office; therefore, "teachers" ought not
to be many.

masters--rather, "teachers." The Jews were especially prone to this
presumption. The idea that faith (so called) without works ([Jam
2:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014).md) was all that is required,
prompted "many" to set up as "teachers," as has been the case in all
ages of the Church. At first all were allowed to teach in turns. Even
their inspired gifts did not prevent liability to abuse, as James here
implies: much more is this so when self-constituted teachers have no
such miraculous gifts.

knowing--as all might know.

we . . . greater condemnation--James in a humble, conciliatory spirit,
includes himself: if we teachers abuse the office, we shall receive
greater condemnation than those who are mere hearers (compare [Luk
12:42-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042).md). CALVIN, like English
Version, translates, "masters" that is, self-constituted censors and
reprovers of others [Jam 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md) accords
with this view.

[James 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 3:2</span></span>

all--The Greek implies "all without exception": even the apostles.

offend not--literally "stumbleth not": is void of offence or "slip" in
word: in which respect one is especially tried who sets up to be a
"teacher."

[James 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 3:3</span></span>

Behold--The best authorities read, "but if," that is, Now whensoever (in
the case) of horses (such is the emphatic position of "horses" in the
Greek) we put the bits (so literally, "the customary bits") into their
mouths that they may obey us, we turn about also their whole body. This
is to illustrate how man turns about his whole body with the little
tongue. "The same applies to the pen, which is the substitute for the
tongue among the absent" \[BENGEL\].

[James 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 3:4</span></span>

Not only animals, but even ships.

the governor listeth--literally, "the impulse of the steersman
pleaseth." The feeling which moves the tongue corresponds with this.

[James 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 3:5</span></span>

boasteth great things--There is great moment in what the careless think
"little" things \[BENGEL\]. Compare "a world," "the course of nature,"
"hell," [Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md), which illustrate how
the little tongue's great words produce great mischief.

how great a matter a little fire kindleth--The best manuscripts read,
"how little a fire kindleth how great a," &c. ALFORD, for "matter,"
translates, "forest." But GROTIUS translates as English Version,
"material for burning": a pile of fuel.

[James 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 3:6</span></span>

Translate, "The tongue, that world of iniquity, is a fire." As man's
little world is an image of the greater world, the universe, so the
tongue is an image of the former \[BENGEL\].

so--omitted in the oldest authorities.

is--literally, "is constituted." "The tongue is (constituted), among the
members, the one which defileth," &c. (namely, as fire defiles with its
smoke).

course of nature--"the orb (cycle) of creation."

setteth on fire . . . is set on fire--habitually and continually. While
a man inflames others, he passes out of his own power, being consumed in
the flame himself.

of hell--that is, of the devil. Greek, "Gehenna"; found here only and in
[Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md). James has much in common
with the Sermon on the Mount ([Pro
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027).md).

[James 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 3:7</span></span>

every kind--rather, "every nature" (that is, natural disposition and
characteristic power).

of beasts--that is, quadrupeds of every disposition; as distinguished
from the three other classes of creation, "birds, creeping things (the
Greek includes not merely 'serpents,' as English Version), and things in
the sea."

is tamed, and hath been--is continually being tamed, and hath been so
long ago.

of mankind--rather, "by the nature of man": man's characteristic power
taming that of the inferior animals. The dative in the Greek may imply,
"Hath suffered itself to be brought into tame subjection TO the nature
of men." So it shall be in the millennial world; even now man, by gentle
firmness, may tame the inferior animal, and even elevate its nature.

[James 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 3:8</span></span>

no man--literally, "no one of men": neither can a man control his
neighbor's, nor even his own tongue. Hence the truth of [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md) appears.

unruly evil--The Greek, implies that it is at once restless and
incapable of restraint. Nay, though nature has hedged it in with a
double barrier of the lips and teeth, it bursts from its barriers to
assail and ruin men \[ESTIUS\].

deadly--literally, "death-bearing."

[James 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 3:9</span></span>

God--The oldest authorities read, "Lord." "Him who is Lord and Father."
The uncommonness of the application of "Lord" to the Father, doubtless
caused the change in modern texts to "God" ([Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027).md). But as Messiah is called
"Father," [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), so God the Father
is called by the Son's title, "Lord": showing the unity of the Godhead.
"Father" implies His paternal love; "Lord," His dominion.

men, which--not "men who"; for what is meant is not particular men, but
men genetically \[ALFORD\].

are made after . . . similitude of God--Though in a great measure man
has lost the likeness of God in which he was originally made, yet enough
of it still remains to show what once it was, and what in regenerated
and restored man it shall be. We ought to reverence this remnant and
earnest of what man shall be in ourselves and in others. "Absalom has
fallen from his father's favor, but the people still recognize him to be
the king's son" \[BENGEL\]. Man resembles in humanity the Son of man,
"the express image of His person" ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md), compare [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md); [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md). In the passage, [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md), "image" and "likeness" are
distinct: "image," according to the Alexandrians, was something in which
men were created, being common to all, and continuing to man after the
fall, while the "likeness" was something toward which man was created,
to strive after and attain it: the former marks man's physical and
intellectual, the latter his moral pre-eminence.

[James 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 3:10</span></span>

The tongue, says Ã†SOP, is at once the best and the worst of things. So
in a fable, a man with the same breath blows hot and cold. "Life and
death are in the power of the tongue" (compare [Psa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#004).md).

brethren--an appeal to their consciences by their brotherhood in Christ.

ought not so to be--a mild appeal, leaving it to themselves to
understand that such conduct deserves the most severe reprobation.

[James 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 3:11</span></span>

fountain--an image of the heart: as the aperture (so the Greek for
"place" is literally) of the fountain is an image of man's mouth. The
image here is appropriate to the scene of the Epistle, Palestine,
wherein salt and bitter springs are found. Though "sweet" springs are
sometimes found near, yet "sweet and bitter" (water) do not flow "at the
same place" (aperture). Grace can make the same mouth that "sent forth
the bitter" once, send forth the sweet for the time to come: as the wood
(typical of Christ's cross) changed Marah's bitter water into sweet.

[James 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 3:12</span></span>

Transition from the mouth to the heart.

Can the fig tree, &c.--implying that it is an impossibility: as before
in [Jam 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#010.md) he had said it "ought not
so to be." James does not, as Matthew ([Mat
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016).md), make the question, "Do men
gather figs of thistles?" His argument is, No tree "can" bring forth
fruit inconsistent with its nature, as for example, the fig tree, olive
berries: so if a man speaks bitterly, and afterwards speaks good words,
the latter must be so only seemingly, and in hypocrisy, they cannot be
real.

so can no fountain . . . salt . . . and fresh--The oldest authorities
read, "Neither can a salt (water spring) yield fresh." So the mouth that
emits cursing, cannot really emit also blessing.

[James 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 3:13</span></span>

Who--(Compare [Psa 34:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012).md). All wish
to appear "wise": few are so.

show--"by works," and not merely by profession, referring to [Jam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#018.md).

out of a good conversation his works--by general "good conduct"
manifested in particular "works." "Wisdom" and "knowledge," without
these being "shown," are as dead as faith would be without works
\[ALFORD\].

with meekness of wisdom--with the meekness inseparable from true
"wisdom."

[James 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 3:14</span></span>

if ye have--as is the case (this is implied in the Greek indicative).

bitter-- [Eph 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md), "bitterness."

envying--rather, "emulation," or literally, "zeal": kindly, generous
emulation, or zeal, is not condemned, but that which is "bitter"
\[BENGEL\].

strife--rather, "rivalry."

in your hearts--from which flow your words and deeds, as from a
fountain.

glory not, and lie not against the truth--To boast of your wisdom is
virtually a lying against the truth (the gospel), while your lives belie
your glorying. [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md), "The word of truth." [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), [Rom
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md), speaks similarly of the same
contentious Jewish Christians.

[James 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 3:15</span></span>

This wisdom--in which ye "glory," as if ye were "wise" ([Jam
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013).md).

descendeth not from above--literally, "is not one descending," &c.:
"from the Father of lights" (true illumination and wisdom), [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md); through "the Spirit of truth,"
[Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md).

earthly--opposed to heavenly. Distinct from "earthy," [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md). Earthly is what is IN the
earth; earthy, what is of the earth.

sensual--literally, "animal-like": the wisdom of the "natural" (the same
Greek) man, not born again of God; "not having the Spirit" ([Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019).md).

devilish--in its origin (from "hell," [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md); not from God, the Giver of true
wisdom, [Jam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005).md), and also in its
character, which accords with its origin. Earthly, sensual, and
devilish, answer to the three spiritual foes of man, the world, the
flesh, and the devil.

[James 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 3:16</span></span>

envying--So English Version translates the Greek, which usually means
"zeal"; "emulation," in [Rom 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md).
"The envious man stands in his own light. He thinks his candle cannot
shine in the presence of another's sun. He aims directly at men,
obliquely at God, who makes men to differ."

strife--rivalry \[ALFORD\].

confusion--literally, "tumultuous anarchy": both in society (translated
"commotions," [Luk 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009.md); "tumults,"
[Co2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005).md), and in the individual mind;
in contrast to the "peaceable" composure of true "wisdom," [Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md). James does not honor such
effects of this earthly wisdom with the name "fruit," as he does in the
case of the wisdom from above. [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md); compare [Gal
5:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md), "works of the flesh . . .
fruit of the Spirit."

[James 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 3:17</span></span>

first pure--literally, "chaste," "sanctified": pure from all that is
"earthly, sensual (animal), devilish" ([Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).md). This is put, "first of all,"
before "peaceable" because there is an unholy peace with the world which
makes no distinction between clean and unclean. Compare "undefiled" and
"unspotted from the world," [Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md);
[Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md), [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md), "purify . . . hearts"; [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md), "purified . . . souls" (the same
Greek). Ministers must not preach before a purifying change of heart,
"Peace," where there is no peace. Seven (the perfect number)
characteristic peculiarities of true wisdom are enumerated. Purity or
sanctity is put first because it has respect both to God and to
ourselves; the six that follow regard our fellow men. Our first concern
is to have in ourselves sanctity; our second, to be at peace with men.

gentle--"forbearing"; making allowances for others; lenient towards
neighbors, as to the DUTIES they owe us.

easy to be entreated--literally, "easily persuaded," tractable; not
harsh as to a neighbor's FAULTS.

full of mercy--as to a neighbor's MISERIES.

good fruits--contrasted with "every evil work," [Jam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md).

without partiality--recurring to the warning against partial "respect to
persons," [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md), [Jam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md), [Jam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009.md). ALFORD translates as the Greek is
translated, [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md), "wavering,"
"without doubting." But thus there would be an epithet referring to
one's self inserted amidst those referring to one's conduct towards
others. English Version is therefore better.

without hypocrisy--Not as ALFORD explains from [Jam
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md), [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md), "Without deceiving yourselves"
with the name without the reality of religion. For it must refer, like
the rest of the six epithets, to our relations to others; our
peaceableness and mercy towards others must be "without dissimulation."

[James 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 3:18</span></span>

"The peaceable fruit of righteousness." He says "righteousness"; because
it is itself the true wisdom. As in the case of the earthly wisdom,
after the characteristic description came its results; so in this verse,
in the case of the heavenly wisdom. There the results were present;
here, future.

fruit . . . sown--Compare [Psa 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011.md);
[Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md), "trees of righteousness."
Anticipatory, that is, the seed whose "fruit," namely, "righteousness,"
shall be ultimately reaped, is now "sown in peace." "Righteousness," now
in germ, when fully developed as "fruit" shall be itself the everlasting
reward of the righteous. As "sowing in peace" (compare "sown in
dishonor," [Co1 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043).md) produces the
"fruit of righteousness," so conversely "the work" and "effect of
righteousness" is "peace."

of them that make peace--"by (implying also that it is for them, and to
their good) them that work peace." They, and they alone, are "blessed."
"Peacemakers," not merely they who reconcile others, but who work peace.
"Cultivate peace" \[ESTIUS\]. Those truly wise towards God, while
peaceable and tolerant towards their neighbors, yet make it their chief
concern to sow righteousness, not cloaking men's sins, but reproving
them with such peaceable moderation as to be the physicians, rather than
the executioners, of sinners \[CALVIN\].
