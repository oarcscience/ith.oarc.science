Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 10:1</span></span>

CONTRAST BETWEEN THE IDOLS AND JEHOVAH. THE PROPHET'S LAMENTATION AND
PRAYER. (Jer. 10:1-25)

Israel--the Jews, the surviving representatives of the nation.

[Jeremiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 10:2</span></span>

EICHORN thinks the reference here to be to some celestial portent which
had appeared at that time, causing the Jews' dismay. Probably the
reference is general, namely, to the Chaldeans, famed as astrologers,
through contact with whom the Jews were likely to fall into the same
superstition.

way--the precepts or ordinances ([Lev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md); [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).md).

signs of heaven--The Gentiles did not acknowledge a Great First Cause:
many thought events depended on the power of the stars, which some, as
PLATO, thought to be endued with spirit and reason. All heavenly
phenomena, eclipses, comets, &c., are included.

one cutteth a tree, &c.--rather, "It (that which they busy themselves
about: a sample of their 'customs') is a tree cut out of the forest"
\[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 10:4</span></span>

fasten . . . move not--that is, that it may stand upright without risk
of falling, which the god (!) would do, if left to itself ([Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 10:5</span></span>

upright--or, "They are of turned work, resembling a palm tree"
\[MAURER\]. The point of comparison between the idol and the palm is in
the pillar-like uprightness of the latter, it having no branches except
at the top.

speak not-- ([Psa 115:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#005).md).

cannot go--that is, walk ([Psa 115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md);
[Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007).md).

neither . . . do good-- ([Isa 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 10:6</span></span>

none--literally, "no particle of nothing": nothing whatever; the
strongest possible denial ([Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md);
[Psa 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008.md), [Psa
86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 10:7</span></span>

([Rev 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004).md).

to thee doth it appertain--to Thee it properly belongs, namely, that
Thou shouldest be "feared" (taken out of the previous "fear Thee")
(compare [Eze 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md). He alone is the
becoming object of worship. To worship any other is unseemly and an
infringement of His inalienable prerogative.

none--nothing whatever (see on [Jer
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md); [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 10:8</span></span>

altogether--rather, "all alike" \[MAURER\]. Even the so-called "wise"
men ([Jer 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007).md) of the Gentiles are on
a level with the brutes and "foolish," namely, because they connive at
the popular idolatry (compare [Rom
1:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021).md). Therefore, in Daniel and
Revelation, the world power is represented under a bestial form. Man
divests himself of his true humanity, and sinks to the level of the
brute, when he severs his connection with God ([Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008.md); [Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008).md).

stock is a doctrine of vanities--The stock (put for the worship of all
idols whatever, made out of a stock) speaks for itself that the whole
theory of idolatry is vanity ([Isa
44:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).md). CASTALIO translates, "the
very wood itself confuting the vanity" (of the idol).

[Jeremiah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 10:9</span></span>

Everything connected with idols is the result of human effort.

Silver spread--(See on [Isa 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md);
[Isa 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019).md).

Tarshish--Tartessus, in Spain, famed for precious metals.

Uphaz-- ([Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005).md). As the Septuagint
in the Syrian Hexapla in the Margin, THEODOTUS, the Syrian and Chaldee
versions have "Ophir," GESENIUS thinks "Uphaz" a colloquial corruption
(one letter only being changed) for "Ophir." Ophir, in [Gen
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029.md), is mentioned among Arabian
countries. Perhaps Malacca is the country meant, the natives of which
still call their gold mines Ophirs. HEEREN thinks Ophir the general name
for the rich countries of the south, on the Arabian, African, and Indian
coasts; just as our term, East Indies.

cunning--skilful.

[Jeremiah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 10:10</span></span>

true God--literally, "God Jehovah is truth"; not merely true, that is,
veracious, but truth in the reality of His essence, as opposed to the
"vanity" or emptiness which all idols are ([Jer
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003.md), [Jer
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md), [Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015.md); [Ch2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md); [Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md).

living God-- ([Joh 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md); [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017).md). He hath life in Himself which
no creature has. All else "live in Him" ([Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028).md). In contrast to dead idols.

everlasting-- ([Psa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016).md). In
contrast to the temporary existence of all other objects of worship.

[Jeremiah 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 10:11</span></span>

This verse is in Chaldee, Jeremiah supplying his countrymen with a
formula of reply to Chaldee idolaters in the tongue most intelligible to
the latter. There may be also derision intended in imitating their
barbarous dialect. ROSENMULLER objects to this view, that not merely the
words put in the mouths of the Israelites, but Jeremiah's own
introductory words, "Thus shall ye say to them," are in Chaldee, and
thinks it to be a marginal gloss. But it is found in all the oldest
versions. It was an old Greek saying: "Whoever thinks himself a god
besides the one God, let him make another world" ([Psa
96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005).md).

shall perish-- ([Isa 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018.md); [Zac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002).md).

these heavens--the speaker pointing to them with his fingers.

[Jeremiah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 10:12</span></span>

Continuation of [Jer 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md), after the
interruption of the thread of the discourse in [Jer
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011.md) ([Psa
136:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 10:13</span></span>

Literally, "At the voice of His giving forth," that is, when He
thunders. ([Job 38:34](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#034.md); [Psa
29:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003).md).

waters-- ([Gen 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007).md) --above the
firmament; heavy rains accompany thunder.

vapours . . . ascend-- ([Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007).md).

treasures--His stores.

[Jeremiah 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 10:14</span></span>

in his knowledge--"is rendered brutish by his skill," namely, in
idol-making ([Jer 10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008).md). Thus the
parallel, "confounded by the graven image," corresponds (so [Jer
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#017).md). Others not so well translate,
"without knowledge," namely, of God (see [Isa
42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017.md); [Isa
45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016.md); [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 10:15</span></span>

errors--deceptions; from a Hebrew root, "to stutter"; then meaning "to
mock."

their visitation they--When God shall punish the idol-worshippers
(namely, by Cyrus), the idols themselves shall be destroyed
\[ROSENMULLER\] ([Jer 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 10:16</span></span>

portion--from a Hebrew root, "to divide." God is the all-sufficient Good
of His people ([Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md); [Lam
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024).md).

not like them--not like the idols, a vain object of trust ([Deu
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031).md).

former of all things--the Fashioner (as a potter, [Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008).md) of the universe.

rod of his inheritance--The portion marked off as His inheritance by the
measuring rod ([Eze 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021).md). As He is
their portion, so are they His portion ([Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md). A reciprocal tie (compare [Jer
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#019.md); [Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002), Margin.md). Others make "rod" refer
to the tribal rod or scepter.

[Jeremiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 10:17</span></span>

wares--thine effects or movable goods ([Eze
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003).md). Prepare for migrating as
captives to Babylon. The address is to Jerusalem, as representative of
the whole people.

inhabitant of the fortress--rather, "inhabitress of the fortress."
Though thou now seemest to inhabit an impregnable fortress, thou shalt
have to remove. "The land" is the champaign region opposed to the
"fortified" cities. The "fortress" being taken, the whole "land" will
share the disaster. HENDERSON translates, "Gather up thy packages from
the ground." ROSENMULLER, for "fortress," translates, "siege," that is,
the besieged city. The various articles, in this view, are supposed to
be lying about in confusion on the ground during the siege.

[Jeremiah 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 10:18</span></span>

sling out--expressing the violence and suddenness of the removal to
Babylon. A similar image occurs in [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013.md); [Sa1
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029.md); [Isa
22:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017.md).

at this once--at this time, now.

find it so--find it by experience, that is, feel it ([Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010).md). MICHAELIS translates, "I will
bind them together (as in a sling) that they may reach the goal"
(Babylon). English Version is best: "that they may find it so as I have
said" ([Num 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md); [Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 10:19</span></span>

Judea bewails its calamity.

wound--the stroke I suffer under.

I must bear--not humble submission to God's will ([Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009).md), but sullen impenitence. Or,
rather, it is prophetical of their ultimate acknowledgment of their
guilt as the cause of their calamity ([Lam
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039).md).

[Jeremiah 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 10:20</span></span>

tabernacle is spoiled--metaphor from the tents of nomadic life; as these
are taken down in a few moments, so as not to leave a vestige of them,
so Judea ([Jer 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020).md).

cords--with which the coverings of the tent are extended.

curtains--tent-curtains.

[Jeremiah 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 10:21</span></span>

pastors--the rulers, civil and religious. This verse gives the cause of
the impending calamity.

[Jeremiah 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 10:22</span></span>

bruit--rumor of invasion. The antithesis is between the voice of God in
His prophets to whom they turned a deaf ear, and the cry of the enemy, a
new teacher, whom they must hear \[CALVIN\].

north country--Babylon ([Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 10:23</span></span>

Despairing of influencing the people, he turns to God.

way of man not in himself-- ([Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001.md); [Pro
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024.md); [Jam
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md). I know, O Jehovah, that the
march of the Babylonian conqueror against me (Jeremiah identifying
himself with his people) is not at his own discretion, but is overruled
by Thee ([Isa 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); compare [Jer
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019).md).

that walketh--when he walketh, that is, sets out in any undertaking.

direct . . . steps--to give a prosperous issue to ([Psa
73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 10:24</span></span>

Since I (my nation) must be corrected (justice requiring it because of
the deep guilt of the nation), I do not deprecate all chastisement, but
pray only for moderation in it ([Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md); [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md); [Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001).md); and that the full tide of Thy
fury may be poured out on the heathen invaders for their cruelty towards
Thy people. [Psa 79:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md), a psalm to be
referred to the time of the captivity, its composer probably repeated
this from Jeremiah. The imperative, "Pour out," is used instead of the
future, expressing vividly the certainty of the prediction, and that the
word of God itself effects its own declarations. Accordingly, the Jews
were restored after correction; the Babylonians were utterly
extinguished.

know thee . . . call . . . on thy name--Knowledge of God is the
beginning of piety; calling on Him the fruit.

heathen . . . Jacob--He reminds God of the distinction He has made
between His people whom Jacob represents, and the heathen aliens.
Correct us as Thy adopted sons, the seed of Jacob; destroy them as
outcasts ([Zac 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md), [Zac
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#021).md).
