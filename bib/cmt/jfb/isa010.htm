<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005">Isaiah 10:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 10:5</A></FONT></span></p>It was written when Assyria proposed (a design which it soon after tried to carry out under Sennacherib) to destroy Judah and Jerusalem, as it had destroyed Samaria. This is the first part of Isaiah's prophecies under Hezekiah. Probably between 722 and 715 B.C. (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027">Isa 10:27</A>). (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009">Isa 10:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011">Isa 10:11</A> show that Samaria was destroyed before this prophecy)
<p>
<p>O Assyrian, &amp;c.--rather, "What, ho (but MAURER, Woe to the) Assyrian! He is the rod and staff of Mine anger (My instrument in punishing, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020">Jer 51:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013">Psa 17:13</A>). In their hands is Mine indignation" [HORSLEY, after JEROME]. I have put into the Assyrians' hands the execution of Mine indignation against My people.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006">Isaiah 10:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>hypocritical--polluted [HORSLEY].

<p>
<p>give . . . charge-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022">Jer 34:22</A>). 
<p>
<p>and to tread, &amp;c.--HORSLEY translates: "And then to make him (the Assyrian) a trampling under foot like the mire of the streets" (so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012">Isa 10:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001">Isa 33:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005">Zac 10:5</A>). But see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026">Isa 37:26</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007">Isaiah 10:7</A></p>

<p>
<p>think--intend. Sinners' plans are no less culpable, though they by them unconsciously fulfil God's designs (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010">Psa 76:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012">Mic 4:12</A>).

The sinner's motive, not the result (which depends on God), will be the test in judgment. 
<p>
<p>heart to destroy . . . not a few--Sennacherib's ambition was not confined to Judea. His plan was also to conquer Egypt and Ethiopia (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015">Zac 1:15</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>Vauntings of the Assyrians. Illustrated by the self-laudatory inscriptions of Assyria deciphered by HINCKS. 
<p>
<p>princes . . . kings--Eastern satraps and governors of provinces often had the title and diadem of kings. Hence the title, "King of kings," implying the greatness of Him who was over them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007">Eze 26:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012">Ezr 7:12</A>).

<p>
<p>Calno--Calneh, built by Nimrod (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010">Gen 10:10</A>), once his capital, on the Tigris. 
<p>
<p>Carchemish--Circesium, on the Euphrates. Taken afterwards by Necho, king of Egypt; and retaken by Nebuchadnezzar: by the Euphrates (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>Hamath--in Syria, north of Canaan (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018">Gen 10:18</A>). Taken by Assyria about 753 B.C. From it colonists were planted by Assyria in Samaria. 
<p>
<p>Arpad--near Hamath. 
<p>
<p>Samaria--now overthrown. 
<p>
<p>Damascus-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001">Isa 17:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003">Isa 17:3</A>).

<p>
<p>and whose--rather, "and their." This clause, down to "Samaria," is parenthetical. 
<p>
<p>excel--were more powerful. He regards Jerusalem as idolatrous, an opinion which it often had given too much ground for: Jehovah was in his view the mere local god of Judea, as Baal of the countries where it was adored, nay, inferior in power to some national gods (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019">Isa 36:19-20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012">Isa 37:12</A>).

<p>
<p>As my hand . . . shall I not, as I have--a double protasis. Agitation makes one accumulate sentences.

<p>
<p>Zion--the royal residence, the court, princes and nobles; as distinguished from "Jerusalem," the people in general. 
<p>
<p>fruit--the result of, that is, the plants emanating from. 
<p>
<p>stout--Hebrew, "greatness of," that is, pride of. 
<p>
<p>glory--haughtiness.

<p>
<p>removed the bounds--set aside old, and substituted new boundaries of kingdoms at will. A criminal act, as Jehovah Himself had appointed the boundaries of the nations (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008">Deu 32:8</A>). 
<p>
<p>treasures--"hoarded treasures" [HORSLEY]. 
<p>
<p>put down . . . inhabitants like, &amp;c.--rather, "as a valiant man, I have brought down (from their seats) those seated" (namely, "on thrones"; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004">Psa 2:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010">Psa 29:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019">Psa 55:19</A>.

<p>
<p>left--by the parent bird. 
<p>
<p>none . . . moved . . . wing--image from an angry bird resisting the robbery of its "nest." 
<p>
<p>peeped--chirped even low (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019">Isa 8:19</A>). No resistance was offered me, of deed, or even word.

<p>
<p>shaketh it--moves it back and forward. 
<p>
<p>staff . . . lift . . . itself . . . no wood--rather, "as if the staff (man, the instrument of God's judgments on his fellow man) should set aside (Him who is) not wood" (not a mere instrument, as man). On "no wood" compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021">Deu 32:21</A>, "that which is not God;" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008">Isa 31:8</A> shows that God is meant here by "not wood" [MAURER].

<p>
<p>leanness--carrying out the image on "fat ones." Destruction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015">Psa 106:15</A>). Fulfilled (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036">Isa 37:36</A>).

<p>in one day-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036">Isa 37:36</A>). 
<p>
<p>fruitful field--literally, "Carmel," a rich mountain in the tribe of Asher. Figurative for Sennacherib's mighty army. Perhaps alluding to his own boasting words about to be uttered (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024">Isa 37:24</A>), "I will enter the forest of his Carmel." 
<p>
<p>soul and body--proverbial for utterly; the entire man is made up of soul and body. 
<p>
<p>as when a standard bearer fainteth--rather, "they shall be as when a sick man" (from a Syriac root) wastes away." Compare "leanness," that is, wasting destruction (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016">Isa 10:16</A>) [MAURER]. Or, "there shall be an entire dissipation, like a perfect melting" (namely, of the Assyrian army) [HORSLEY].

<p>From the local and temporary national deliverance the prophet passes by the law of suggestion in an easy transition to the end of all prophecy--the everlasting deliverance under Messiah's reign, not merely His first coming, but chiefly His second coming. The language and illustrations are still drawn from the temporary national subject, with which he began, but the glories described pertain to Messiah's reign. Hezekiah cannot, as some think, be the subject; for he was already come, whereas the "stem of Jesse" was yet future ("shall come") (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011">Mic 4:11</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001">Mic 5:1-2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15-16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012">Rom 15:12</A>).
