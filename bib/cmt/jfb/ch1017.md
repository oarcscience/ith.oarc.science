### [1 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 17:1</span></span>

DAVID FORBIDDEN TO BUILD GOD A HOUSE. ([Ch1
17:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001).md)

as David sat in his house--The details of this chapter were given in
nearly similar terms (2Sa. 7:1-29). The date was towards the latter end
of David's reign, for it is expressly said in the former book to have
been at the cessation of all his wars. But as to narrate the
preparations for the removal of the ark and the erection of the temple
was the principal object of the historian, the exact chronology is not
followed.

[1 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 17:5</span></span>

I . . . have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to
another--The literal rendering is, "I was walking in a tent and in a
dwelling." The evident intention (as we may see from [Ch1
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#006).md) was to lay stress upon the fact
that God was a Mithhatlek (a travelling God) and went from one place to
another with His tent and His entire dwelling (the dwelling included not
merely the tent, but the fore-courts with the altar of burnt offerings,
&c.) \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 17:6</span></span>

spake I a word to any of the judges--In [Sa2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007.md) it is "any of the tribes" of
Israel. Both are included. But the judges "who were commanded to feed
the people," form the more suitable antithesis to David.

Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?--that is, a solid and
magnificent temple.

[1 Chronicles 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 17:7</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote--a round
tower of rude construction, high walled, but open at the top, in which
sheep are often enclosed at night to protect them from wild beasts. The
meaning is, I elevated you to the throne from a humble condition solely
by an act of divine grace, and not from any antecedent merits of your
own (see on [Sa1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011).md), and I enabled
you to acquire renown, equal or superior to any other monarch. Your
reign will ever be afterwards regarded as the best and brightest era in
the history of Israel, for it will secure to the nation a settled
inheritance of prosperity and peace, without any of the oppressions or
disorders that afflicted them in early times.

[1 Chronicles 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 17:9</span></span>

at the beginning, and since the time that I commanded judges--that is,
including the whole period from Joshua to Saul.

I tell thee that the Lord will build thee an house--This was the
language of Nathan himself, who was specially directed to assure David,
not only of personal blessing and prosperity, but of a continuous line
of royal descendants.

[1 Chronicles 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 17:11</span></span>

I will raise up thy seed--(See on [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).md).

[1 Chronicles 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 17:13</span></span>

I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
before thee--My procedure in dealing with him will be different from My
disposal of Saul. Should his misconduct call for personal chastisement,
I shall spare his family. If I see it necessary to withdraw My favor and
help for a time, it will be a corrective discipline only to reform and
restore, not to destroy. (On this passage some have founded an argument
for Solomon's repentance and return to God).

[1 Chronicles 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 17:14</span></span>

I will settle him in my house--over My people Israel.

and in my kingdom for ever--God here asserts His right of supreme
sovereignty in Israel. David and Solomon, with their successors, were
only the vicegerents whom He nominated, or, in His providence,
permitted.

his throne shall be established for evermore--The posterity of David
inherited the throne in a long succession--but not always. In such a
connection as this, the phrase "for evermore" is employed in a
restricted sense (see on [Lam 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#031).md).
We naturally expect the prophet to revert to David before concluding,
after having spoken ([Ch1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012).md) of
the building of Solomon's temple. The promise that his house should be
blessed was intended as a compensation for the disappointment of his
wish to build the temple, and hence this assurance is appropriately
repeated at the conclusion of the prophet's address \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 17:15</span></span>

According to all . . . this vision--The revelation of the divine will
was made to the prophet in a dream.

[1 Chronicles 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 17:16</span></span>

David the king . . . sat before the Lord, and said--(See on [Sa2
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018).md).
