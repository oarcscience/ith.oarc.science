### [Psalms Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 29:1</span></span>

Trust in God is encouraged by the celebration of His mighty power as
illustrated in His dominion over the natural world, in some of its most
terrible and wonderful exhibitions. ([Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001).md)

Give--or, "ascribe" ([Deu 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#003).md).

mighty--or, "sons of the mighty" ([Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006).md). Heavenly beings, as angels.

[Psalms 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 29:2</span></span>

name--as ([Psa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md); [Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001).md).

beauty of holiness--the loveliness of a spiritual worship, of which the
perceptible beauty of the sanctuary worship was but a type.

[Psalms 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 29:3</span></span>

The voice of the Lord--audible exhibition of His power in the tempest,
of which thunder is a specimen, but not the uniform or sole example.

the waters--the clouds or vapors ([Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 29:4</span></span>

powerful . . . majesty--literally, "in power, in majesty."

[Psalms 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 29:5</span></span>

The tall and large cedars, especially of Lebanon, are shivered, utterly
broken. The waving of the mountain forests before the wind is expressed
by the figure of skipping or leaping.

[Psalms 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 29:7</span></span>

divideth--literally, "hews off." The lightning, like flakes and
splinters hewed from stone or wood, flies through the air.

[Psalms 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 29:8</span></span>

the wilderness--especially Kadesh, south of Judea, is selected as
another scene of this display of divine power, as a vast and desolate
region impresses the mind, like mountains, with images of grandeur.

[Psalms 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 29:9</span></span>

Terror-stricken animals and denuded forests close the illustration. In
view of this scene of awful sublimity, God's worshippers respond to the
call of [Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md), and speak or cry,
"Glory!" By "temple," or "palace" (God's residence, [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md), may here be meant heaven, or the
whole frame of nature, as the angels are called on for praise.

[Psalms 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 29:10</span></span>

Over this terrible raging of the elements God is enthroned, directing
and restraining by sovereign power; and hence the comfort of His people.
"This awful God is ours, our Father and our Love."
