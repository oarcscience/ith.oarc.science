### [Isaiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 23:1</span></span>

PROPHECY RESPECTING TYRE. (Isa. 23:1-18)

Tyre--Hebrew, Tsur, that is, "Rock."

ships of Tarshish--ships of Tyre returning from their voyage to
Tarshish, or Tartessus in Spain, with which the PhÅ“nicians had much
commerce ([Eze 27:12-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012).md). "Ships of
Tarshish" is a phrase also used of large and distant-voyaging merchant
vessels ([Isa 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016.md); [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md); [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007).md).

no house--namely, left; such was the case as to Old Tyre, after
Nebuchadnezzar's siege.

no entering--There is no house to enter ([Isa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010).md) \[G. V. SMITH\]. Or, Tyre is so
laid waste, that there is no possibility of entering the harbor
\[BARNES\]; which is appropriate to the previous "ships."

Chittim--Cyprus, of which the cities, including Citium in the south
(whence came "Chittim"), were mostly PhÅ“nician ([Eze
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#006).md). The ships from Tarshish on
their way to Tyre learn the tidings ("it is revealed to them") of the
downfall of Tyre. At a later period Chittim denoted the islands and
coasts of the Mediterranean ([Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030).md).

[Isaiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 23:2</span></span>

Be still--"struck dumb with awe." Addressed to those already in the
country, eye-witnesses of its ruin ([Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md); or, in contrast to the busy din
of commerce once heard in Tyre; now all is hushed and still.

isle--strictly applicable to New Tyre: in the sense coast, to the
mainland city, Old Tyre (compare [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md); [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006).md).

Zidon--of which Tyre was a colony, planted when Zidon was conquered by
the Philistines of Ascalon. Zidon means a "fishing station"; this was
its beginning.

replenished--with wealth and an industrious population ([Eze
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003.md), [Eze
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#008.md), [Eze
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023).md). Here "Zidon," as the oldest
city of PhÅ“nicia, includes all the PhÅ“nician towns on the strip of
"coast." Thus, Eth-baal, king of Tyre \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.3,2\],
is called king of the Sidonians ([Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md); and on coins Tyre is called
the metropolis of the Sidonians.

[Isaiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 23:3</span></span>

great waters--the wide waters of the sea.

seed--"grain," or crop, as in [Sa1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015.md); [Job
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#012.md).

Sihor--literally, "dark-colored"; applied to the Nile, as the Egyptian
Jeor, and the Greek Melas, to express the "dark, turbid" colors given to
its waters by the fertilizing soil which it deposits at its yearly
overflow ([Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018).md).

harvest of the river--the growth of the Delta; the produce due to the
overflow of the Nile: Egypt was the great granary of corn in the ancient
world (Gen. 41:1-57; Gen. 42:1-38; Gen. 43:1-34).

her revenue--Tyrian vessels carried Egyptian produce obtained in
exchange for wine, oil, glass, &c., into various lands, and so made
large profits.

mart-- ([Eze 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003).md). No city was more
favorably situated for commerce.

[Isaiah 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 23:4</span></span>

Zidon--called on, as being the parent country of Tyre ([Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012).md), and here equivalent to
PhÅ“nicia in general, to feel the shame (as it was esteemed in the East)
of being now as childless as if she never had any. "I (no more now)
travail, nor bring forth," &c. "Strength of the sea," that is,
stronghold, namely, New Tyre, on a rock (as "Tyre" means) surrounded by
the sea ([Eze 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#004.md), [Eze
26:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#014.md); so Venice was called "Bride
of the sea"; [Zac 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 23:5</span></span>

As, &c.--rather, "When the report (shall reach) the people of Egypt,
they shall be sorely pained at the report concerning Tyre" (namely, its
overthrow). So JEROME, "When the Egyptians shall hear that so powerful a
neighboring nation has been destroyed, they must know their own end is
near" \[LOWTH, &c.\].

[Isaiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 23:6</span></span>

Pass . . . over--Escape from Tyre to your colonies as Tarshish (compare
[Isa 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012).md). The Tyrians fled to
Carthage and elsewhere, both at the siege under Nebuchadnezzar and that
under Alexander.

[Isaiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 23:7</span></span>

Is this silent ruin all that is left of your once joyous city ([Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012).md)?

antiquity--The Tyrian priests boasted in HERODOTUS' time that their city
had already existed 2300 years: an exaggeration, but still implying that
it was ancient even then.

her own feet--walking on foot as captives to an enemy's land.

[Isaiah 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 23:8</span></span>

Who--answered in [Isa 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009.md), "The Lord
of hosts."

crowning--crown-giving; that is, the city from which dependent kingdoms
had arisen, as Tartessus in Spain, Citium in Cyprus, and Carthage in
Africa ([Eze 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#033).md).

traffickers--literally, "Canaanites," who were famed for commerce
(compare [Hos 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007), Margin.md).

[Isaiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 23:9</span></span>

Whoever be the instruments in overthrowing haughty sinners, God, who has
all hosts at His command, is the First Cause ([Isa
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

stain--rather, "to profane"; as in [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md), the Sabbath, and other objects
of religious reverence; so here, "the pride of all glory" may refer to
the Tyrian temple of Hercules, the oldest in the world, according to
ARRIAN ([Isa 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016).md); the prophet of the
true God would naturally single out for notice the idol of Tyre \[G. V.
SMITH\]. It may, however, be a general proposition; the destruction of
Tyre will exhibit to all how God mars the luster of whatever is haughty
([Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 23:10</span></span>

a river--Hebrew, "the river," namely, Nile.

daughter of Tarshish--Tyre and its inhabitants ([Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md), about henceforth, owing to the
ruin of Tyre, to become inhabitants of its colony, Tartessus: they would
pour forth from Tyre, as waters flow on when the barriers are removed
\[LOWTH\]. Rather, Tarshish, or Tartessus and its inhabitants, as the
phrase usually means: they had been kept in hard bondage, working in
silver and lead mines near Tarshish, by the parent city ([Eze
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#017).md): but now "the bond of
restraint" (for so "strength," Margin, "girdle," that is, bond, [Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003), ought to be translated.md) is
removed, since Tyre is no more.

[Isaiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 23:11</span></span>

He--Jehovah.

kingdoms--the PhÅ“nician cities and colonies.

the merchant city--rather, Canaan, meaning the north of it, namely,
PhÅ“nicia. On their coins, they call their country Canaan.

[Isaiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 23:12</span></span>

he--God.

rejoice--riotously ([Isa 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007).md).

oppressed--"deflowered"; laying aside the figure "taken by storm"; the
Arabs compare a city never taken to an undefiled virgin (compare [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005), &c..md).

daughter of Zidon--Tyre: or else, sons of Zidon, that is, the whole land
and people of PhÅ“nicia (see on [Isa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002).md) \[MAURER\].

Chittim--Citium in Cyprus ([Isa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001).md).

there also . . . no rest--Thy colonies, having been harshly treated by
thee, will now repay thee in kind (see on [Isa
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010).md). But VITRINGA refers it to the
calamities which befell the Tyrians in their settlements subsequently,
namely, Sicily, Corcyra, Carthage, and Spain, all flowing from the
original curse of Noah against the posterity of Canaan ([Gen
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025).md).

[Isaiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 23:13</span></span>

Behold--Calling attention to the fact, so humiliating to Tyre, that a
people of yesterday, like the Chaldees, should destroy the most ancient
of cities, Tyre.

was not--had no existence as a recognized nation; the Chaldees were
previously but a rude, predatory people ([Job
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017).md).

Assyrian founded it--The Chaldees ("them that dwell in the wilderness")
lived a nomadic life in the mountains of Armenia originally (Arphaxad,
in [Gen 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md), refers to such a region
of Assyria near Armenia), north and east of Assyria proper. Some may
have settled in Mesopotamia and Babylonia very early and given origin to
the astrologers called Chaldees in later times. But most of the people
had been transferred only a little before the time of this prophecy from
their original seats in the north to Mesopotamia, and soon afterwards to
South Babylonia. "Founded it," means "assigned it (the land) to them who
had (heretofore) dwelt in the wilderness" as a permanent settlement (so
in [Psa 104:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#008).md) \[MAURER\]. It was the
Assyrian policy to infuse into their own population of the plain the
fresh blood of hardy mountaineers, for the sake of recruiting their
armies. Ultimately the Chaldees, by their powerful priest-caste, gained
the supremacy and established the later or Chaldean empire. HORSLEY
refers it to Tyre, founded by an Assyrian race.

towers thereof--namely, of Babylon, whose towers, HERODOTUS says, were
"set up" by the Assyrians \[BARNES\]. Rather, "The Chaldees set up their
siege-towers" against Tyre, made for the attack of high walls, from
which the besiegers hurled missiles, as depicted in the Assyrian
sculptures \[G. V. SMITH\].

raised up--rather, "They lay bare," namely, the foundations of "her
(Tyre's) palaces," that is, utterly overthrew them ([Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 23:14</span></span>

strength--stronghold (compare [Eze
26:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 23:15</span></span>

forgotten--Having lost its former renown, Tyre shall be in obscurity.

seventy years--(so [Jer 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md).

days of one king--that is, a dynasty. The Babylonian monarchy lasted
properly but seventy years. From the first year of Nebuchadnezzar to the
taking of Babylon, by Cyrus, was seventy years; then the subjected
nations would be restored to liberty. Tyre was taken in the middle of
that period, but it is classed in common with the rest, some conquered
sooner and others later, all, however, alike to be delivered at the end
of the period. So "king" is used for dynasty ([Dan
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017.md); [Dan
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020).md): Nebuchadnezzar, his son
Evil-merodach, and his grandson, Belshazzar, formed the whole dynasty
([Jer 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md).

shall Tyre sing as . . . harlot--It shall be to Tyre as the song of the
harlot, namely, a harlot that has been forgotten, but who attracts
notice again by her song. Large marts of commerce are often compared to
harlots seeking many lovers, that is, they court merchants of all
nations, and admit any one for the sake of gain ([Nah
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md); [Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003).md). Covetousness is closely akin to
idolatry and licentiousness, as the connection ([Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md) proves (compare [Isa
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md), [Isa
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 23:16</span></span>

Same figure \[[Isa 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)\] to express
that Tyre would again prosper and attract commercial intercourse of
nations to her, and be the same joyous, self-indulging city as before.

[Isaiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 23:17</span></span>

visit--not in wrath, but mercy.

hire--image from a harlot: her gains by commerce. After the Babylonian
dynasty was ended, Tyre was rebuilt; also, again, after the destruction
under Alexander.

[Isaiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 23:18</span></span>

merchandise . . . holiness--Her traffic and gains shall at last (long
after the restoration mentioned in [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017).md) be consecrated to Jehovah.
Jesus Christ visited the neighborhood of Tyre ([Mat
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).md); Paul found disciples there
([Act 21:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003).md); it early became a
Christian bishopric, but the full evangelization of that whole race, as
of the Ethiopians ([Isa 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md), of
the Egyptians and Assyrians (Isa. 19:1-25), is yet to come ([Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005).md).

not treasured--but freely expended in His service.

them that dwell before the Lord--the ministers of religion. But HORSLEY
translates, "them that sit before Jehovah" as disciples.

durable clothing--Changes of raiment constituted much of the wealth of
former days.

The four chapters (the twenty-fourth through the twenty-seventh) form
one continuous poetical prophecy: descriptive of the dispersion and
successive calamities of the Jews ([Isa
24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001).md); the preaching of the Gospel
by the first Hebrew converts throughout the world ([Isa
24:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013).md); the judgments on the
adversaries of the Church and its final triumph ([Isa
24:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016).md); thanksgiving for the
overthrow of the apostate faction ([Isa
25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001).md), and establishment of the
righteous in lasting peace (Isa. 26:1-21); judgment on leviathan and
entire purgation of the Church ([Isa
27:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md). Having treated of the
several nations in particular--Babylon, Philistia, Moab, Syria, Israel,
Egypt, Edom, and Tyre (the miniature representative of all, as all
kingdoms flocked into it)--he passes to the last times of the world at
large and of Judah the representative and future head of the churches.
