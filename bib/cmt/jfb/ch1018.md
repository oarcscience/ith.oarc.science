### [1 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 18:1</span></span>

DAVID SUBDUES THE PHILISTINES AND MOABITES. ([Ch1
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001))

David . . . took Gath and her towns--The full extent of David's
conquests in the Philistine territory is here distinctly stated, whereas
in the parallel passage ([Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001)) it
was only described in a general way. Gath was the "Metheg-ammah," or
"arm-bridle," as it is there called--either from its supremacy as the
capital over the other Philistine towns, or because, in the capture of
that important place and its dependencies, he obtained the complete
control of his restless neighbors.

[1 Chronicles 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 18:2</span></span>

he smote Moab--The terrible severities by which David's conquest of that
people was marked, and the probable reason of their being subjected to
such a dreadful retribution, are narrated ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)).

the Moabites . . . brought gifts--that is, became tributary to Israel.

[1 Chronicles 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 18:3</span></span>

DAVID SMITES HADADEZER AND THE SYRIANS. ([Ch1
18:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003))

Hadarezer--or, "Hadadezer" ([Sa2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003)),
which was probably the original form of the name, was derived from
Hadad, a Syrian deity. It seems to have become the official and
hereditary title of the rulers of that kingdom.

Zobah--Its situation is determined by the words "unto" or "towards
Hamath," a little to the northeast of Damascus, and is supposed by some
to be the same place as in earlier times was called Hobah ([Gen
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#015)). Previous to the rise of
Damascus, Zobah was the capital of the kingdom which held supremacy
among the petty states of Syria.

as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates--Some refer
this to David, who was seeking to extend his possessions in one
direction towards a point bordering on the Euphrates, in accordance with
the promise ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017)). But others are of opinion
that, as David's name is mentioned ([Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004)), this reference is most
applicable to Hadadezer.

[1 Chronicles 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 18:4</span></span>

And David took from him a thousand chariots--(See on [Sa2
8:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003)). In [Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004) David is said to have taken seven
hundred horsemen, whereas here it is said that he took seven thousand.
This great discrepancy in the text of the two narratives seems to have
originated with a transcriber in confounding the two Hebrew letters
which indicate the numbers, and in neglecting to mark or obscure the
points over one of them. We have no means of ascertaining whether seven
hundred or seven thousand be the more correct. Probably the former
should be adopted \[DAVIDSON'S HERMENUTICS\].

but reserved of them an hundred chariots--probably to grace a triumphal
procession on his return to Jerusalem, and after using them in that way,
destroy them like the rest.

[1 Chronicles 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 18:8</span></span>

from Tibhath and from Chun--These places are called Betah and Berothai
([Sa2 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008)). Perhaps the one might be
the Jewish, the other the Syrian, name of these towns. Neither their
situation nor the connection between them is known. The Arabic version
makes them to be Emesa (now Hems) and Baal-bek, both of which agree very
well with the relative position of Zobah.

[1 Chronicles 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 18:9</span></span>

Tou--or Toi--whose dominions border on those of Hadadezer. (See on [Sa2
8:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009); [Kg1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015)).

[1 Chronicles 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 18:17</span></span>

the Cherethites and the Pelethites--who formed the royal bodyguard. The
Cherethites were, most probably, those brave men who all along
accompanied David while among the Philistines, and from that people
derived their name ([Sa1 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014); [Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016); [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005)) as well as their skill in
archery--while the Pelethites were those who joined him at Ziklag, took
their name from Pelet, the chief man in the company ([Ch1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#003)), and, being Benjamites, were
expert in the use of the sling.
