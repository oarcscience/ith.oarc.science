### [Ezekiel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 11:1</span></span>

PROPHECY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CORRUPT "PRINCES OF THE PEOPLE;"
PELATIAH DIES; PROMISE OF GRACE TO THE BELIEVING REMNANT; DEPARTURE OF
THE GLORY OF GOD FROM THE CITY; EZEKIEL'S RETURN TO THE CAPTIVES. (Eze.
11:1-25)

east gate--to which the glory of God had moved itself ([Eze
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019).md), the chief entrance of the
sanctuary; the portico or porch of Solomon. The Spirit moves the prophet
thither, to witness, in the presence of the divine glory, a new scene of
destruction.

five and twenty men--The same as the twenty-five (that is, twenty-four
heads of courses, and the high priest) sun-worshippers seen in [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md). The leading priests were usually
called "princes of the sanctuary" ([Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028).md) and "chiefs of the priests"
([Ch2 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014).md); but here two of them are
called "princes of the people," with irony, as using their priestly
influence to be ringleaders of the people in sin ([Eze
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#002).md). Already the wrath of God had
visited the people represented by the elders ([Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006).md); also the glory of the Lord had
left its place in the holy of holies, and, like the cherubim and flaming
sword in Eden, had occupied the gate into the deserted sanctuary. The
judgment on the representatives of the priesthood naturally follows
here, just as the sin of the priests had followed in the description
([Eze 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md), [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016).md) after the sin of the elders.

Jaazaniah--signifying "God hears."

son of Azur--different from Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan ([Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011).md). Azur means "help." He and
Pelatiah ("God delivers"), son of Benaiah ("God builds"), are singled
out as Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, in the case of the seventy elders
([Eze 8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011).md), because their names
ought to have reminded them that "God" would have "heard" had they
sought His "help" to "deliver" and "build" them up. But, neglecting
this, they incurred the heavier judgment by the very relation in which
they stood to God \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 11:2</span></span>

he--the Lord sitting on the cherubim ([Eze
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002).md).

wicked counsel--in opposition to the prophets of God ([Eze
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 11:3</span></span>

It is not near--namely, the destruction of the city; therefore "let us
build houses," as if there was no fear. But the Hebrew opposes English
Version, which would require the infinitive absolute. Rather, "Not at
hand is the building of houses." They sneer at Jeremiah's letter to the
captives, among whom Ezekiel lived ([Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005).md). "Build ye houses, and dwell in
them," that is, do not fancy, as many persuade you, that your sojourn in
Babylon is to be short; it will be for seventy years ([Jer
25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md); therefore build houses and
settle quietly there. The scorners in Jerusalem reply, Those far off in
exile may build if they please, but it is too remote a concern for us to
trouble ourselves about \[FAIRBAIRN\], (Compare [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md), [Eze
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027.md); [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).md).

this city . . . caldron . . . we . . . flesh--sneering at [Jer
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013.md), when he compared the city to a
caldron with its mouth towards the north. "Let Jerusalem be so if you
will, and we the flesh, exposed to the raging foe from the north, still
its fortifications will secure us from the flame of war outside; the
city must stand for our sakes, just as the pot exists for the safety of
the flesh in it." In opposition to this God says ([Eze
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#011).md), "This city shall not be your
caldron, to defend you in it from the foe outside: nay, ye shall be
driven out of your imaginary sanctuary and slain in the border of the
land. "But," says God, in [Eze 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007.md),
"your slain are the flesh, and this city the caldron; but (not as you
fancy, shall ye be kept safe inside) I will bring you forth out of the
midst of it"; and again, in [Eze 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md),
"Though not a caldron in your sense, Jerusalem shall be so in the sense
of its being exposed to a consuming foe, and you yourselves in it and
with it."

[Ezekiel 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 11:4</span></span>

prophesy . . . prophesy--The repetition marks emphatic earnestness.

[Ezekiel 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 11:5</span></span>

Spirit . . . fell upon me--stronger than "entered into me" ([Eze
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002.md); [Eze
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024).md), implying the zeal of the Spirit
of God roused to immediate indignation at the contempt of God shown by
the scorners.

I know-- ([Psa 139:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001).md). Your scornful
jests at My word escape not My notice.

[Ezekiel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 11:6</span></span>

your slain--those on whom you have brought ruin by your wicked counsels.
Bloody crimes within the city brought on it a bloody foe from without
([Eze 7:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023).md). They had made it a
caldron in which to boil the flesh of God's people ([Mic
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001).md), and eat it by unrighteous
oppression; therefore God will make it a caldron in a different sense,
one not wherein they may be safe in their guilt, but "out of the midst
of" which they shall be "brought forth" ([Jer
34:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 11:7</span></span>

The city is a caldron to them, but it shall not be so to you. Ye shall
meet your doom on the frontier.

[Ezekiel 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 11:8</span></span>

The Chaldean sword, to escape which ye abandoned your God, shall be
brought on you by God because of that very abandonment of Him.

[Ezekiel 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 11:9</span></span>

out of the midst thereof--that is, of the city, as captives led into the
open plain for judgment.

[Ezekiel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 11:10</span></span>

in the border of Israel--on the frontier: at Riblah, in the land of
Hamath (compare [Kg2 25:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md), with
[Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065).md).

ye shall know that I am the Lord--by the judgments I inflict ([Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 11:11</span></span>

(See on [Eze 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 11:12</span></span>

([Deu 12:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#030).md).

[Ezekiel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 11:13</span></span>

Pelaliah--probably the ringleader of the scorners ([Eze
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001).md) was an earnest of the
destruction of the rest of the twenty-five, as Ezekiel had foretold, as
also of the general ruin.

fell . . . upon . . . face--(See on [Eze
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008).md).

wilt thou make a full end of the remnant--Is Pelatiah's destruction to
be the token of the destruction of all, even of the remnant? The people
regarded Pelatiah as a mainstay of the city. His name (derived from a
Hebrew root, "a remnant," or else "God delivers") suggested hope. Is
that hope, asks Ezekiel, to be disappointed?

[Ezekiel 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 11:15</span></span>

thy brethren . . . brethren--The repetition implies, "Thy real brethren"
are no longer the priests at Jerusalem with whom thou art connected by
the natural ties of blood and common temple service, but thy fellow
exiles on the Chebar, and the house of Israel whosoever of them belong
to the remnant to be spared.

men of thy kindred--literally, "of thy redemption," that is, the nearest
relatives, whose duty it was to do the part of Goel, or vindicator and
redeemer of a forfeited inheritance ([Lev
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025).md). Ezekiel, seeing the priesthood
doomed to destruction, as a priest, felt anxious to vindicate their
cause, as if they were his nearest kinsmen and he their Goel. But he is
told to look for his true kinsmen in those, his fellow exiles, whom his
natural kinsmen at Jerusalem despised, and he is to be their vindicator.
Spiritual ties, as in the case of Levi ([Deu
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009).md), the type of Messiah ([Mat
12:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#047).md) are to supersede natural
ones where the two clash. The hope of better days was to rise from the
despised exiles. The gospel principle is shadowed forth here, that the
despised of men are often the chosen of God and the highly esteemed
among men are often an abomination before Him ([Luk
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md); [Co1
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md). "No door of hope but in the
valley of Achor" ("trouble," [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015).md), \[FAIRBAIRN\].

Get you far . . . unto us is this land--the contemptuous words of those
left still in the city at the carrying away of Jeconiah to the exiles,
"However far ye be outcasts from the Lord and His temple, we are secure
in our possession of the land."

[Ezekiel 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 11:16</span></span>

Although--anticipating the objection of the priests at Jerusalem, that
the exiles were "cast far off." Though this be so, and they are far from
the outer temple at Jerusalem, I will be their asylum or sanctuary
instead ([Psa 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md); [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009.md); [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014).md). My shrine is the humble heart:
a preparation for gospel catholicity when the local and material temple
should give place to the spiritual ([Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md); [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md); [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md); [Joh
4:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md); [Act
7:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048).md). The trying discipline of the
exile was to chasten the outcasts so as to be meet recipients of God's
grace, for which the carnal confidence of the priests disqualified them.
The dispersion served the end of spiritualizing and enlarging the views
even of the better Jews, so as to be able to worship God everywhere
without a material temple; and, at the same time, it diffused some
knowledge of God among the greatest Gentile nations, thus providing
materials for the gathering in of the Christian Church among the
Gentiles; so marvellously did God overrule a present evil for an
ultimate good. Still more does all this hold good in the present much
longer dispersion which is preparing for a more perfect and universal
restoration ([Isa 2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016).md). Their long privation of the
temple will prepare them for appreciating the more, but without Jewish
narrowness, the temple that is to be (Eze. 40:1-44:31).

a little--rather, "for a little season"; No matter how long the
captivity may be, the seventy years will be but as a little season,
compared with their long subsequent settlement in their land. This holds
true only partially in the case of the first restoration; but as in a
few centuries they were dispersed again, the full and permanent
restoration is yet future ([Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 11:17</span></span>

([Eze 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md); [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md); [Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024).md).

[Ezekiel 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 11:18</span></span>

They have eschewed every vestige of idolatry ever since their return
from Babylon. But still the Shekinah glory had departed, the ark was not
restored, nor was the second temple strictly inhabited by God until He
came who made it more glorious than the first temple ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md); even then His stay was short,
and ended in His being rejected; so that the full realization of the
promise must still be future.

[Ezekiel 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 11:19</span></span>

I will give them--lest they should claim to themselves the praise given
them in [Eze 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md), God declares it is
to be the free gift of His Spirit.

one heart--not singleness, that is, uprightness, but oneness of heart in
all, unanimously seeking Him in contrast to their state at that time,
when only single scattered individuals sought God ([Jer
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039.md); [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md) \[HENGSTENBERG\]. Or, "content
with one God," not distracted with "the many detestable things" ([Eze
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md); [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md); [Hos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002).md) \[CALVIN\].

new spirit-- ([Psa 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033).md). Realized fully in the "new
creature" of the New Testament ([Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017).md); having new motives, new rules,
new aims.

stony heart--like "adamant" ([Zac
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012).md); the natural heart of every man.

heart of flesh--impressible to what is good, tender.

[Ezekiel 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 11:20</span></span>

walk in my statutes--Regeneration shows itself by its fruits ([Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md), [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025).md).

they . . . my people, . . . I . . . their God-- ([Eze
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#011.md); [Eze
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md); [Jer
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007).md). In its fullest sense still
future ([Zac 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 11:21</span></span>

whose heart . . . after . . . heart of . . . detestable things--The
repetition of "heart" is emphatic, signifying that the heart of those
who so obstinately clung to idols, impelled itself to fresh
superstitions in one continuous tenor \[CALVIN\]. Perhaps it is implied
that they and their idols are much alike in character ([Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008).md). The heart walks astray first,
the feet follow.

recompense . . . way upon . . . heads--They have abandoned Me, so will I
abandon them; they profaned My temple, so will I profane it by the
Chaldeans ([Eze 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 11:23</span></span>

The Shekinah glory now moves from the east gate ([Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md), [Eze
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019).md) to the Mount of Olives,
altogether abandoning the temple. The mount was chosen as being the
height whence the missiles of the foe were about to descend on the city.
So it was from it that Jesus ascended to heaven when about to send His
judgments on the Jews; and from it He predicted its overthrow before His
crucifixion ([Mat 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003).md). It is also to
be the scene of His return in person to deliver His people ([Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md), when He shall come by the same
way as He went, "the way of the east" ([Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 11:24</span></span>

brought me in a vision--not in actual fact, but in ecstatic vision. He
had been as to the outward world all the time before the elders ([Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003).md) in Chaldea; he now reports what
he had witnessed with the inner eye.

[Ezekiel 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 11:25</span></span>

things . . . showed me--literally, "words"; an appropriate expression;
for the word communicated to him was not simply a word, but one clothed
with outward symbols "shown" to him as in the sacrament, which AUGUSTINE
terms "the visible word" \[CALVIN\].
