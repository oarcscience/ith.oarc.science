### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 5:1</span></span>

NAAMAN'S LEPROSY. ([Kg2 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001).md)

Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with
his master--highly esteemed for his military character and success.

and honourable--rather, "very rich."

but he was a leper--This leprosy, which, in Israel, would have excluded
him from society, did not affect his free intercourse in the court of
Syria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 5:2</span></span>

a little maid--who had been captured in one of the many predatory
incursions which were then made by the Syrians on the northern border of
Israel (see [Sa1 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008.md); [Kg2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md); [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md). By this young Hebrew slave of
his wife, Naaman's attention was directed to the prophet of Israel, as
the person who would remove his leprosy. Naaman, on communicating the
matter to his royal master, was immediately furnished with a letter to
the king of Israel, and set out for Samaria, carrying with him, as an
indispensable preliminary in the East, very costly presents.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 5:5</span></span>

ten talents of silver--Â£3421; 6000 shekels of gold; a large sum of
uncertain value.

ten changes of raiment--splendid dresses, for festive occasions--the
honor being thought to consist not only in the beauty and fineness of
the material, but on having a variety to put on one after another, in
the same night.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 5:7</span></span>

when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his
clothes--According to an ancient practice among the Eastern people, the
main object only was stated in the letter that was carried by the party
concerned, while other circumstances were left to be explained at the
interview. This explains Jehoram's burst of emotion--not horror at
supposed blasphemy, but alarm and suspicion that this was merely made an
occasion for a quarrel. Such a prince as he was would not readily think
of Elisha, or, perhaps, have heard of his miraculous deeds.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 5:8</span></span>

ELISHA SENDS HIM TO JORDAN, AND HE IS HEALED. ([Kg2
5:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008).md)

when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent
his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, . . . let him come now to
me--This was the grand and ultimate object to which, in the providence
of God, the journey of Naaman was subservient. When the Syrian general,
with his imposing retinue, arrived at the prophet's house, Elisha sent
him a message to "go and wash in Jordan seven times." This apparently
rude reception to a foreigner of so high dignity incensed Naaman to such
a degree that he resolved to depart, scornfully boasting that the rivers
of Damascus were better than all the waters of Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 5:11</span></span>

strike his hand over the place--that is, wave it over the diseased parts
of his body. It was anciently, and still continues to be, a very
prevalent superstition in the East that the hand of a king, or person of
great reputed sanctity, touching, or waved over a sore, will heal it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 5:12</span></span>

Abana and Pharpar--the Barrady and one of its five
tributaries--uncertain which. The waters of Damascus are still highly
extolled by their inhabitants for their purity and coldness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 5:14</span></span>

Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan--Persuaded
by his calmer and more reflecting attendants to try a method so simple
and easy, he followed their instructions, and was cured. The cure was
performed on the basis of God's covenant with Israel, by which the land,
and all pertaining to it, was blessed. Seven was the symbol of the
covenant \[KEIL\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 5:15</span></span>

ELISHA REFUSES NAAMAN'S GIFTS. ([Kg2
5:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015).md)

he returned to the man of God--After the miraculous cure, Naaman
returned to Elisha, to whom he acknowledged his full belief in the sole
supremacy of the God of Israel and offered him a liberal reward. But to
show that he was not actuated by the mercenary motives of the heathen
priests and prophets, Elisha, though he accepted presents on other
occasions ([Kg2 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md), respectfully
but firmly declined them on this, being desirous that the Syrians should
see the piety of God's servants, and their superiority to all worldly
and selfish motives in promoting the honor of God and the interests of
true religion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 5:17</span></span>

two mules' burden of earth--with which to make an altar ([Exo
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md) to the God of Israel. What his
motive or his purpose was in this proposal--whether he thought that God
could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil; or whether he
wished, when far away from the Jordan, to have the earth of Palestine to
rub himself with, which the Orientals use as a substitute for water; or
whether, by making such a request of Elisha, he thought the prophet's
grant of it would impart some virtue; or whether, like the modern Jews
and Mohammedans, he resolved to have a portion of this holy earth for
his nightly pillow--it is not easy to say. It is not strange to find
such notions in so newly a converted heathen.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 5:18</span></span>

goeth into the house of Rimmon--a Syrian deity; probably the sun, or the
planetary system, of which a pomegranate (Hebrew, Rimmon) was the
symbol.

leaneth on my hand--that is, meaning the service which Naaman rendered
as the attendant of his sovereign. Elisha's prophetic commission not
extending to any but the conversion of Israel from idolatry, he makes no
remark, either approving or disapproving, on the declared course of
Naaman, but simply gives the parting benediction ([Kg2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 5:20</span></span>

GEHAZI, BY A LIE, OBTAINS A PRESENT, BUT IS SMITTEN WITH LEPROSY. ([Kg2
5:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020).md)

I will run after him, and take somewhat of him--The respectful courtesy
to Elisha, shown in the person of his servant, and the open-handed
liberality of his gifts, attest the fulness of Naaman's gratitude; while
the lie--the artful management is dismissing the bearers of the
treasure, and the deceitful appearance before his master, as if he had
not left the house--give a most unfavorable impression of Gehazi's
character.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 5:23</span></span>

in two bags--People in the East, when travelling, have their money, in
certain sums, put up in bags.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 5:27</span></span>

leper as white as snow--(See on [Lev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003).md). This heavy infliction was not
too severe for the crime of Gehazi. For it was not the covetousness
alone that was punished; but, at the same time, it was the ill use made
of the prophet's name to gain an object prompted by a mean covetousness,
and the attempt to conceal it by lying \[KEIL\].
