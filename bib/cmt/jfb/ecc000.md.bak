### [Ecclesiastes Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 0:0</span></span>

The Hebrew title is Koheleth, which the speaker in it applies to himself
([Ecc 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012).md), "I, Koheleth, was king
over Israel." It means an Assembler or Convener of a meeting and a
Preacher to such a meeting. The feminine form of the Hebrew noun, and
its construction once ([Ecc 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027).md) with
a feminine verb, show that it not only signifies Solomon, the Preacher
to assemblies (in which case it is construed with the verb or noun
masculine), but also Divine Wisdom (feminine in Hebrew) speaking by the
mouth of the inspired king. In six cases out of seven it is construed
with the masculine. Solomon was endowed with inspired wisdom ([Kg1
3:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md); [Kg1
6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#011.md); [Kg1
9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md); [Kg1
11:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#009).md), specially fitting him for
the task. The Orientals delight in such meetings for grave discourse.
Thus the Arabs formerly had an assembly yearly, at Ocadh, for hearing
and reciting poems. Compare "Masters of assemblies" (see on [Ecc
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md), also [Ecc
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009).md). "The Preacher taught the people
knowledge," probably viva voce ("orally"); [Kg1
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#034.md); [Kg1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md), [Kg1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008.md), [Kg1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024.md); [Ch2
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001.md), [Ch2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#007.md), [Ch2
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023.md), plainly refer to a somewhat
public divan met for literary discussion. So "spake," thrice repeated
([Kg1 4:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032).md), refers not to written
compositions, but to addresses spoken in assemblies convened for the
purpose. The Holy Ghost, no doubt, signifies also by the term that
Solomon's doctrine is intended for the "great congregation," the Church
of all places and ages ([Psa 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md);
[Psa 49:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#002).md).

Solomon was plainly the author ([Ecc
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012.md), [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md); [Ecc
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md); [Ecc
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#009).md). That the Rabbins attribute it
to Isaiah or Hezekiah is explicable by supposing that one or the other
inserted it in the canon. The difference of its style, as compared with
Proverbs and Song of Solomon, is due to the difference of subjects, and
the different period of his life in which each was written; the Song, in
the fervor of his first love to God; Proverbs, about the same time, or
somewhat later; but Ecclesiastes in late old age, as the seal and
testimony of repentance of his apostasy in the intervening period: [Psa
89:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md), [Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md) proves his penitence. The
substitution of the title Koheleth for Solomon (that is, peace), may
imply that, having troubled Israel, meantime he forfeited his name of
peace ([Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md), [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023).md); but now, having repented, he
wishes to be henceforth a Preacher of righteousness. The alleged foreign
expressions in the Hebrew may have been easily imported, through the
great intercourse there was with other nations during his long reign.
Moreover, supposed Chaldaisms may be fragments preserved from the common
tongue of which Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldee, and Arabic were offshoots.

THE SCOPE of Ecclesiastes is to show the vanity of all mere human
pursuits, when made the chief end, as contrasted with the real
blessedness of true wisdom, that is, religion. The immortality of the
soul is dwelt on incidentally, as subsidiary to the main scope. Moses'
law took this truth for granted but drew its sanctions of rewards and
punishments in accordance with the theocracy, which was under a special
providence of God as the temporal King of Israel, from the present life,
rather than the future. But after Israel chose an earthly king, God
withdrew, in part, His extraordinary providence, so that under Solomon,
temporal rewards did not invariably follow virtue, and punishments vice
(compare [Ecc 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md); [Ecc
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md); [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md); [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md); [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md); [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md), [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md). Hence the need arises to show
that these anomalies will be rectified hereafter, and this is the grand
"conclusion," therefore, of the "whole" book, that, seeing there is a
coming judgment, and seeing that present goods do not satisfy the soul,
"man's whole duty is to fear God and keep his commandments" ([Ecc
12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013).md), and meanwhile, to use, in
joyful and serene sobriety, and not abuse, the present life ([Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012).md).

It is objected that sensual epicurism seems to be inculcated ([Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022), &c..md); but it is a contented,
thankful enjoyment of God's present gifts that is taught, as opposed to
a murmuring, anxious, avaricious spirit, as is proved by [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md), compare with [Ecc
5:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011.md), not making them the chief end
of life; not the joy of levity and folly; a misunderstanding which he
guards against in [Ecc 7:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md); [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md); [Ecc
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md). Again, [Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md); [Ecc
9:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md), might seem to teach fatalism
and skepticism. But these are words put in the mouth of an objector; or
rather, they were the language of Solomon himself during his apostasy,
finding an echo in the heart of every sensualist, who wishes to be an
unbeliever, and, who, therefore, sees difficulties enough in the world
around wherewith to prop up his wilful unbelief. The answer is given
([Ecc 7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md); [Ecc
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md); [Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md), [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md); [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013).md). Even if these passages be
taken as words of Solomon, they are to be understood as forbidding a
self-made "righteousness," which tries to constrain God to grant
salvation to imaginary good works and external strictness with which it
wearies itself; also, that speculation which tries to fathom all God's
inscrutable counsels ([Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017).md), and
that carefulness about the future forbidden in [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md).

THE CHIEF GOOD is that the possession of that which makes us happy, is
to be sought as the end, for its own sake; whereas, all other things are
but means towards it. Philosophers, who made it the great subject of
inquiry, restricted it to the present life, treating the eternal as
unreal, and only useful to awe the multitude with. But Solomon shows the
vanity of all human things (so-called philosophy included) to satisfy
the soul, and that heavenly wisdom alone is the chief good. He had
taught so when young ([Pro 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md); [Pro
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001).md); so also; in Song of Solomon, he
had spiritualized the subject in an allegory; and now, after having long
personally tried the manifold ways in which the worldly seek to reach
happiness, he gives the fruit of his experience in old age.

It is divided into two parts-- Ecc. 1:1-6:10 showing the vanity of
earthly things; Ecc. 6:10-12:14, the excellence of heavenly wisdom.
Deviations from strict logical methods occur in these divisions, but in
the main they are observed. The deviations make it the less stiff and
artificial, and the more suited to all capacities. It is in poetry; the
hemistichal division is mostly observed, but occasionally not so. The
choice of epithets, imagery, inverted order of words, ellipses,
parallelism, or, in its absence, similarity of diction, mark
versification.
