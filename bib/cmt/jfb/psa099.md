6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003)).

[Psalms 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 99:4</span></span>

To His wise and righteous government all nations should render honor.

king's . . . judgment--His power is combined with justice.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006)

33:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#009); [Num
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005)). Obedience was united with
worship. God answered them as intercessors for the people, who, though
forgiven, were yet chastened ([Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010), [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034)).
