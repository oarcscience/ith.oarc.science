### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 14:1</span></span>

AHIJAH DENOUNCES GOD'S JUDGMENTS AGAINST JEROBOAM. (1Ki. 14:1-20)

At that time--a phrase used often loosely and indefinitely in sacred
history. This domestic incident in the family of Jeroboam probably
occurred towards the end of his reign; his son Abijah was of age and
considered by the people the heir to the throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 14:2</span></span>

Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself--His
natural and intense anxiety as a parent is here seen, blended with the
deep and artful policy of an apostate king. The reason of this extreme
caution was an unwillingness to acknowledge that he looked for
information as to the future, not to his idols, but to the true God; and
a fear that this step, if publicly known, might endanger the stability
of his whole political system; and a strong impression that Ahijah, who
was greatly offended with him, would, if consulted openly by his queen,
either insult or refuse to receive her. For these reasons he selected
his wife, as, in every view, the most proper for such a secret and
confidential errand, but recommended her to assume the garb and manner
of a peasant woman. Strange infatuation, to suppose that the God who
could reveal futurity could not penetrate a flimsy disguise!

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 14:3</span></span>

And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and
go to him--This was a present in unison with the peasant character she
assumed. Cracknels are a kind of sweet seed-cake. The prophet was blind,
but having received divine premonition of the pretended countrywoman's
coming, he addressed her as the queen the moment she appeared, apprised
her of the calamities which, in consequence of the ingratitude of
Jeroboam, his apostasy, and outrageous misgovernment of Israel, impended
over their house, as well as over the nation which too readily followed
his idolatrous innovations.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 14:8</span></span>

thou hast not been as my servant David--David, though he fell into
grievous sins, repented and always maintained the pure worship of God as
enjoined by the law.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 14:10</span></span>

I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam--Strong expressions are
here used to indicate the utter extirpation of his house;

him that is shut up and left in Israel--means those who were concealed
with the greatest privacy, as the heirs of royalty often are where
polygamy prevails; the other phrase, from the loose garments of the East
having led to a different practice from what prevails in the West,
cannot refer to men; it must signify either a very young boy, or rather,
perhaps, a dog, so entire would be the destruction of Jeroboam's house
that none, not even a dog, belonging to it should escape. This peculiar
phrase occurs only in regard to the threatened extermination of a family
([Sa1 25:22-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022).md). See the manner of
extermination ([Kg1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004.md); [Kg1
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#024).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 14:12</span></span>

the child shall die--The death and general lamentation felt through the
country at the loss of the prince were also predicted. The reason for
the profound regret shown at his death arose, according to Jewish
writers, from his being decidedly opposed to the erection of the golden
calves, and using his influence with his father to allow his subjects
the free privilege of going to worship in Jerusalem.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 14:13</span></span>

all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him--the only one of Jeroboam's
family who should receive the rites of sepulture.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 14:14</span></span>

the Lord shall raise him up a king . . . but what? even now--namely,
Baasha ([Kg1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027).md); he was already
raised--he was in being, though not in power.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 14:17</span></span>

Tirzah--a place of pre-eminent beauty ([Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md), three hours' travelling east of
Samaria, chosen when Israel became a separate kingdom, by the first
monarch, and used during three short reigns as a residence of the royal
house. The fertile plains and wooded hills in that part of the territory
of Ephraim gave an opening to the formation of parks and
pleasure-grounds similar to those which were the "paradises" of Assyrian
and Persian monarchs \[STANLEY\]. Its site is occupied by the large
village of Taltise \[ROBINSON\]. As soon as the queen reached the gate
of the palace, she received the intelligence that her son was dying,
according to the prophet's prediction \[[Kg1
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#012.md)\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 14:19</span></span>

the rest of the acts of Jeroboam--None of the threatenings denounced
against this family produced any change in his policy or government.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 14:21</span></span>

REHOBOAM'S WICKED REIGN. ([Kg1
14:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021).md)

he reigned . . . in Jerusalem--Its particular designation as "the city
which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his
name there," seems given here, both as a reflection on the apostasy of
the ten tribes, and as a proof of the aggravated wickedness of
introducing idolatry and its attendant vices there.

his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess--Her heathen extraction and
her influence as queen mother are stated to account for Rehoboam's
tendency to depart from the true religion. Led by the warning of the
prophet ([Kg1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#023).md), as well as by
the large immigration of Israelites into his kingdom ([Kg1
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#017.md); [Ch2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016).md), he continued for the first
three years of his reign a faithful patron of true religion ([Ch2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017).md). But afterwards he began and
encouraged a general apostasy; idolatry became the prevailing form of
worship, and the religious state of the kingdom in his reign is
described by the high places, the idolatrous statues, the groves and
impure rites that with unchecked license were observed in them. The
description is suited to the character of the Canaanitish worship.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 14:25</span></span>

SHISHAK SPOILS JERUSALEM. ([Kg1
14:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025).md)

Shishak king of Egypt came up--He was the instrument in the hand of
Providence for punishing the national defection. Even though this king
had been Solomon's father-in-law, he was no relation of Rehoboam's; but
there is a strong probability that he belonged to another dynasty (see
on [Ch2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002).md). He was the Sheshonk of
the Egyptian monuments, who is depicted on a bas-relief at Karnak, as
dragging captives, who, from their peculiar physiognomy, are universally
admitted to be Jews.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 14:29</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam . . ., are they not written in the
book of the chronicles?--not the book so called and comprehended in the
sacred canon, but the national archives of Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 14:30</span></span>

there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam--The former was prohibited
from entering on an aggressive war; but as the two kingdoms kept up a
jealous rivalry, he might be forced into vigilant measures of defense,
and frequent skirmishes would take place on the borders.
