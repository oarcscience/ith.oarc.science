### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 135:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 135:1</span></span>

A Psalm of praise, in which God's relations to His Church, His power in
the natural world, and in delivering His people, are contrasted with the
vanity of idols and idol-worship. (Psa. 135:1-21)

In the general call for praise, the priests, that stand in the house of
the Lord, are specially mentioned.

[Psalms 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 135:4</span></span>

God's choice of Israel is the first reason assigned for rendering
praise; the next, His manifested greatness in creation and providence.

[Psalms 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 135:6</span></span>

heaven, and . . . seas, and all . . . ends of the earth--denote
universality.

[Psalms 135:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 135:8</span></span>

The last plague \[[Exo 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md)\] is
cited to illustrate His "tokens and wonders."

[Psalms 135:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 135:10</span></span>

The conquest of Canaan was by God's power, not that of the people.

[Psalms 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 135:13</span></span>

heritage--or, "possession."

name . . . memorial--Each denote that by which God is made known.

[Psalms 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 135:14</span></span>

will judge--do justice ([Psa 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002).md).

repent himself--change His dealings ([Psa
90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 115:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 135:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 135:18</span></span>

are like unto them--or, "shall be like," &c. Idolaters become
spiritually stupid and perish with their idols ([Isa
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#031).md).

[Psalms 135:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 135:19</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009).md). There we have
"trust" for "bless" here.

[Psalms 135:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 135:21</span></span>

out of Zion--(Compare [Psa 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md); [Psa
134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003).md). From the Church, as a center,
His praise is diffused throughout the earth.
