### [Haggai Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

[Haggai 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 2:1</span></span>

SECOND PROPHECY. The people, discouraged at the inferiority of this
temple to Solomon's, are encouraged nevertheless to persevere, because
God is with them, and this house by its connection with Messiah's
kingdom shall have a glory far above that of gold and silver. ([Hag
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).md)

seventh month--of the Hebrew year; in the second year of Darius reign
([Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001).md); not quite a month after
they had begun the work ([Hag 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015).md).
This prophecy was very shortly before that of Zechariah.

[Haggai 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hag 2:3</span></span>

Who is left . . . that saw . . . first glory--Many elders present at the
laying of the foundation of the second temple who had seen the first
temple ([Ezr 3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012).md) in all its
glory, wept at the contrast presented by the rough and unpromising
appearance of the former in its beginnings. From the destruction of the
first temple to the second year of Darius Hystaspes, the date of
Haggai's prophecy, was a space of seventy years ([Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012).md); and to the first year of Cyrus,
or the end of the captivity, fifty-two years; so that the elders might
easily remember the first temple. The Jews note five points of
inferiority: The absence from the second temple of (1) the sacred fire;
(2) the Shekinah; (3) the ark and cherubim; (4) the Urim and Thummim;
(5) the spirit of prophecy. The connection of it with Messiah more than
counterbalanced all these; for He is the antitype to all the five ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md).

how do ye see it now?--God's estimate of things is very different from
man's ([Zac 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006.md); compare [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007).md). However low their estimate of
the present temple ("it") from its outward inferiority, God holds it
superior ([Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md); [Co1
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md).

[Haggai 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 2:4</span></span>

be strong . . . for I am with you--The greatest strength is to have
Jehovah with us as our strength. Not in man's "might," but in that of
God's Spirit ([Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006).md).

[Haggai 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hag 2:5</span></span>

According to the word that--literally, "(I am with you) the word (or
thing) which I covenanted"; that is, I am with you as I covenanted with
you when ye came out of Egypt ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Exo
34:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010).md). The covenant promise of God
to the elect people at Sinai is an additional motive for their
persevering. The Hebrew for to "covenant" is literally "to cut,"
alluding to the sacrificial victims cut in ratification of a covenant.

so--or, "and."

my Spirit remaineth among you--to strengthen you for the work ([Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md); [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006).md). The inspiration of Haggai and
Zechariah at this time was a specimen of the presence of God's Spirit
remaining still with His people, as He had been with Moses and Israel of
old ([Ezr 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md); [Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011).md).

[Haggai 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 2:6</span></span>

Yet once, it is a little while--or, "(it is) yet a little while." The
Hebrew for "once" expresses the indefinite article "a" \[MAURER\]. Or,
"it is yet only a little while"; literally, "one little," that is, a
single brief space till a series of movements is to begin; namely, the
shakings of nations soon to begin which are to end in the advent of
Messiah, "the desire of all nations" \[MOORE\]. The shaking of nations
implies judgments of wrath on the foes of God's people, to precede the
reign of the Prince of peace ([Isa
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013).md). The kingdoms of the world are
but the scaffolding for God's spiritual temple, to be thrown down when
their purpose is accomplished. The transitoriness of all that is earthly
should lead men to seek "peace" in Messiah's everlasting kingdom ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md); [Heb
12:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027).md) \[MOORE\]. The Jews in
Haggai's times hesitated about going forward with the work, through
dread of the world power, Medo-Persia, influenced by the craft of
Samaria. The prophet assures them this and all other world powers are to
fall before Messiah, who is to be associated with this temple; therefore
they need fear naught. So [Heb 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md),
which quotes this passage; the apostle compares the heavier punishment
which awaits the disobedient under the New Testament with that which met
such under the Old Testament. At the establishment of the Sinaitic
covenant, only the earth was shaken to introduce it, but now heaven and
earth and all things are to be shaken, that is, along with prodigies in
the world of nature, all kingdoms that stand in the way of Messiah's
kingdom, "which cannot be shaken," are to be upturned ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035.md), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044).md). [Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027.md), "Yet once more," favors English
Version. Paul condenses together the two verses of Haggai ([Hag
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md), and [Hag
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021).md), implying that it was one and
the same shaking, of which the former verses of Haggai denote the
beginning, the latter the end. The shaking began introductory to the
first advent; it will be finished at the second. Concerning the former,
compare [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md); [Mat
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md); [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md); [Act
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031.md); concerning the latter, [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007.md); [Rev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020.md); [Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md); [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md) \[BENGEL\]. There is scarcely a
prophecy of Messiah in the Old Testament which does not, to some extent
at least, refer to His second coming \[SIR ISAAC NEWTON\]. [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md) mentions the heavens dropping
near the mountain (Sinai); but Haggai speaks of the whole created
heavens: "Wait only a little while, though the promised event is not
apparent yet; for soon will God change things for the better: do not
stop short with these preludes and fix your eyes on the present state of
the temple \[CALVIN\]. God shook the heavens by the lightnings at Sinai;
the earth, that it should give forth waters; the sea, that it should be
divided asunder. In Christ's time God shook the heaven, when He spake
from it; the earth, when it quaked; the sea, when He commanded the winds
and waves \[GROTIUS\]. CICERO records at the time of Christ the
silencing of the heathen oracles; and DIO, the fall of the idols in the
Roman capitol.

[Haggai 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hag 2:7</span></span>

shake--not convert; but cause that agitation which is to precede
Messiah's coming as the healer of the nations' agitations. The previous
shaking shall cause the yearning "desire" for the Prince of peace. MOORE
and others translate "the beauty," or "the desirable things (the
precious gifts) of all nations shall come" ([Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), [Isa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011.md); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006).md). He brings these objections to
applying "the desire of all nations" to Messiah: (1) The Hebrew means
the quality, not the thing desired, namely, its desirableness or beauty,
But the abstract is often put for the concrete. So "a man of desires,"
that is, one desired or desirable ([Dan
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023.md); [Dan
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#011.md), Margin; [Dan
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003), Margin). (2.md) Messiah was not
desired by all nations, but "a root out of a dry ground," having "no
beauty that we should desire Him" ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002).md). But what is implied is not that
the nations definitely desired Him, but that He was the only one to
satisfy the yearning desires which all felt unconsciously for a Saviour,
shown in their painful rites and bloody sacrifices. Moreover, while the
Jews as a nation desired Him not (to which people [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002) refers.md), the Gentiles, who are
plainly pointed out by "all nations," accepted Him; and so to them He
was peculiarly desirable. (3) The verb, "shall come," is plural, which
requires the noun to be understood in the plural, whereas if Messiah be
intended, the noun is singular. But when two nouns stand together, of
which one is governed by the other, the verb agrees sometimes in number
with the latter, though it really has the former as its nominative, that
is, the Hebrew "come" is made in number to agree with "nations," though
really agreeing with "the desire." Besides, Messiah may be described as
realizing in Himself at His coming "the desires (the noun expressing
collectively the plural) of all nations"; whence the verb is plural. So
in [Sol 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016.md), "He is altogether
lovely," in the Hebrew the same word as here, "all desires," that is,
altogether desirable, or the object of desires. (4) [Hag
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md), "The silver is mine," &c.;
accords with the translation, "the choice things of all nations" shall
be brought in. But [Hag 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md) harmonizes
quite as well with English Version of [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md), as the note on eighth verse will
show; see on [Hag 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008). (5.md) the
Septuagint and Syriac versions agree with MOORE'S translation. But
Vulgate confirms English Version. So also early Jewish Rabbis before
JEROME'S time. PLATO \[Alcibiades, 2\] shows the yearning of the
Gentiles after a spiritual deliverer: "It is therefore necessary," says
Alcibiades on the subject of acceptable worship, "to wait until One
teach us how we ought to behave towards the gods and men." Alcibiades
replies, "When shall that time arrive, and who shall that Teacher be?
For most glad would I be to see such a man." The "good tidings of great
joy" were "to all people" ([Luk 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010).md).
The Jews, and those in the adjoining nations instructed by them, looked
for Shiloh to come unto whom the gathering of the people was to be, from
Jacob's prophecy ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md). The
early patriarchs, Job ([Job 19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md);
[Job 33:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md) and Abraham ([Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056).md), desired Him.

fill this house with glory-- ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md). As the first temple was filled
with the cloud of glory, the symbol of God ([Kg1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011.md); [Ch2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014).md), so this second temple was
filled with the "glory" of God ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md) veiled in the flesh (as it were
in the cloud) at Christ's first coming, when He entered it and performed
miracles there ([Mat 21:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).md); but
that "glory" is to be revealed at His second coming, as this prophecy in
its ulterior reference foretells ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md). The Jews before the destruction
of Jerusalem all expected Messiah would appear in the second temple.
Since that time they invent various forced and false interpretations of
such plain Messianic prophecies.

[Haggai 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 2:8</span></span>

The silver is mine-- ([Job 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011.md); [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012).md). Ye are disappointed at the
absence of these precious metals in the adorning of this temple, as
compared with the first temple: If I pleased I could adorn this temple
with them, but I will adorn it with a "glory" ([Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md), [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md) far more precious; namely, with
the presence of My divine Son in His veiled glory first, and at His
second coming with His revealed glory, accompanied with outward
adornment of gold and silver, of which the golden covering within and
without put on by Herod is the type. Then shall the nations bring
offerings of those precious metals which ye now miss so much ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md), [Isa
60:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md); [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md), [Eze
43:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004.md); [Eze
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004).md). The heavenly Jerusalem shall be
similarly adorned, but shall need "no temple" ([Rev
21:10-22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010).md). Compare [Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md), where gold and silver represent
the most precious things ([Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md).
The inward glory of New Testament redemption far exceeds the outward
glory of the Old Testament dispensation. So, in the case of the
individual poor believer, God, if He pleased, could bestow gold and
silver, but He bestows far better treasures, the possession of which
might be endangered by that of the former ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md).

[Haggai 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 2:9</span></span>

The glory of this latter house . . . greater than of the former--namely,
through the presence of Messiah, in (whose) face is given the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md); compare [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md), and who said of Himself, "in
this place is one greater than the temple" ([Mat
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006).md), and who "sat daily teaching in
it" ([Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055).md). Though Zerubbabel's
temple was taken down to the foundations when Herod rebuilt the temple,
the latter was considered, in a religious point of view, as not a third
temple, but virtually the second temple.

in this place . . . peace--namely, at Jerusalem, the metropolis of the
kingdom of God, whose seat was the temple: where Messiah "made peace
through the blood of His cross" ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md). Thus the "glory" consists in
this "peace." This peace begins by the removal of the difficulty in the
way of the just God accepting the guilty ([Psa
85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md), [Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md); [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md); [Co2
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018).md); then it creates peace in the
sinner's own heart ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md); [Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md); [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md); [Eph
2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md); [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007).md); then peace in the whole earth
([Mic 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md); [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014).md). First peace between God and
man, then between man and God, then between man and man ([Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018.md); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md). As "Shiloh" ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md) means peace, this verse
confirms the view that [Hag 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md), "the
desire of all nations," refers to Shiloh or Messiah, foretold in [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md).

[Haggai 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 2:10</span></span>

THIRD PROPHECY. Sacrifices without obedience (in respect to God's
command to build the temple) could not sanctify. Now that they are
obedient, God will bless them, though no sign is seen of fertility as
yet. ([Hag 2:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010).md)

four and twentieth day . . . ninth month--three days more than two
months from the second prophecy ([Hag
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).md); in the month Chisleu, the lunar
one about the time of our December. The Jews seem to have made
considerable progress in the work in the interval ([Hag
2:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015).md).

[Haggai 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hag 2:11</span></span>

Ask . . . the priests--Propose this question to them on the law. The
priests were the authorized expounders of the law ([Lev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md); [Deu
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md); [Eze
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#023.md); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md).

[Haggai 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 2:12</span></span>

"Holy flesh" (that is, the flesh of a sacrifice, [Jer
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015).md), indeed, makes holy the "skirt"
in which it is carried; but that "skirt" cannot impart its sanctity to
any thing beyond, as "bread," &c. ([Lev
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027).md). This is cited to illustrate the
principle, that a sacrifice, holy, as enveloping divine things (just as
the "skirt" is "holy" which envelops "holy" flesh), cannot by its
inherent or opus operatum efficacy make holy a person whose
disobedience, as that of the Jew while neglecting God's house, made him
unholy.

[Haggai 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hag 2:13</span></span>

On the other hand, a legally "unclean" person imparts his uncleanness to
any thing, whereas a legally holy thing cannot confer its sanctity on an
"unclean" person ([Num 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md), [Num
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013.md), [Num
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022).md). Legal sanctity is not so
readily communicated as legal impurity. So the paths to sin are
manifold: the paths to holiness one, and that one of difficult access
\[GROTIUS\]. One drop of filth will defile a vase of water: many drops
of water will not purity a vase of filth \[MOORE\].

[Haggai 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hag 2:14</span></span>

Then answered Haggai--rather, "Then Haggai answered (in rejoinder to the
priests' answer) and said" \[MAURER\].

so is this people--heretofore not in such an obedient state of mind as
to deserve to be called My people ([Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md). Here he applies the two cases
just stated. By the first case, "this people" is not made "holy" by
their offerings "there" (namely, on the altar built in the open air,
under Cyrus, [Ezr 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003).md); though the
ritual sacrifice can ordinarily sanctify outwardly so far as it reaches
([Heb 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013).md), as the "holy flesh"
sanctified the "skirt," yet it cannot make the offerers in their persons
and all their works acceptable to God, because lacking the spirit of
obedience ([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022).md) so long as they
neglected to build the Lord's house. On the contrary, by the second
case, they made "unclean" their very offerings by being unclean through
"dead works" (disobedience), just as the person unclean by contact with
a dead body imparted his uncleanness to all that he touched (compare
[Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md). This all applies to them
as they had been, not as they are now that they have begun to obey; the
design is to guard them against falling back again. The "there" points
to the altar, probably in view of the audience which the prophet
addressed.

[Haggai 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 2:15</span></span>

consider--literally, "lay it to heart." Ponder earnestly, retracing the
past "upward" (that is, backward), comparing what evils heretofore
befell you before ye set about this work, with the present time when you
have again commenced it, and when in consequence I now engage to "bless
you." Hence ye may perceive the evils of disobedience and the blessing
of obedience.

[Haggai 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hag 2:16</span></span>

Since those days were--from the time that those days of your neglect of
the temple work have been.

when one came to an heap of twenty measures--that is to a heap which he
had expected would be one of twenty measures, there were but ten.

fifty vessels out of the press--As the Septuagint translates "measure,"
and Vulgate "a flagon," and as we should rather expect vat than press.
MAURER translates (omitting vessels, which is not in the original),
"purahs," or "wine-measures."

Appropriated from [Amo 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md), whose
canonicity is thus sealed by Haggai's inspired authority; in the last
clause, "turned," however, has to be supplied, its omission marking by
the elliptical abruptness ("yet ye not to Me!") God's displeasure.
Compare "(let him come) unto Me!" Moses in excitement omitting the
bracketed words ([Exo 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026).md).
"Blasting" results from excessive drought; "mildew, from excessive
moisture.

[Haggai 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hag 2:18</span></span>

Resumed from [Hag 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md) after [Hag
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md), that the blessing in [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md) may stand in the more marked
contrast with the curse in [Hag
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md). Affliction will harden the
heart, if not referred to God as its author \[MOORE\].

even from the day that the foundation of . . . temple was laid--The
first foundation beneath the earth had been long ago laid in the second
year of Cyrus, 535 B.C. ([Ezr
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010).md); the foundation now laid was
the secondary one, which, above the earth, was laid on the previous work
\[TIRINUS\]. Or, translate, "From this day on which the temple is being
begun," namely, on the foundations long ago laid \[GROTIUS\]. MAURER
translates, "Consider . . . from the four and twentieth day . . . to
(the time which has elapsed) from the day on which the foundation . . .
was laid." The Hebrew supports English Version.

Is the seed yet in the barn?--implying, It is not. It has been already
sown this month, and there are no more signs of its bearing a good crop,
much less of its being safely stored in the barn, than there were in the
past season, when there was such a failure; yet I promise to you from
this day (emphatically marking by the repetition the connection of the
blessing with the day of their obedience) a blessing in an abundant
harvest. So also the vine, &c., which heretofore have borne little or
nothing, shall be blessed with productiveness. Thus it will be made
evident that the blessing is due to Me, not to nature. We may trust
God's promise to bless us, though we see no visible sign of its
fulfilment ([Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md).

[Haggai 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md)

FOURTH PROPHECY. God's promise through Zerubbabel to Israel of safety in
the coming commotions. ([Hag 2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020).md)

the month--the ninth in the second year of Darius. The same date as
Prophecy III ([Hag 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010).md).

[Haggai 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">hag 2:21</span></span>

to Zerubbabel--Perhaps Zerubbabel had asked as to the convulsions
foretold ([Hag 2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006).md). This is the
reply: The Jews had been led to fear that these convulsions would
destroy their national existence. Zerubbabel, therefore, as their civil
leader and representative is addressed, not Joshua, their religious
leader. Messiah is the antitypical Zerubbabel, their national
Representative and King, with whom God the Father makes the covenant
wherein they, as identified with Him, are assured of safety in God's
electing love (compare [Hag 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md),
"will make thee as a signet"; "I have chosen thee").

shake . . . heavens--(see on [Hag
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006).md); violent political convulsions
accompanied with physical prodigies ([Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007.md), [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md).

[Haggai 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">hag 2:22</span></span>

All other world kingdoms are to be overthrown to make way for Christ's
universal kingdom ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044).md). War
chariots are to give place to His reign of peace ([Mic
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md).

[Haggai 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">hag 2:23</span></span>

take thee--under My protection and to promote thee and thy people to
honor ([Psa 78:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070).md).

a signet-- ([Sol 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md); [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024).md). A ring with a seal on it; the
legal representative of the owner; generally of precious stones and
gold, &c., and much valued. Being worn on the finger, it was an object
of constant regard. In all which points of view the theocratic people,
and their representative, Zerubbabel the type, and Messiah his
descendant the Antitype, are regarded by God. The safety of Israel to
the end is guaranteed in Messiah, in whom God hath chosen them as His
own ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md); [Isa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003).md). So the spiritual Israel is
sealed in their covenant head by His Spirit ([Co2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md), [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md); [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md), [Eph
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md). All is ascribed, not to the
merits of Zerubbabel, but to God's gratuitous choice. Christ is the
"signet" on God's hand: always in the Father's presence, ever pleasing
in his sight. The signet of an Eastern monarch was the sign of delegated
authority; so Christ ([Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); [Joh
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022).md).
