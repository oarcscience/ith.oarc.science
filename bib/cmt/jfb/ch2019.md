### [2 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 19:1</span></span>

JEHOSHAPHAT VISITS HIS KINGDOM. ([Ch2
19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001))

Jehoshaphat . . . returned to his house in peace--(See [Ch2
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#016)). Not long after he had resumed
the ordinary functions of royalty in Jerusalem, he was one day disturbed
by an unexpected and ominous visit from a prophet of the Lord \[[Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002)\]. This was Jehu, of whose father
we read in [Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007). He himself had
been called to discharge the prophetic office in Israel. But probably
for his bold rebuke to Baasha ([Kg1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001)), he had been driven by that
arbitrary monarch within the territory of Judah, where we now find him
with the privileged license of his order, taking the same religious
supervision of Jehoshaphat's proceedings as he had formerly done of
Baasha's. At the interview here described, he condemned, in the
strongest terms, the king of Judah's imprudent and incongruous league
with Ahab--God's open enemy ([Kg1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002)) --as an unholy alliance that
would be conducive neither to the honor and comfort of his house nor to
the best interests of his kingdom. He apprised Jehoshaphat that, on
account of that grave offense, "wrath was upon him from before the
Lord," a judgment that was inflicted soon after (see on 2Ch. 20:1-37).
The prophet's rebuke, however, was administered in a mingled strain of
severity and mildness; for he interposed "a nevertheless" ([Ch2
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003)), which implied that the
threatened storm would be averted, in token of the divine approval of
his public efforts for the promotion of the true religion, as well as of
the sincere piety of his personal character and life.

[2 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 19:4</span></span>

he went out again through the people--This means his reappointing the
commissioners of public instruction ([Ch2
17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)), perhaps with new powers and a
larger staff of assistants to overtake every part of the land. The
complement of teachers required for that purpose would be easily
obtained because the whole tribe of Levites was now concentrated within
the kingdom of Judah.

[2 Chronicles 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 19:5</span></span>

HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JUDGES. ([Ch2
19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005))

he set judges in the land--There had been judicial courts established at
an early period. But Jehoshaphat was the first king who modified these
institutions according to the circumstances of the now fragmentary
kingdom of Judah. He fixed local courts in each of the fortified cities,
these being the provincial capitals of every district (see on [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)).

[2 Chronicles 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 19:8</span></span>

TO THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES. ([Ch2
19:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008))

set of the Levites . . . priests, and of the chief of the fathers of
Israel--A certain number of these three classes constituted a supreme
court, which sat in Jerusalem to review appellate cases from the
inferior courts. It consisted of two divisions: the first of which had
jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters; the second, in civil, fiscal,
and criminal cases. According to others, the two divisions of the
supreme court adjudicated: the one according to the law contained in the
sacred books; the other according to the law of custom and equity. As in
Eastern countries at the present day, the written and unwritten law are
objects of separate jurisdiction.
