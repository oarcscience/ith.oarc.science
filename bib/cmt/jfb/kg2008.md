### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 8:1</span></span>

THE SHUNAMMITE'S LAND RESTORED. ([Kg2
8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001).md)

Then spake Elisha unto the woman--rather "had spoken." The repetition of
Elisha's direction to the Shunammite is merely given as an introduction
to the following narrative; and it probably took place before the events
recorded in chapters 5 and 6.

the Lord hath called for a famine--All such calamities are chastisements
inflicted by the hand of God; and this famine was to be of double
duration to that one which happened in the time of Elijah ([Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017).md) --a just increase of severity,
since the Israelites still continued obdurate and incorrigible under the
ministry and miracles of Elisha ([Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md), [Lev
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md), [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 8:2</span></span>

she . . . sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years--Their
territory was recommended to her from its contiguity to her usual
residence; and now that this state had been so greatly reduced, there
was less risk than formerly from the seductions of idolatry; and many of
the Jews and Israelites were residing there. Besides, an emigration
thither was less offensive to the king of Israel than going to sojourn
in Judah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 8:3</span></span>

she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land--In
consequence of her long-continued absence from the country, her
possessions were occupied by her kindred, or had been confiscated by the
crown. No statute in the law of Moses ordained that alienation. But the
innovation seems to have been adopted in Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 8:4</span></span>

the king talked with Gehazi--Ceremonial pollution being conveyed by
contact alone, there was nothing to prevent a conference being held with
this leper at a distance; and although he was excluded from the town of
Samaria, this reported conversation may have taken place at the gate or
in one of the royal gardens. The providence of God so ordained that King
Jehoram had been led to inquire, with great interest, into the
miraculous deeds of Elisha, and that the prophet's servant was in the
act of relating the marvellous incident of the restoration of the
Shunammite's son when she made her appearance to prefer her request. The
king was pleased to grant it; and a state officer was charged to afford
her every facility in the recovery of her family possession out of the
hands of the occupier.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 8:7</span></span>

HAZAEL KILLS HIS MASTER, AND SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Kg2
8:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007).md)

Elisha came to Damascus--He was directed thither by the Spirit of God,
in pursuance of the mission formerly given to his master in Horeb ([Kg1
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015).md), to anoint Hazael king of
Syria. On the arrival of the prophet being known, Ben-hadad, who was
sick, sent to inquire the issue of his disease, and, according to the
practice of the heathens in consulting their soothsayers, ordered a
liberal present in remuneration for the service.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 8:9</span></span>

forty camels' burden--The present, consisting of the rarest and most
valuable produce of the land, would be liberal and magnificent. But it
must not be supposed it was actually so large as to require forty camels
to carry it. The Orientals are fond of display, and would,
ostentatiously, lay upon forty beasts what might very easily have been
borne by four.

Thy son Ben-hadad--so called from the established usage of designating
the prophet "father." This was the same Syrian monarch who had formerly
persecuted him (see [Kg2 6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 8:10</span></span>

Go, say . . . Thou mayest certainly recover--There was no contradiction
in this message. This part was properly the answer to Ben-hadad's
inquiry \[[Kg2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009.md)\]. The second part
was intended for Hazael, who, like an artful and ambitious courtier,
reported only as much of the prophet's statement as suited his own views
(compare [Kg2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 8:11</span></span>

he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed--that is,
Hazael. The steadfast, penetrating look of the prophet seemed to have
convinced Hazael that his secret designs were known. The deep emotions
of Elisha were justified by the horrible atrocities which, too common in
ancient warfare, that successful usurper committed in Israel ([Kg2
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); [Kg2
13:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 8:15</span></span>

took a thick cloth, &c.--a coverlet. In the East, this article of
bedding is generally a thick quilt of wool or cotton, so that, with its
great weight, when steeped in water, it would be a fit instrument for
accomplishing the murderous purpose, without leaving any marks of
violence. It has been supposed by many doubtful that Hazael purposely
murdered the king. But it is common for Eastern people to sleep with
their faces covered with a mosquito net; and, in some cases of fever,
they dampen the bedclothes. Hazael, aware of those chilling remedies
being usually resorted to, might have, with an honest intention, spread
a refreshing cover over him. The rapid occurrence of the king's death
and immediate burial were favorable to his instant elevation to the
throne.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 8:16</span></span>

JEHORAM'S WICKED REIGN. ([Kg2 8:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016).md)

Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat . . . began to reign--(See on [Kg2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001).md). His father resigned the throne
to him two years before his death.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 8:18</span></span>

daughter of Ahab--Athaliah, through whose influence Jehoram introduced
the worship of Baal and many other evils into the kingdom of Judah (see
2Ch. 21:2-20). This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of
the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise
to David ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016).md). A national
chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom,
which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler ([Kg2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009.md); [Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047).md), erected the standard of
independence ([Ch2 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#009).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 8:24</span></span>

AHAZIAH SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Kg2 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024).md)

Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead--(See on [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001).md).
