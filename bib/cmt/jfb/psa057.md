### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

Altaschith--or, "Destroy not." This is perhaps an enigmatical allusion
to the critical circumstances connected with the history, for which
compare [Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md); [Sa1
26:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md). In Moses' prayer ([Deu
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026).md) it is a prominent petition
deprecating God's anger against the people. This explanation suits the
fifty-eighth and fifty-ninth also. Asaph uses it for the seventy-fifth,
in the scope of which there is allusion to some emergency. Michtam--(See
on [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001), title.md). To an earnest
cry for divine aid, the Psalmist adds, as often, the language of praise,
in the assured hope of a favorable hearing. ([Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001).md)

my soul--or self, or life, which is threatened.

shadow of thy wings-- ([Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Psa
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007).md).

calamities--literally, "mischiefs" ([Psa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002.md); [Psa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 57:2</span></span>

performeth--or, completes what He has begun.

[Psalms 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 57:3</span></span>

from . . . swallow me up--that pants in rage after me ([Psa
56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002).md).

mercy and . . . truth-- ([Psa 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md);
[Psa 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005).md), as messengers ([Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md) sent to deliver him.

[Psalms 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 57:4</span></span>

The mingled figures of wild beasts ([Psa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#009.md); [Psa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012).md) and weapons of war ([Psa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002).md) heighten the picture of danger.

whose . . . tongue--or slanders.

[Psalms 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 57:5</span></span>

This doxology illustrates his view of the connection of his deliverance
with God's glory.

[Psalms 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 57:6</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md); [Psa
9:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015).md).

[Psalms 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 57:7</span></span>

I will . . . praise--both with voice and instrument.

[Psalms 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 57:8</span></span>

Hence--he addresses his glory, or tongue ([Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md); [Psa
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012).md), and his psaltery, or lute, and
harp.

I myself . . . early--literally, "I will awaken dawn," poetically
expressing his zeal and diligence.

[Psalms 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 57:9</span></span>

As His mercy and truth, so shall His praise, fill the universe.
