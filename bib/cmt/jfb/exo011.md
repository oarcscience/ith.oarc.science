### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

DEATH OF THE FIRST-BORN THREATENED. ([Exo
11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001))

the Lord said--rather, "had said unto Moses." It may be inferred,
therefore, that he had been apprised that the crisis had now arrived,
that the next plague would so effectually humble and alarm the mind of
Pharaoh, that he would "thrust them out thence altogether"; and thus the
word of Moses ([Exo 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#029)), must be
regarded as a prediction.

[Exodus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 11:2</span></span>

Speak now in the ears of the people--These verses, describing the
communication which had been made in private to Moses, are inserted here
as a parenthesis, and will be considered ([Exo
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035)).

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord, About midnight--Here is recorded the announcement
of the last plague made in the most solemn manner to the king, on whose
hardened heart all his painful experience had hitherto produced no
softening, at least no permanently good effect.

will I go out into the midst of Egypt--language used after the manner of
men.

[Exodus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 11:5</span></span>

And all the first-born in the land . . . shall die--The time, the
suddenness, the dreadful severity of this coming calamity, and the
peculiar description of victims, among both men and beasts, on whom it
was to fall, would all contribute to aggravate its character.

the maid-servant that is behind the mill--The grinding of the meal for
daily use in every household is commonly done by female slaves and is
considered the lowest employment. Two portable millstones are used for
the purpose, of which the uppermost is turned by a small wooden handle,
and during the operation the maid sits behind the mill.

[Exodus 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 11:6</span></span>

shall be a great cry throughout all the land--In the case of a death,
people in the East set up loud wailings, and imagination may conceive
what "a great cry" would be raised when death would invade every family
in the kingdom.

[Exodus 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 11:7</span></span>

against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
tongue--No town or village in Egypt or in the East generally is free
from the nuisance of dogs, who prowl about the streets and make the most
hideous noise at any passers-by at night. What an emphatic significance
does the knowledge of this circumstance give to this fact in the sacred
record, that on the awful night that was coming, when the air should be
rent with the piercing shrieks of mourners, so great and universal would
be the panic inspired by the hand of God, that not a dog would move his
tongue against the children of Israel!

[Exodus 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 11:8</span></span>

all these thy servants shall . . . bow down themselves unto me--This
would be the effect of the universal terror; the hearts of the proudest
would be humbled and do reverential homage to God, in the person of His
representative.

went out . . . in a great anger--Holy and righteous indignation at the
duplicity, repeated falsehood, and hardened impenitence of the king; and
this strong emotion was stirred in the bosom of Moses, not at the ill
reception given to himself, but the dishonor done to God ([Mat
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008); [Eph
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026)).
