### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 95:1</span></span>

David ([Heb 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007).md) exhorts men to praise
God for His greatness, and warns them, in God's words, against
neglecting His service. ([Psa 95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001).md)

The terms used to express the highest kind of joy.

rock--a firm basis, giving certainty of salvation ([Psa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 95:2</span></span>

come . . . presence--literally, "approach," or, meet Him ([Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 95:3</span></span>

above . . . gods--esteemed such by men, though really nothing ([Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md); [Jer
10:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 95:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 95:4</span></span>

The terms used describe the world in its whole extent, subject to God.

[Psalms 95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 95:6</span></span>

come--or, "enter," with solemn forms, as well as hearts.

[Psalms 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 95:7</span></span>

This relation illustrates our entire dependence (compare [Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md); [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md). The last clause is united by
Paul ([Heb 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007).md) to the following
(compare [Psa 81:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#008).md),

[Psalms 95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md)

warning against neglect; and this is sustained by citing the melancholy
fate of their rebellious ancestors, whose provoking insolence is
described by quoting the language of God's complaint ([Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011).md) of their conduct at Meribah and
Massah, names given ([Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md) to
commemorate their strife and contention with Him ([Psa
78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018.md), [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041).md).

[Psalms 95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 95:10</span></span>

err in their heart--Their wanderings in the desert were but types of
their innate ignorance and perverseness.

that they should not--literally, "if they," &c., part of the form of
swearing (compare [Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030.md); [Psa
89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035).md).
