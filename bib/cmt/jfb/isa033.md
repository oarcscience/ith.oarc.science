### [Isaiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 33:1</span></span>

The time is the autumn of 713 B.C. ([Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md), [Isa
33:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md), describe the Assyrian spoiler;
strong as he is, he shall fall before Jehovah who is stronger ([Isa
33:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md), [Isa
33:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010)).md)

and thou--that is, though thou wast not spoiled--though thou wast not
dealt treacherously with (see on [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016).md), thy spoiling and treachery are
therefore without excuse, being unprovoked.

cease--When God has let thee do thy worst, in execution of His plans,
thine own turn shall come (compare [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Isa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md); [Hab
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md); [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 33:2</span></span>

us; we . . . their . . . our--He speaks interceding for His people,
separating himself in thought for a moment from them, and immediately
returns to his natural identification with them in the word "our."

every morning--each day as it dawns, especially during our danger, as
the parallel "time of trouble" shows.

[Isaiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 33:3</span></span>

the tumult--the approach of Jehovah is likened to an advancing
thunderstorm ([Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027).md), which is His voice ([Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015).md), causing the people to "flee."

nation--the Assyrian levies.

[Isaiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 33:4</span></span>

The invaders' "spoil" shall be left behind by them in their flight, and
the Jews shall gather it.

caterpillar--rather, "the wingless locust"; as it gathers; the Hebrew
word for "gathers" is properly used of the gathering of the fruits of
harvest ([Isa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010).md).

running to and fro--namely, in gathering harvest fruits.

he--rather, "they."

them--rather, "it," that is, the prey.

[Isaiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 33:6</span></span>

wisdom--sacred; that is, piety.

thy--Hezekiah's; or rather, "Judea's." "His" refers to the same; such
changes from the pronoun possessive of the second person to that of the
third are common in Hebrew poetry.

treasure--Not so much material wealth as piety shall constitute the
riches of the nation ([Pro 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md); [Pro
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 33:7</span></span>

From the vision of future glory Isaiah returns to the disastrous
present; the grief of "the valiant ones" (parallel to, and identical
with, "the ambassadors of peace"), men of rank, sent with presents to
sue for peace, but standing "without" the enemy's camp, their suit being
rejected ([Kg2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018.md), [Kg2
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#037).md). The highways deserted through
fear, the cities insulted, the lands devastated.

cry-- ([Isa 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 33:8</span></span>

broken . . . covenant--When Sennacherib invaded Judea, Hezekiah paid him
a large sum to leave the land; Sennacherib received the money and yet
sent his army against Jerusalem ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017).md).

despised--make slight of as unable to resist him ([Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009.md); [Isa
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019).md); easily captures them.

[Isaiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 33:9</span></span>

([Isa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004).md).

Lebanon--personified; the allusion may be to the Assyrian cutting down
its choice trees ([Isa 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md); [Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024).md).

Sharon--south of Carmel, along the Mediterranean, proverbial for
fertility ([Isa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002).md).

Bashan--afterwards called Batanea ([Isa
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013).md).

fruits--rather, understand "leaves"; they lie as desolate as in winter.

[Isaiah 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 33:10</span></span>

The sight of His people's misery arouses Jehovah; He has let the enemy
go far enough.

I--emphatic; God Himself will do what man could not.

[Isaiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 33:11</span></span>

Ye--the enemy.

conceive chaff-- ([Isa 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018.md); [Isa
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004).md).

your breath--rather, your own spirit of anger and ambition \[MAURER\],
([Isa 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028).md).

[Isaiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 33:12</span></span>

([Isa 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#019.md); [Amo
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001).md). Perhaps alluding to their being
about to be burnt on the funeral pyre ([Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033).md).

thorns--the wicked ([Sa2 23:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 33:13</span></span>

far off--distant nations.

near--the Jews and adjoining peoples ([Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 33:14</span></span>

sinners in Zion--false professors of religion among the elect people
([Mat 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012).md).

hypocrites--rather, "the profane"; "the abandoned" \[HORSLEY\].

who, &c.--If Jehovah's wrath could thus consume such a host in one
night, who could abide it, if continued for ever ([Mar
9:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#046).md)? Fire is a common image for
the divine judgments ([Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030).md).

among us--If such awful judgments have fallen on those who knew not the
true God, how infinitely worse shall fall on us who, amid religious
privileges and profession, sin against God, ([Luk
12:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md); [Jam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017).md)?

[Isaiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 33:15</span></span>

In contrast to the trembling "sinners in Zion" ([Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md), the righteous shall be secure
amid all judgments; they are described according to the Old Testament
standpoint of righteousness ([Psa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md); [Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004).md).

stoppeth . . . ears . . . eyes--"Rejoiceth not in iniquity" ([Co1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#006.md); contrast [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md); [Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md); [Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032).md). The senses are avenues for the
entrance of sin ([Psa 119:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#037).md).

[Isaiah 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 33:16</span></span>

on high--heights inaccessible to the foe ([Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001).md).

bread . . . waters--image from the expected siege by Sennacherib;
however besieged by trials without, the godly shall have literal and
spiritual food, as God sees good for them ([Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md); [Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025.md); [Psa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md); [Psa
132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 33:17</span></span>

Thine--the saints'.

king in . . . beauty--not as now, Hezekiah in sackcloth, oppressed by
the enemy, but King Messiah ([Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001).md) "in His beauty" ([Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md), [Sol
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016.md); [Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).md).

land . . . very far off--rather, "the land in its remotest extent" (no
longer pent up as Hezekiah was with the siege); see Margin. For
Jerusalem is made the scene of the king's glory ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020), &c..md), and it could not be said
to be "very far off," unless the far-off land be heaven, the Jerusalem
above, which is to follow the earthly reign of Messiah at literal
Jerusalem ([Isa 65:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md); [Rev
21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md), [Rev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 33:18</span></span>

meditate--on the "terror" caused by the enemy, but now past.

where, &c.--the language of the Jews exulting over their escape from
danger.

scribe--who enrolled the army \[MAURER\]; or, who prescribed the tribute
to be paid \[ROSENMULLER\]; or, who kept an account of the spoil. "The
principal scribe of the host" ([Kg2
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md); [Jer
52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025).md). The Assyrian records are free
from the exaggerations of Egyptian records. Two scribes are seen in
every Assyrian bas-relief, writing down the various objects brought to
them, the heads of the slain, prisoners, cattle, sheep, &c.

receiver--"weigher," Margin. LAYARD mentions, among the Assyrian
inscriptions, "a pair a scales for weighing the spoils."

counted . . . towers--he whose duty it was to reconnoitre and report the
strength of the city to be besieged.

[Isaiah 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 33:19</span></span>

fierce people--The Assyrians shall not be allowed to enter Jerusalem
([Kg2 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032).md). Or, thou shalt not any
longer see fierce enemies threatening thee as previously; such as the
Assyrians, Romans, and the last Antichristian host that is yet to assail
Jerusalem ([Deu 28:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Jer
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md).

stammering--barbarous; so "deeper," &c., that is, unintelligible. The
Assyrian tongue differed only in dialect from the Hebrew, but in the
Assyrian levies were many of non-Semitic race and language, as the
Medes, Elamites, &c. (see on [Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 33:20</span></span>

solemnities--solemn assemblies at the great feasts (see on [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md); [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md); [Psa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012).md).

not . . . taken down . . . removed--image from captives "removed" from
their land ([Isa 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017).md). There shall
be no more "taking away" to an enemy's land. Or else, from nomads living
in shifting tents. The saints, who sojourned once in tabernacles as
pilgrims, shall have a "building of God--eternal in the heavens" ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md); [Heb
11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md); compare [Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002).md).

stakes--driven into the ground; to these the "cords" were fastened.
Christ's Church shall never fall ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md). So individual believers ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 33:21</span></span>

there--namely, in Jerusalem.

will be . . . rivers--Jehovah will be as a broad river surrounding our
city (compare [Isa 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md); [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md), and this, too, a river of such a
kind as no ship of war can pass (compare [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001).md). Jerusalem had not the advantage
of a river; Jehovah will be as one to it, affording all the advantages,
without any of the disadvantages of one.

galley with oars--war vessels of a long shape, and propelled by oars;
merchant vessels were broader and carried sail.

gallant--same Hebrew word as for "glorious," previously; "mighty" will
suit both places; a ship of war is meant. No "mighty vessel" will dare
to pass where the "mighty Lord" stands as our defense.

[Isaiah 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 33:22</span></span>

Lord--thrice repeated, as often: the Trinity ([Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024).md).

judge . . . lawgiver . . . king--perfect ideal of the theocracy, to be
realized under Messiah alone; the judicial, legislative, and
administrative functions as king to be exercised by Him in person ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md); [Jam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 33:23</span></span>

tacklings--Continuing the allegory in [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md), he compares the enemies' host
to a war galley which is deprived of the tacklings or cords by which the
mast is sustained and the sail is spread; and which therefore is sure to
be wrecked on "the broad river" ([Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021).md), and become the prey of Israel.

they--the tacklings, "hold not firm the base of the mast."

then--when the Assyrian host shall have been discomfited. Hezekiah had
given Sennacherib three hundred talents of silver, and thirty of gold
([Kg2 18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).md), and had stripped the
temple of its gold to give it to him; this treasure was probably part of
the prey found in the foe's camp. After the invasion, Hezekiah had so
much wealth that he made an improper display of it ([Kg2
20:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013).md); this wealth, probably, was
in part got from the Assyrian.

the lame--Even the most feeble shall spoil the Assyrian camp (compare
[Isa 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md); [Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 33:24</span></span>

sick--SMITH thinks the allusion is to the beginning of the pestilence by
which the Assyrians were destroyed, and which, while sparing the
righteous, affected some within the city ("sinners in Zion"); it may
have been the sickness that visited Hezekiah (Isa. 38:1-22). In the
Jerusalem to come there shall be no "sickness," because there will be no
"iniquity," it being forgiven ([Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003).md). The latter clause of the verse
contains the cause of the former ([Mar
2:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#005).md).

The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth chapters form one prophecy, the
former part of which denounces God's judgment against His people's
enemies, of whom Edom is the representative; the second part, of the
flourishing state of the Church consequent on those judgments. This
forms the termination of the prophecies of the first part of Isaiah (the
thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters being historical) and is a
kind of summary of what went before, setting forth the one main truth,
Israel shall be delivered from all its foes, and happier times shall
succeed under Messiah.
