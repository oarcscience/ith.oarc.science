### [Romans Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)

[Romans 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 9:1</span></span>

THE BEARING OF THE FOREGOING TRUTHS UPON THE CONDITION AND DESTINY OF
THE CHOSEN PEOPLE--ELECTION--THE CALLING OF THE GENTILES. (Rom. 9:1-33)

I say the truth in Christ--as if steeped in the spirit of Him who wept
over impenitent and doomed Jerusalem (compare [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Co2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019.md); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008).md).

my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost--"my conscience as
quickened, illuminated, and even now under the direct operation of the
Holy Ghost."

[Romans 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 9:2</span></span>

That I have, &c.--"That I have great grief (or, sorrow) and unceasing
anguish in my heart"--the bitter hostility of his nation to the glorious
Gospel, and the awful consequences of their unbelief, weighing heavily
and incessantly upon his spirit.

[Romans 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 9:3</span></span>

For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for--"in behalf
of"

my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh--In proportion as he felt
himself severed from his nation, he seems to have realized all the more
vividly their natural relationship. To explain away the wish here
expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some
have rendered the opening words, "I did wish," referring it to his
former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured:
others unwarrantably soften the sense of the word "accursed." But our
version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood
as the language rather of "strong and indistinct emotions than of
definite ideas" \[HODGE\], expressing passionately how he felt his whole
being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will
vanish, and we shall be reminded of the similar idea so nobly expressed
by Moses ([Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032).md).

[Romans 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 9:4</span></span>

Who are Israelites--See [Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md);
[Co2 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md); [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md).

to whom pertaineth--"whose is"

the adoption--It is true that, compared with the new economy, the old
was a state of minority and pupilage, and so far that of a bond-servant
([Gal 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001).md); yet, compared with the
state of the surrounding heathen, the choice of Abraham and his seed was
a real separation of them to be a Family of God ([Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md); [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md); [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md); [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); [Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006).md).

and the glory--that "glory of the Lord," or "visible token of the Divine
Presence in the midst of them," which rested on the ark and filled the
tabernacle during all their wanderings in the wilderness; which in
Jerusalem continued to be seen in the tabernacle and temple, and only
disappeared when, at the Captivity, the temple was demolished, and the
sun of the ancient economy began to go down. This was what the Jews
called the "Shekinah."

and the covenants--"the covenants of promise" to which the Gentiles
before Christ were "strangers" ([Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md); meaning the one covenant with
Abraham in its successive renewals (see [Gal
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md).

and the giving of the law--from Mount Sinai, and the possession of it
thereafter, which the Jews justly deemed their peculiar honor ([Deu
26:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018.md); [Psa
147:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md); [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017).md).

and the service of God--or, of the sanctuary, meaning the whole divinely
instituted religious service, in the celebration of which they were
brought so nigh unto God.

and the promises--the great Abrahamic promises, successively unfolded,
and which had their fulfilment only in Christ; (see [Heb
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006.md); [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md); [Act
26:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006).md).

[Romans 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 9:5</span></span>

Whose are the fathers--here, probably, the three great fathers of the
covenant--Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--by whom God condescended to name
Himself ([Exo 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#006.md), [Exo
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#013.md); [Luk
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).md).

and--most exalted privilege of all, and as such, reserved to the last.

of whom as concerning the flesh--(See on [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003).md).

Christ came--or, "is Christ"

who is over all, God--rather, "God over all."

blessed for ever. Amen--To get rid of the bright testimony here borne to
the supreme divinity of Christ, various expedients have been adopted:
(1) To place a period, either after the words "concerning the flesh
Christ came," rendering the next clause as a doxology to the
Father--"God who is over all be blessed for ever"; or after the word
"all"--thus, "Christ came, who is over all: God be blessed.", &c.
\[ERASMUS, LOCKE, FRITZSCHE, MEYER, JOWETT, &c.\]. But it is fatal to
this view, as even Socinus admits, that in other Scripture doxologies
the word "Blessed" precedes the name of God on whom the blessing is
invoked (thus: "Blessed be God," [Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md); "Blessed be the Lord God, the
God of Israel," [Psa 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018).md). Besides,
any such doxology here would be "unmeaning and frigid in the extreme";
the sad subject on which he was entering suggesting anything but a
doxology, even in connection with Christ's Incarnation \[ALFORD\]. (2)
To transpose the words rendered "who is"; in which case the rendering
would be, "whose (that is, the fathers') is Christ according to the
flesh" \[CRELLIUS, WHISTON, TAYLOR, WHITBY\]. But this is a desperate
expedient, in the face of all manuscript authority; as is also the
conjecture of GROTIUS and others, that the word "God" should be omitted
from the text. It remains then, that we have here no doxology at all,
but a naked statement of fact, that while Christ is "of" the Israelitish
nation "as concerning the flesh," He is, in another respect, "God over
all, blessed for ever." (In [Co2 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#031.md)
the very Greek phrase which is here rendered "who is," is used in the
same sense; and compare [Rom 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025.md),
Greek). In this view of the passage, as a testimony to the supreme
divinity of Christ, besides all the orthodox fathers, some of the ablest
modern critics concur \[BENGEL, THOLUCK, STUART, OLSHAUSEN, PHILIPPI,
ALFORD, &c.\]

[Romans 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 9:6</span></span>

Not as though the word of God had taken none effect--"hath fallen to the
ground," that is, failed: compare [Luk
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#017.md), Greek.

for they are not all Israel which are of Israel--better, "for not all
they which are of Israel are Israel." Here the apostle enters upon the
profound subject of ELECTION, the treatment of which extends to the end
of the eleventh chapter--"Think not that I mourn over the total loss of
Israel; for that would involve the failure of God's word to Abraham; but
not all that belong to the natural seed, and go under the name of
'Israel,' are the Israel of God's irrevocable choice." The difficulties
which encompass this subject lie not in the apostle's teaching, which is
plain enough, but in the truths themselves, the evidence for which,
taken by themselves, is overwhelming, but whose perfect harmony is
beyond human comprehension in the present state. The great source of
error here lies in hastily inferring (as THOLUCK and others), from the
apostle's taking tip, at the close of this chapter, the calling of the
Gentiles in connection with the rejection of Israel, and continuing this
subject through the two next chapters, that the Election treated of in
the body of this chapter is national, not personal Election, and
consequently is Election merely to religious advantages, not to eternal
salvation. In that case, the argument of [Rom
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md), with which the subject of
Election opens, would be this: "The choice of Abraham and his seed has
not failed; because though Israel has been rejected, the Gentiles have
taken their place; and God has a right to choose what nation He will to
the privileges of His visible kingdom." But so far from this, the
Gentiles are not so much as mentioned at all till towards the close of
the chapter; and the argument of this verse is, that "all Israel is not
rejected, but only a portion of it, the remainder being the 'Israel'
whom God has chosen in the exercise of His sovereign right." And that
this is a choice not to mere external privileges, but to eternal
salvation, will abundantly appear from what follows.

[Romans 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 9:7</span></span>

Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
children--"Not in the line of mere fleshly descent from Abraham does the
election run; else Ishmael, Hagar's child, and even Keturah's children,
would be included, which they were not."

but--the true election are such of Abraham's seed as God unconditionally
chooses, as exemplified in that promise.

in Isaac shall thy seed be called-- ([Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012).md).

[Romans 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 9:10</span></span>

And not only this; but when Rebecca, &c.--It might be thought that there
was a natural reason for preferring the child of Sarah, as being
Abraham's true and first wife, both to the child of Hagar, Sarah's maid,
and to the children of Keturah, his second wife. But there could be no
such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife; for the choice of
her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and
of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was
born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a
ground of preference: and all to show that the sole ground of
distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God--"not of works, but
of Him that calleth."

[Romans 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 9:14</span></span>

What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
forbid--This is the first of two objections to the foregoing doctrine,
that God chooses one and rejects another, not on account of their works,
but purely in the exercise of His own good pleasure: "This doctrine is
inconsistent with the justice of God." The answer to this objection
extends to [Rom 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md), where we have
the second objection.

[Romans 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 9:15</span></span>

For he saith to Moses-- ([Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019).md).

I will have mercy on whom I will have--"on whom I have"

mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have--"on whom I have"

compassion--"There can be no unrighteousness in God's choosing whom He
will, for to Moses He expressly claims the right to do so." Yet it is
worthy of notice that this is expressed in the positive rather than the
negative form: not, "I will have mercy on none but whom I will"; but, "I
will have mercy on whomsoever I will."

[Romans 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 9:16</span></span>

So then it is not of him that willeth--hath the inward desire

nor of him that runneth--maketh active effort (compare [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md), [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014).md). Both these are indispensable to
salvation, yet salvation is owing to neither, but is purely "of God that
showeth mercy." See on [Phi 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md),
"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God
which, out of His own good pleasure, worketh in you both to will and to
do."

[Romans 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 9:17</span></span>

For the scripture saith to Pharaoh--observe here the light in which the
Scripture is viewed by the apostle.

Even for this same--"this very"

purpose have I raised--"raised I"

thee up, &c.--The apostle had shown that God claims the right to choose
whom He will: here he shows by an example that God punishes whom He
will. But "God did not make Pharaoh wicked; He only forbore to make him
good, by the exercise of special and altogether unmerited grace"
\[HODGE\].

that I might--"may"

show my power in thee--It was not that Pharaoh was worse than others
that he was so dealt with, but "in order that he might become a monument
of the penal justice of God, and it was with a view to this that God
provided that the evil which was in him should be manifested in this
definite form" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

and that my name might--"may"

be declared--"proclaimed"

in all the earth--"This is the principle on which all punishment is
inflicted, that the true character of the Divine Lawgiver should be
known. This is of all objects, where God is concerned, the highest and
most important; in itself the most worthy, and in its results the most
beneficent" \[HODGE\].

[Romans 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 9:18</span></span>

Therefore hath he--"So then he hath." The result then is that He hath

mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth--by
judicially abandoning them to the hardening influence of sin itself
([Psa 81:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011.md); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md), [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Heb
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md), [Heb
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013).md), and of the surrounding
incentives to it ([Mat 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038.md); [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017).md).

Second objection to the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty:

[Romans 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 9:19</span></span>

Thou shalt say then unto me, Why--"Why then" is the true reading.

doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted--"Who resisteth"

his will?--that is, "This doctrine is incompatible with human
responsibility"; If God chooses and rejects, pardons and punishes, whom
He pleases, why are those blamed who, if rejected by Him, cannot help
sinning and perishing? This objection shows quite as conclusively as the
former the real nature of the doctrine objected to--that it is Election
and Non-election to eternal salvation prior to any difference of
personal character; this is the only doctrine that could suggest the
objection here stated, and to this doctrine the objection is plausible.
What now is the apostle's answer? It is twofold. First: "It is
irreverence and presumption in the creature to arraign the Creator."

[Romans 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 9:20</span></span>

Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made--"didst thou make"

me thus?-- ([Isa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md).

[Romans 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 9:21</span></span>

Hath not the potter power over the clay; of the same lump to make one
vessel unto honour, and another to dishonour?--"The objection is founded
on ignorance or misapprehension of the relation between God and His
sinful creatures; supposing that He is under obligation to extend His
grace to all, whereas He is under obligation to none. All are sinners,
and have forfeited every claim to His mercy; it is therefore perfectly
competent to God to spare one and not another, to make one vessel to
honor and another to dishonor. But it is to be borne in mind that Paul
does not here speak of God's right over His creatures as creatures, but
as sinful creatures: as he himself clearly intimates in the next verses.
It is the cavil of a sinful creature against his Creator that he is
answering, and be does so by showing that God is under no obligation to
give His grace to any, but is as sovereign as in fashioning the clay"
\[HODGE\]. But, Second: "There is nothing unjust in such sovereignty."

[Romans 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 9:22</span></span>

What if God, willing to show--"designing to manifest"

his wrath--His holy displeasure against sin.

and to make his power--to punish it

known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath--that is,
"destined to wrath"; just as "vessels of mercy," in [Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023.md), mean "vessels destined to
mercy"; compare [Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md), "children of
wrath."

fitted for destruction--It is well remarked by STUART that the
"difficulties which such statements involve are not to be got rid of by
softening the language of one text, while so many others meet us which
are of the same tenor; and even if we give up the Bible itself, so long
as we acknowledge an omnipotent and omniscient God we cannot abate in
the least degree from any of the difficulties which such texts make." Be
it observed, however, that if God, as the apostle teaches, expressly
"designed to manifest His wrath, and to make His power (in the way of
wrath) known," it could only be by punishing some, while He pardons
others; and if the choice between the two classes was not to be founded,
as our apostle also teaches, on their own doings but on God's good
pleasure, the decision behooved ultimately to rest with God. Yet, even
in the necessary punishment of the wicked, as HODGE observes, so far
from proceeding with undue severity, the apostle would have it remarked
that God "endures with much long-suffering" those objects of His
righteous displeasure.

[Romans 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 9:23</span></span>

And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of
mercy--that "glorious exuberance of Divine mercy" which "was manifested
in choosing and eternally arranging for the salvation of sinners."

[Romans 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 9:24</span></span>

even us, whom he hath called, &c.--rather, "Whom he hath also called,
even us," &c., in not only "afore preparing," but in due time
effectually "calling us."

not of the Jews, &c.--better, "not from among Jews only, but also from
among Gentiles." Here for the first title in this chapter the calling of
the Gentiles is introduced; all before having respect, not to the
substitution of the called Gentiles for the rejected Jews, but to the
choice of one portion and the rejection of another of the same Israel.
Had Israel's rejection been total, God's promise to Abraham would not
have been fulfilled by the substitution of the Gentiles in their room;
but Israel's rejection being only partial, the preservation of a
"remnant," in which the promise was made good, was but "according to the
election of grace." And now, for the first time, the apostle tells us
that along with this elect remnant of Israel, it is God's purpose to
"take out of the Gentiles a people for His name" ([Act
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#014).md); and that subject, thus
introduced, is now continued to the end of the eleventh chapter.

[Romans 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 9:25</span></span>

As he saith also in Osee--"Hosea."

I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved,
which was not beloved--quoted, though not quite to the letter, from [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md), a passage relating immediately,
not to the heathen, but to the kingdom of the ten tribes; but since they
had sunk to the level of the heathen, who were "not God's people," and
in that sense "not beloved," the apostle legitimately applies it to the
heathen, as "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the
covenants of promise" (so [Pe1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010).md).

[Romans 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 9:26</span></span>

And--another quotation from [Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md).

it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye
are not my people; there shall they be called the children--"called
sons"

of the living God--The expression, "in the place where . . . there,"
seems designed only to give greater emphasis to the gracious change here
announced, from divine exclusion to divine admission to the privileges
of the people of God.

[Romans 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 9:27</span></span>

Esaias also crieth--"But Isaiah crieth"--an expression denoting a solemn
testimony openly borne ([Joh 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md);
[Joh 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md), [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md); [Joh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044.md); [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md); [Act
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021).md).

concerning Israel, Though the number of the children--"sons"

of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a--"the"

remnant--that is, the elect remnant only shall be saved.

[Romans 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 9:28</span></span>

For he will finish the work, and cut--"is finishing the reckoning, and
cutting it"

it short in righteousness; because a short work--"reckoning"

will the Lord make upon the earth-- ([Isa
10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022).md), as in the Septuagint. The
sense given to these words by the apostle may seem to differ from that
intended by the prophet. But the sameness of sentiment in both places
will at once appear, if we understand those words of the prophet, "the
consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness," to mean that
while a remnant of Israel should be graciously spared to return from
captivity, "the decreed consumption" of the impenitent majority should
be "replete with righteousness," or illustriously display God's
righteous vengeance against sin. The "short reckoning" seems to mean the
speedy completing of His word, both in cutting off the one portion and
saving the other.

[Romans 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 9:29</span></span>

And as Esaias said--"hath said"

before--that is, probably in an earlier part of his book, namely, [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md).

Except the Lord of Sabaoth--that is, "The Lord of Hosts": the word is
Hebrew, but occurs so in the Epistle of James ([Jam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004).md), and has thence become
naturalized in our Christian phraseology.

had left us a seed--meaning a "remnant"; small at first, but in due time
to be a seed of plenty (compare [Psa
22:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md); [Isa
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#012).md).

we had been--"become"

as Sodom, &c.--But for this precious seed, the chosen people would have
resembled the cities of the plain, both in degeneracy of character and
in merited doom.

[Romans 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 9:30</span></span>

What shall we say then?--"What now is the result of the whole?" The
result is this--very different from what one would have expected.

That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have
attained--"attained"

to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith--As we have seen that
"the righteousness of faith" is the righteousness which justifies (see
on [Rom 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022), &c..md), this verse must
mean that "the Gentiles, who while strangers to Christ were quite
indifferent about acceptance with God, having embraced the Gospel as
soon as it was preached to them, experienced the blessedness of a
justified state."

[Romans 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 9:31</span></span>

But Israel, which followed--"following"

after the law of righteousness, hath not attained--"attained not"

unto the law of righteousness--The word "law" is used here, we think, in
the same sense as in [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md), to
denote "a principle of action"; that is, "Israel, though sincerely and
steadily aiming at acceptance with God, nevertheless missed it."

[Romans 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 9:32</span></span>

Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were--rather
simply, "as"

by the works of the law--as if it were thus attainable, which
justification is not: Since, therefore, it is attainable only by faith,
they missed it.

for--it is doubtful if this particle was originally in the text.

they stumbled at that stumbling-stone--better, "against the stone of
stumbling," meaning Christ. But in this they only did.

[Romans 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 9:33</span></span>

As it is written-- ([Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md).

Behold, &c.--Two Messianic predictions are here combined, as is not
unusual in quotations from the Old Testament. Thus combined, the
prediction brings together both the classes of whom the apostle is
treating: those to whom Messiah should be only a stone of stumbling, and
those who were to regard Him as the Cornerstone of all their hopes. Thus
expounded, this chapter presents no serious difficulties, none which do
not arise out of the subject itself, whose depths are unfathomable;
whereas on every other view of it the difficulty of giving it any
consistent and worthy interpretation is in our judgment insuperable.

Note, (1) To speak and act "in Christ," with a conscience not only
illuminated, but under the present operation of the Holy Ghost, is not
peculiar to the supernaturally inspired, but is the privilege, and ought
to be the aim, of every believer ([Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001)). (2.md) Grace does not destroy, but
only intensify and elevate, the feelings of nature; and Christians
should study to show this ([Rom
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002)). (3.md) To belong to the visible
Church of God, and enjoy its high and holy distinctions, is of the
sovereign mercy of God, and should be regarded with devout thankfulness
([Rom 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)). (4.md) Yet the most sacred
external distinctions and privileges will avail nothing to salvation
without the heart's submission to the righteousness of God ([Rom
9:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031)). (5.md) What manner of persons
ought "God's elect" to be--in humility, when they remember that He hath
saved them and called them, not according to their works, but according
to His own purpose and grace, given them in Christ Jesus before the
world began ([Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009).md); in
thankfulness, for "Who maketh thee to differ, and what hast thou that
thou didst not receive?" ([Co1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007).md);
in godly jealousy over themselves; remembering that "God is not mocked,"
but "whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap" ([Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md); in diligence "to make our
calling and election sure" ([Pe2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010).md); and yet in calm confidence that
"whom God predestinates, and calls, and justifies, them (in due time) He
also glorifies" ([Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030)). (6.md) On
all subjects which from their very nature lie beyond human
comprehension, it will be our wisdom to set down what God says in His
word, and has actually done in His procedure towards men, as
indisputable, even though it contradict the results at which in the best
exercise of our limited judgment we may have arrived ([Rom
9:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014)). (7.md) Sincerity in religion,
or a general desire to be saved, with assiduous efforts to do right,
will prove fatal as a ground of confidence before God, if unaccompanied
by implicit submission to His revealed method of salvation ([Rom
9:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031)). (8.md) In the rejection of the
great mass of the chosen people, and the inbringing of multitudes of
estranged Gentiles, God would have men to see a law of His procedure,
which the judgment of the great day will more vividly reveal that "the
last shall be first and the first last" ([Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016).md).
