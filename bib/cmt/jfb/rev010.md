### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

[Revelation 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 10:1</span></span>

VISION OF THE LITTLE BOOK. ([Rev
10:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001))

another mighty angel--as distinguished from the mighty angel who asked
as to the former and more comprehensive book ([Rev
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002)), "Who is worthy to open the
book?"

clothed with a cloud--the emblem of God coming in judgment.

a--A, B, C, and Aleph read "the"; referring to ([Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003)) the rainbow already mentioned.

rainbow upon his head--the emblem of covenant mercy to God's people,
amidst judgments on God's foes. Resumed from [Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003) (see on [Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003)).

face as . . . the sun-- ([Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016);
[Rev 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001)).

feet as pillars of fire-- ([Rev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015);
[Eze 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007)). The angel, as
representative of Christ, reflects His glory and bears the insignia
attributed in [Rev 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015); [Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003), to Christ Himself. The pillar of
fire by night led Israel through the wilderness, and was the symbol of
God's presence.

[Revelation 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 10:2</span></span>

he had--Greek, "Having."

in his hand--in his left hand: as in [Rev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005) (see on [Rev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)), he lifts up his right hand to
heaven.

a little book--a roll little in comparison with the "book" ([Rev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)) which contained the whole vast
scheme of God's purposes, not to be fully read till the final
consummation. This other, a less book, contained only a portion which
John was now to make his own ([Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009), [Rev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011)), and then to use in prophesying
to others. The New Testament begins with the word "book" (Greek,
"biblus"), of which "the little book" (Greek, "biblaridion") is the
diminutive, "the little bible," the Bible in miniature.

upon the sea . . . earth--Though the beast with seven heads is about to
arise out of the sea ([Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)), and
the beast with two horns like a lamb ([Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011)) out of the earth, yet it is but
for a time, and that time shall no longer be ([Rev
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006)) when once the seventh trumpet
is about to sound; the angel with his right foot on the sea, and his
left on the earth, claims both as God's, and as about soon to be cleared
of the usurper and his followers.

[Revelation 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 10:3</span></span>

as . . . lion--Christ, whom the angel represents, is often so symbolized
([Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005), "the Lion of the tribe of
Juda").

seven thunders--Greek, "the seven thunders." They form part of the
Apocalyptic symbolism; and so are marked by the article as well known.
Thus thunderings marked the opening of the seventh seal ([Rev
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001), [Rev
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005)); so also at the seventh vial
([Rev 16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017)). WORDSWORTH calls this
the prophetic use of the article; "the thunders, of which more
hereafter." Their full meaning shall be only known at the grand
consummation marked by the seventh seal, the seventh trumpet ([Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019)), and the seventh vial.

uttered their--Greek, "spake their own voices"; that is, voices
peculiarly their own, and not now revealed to men.

[Revelation 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 10:4</span></span>

when--Aleph reads, "Whatsoever things." But most manuscripts support
English Version.

uttered their voices--A, B, C, and Aleph omit "their voices." Then
translate, "had spoken."

unto me--omitted by A, B, C, Aleph, and Syriac.

Seal up--the opposite command to [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020). Even though at the time of the
end the things sealed in Daniel's time were to be revealed, yet not so
the voices of these thunders. Though heard by John, they were not to be
imparted by him to others in this book of Revelation; so terrible are
they that God in mercy withholds them, since "sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof." The godly are thus kept from morbid ponderings over
the evil to come; and the ungodly are not driven by despair into utter
recklessness of life. ALFORD adds another aim in concealing them,
namely, "godly fear, seeing that the arrows of God's quiver are not
exhausted." Besides the terrors foretold, there are others unutterable
and more horrifying lying in the background.

[Revelation 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 10:5</span></span>

lifted up his hand--So A and Vulgate read. But B, C, Aleph, Syriac, and
Coptic, ". . . his right hand." It was customary to lift up the hand
towards heaven, appealing to the God of truth, in taking a solemn oath.
There is in this part of the vision an allusion to [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001). Compare [Rev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004), with [Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004), [Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009); and [Rev
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005), end, with [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007). But there the angel clothed in
linen, and standing upon the waters, sware "a time, times, and a half"
were to interpose before the consummation; here, on the contrary, the
angel standing with his left foot on the earth, and his right upon the
sea, swears there shall be time no longer. There he lifted up both hands
to heaven; here he has the little book now open (whereas in Daniel the
book is sealed) in his left hand ([Rev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002)), and he lifts up only his right
hand to heaven.

[Revelation 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 10:6</span></span>

liveth for ever and ever--Greek, "liveth unto the ages of the ages"
(compare [Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)).

created heaven . . . earth . . . sea, &c.--This detailed designation of
God as the Creator, is appropriate to the subject of the angel's oath,
namely, the consummating of the mystery of God ([Rev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007)), which can surely be brought to
pass by the same Almighty power that created all things, and by none
else.

that there should be time no longer--Greek, "that time (that is, an
interval of time) no longer shall be." The martyrs shall have no longer
a time to wait for the accomplishment of their prayers for the purgation
of the earth by the judgments which shall remove their and God's foes
from it ([Rev 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011)). The appointed
season or time of delay is at an end (the same Greek is here as in [Rev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011), chronus). Not as English Version
implies, Time shall end and eternity begin.

[Revelation 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 10:7</span></span>

But--connected with [Rev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006). "There
shall be no longer time (that is, delay), but in the days of the voice
of the seventh angel, when he is about to (so the Greek) sound his
trumpet (so the Greek), then (literally, 'also'; which conjunction often
introduces the consequent member of a sentence) the mystery of God is
finished," literally, "has been finished"; the prophet regarding the
future as certain as if it were past. A, C, Aleph, and Coptic read the
past tense (Greek, "etelesthee"). B reads, as English Version, the
future tense (Greek, "telesthee"). "should be finished" (compare [Rev
11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)). Sweet consolation to the
waiting saints! The seventh trumpet shall be sounded without further
delay.

the mystery of God--the theme of the "little book," and so of the
remainder of the Apocalypse. What a grand contrast to the "mystery of
iniquity Babylon!" The mystery of God's scheme of redemption, once
hidden in God's secret counsel and dimly shadowed forth in types and
prophecies, but now more and more clearly revealed according as the
Gospel kingdom develops itself, up to its fullest consummation at the
end. Then finally His servants shall praise Him most fully, for the
glorious consummation of the mystery in having taken to Himself and His
saints the kingdom so long usurped by Satan and the ungodly. Thus this
verse is an anticipation of [Rev
11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).

declared to--Greek, "declared the glad tidings to." "The mystery of God"
is the Gospel glad tidings. The office of the prophets is to receive the
glad tidings from God, in order to declare them to others. The final
consummation is the great theme of the Gospel announced to, and by, the
prophets (compare [Gal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008)).

[Revelation 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 10:8</span></span>

spake . . . and said--So Syriac and Coptic read. But A, B, C, "(I heard)
again speaking with me, and saying" (Greek, "lalousan . . . legousan").

little book--So Aleph and B read. But A and C, "the book."

[Revelation 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 10:9</span></span>

I went--Greek, "I went away." John here leaves heaven, his
standing-point of observation heretofore, to be near the angel standing
on the earth and sea.

Give--A, B, C, and Vulgate read the infinitive, "Telling him to give."

eat it up--appropriate its contents so entirely as to be assimilated
with (as food), and become part of thyself, so as to impart them the
more vividly to others. His finding the roll sweet to the taste at
first, is because it was the Lord's will he was doing, and because,
divesting himself of carnal feeling, he regarded God's will as always
agreeable, however bitter might be the message of judgment to be
announced. Compare [Psa 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008), Margin,
as to Christ's inner complete appropriation of God's word.

thy belly bitter--parallel to [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010), "There was written therein
lamentations, and mourning, and woe."

as honey-- ([Psa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010); [Psa
119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103)). Honey, sweet to the mouth,
sometimes turns into bile in the stomach. The thought that God would be
glorified ([Rev 11:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003), [Rev
11:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011)) gave him the sweetest
pleasure. Yet, afterwards the belly, or carnal natural feeling, was
embittered with grief at the prophecy of the coming bitter persecutions
of the Church ([Rev 11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007)); compare
[Joh 16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001). The revelation of the
secrets of futurity is sweet to one at first, but bitter and distasteful
to our natural man, when we learn the cross which is to be borne before
the crown shall be won. John was grieved at the coming apostasy and the
sufferings of the Church at the hands of Antichrist.

[Revelation 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 10:10</span></span>

the little book--So A and C, but B, Aleph, and Vulgate, "the book."

was bitter--Greek, "was embittered."

[Revelation 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 10:11</span></span>

he said--A, B, and Vulgate read, "they say unto me"; an indefinite
expression for "it was said unto me."

Thou must--The obligation lies upon thee, as the servant of God, to
prophesy at His command.

again--as thou didst already in the previous part of this book of
Revelation.

before, &c.--rather as Greek (epilaois), "concerning many peoples," &c.,
namely, in their relation to the Church. The eating of the book, as in
Ezekiel's case, marks John's inauguration to his prophetical
office--here to a fresh stage in it, namely, the revealing of the things
which befall the holy city and the Church of God--the subject of the
rest of the book.
