### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

A Psalm-song--(see on [Psa 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md),
title). The theme: God should be praised for His righteous judgments on
the wicked and His care and defense of His people. Such a topic, at all
times proper, is specially so for the reflections of the Sabbath day.
([Psa 92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001).md)

sing . . . name--celebrate Thy perfections.

[Psalms 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 92:2</span></span>

in the morning, . . . every night--diligently and constantly ([Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008).md).

loving kindness--literally, "mercy."

faithfulness--in fulfilling promises ([Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014).md).

[Psalms 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 92:3</span></span>

In such a work all proper aid must be used.

with a . . . sound--or, on Higgaion (see on [Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md), perhaps an instrument of that
name, from its sound resembling the muttered sound of meditation, as
expressed also by the word. This is joined with the harp.

[Psalms 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 92:4</span></span>

thy work--that is, of providence ([Psa
90:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 92:5</span></span>

great . . . works--correspond to deep or vast thoughts ([Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md); [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 92:6</span></span>

A brutish man knoweth not--that is, God's works, so the Psalmist
describes himself ([Psa 73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).md) when
amazed by the prosperity of the wicked, now understood and explained.

[Psalms 92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 92:8</span></span>

This he does in part, by contrasting their ruin with God's exaltation
and eternity.

most high--as occupying the highest place in heaven ([Psa
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md); [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 92:9</span></span>

A further contrast with the wicked, in the lot of the righteous, safety
and triumph.

[Psalms 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 92:10</span></span>

horn . . . exalt--is to increase power ([Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005).md).

anointed . . . fresh--or, "new"

oil-- ([Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005).md) a figure for
refreshment (compare [Luk 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046).md). Such
use of oil is still common in the East.

[Psalms 92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 92:11</span></span>

see . . . \[and\] . . . hear my desire--or, literally, "look on" my
enemies and hear of the wicked (compare [Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md); [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007).md) --that is, I shall be gratified
by their fall.

[Psalms 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 92:12</span></span>

The vigorous growth, longevity, utility, fragrance, and beauty of these
noble trees, set forth the life, character, and destiny of the pious;

[Psalms 92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 92:15</span></span>

and they thus declare God's glory as their strong and righteous ruler.
