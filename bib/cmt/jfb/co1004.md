### [1 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 4:1</span></span>

TRUE VIEW OF MINISTERS: THE JUDGMENT IS NOT TO BE FORESTALLED; MEANWHILE
THE APOSTLES' LOW STATE CONTRASTS WITH THE CORINTHIANS' PARTY PRIDE, NOT
THAT PAUL WOULD SHAME THEM, BUT AS A FATHER WARN THEM; FOR WHICH END HE
SENT TIMOTHY, AND WILL SOON COME HIMSELF. (1Co. 4:1-21)

account . . . us--Paul and Apollos.

ministers of Christ--not heads of the Church in whom ye are severally to
glory ([Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)); the headship
belongs to Christ alone; we are but His servants ministering to you
([Co1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013); [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005), [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022)).

stewards-- ([Luk 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042); [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010)). Not the depositories of grace,
but dispensers of it ("rightly dividing" or dispensing it), so far as
God gives us it, to others. The chazan, or "overseer," in the synagogue
answered to the bishop or "angel" of the Church, who called seven of the
synagogue to read the law every sabbath, and oversaw them. The parnasin
of the synagogue, like the ancient "deacon" of the Church, took care of
the poor ([Act 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)) and subsequently
preached in subordination to the presbyters or bishops, as Stephen and
Philip did. The Church is not the appendage to the priesthood; but the
minister is the steward of God to the Church. Man shrinks from too close
contact with God; hence he willingly puts a priesthood between, and
would serve God by deputy. The pagan (like the modern Romish) priest was
rather to conceal than to explain "the mysteries of God." The minister's
office is to "preach" (literally, "proclaim as a herald," [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027)) the deep truths of God
("mysteries," heavenly truths, only known by revelation), so far as they
have been revealed, and so far as his hearers are disposed to receive
them. JOSEPHUS says that the Jewish religion made known to all the
people the mysteries of their religion, while the pagans concealed from
all but the "initiated" few, the mysteries of theirs.

[1 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 4:2</span></span>

Moreover--The oldest manuscripts read, "Moreover here" (that is, on
earth). The contrast thus is between man's usage as to stewards ([Co1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002)), and God's way ([Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003)). Though here below, in the case
of stewards, inquiry is made, that one man be found (that is, proved to
be) faithful; yet God's steward awaits no such judgment of man, in man's
day, but the Lord's judgment in His great day. Another argument against
the Corinthians for their partial preferences of certain teachers for
their gifts: whereas what God requires in His stewards is faithfulness
([Sa1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020), Margin; [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)); as indeed is required in earthly
stewards, but with this difference ([Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003)), that God's stewards await not
man's judgment to test them, but the testing which shall be in the day
of the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 4:3</span></span>

it is a very small thing--literally, "it amounts to a very small
matter"; not that I despise your judgment, but as compared with God's,
it almost comes to nothing.

judged . . . of man's judgment--literally, "man's day," contrasted with
the day ([Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013)) of the Lord ([Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005); [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)). "The day of man" is here put
before us as a person \[WAHL\]. All days previous to the day of the Lord
are man's days. EMESTI translates the thrice recurring Greek for "judged
. . . judge . . . judgeth" ([Co1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)),
thus: To me for my part (though capable of being found faithful) it is a
very small matter that I should be approved of by man's judgment; yea, I
do not even assume the right of judgment and approving myself--but He
that has the right, and is able to judge on my case (the Dijudicator),
is the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 4:4</span></span>

by myself--Translate, "I am conscious to myself of no (ministerial)
unfaithfulness." BENGEL explains the Greek compound, "to decide in
judgments on one in relation to others," not simply to judge.

am I not hereby justified--Therefore conscience is not an infallible
guide. Paul did not consider his so. This verse is directly against the
judicial power claimed by the priests of Rome.

[1 Corinthians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 4:5</span></span>

Disproving the judicial power claimed by the Romish priesthood in the
confessional.

Therefore--as the Lord is the sole Decider or Dijudicator.

judge--not the same Greek word as in [Co1
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003), where the meaning is to approve
of or decide on, the merits of one's case. Here all judgments in general
are forbidden, which would, on our part, presumptuously forestall God's
prerogative of final judgment.

Lord--Jesus Christ, whose "ministers" we are ([Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)), and who is to be the judge ([Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Act
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031)).

manifest . . . hearts--Our judgments now (as those of the Corinthians
respecting their teachers) are necessarily defective; as we only see the
outward act, we cannot see the motives of "hearts." "Faithfulness" ([Co1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002)) will hereby be estimated, and the
"Lord" will "justify," or the reverse ([Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)), according to the state of the
heart.

then shall every man have praise-- ([Co1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008); [Sa1
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023); [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023), [Mat
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#028)). Rather, "his due praise," not
exaggerated praise, such as the Corinthians heaped on favorite teachers;
"the praise" (so the Greek) due for acts estimated by the motives.
"Then," not before: therefore wait till then ([Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007)).

[1 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 4:6</span></span>

And--"Now," marking transition.

in a figure transferred to myself--that is, I have represented under the
persons of Apollos and myself what really holds good of all teachers,
making us two a figure or type of all the others. I have mentioned us
two, whose names have been used as a party cry; but under our names I
mean others to be understood, whom I do not name, in order not to shame
you \[ESTIUS\].

not to think, &c.--The best manuscripts omit "think." Translate, "That
in us (as your example) ye might learn (this), not (to go) beyond what
is written." Revere the silence of Holy Writ, as much as its
declarations: so you will less dogmatize on what is not expressly
revealed ([Deu 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029)).

puffed up for one--namely, "for one (favorite minister) against
another." The Greek indicative implies, "That ye be not puffed up as ye
are."

[1 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 4:7</span></span>

Translate, "Who distinguisheth thee (above another)?" Not thyself, but
God.

glory, as if thou hadst not received it--as if it was to thyself, not to
God, thou owest the receiving of it.

[1 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 4:8</span></span>

Irony. Translate, "Already ye are filled full (with spiritual food),
already ye are rich, ye have seated yourselves upon your throne as
kings, without us." The emphasis is on "already" and "without us"; ye
act as if ye needed no more to "hunger and thirst after righteousness,"
and as if already ye had reached the "kingdom" for which Christians have
to strive and suffer. Ye are so puffed up with your favorite teachers,
and your own fancied spiritual attainments in knowledge through them,
that ye feel like those "filled full" at a feast, or as a "rich" man
priding himself in his riches: so ye feel ye can now do "without us,"
your first spiritual fathers ([Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)). They forgot that before the
"kingdom" and the "fulness of joy," at the marriage feast of the Lamb,
must come the cross, and suffering, to every true believer ([Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005), [Ti2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011)). They were like the
self-complacent Laodiceans ([Rev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017);
compare [Hos 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008)). Temporal fulness
and riches doubtless tended in some cases at Corinth, to generate this
spiritual self-sufficiency; the contrast to the apostle's literal
"hunger and thirst" ([Co1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011)) proves
this.

I would . . . ye did reign--Translate, "I would indeed," &c. I would
truly it were so, and that your kingdom had really begun.

that we also might reign with you-- ([Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014)). "I seek not yours, but you."
Your spiritual prosperity would redound to that of us, your fathers in
Christ ([Co1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#023)). When you reach the
kingdom, you shall be our "crown of rejoicing, in the presence of our
Lord Jesus" ([Th1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 4:9</span></span>

For--assigning the reason for desiring that the "reign" of himself and
his fellow apostles with the Corinthians were come; namely, the present
afflictions of the former.

I think--The Corinthians ([Co1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018))
"seemed" to (literally, as here, "thought") themselves "wise in this
world." Paul, in contrast, "thinks" that God has sent forth him and his
fellow ministers "last," that is, the lowest in this world. The apostles
fared worse than even the prophets, who, though sometimes afflicted,
were often honored ([Kg2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010); [Kg2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#009); [Kg2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009), [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012)).

set forth--as a spectacle or gazing-stock.

us the apostles--Paul includes Apollos with the apostles, in the broader
sense of the word; so [Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007); [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023) (Greek for "messengers,"
apostles).

as it were appointed to death--as criminals condemned to die.

made a spectacle--literally, "a theatrical spectacle." So the Greek in
[Heb 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033), "made a gazing-stock by
reproaches and afflictions." Criminals "condemned to die," in Paul's
time, were exhibited as a gazing-stock to amuse the populace in the
amphitheater. They were "set forth last" in the show, to fight with wild
beasts. This explains the imagery of Paul here. (Compare TERTULLIAN \[On
Modesty, 14\]).

the world--to the whole world, including "both angels and men"; "the
whole family in heaven and earth" ([Eph
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015)). As Jesus was "seen of angels"
([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)), so His followers are a
spectacle to the holy angels who take a deep interest in all the
progressive steps of redemption ([Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012)). Paul tacitly implies that
though "last" and lowest in the world's judgment, Christ's servants are
deemed by angels a spectacle worthy of their most intense regard
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]. However, since "the world" is a comprehensive
expression, and is applied in this Epistle to the evil especially ([Co1
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027)), and since the spectators (in
the image drawn from the amphitheater) gaze at the show with savage
delight, rather than with sympathy for the sufferers, I think bad angels
are included, besides good angels. ESTIUS makes the bad alone to be
meant. But the generality of the term "angels," and its frequent use in
a good sense, as well as [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010);
[Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012), incline me to include good
as well as bad angels, though, for the reasons stated above, the bad may
be principally meant.

[1 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 4:10</span></span>

Irony. How much your lot (supposing it real) is to be envied, and ours
to be pitied.

fools-- ([Co1 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021); [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018); compare [Act
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018); [Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024)).

for Christ's sake . . . in Christ--Our connection with Christ only
entails on us the lowest ignominy, "ON ACCOUNT OF," or, "FOR THE SAKE
OF" Him, as "fools"; yours gives you full fellowship IN Him as "wise"
(that is, supposing you really are all you seem, [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018)).

we . . . weak . . . ye . . . strong-- ([Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003); [Co2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009)).

we . . . despised-- ([Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010))
because of our "weakness," and our not using worldly philosophy and
rhetoric, on account of which ye Corinthians and your teachers are
(seemingly) so "honorable." Contrast with "despised" the "ye (Galatians)
despised not my temptation . . . in my flesh" ([Gal
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 4:11</span></span>

([Co2 11:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)).

naked--that is, insufficiently clad ([Rom
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035)).

buffeted--as a slave ([Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020)), the
reverse of the state of the Corinthians, "reigning as kings" ([Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002)). So Paul's master before him was
"buffeted" as a slave, when about to die a slave's death ([Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067)).

[1 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 4:12</span></span>

working with our own hands--namely, "even unto this present hour" ([Co1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011)). This is not stated in the
narrative of Paul's proceedings at Ephesus, from which city he wrote
this Epistle (though it is expressly stated of him at Corinth, compare
[Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003), [Act
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019)). But in his address to the
Ephesian elders at Miletus ([Act
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034)), he says, "Ye yourselves know
that these hands have ministered unto my necessities," &c. The
undesignedness of the coincidence thus indirectly brought out is
incompatible with forgery.

[1 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 4:13</span></span>

defamed, we entreat--namely, God for our defamers, as Christ enjoined
([Mat 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010), [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044)) \[GROTIUS\]. We reply gently
\[ESTIUS\].

filth--"the refuse" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\], the sweepings or rubbish
thrown out after a cleaning.

of all things--not of the "World" only.

[1 Corinthians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 4:14</span></span>

warn--rather, "admonish" as a father uses "admonition" to "beloved
sons," not provoking them to wrath ([Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)). The Corinthians might well be
"ashamed" at the disparity of state between the father, Paul, and his
spiritual children themselves.

[1 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 4:15</span></span>

ten thousand--implying that the Corinthians had more of them than was
desirable.

instructors--tutors who had the care of rearing, but had not the rights,
or peculiar affection, of the father, who alone had begotten them
spiritually.

in Christ--Paul admits that these "instructors" were not mere legalists,
but evangelical teachers. He uses, however, a stronger phrase of himself
in begetting them spiritually, "In Christ Jesus," implying both the
Saviour's office and person. As Paul was the means of spiritually
regenerating them, and yet "baptized none of them save Crispus, Gaius,
and the household of Stephanas," regeneration cannot be inseparably in
and by baptism ([Co1 1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014)).

[1 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 4:16</span></span>

be ye followers of me--literally, "imitators," namely, in my ways, which
be in Christ ([Co1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017); [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001)), not in my crosses ([Co1
4:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008); [Act
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029); [Gal
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012)).

[1 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 4:17</span></span>

For this came--that ye may the better "be followers of me" ([Co1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016)), through his admonitions.

sent . . . Timotheus-- ([Co1 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010);
[Act 19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)). "Paul purposed . . .
when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem. So
he sent into Macedonia Timotheus and Erastus." Here it is not expressly
said that he sent Timothy into Achaia (of which Corinth was the
capital), but it is implied, for he sent him with Erastus before him. As
he therefore purposed to go into Achaia himself, there is every
probability they were to go thither also. They are said only to have
been sent into Macedonia, because it was the country to which they went
immediately from Ephesus. The undesignedness of the coincidence
establishes the genuineness of both the Epistle and the history. In
both, Timothy's journey is closely connected with Paul's own (compare
[Co1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019)). Erastus is not specified
in the Epistle, probably because it was Timothy who was charged with
Paul's orders, and possibly Erastus was a Corinthian, who, in
accompanying Timothy, was only returning home. The seeming discrepancy
at least shows that the passages were not taken from one another
\[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\].

son--that is, converted by me (compare [Co1
4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014); [Act
14:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006); with [Act
16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001); [Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002)). Translate, "My son, beloved and
faithful in the Lord."

bring you into remembrance--Timothy, from his spiritual connection with
Paul, as converted by him, was best suited to remind them of the
apostle's walk and teaching ([Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010)), which they in some respects,
though not altogether ([Co1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002)), had
forgotten.

as I teach . . . in every church--an argument implying that what the
Spirit directed Paul to teach "everywhere" else, must be necessary at
Corinth also ([Co1 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017)).

[1 Corinthians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 4:18</span></span>

some . . . as though I would not come--He guards against some
misconstruing (as by the Spirit he foresees they will, when his letter
shall have arrived) his sending Timothy, "as though" he "would not come"
(or, "were not coming") himself. A puffed-up spirit was the besetting
sin of the Corinthians (compare [Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011); [Co1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002)).

[1 Corinthians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 4:19</span></span>

ALFORD translates, "But come I will"; an emphatical negation of their
supposition ([Co1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018)).

shortly--after Pentecost ([Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)).

if the Lord will--a wise proviso ([Jam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015)). He does not seem to have been
able to go as soon as he intended.

and will know--take cognizance of.

but the power--I care not for their high-sounding "speech," "but" what I
desire to know is "their power," whether they be really powerful in the
Spirit, or not. The predominant feature of Grecian character, a love for
power of discourse, rather than that of godliness, showed itself at
Corinth.

[1 Corinthians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 4:20</span></span>

kingdom of God is not in word--Translate, as in [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019), to which the reference is
"speech." Not empty "speeches," but the manifest "power" of the Spirit
attests the presence of "the kingdom of God" (the reign of the Gospel
spiritually), in a church or in an individual (compare [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001), [Co1
