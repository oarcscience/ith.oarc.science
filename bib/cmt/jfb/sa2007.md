### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 7:2</span></span>

NATHAN APPROVES THE PURPOSE OF DAVID TO BUILD GOD A HOUSE. ([Sa2
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001))

the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of
cedar--The palace which Hiram had sent men and materials to build in
Jerusalem had been finished. It was magnificent for that age, though
made wholly of wood: houses in warm countries not being required to
possess the solidity and thickness of walls which are requisite for
dwellings in regions exposed to rain and cold. Cedar was the rarest and
most valuable timber. The elegance and splendor of his own royal
mansion, contrasted with the mean and temporary tabernacle in which the
ark of God was placed, distressed the pious mind of David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 7:3</span></span>

Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart--The piety of
the design commended it to the prophet's mind, and he gave his hasty
approval and encouragement to the royal plans. The prophets, when
following the impulse of their own feelings, or forming conjectural
opinions, fell into frequent mistakes. (See on [Sa1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006); [Kg2
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 7:4</span></span>

GOD APPOINTS HIS SUCCESSOR TO BUILD IT. ([Sa2
7:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004))

it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto
Nathan--The command was given to the prophet on the night immediately
following; that is, before David could either take any measures or incur
any expenses.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 7:11</span></span>

Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house--As a reward
for his pious purpose, God would increase and maintain the family of
David and secure the succession of the throne to his dynasty. \[See on
[Ch1 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#010)\].

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 7:12</span></span>

I will set up thy seed after thee, &c.--It is customary for the oldest
son born after the father's succession to the throne to succeed him in
his dignity as king. David had several sons by Bath-sheba born after his
removal to Jerusalem ([Sa2 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014);
compare [Ch1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005)). But by a special
ordinance and promise of God, his successor was to be a son born after
this time; and the departure from the established usage of the East in
fixing the succession, can be accounted for on no other known ground,
except the fulfilment of the divine promise.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 7:13</span></span>

He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of
his kingdom for ever--This declaration referred, in its primary
application, to Solomon, and to the temporal kingdom of David's family.
But in a larger and sublimer sense, it was meant of David's Son of
another nature ([Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)). \[See on
[Ch1 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#014).\]

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 7:18</span></span>

DAVID'S PRAYER AND THANKSGIVING. ([Sa2
7:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018))

Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord--Sitting was anciently
an attitude for worship ([Exo 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012);
[Sa1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#013); [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004)). As to the particular attitude
David sat, most probably, upon his heels. It was the posture of the
ancient Egyptians before the shrines; it is the posture of deepest
respect before a superior in the East. Persons of highest dignity sit
thus when they do sit in the presence of kings and it is the only
sitting attitude assumed by the modern Mohammedans in their places and
rites of devotion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 7:19</span></span>

is this the manner of man, O Lord God?--that is, is it customary for men
to show such condescension to persons so humble as I am? (See [Ch1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#017).)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 7:20</span></span>

what can David say more unto thee?--that is, my obligations are greater
than I can express.
