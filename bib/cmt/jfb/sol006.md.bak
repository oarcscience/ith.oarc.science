### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 6:1</span></span>

Historically, at Jesus Christ's crucifixion and burial, Joseph of
Arimathea, and Nicodemus, and others, joined with His professed
disciples. By speaking of Jesus Christ, the bride does good not only to
her own soul, but to others (see on [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md); [Mat
5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014).md). Compare the hypocritical use
of similar words ([Mat 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 6:2</span></span>

gone down--Jerusalem was on a hill (answering to its moral elevation),
and the gardens were at a little distance in the valleys below.

beds of spices--(balsam) which He Himself calls the "mountain of myrrh,"
&c. ([Sol 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006).md), and again ([Sol
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014).md), the resting-place of His body
amidst spices, and of His soul in paradise, and now in heaven, where He
stands as High Priest for ever. Nowhere else in the Song is there
mention of mountains of spices.

feed in . . . gardens--that is, in the churches, though He may have
withdrawn for a time from the individual believer: she implies an
invitation to the daughters of Jerusalem to enter His spiritual Church,
and become lilies, made white by His blood. He is gathering some lilies
now to plant on earth, others to transplant into heaven ([Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md); [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md); [Mar
4:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028.md); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 6:3</span></span>

In speaking of Jesus Christ to others, she regains her own assurance.
Literally, "I am for my beloved . . . for me." Reverse order from [Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md). She now, after the season of
darkness, grounds her convictions on His love towards her, more than on
hers towards Him ([Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003).md). There,
it was the young believer concluding that she was His, from the sensible
assurance that He was hers.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 6:4</span></span>

Tirzah--meaning "pleasant" ([Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021).md); "well-pleasing" ([Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014).md); the royal city of one of the
old Canaanite kings ([Jos 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024).md); and
after the revolt of Israel, the royal city of its kings, before Omri
founded Samaria ([Kg1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md), [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015).md). No ground for assigning a
later date than the time of Solomon to the Song, as Tirzah was even in
his time the capital of the north (Israel), as Jerusalem was of the
south (Judah).

Jerusalem--residence of the kings of Judah, as Tirzah, of Israel ([Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md), &c.; [Psa
122:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001.md); [Psa
125:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001).md). Loveliness, security, unity,
and loyalty; also the union of Israel and Judah in the Church ([Isa
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013.md); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md); [Eze
37:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md), [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md); compare [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md), [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012).md).

terrible--awe-inspiring. Not only armed as a city on the defensive, but
as an army on the offensive.

banners--(See on [Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md); [Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004).md); Jehovah-nissi ([Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 6:5</span></span>

([Sol 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md); [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md); [Exo
32:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004).md). This is the way "the army"
([Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md) "overcomes" not only
enemies, but Jesus Christ Himself, with eyes fixed on Him ([Psa
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015.md); [Mat
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012).md). Historically, [Sol
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md), represent the restoration of
Jesus Christ to His Church at the resurrection; His sending her forth as
an army, with new powers ([Mar
16:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md), [Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020).md); His rehearsing the same
instructions (see on [Sol 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#006).md) as when
with them ([Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044).md).

overcome--literally, "have taken me by storm."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 6:6</span></span>

Not vain repetition of [Sol 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md). The
use of the same words shows His love unchanged after her temporary
unfaithfulness ([Mal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 6:8</span></span>

threescore--indefinite number, as in [Sol
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007.md). Not queens, &c., of Solomon, but
witnesses of the espousals, rulers of the earth contrasted with the
saints, who, though many, are but "one" bride ([Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md); [Luk
22:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#025.md); [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md); [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017).md). The one Bride is contrasted
with the many wives whom Eastern kings had in violation of the marriage
law ([Kg1 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 6:9</span></span>

Hollow professors, like half wives, have no part in the one bride.

only one of her mother--namely, "Jerusalem above" ([Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026).md). The "little sister" ([Sol
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#008).md) is not inconsistent with her
being "the only one"; for that sister is one with herself ([Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016).md).

choice-- ([Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). As she exalted Him above all
others ([Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010).md), so He now her.

daughters . . . blessed her-- ([Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Isa
61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md); [Eze
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014.md); [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010).md). So at her appearance after
Pentecost ([Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md); [Act
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015.md); [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md); [Act
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 6:10</span></span>

The words expressing the admiration of the daughters. Historically (Acts
5:24-39).

as the morning--As yet she is not come to the fulness of her light ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md).

moon--shining in the night, by light borrowed from the sun; so the
bride, in the darkness of this world, reflects the light of the Sun of
righteousness ([Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).md).

sun--Her light of justification is perfect, for it is His ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017).md). The moon has less light, and
has only one half illuminated; so the bride's sanctification is as yet
imperfect. Her future glory ([Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043).md).

army-- ([Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004).md). The climax requires
this to be applied to the starry and angelic hosts, from which God is
called Lord of Sabaoth. Her final glory ([Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md); [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md); [Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md). The Church Patriarchal, "the
morning"; Levitical, "the moon"; Evangelical, "the sun"; Triumphant,
"the bannered army" ([Rev 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 6:11</span></span>

The bride's words; for she everywhere is the narrator, and often
soliloquizes, which He never does. The first garden ([Sol
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011).md) was that of spring, full of
flowers and grapes not yet ripe; the second, autumn, with spices (which
are always connected with the person of Jesus Christ), and nothing
unripe ([Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013), &c..md). The third
here, of "nuts," from the previous autumn; the end of winter, and verge
of spring; the Church in the upper room ([Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013), &c..md), when one dispensation was
just closed, the other not yet begun; the hard shell of the old needing
to be broken, and its inner sweet kernel extracted \[ORIGEN\] ([Luk
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027.md), [Luk
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032).md); waiting for the Holy Ghost to
usher in spiritual spring. The walnut is meant, with a bitter outer
husk, a hard shell, and sweet kernel. So the Word is distasteful to the
careless; when awakened, the sinner finds the letter hard, until the
Holy Ghost reveals the sweet inner spirit.

fruits of the Valley--MAURER translates, "the blooming products of the
river," that is, the plants growing on the margin of the river flowing
through the garden. She goes to watch the first sproutings of the
various plants.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 6:12</span></span>

Sudden outpourings of the Spirit on Pentecost ([Act
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001).md), while the Church was using
the means (answering to "the garden," [Sol
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md); [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008).md).

Ammi-nadib--supposed to me one proverbial for swift driving. Similarly
([Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009).md). Rather, "my willing
people" ([Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003).md). A willing
chariot bore a "willing people"; or Nadib is the Prince, Jesus Christ
([Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017).md). She is borne in a moment
into His presence ([Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006).md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 6:13</span></span>

Entreaty of the daughters of Jerusalem to her, in her chariot-like
flight from them (compare [Kg2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md);
[Sa2 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#014).md).

Shulamite--new name applied to her now for the first time. Feminine of
Solomon, Prince of Peace; His bride, daughter of peace, accepting and
proclaiming it ([Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md); [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md); [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017).md). Historically, this name answers
to the time when, not without a divine design in it, the young Church
met in Solomon's porch ([Act 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md);
[Act 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012).md). The entreaty, "Return, O
Shulamite," answers to the people's desire to keep Peter and John, after
the lame man was healed, when they were about to enter the temple. Their
reply attributing the glory not to themselves, but to Jesus Christ,
answers to the bride's reply here, "What will ye see" in me? "As it
were," &c. She accepts the name Shulamite, as truly describing her. But
adds, that though "one" ([Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md),
she is nevertheless "two." Her glories are her Lord's, beaming through
her ([Eph 5:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031).md). The two armies are
the family of Jesus Christ in heaven, and that on earth, joined and one
with Him; the one militant, the other triumphant. Or Jesus Christ and
His ministering angels are one army, the Church the other, both being
one ([Joh 17:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021).md). Allusion is made
to Mahanaim (meaning two hosts), the scene of Jacob's victorious
conflict by prayer ([Gen 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md), [Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md), [Gen
32:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#022).md). Though she is peace, yet
she has warfare here, between flesh and spirit within and foes without;
her strength, as Jacob's at Mahanaim, is Jesus Christ and His host
enlisted on her side by prayer; whence she obtains those graces which
raise the admiration of the daughters of Jerusalem.
