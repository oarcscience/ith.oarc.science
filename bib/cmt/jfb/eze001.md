### [Ezekiel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 1:1</span></span>

EZEKIEL'S VISION BY THE CHEBAR. FOUR CHERUBIM AND WHEELS. (Eze. 1:1-28)

Now it came to pass--rather, "And it came," &c. As this formula in [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md) has reference to the written
history of previous times, so here (and in [Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md), and [Est
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001).md), it refers to the unwritten
history which was before the mind of the writer. The prophet by it, as
it were, continues the history of the preceding times. In the fourth
year of Zedekiah's reign ([Jer 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md),
Jeremiah sent by Seraiah a message to the captives (Jer. 29:1-32) to
submit themselves to God and lay aside their flattering hopes of a
speedy restoration. This communication was in the next year, the fifth,
and the fourth month of the same king (for Jehoiachin's captivity and
Zedekiah's accession coincide in time), followed up by a prophet raised
up among the captives themselves, the energetic Ezekiel.

thirtieth year--that is, counting from the beginning of the reign of
Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, the era of the Babylonian
empire, 625 B.C., which epoch coincides with the eighteenth year of
Josiah, that in which the book of the law was found, and the consequent
reformation began \[SCALIGER\]; or the thirtieth year of Ezekiel's life.
As the Lord was about to be a "little sanctuary" ([Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016).md) to the exiles on the Chebar, so
Ezekiel was to be the ministering priest; therefore he marks his
priestly relation to God and the people at the outset; the close, which
describes the future temple, thus answering to the beginning. By
designating himself expressly as "the priest" ([Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003).md), and as having reached his
thirtieth year (the regular year of priests commencing their office), he
marks his office as the priest among the prophets. Thus the opening
vision follows naturally as the formal institution of that spiritual
temple in which he was to minister \[FAIRBAIRN\].

Chebar--the same as Chabor or Habor, whither the ten tribes had been
transported by Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md). It flows into the Euphrates
near Carchemish or Circesium, two hundred miles north of Babylon.

visions of God--Four expressions are used as to the revelation granted
to Ezekiel, the three first having respect to what was presented from
without, to assure him of its reality, the fourth to his being
internally made fit to receive the revelation; "the heavens were opened"
(so [Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md); [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md); [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md); "he saw visions of God"; "the
word of Jehovah came verily (as the meaning is rather than 'expressly,
English Version, [Eze 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003).md) unto him"
(it was no unreal hallucination); and "the hand of Jehovah was upon him"
([Isa 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md); [Dan
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010.md), [Dan
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md); [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md); the Lord by His touch
strengthening him for his high and arduous ministry, that he might be
able to witness and report aright the revelations made to him).

[Ezekiel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 1:2</span></span>

Jehoiachin's captivity--In the third or fourth year of Jehoiakim, father
of Jehoiachin, the first carrying away of Jewish captives to Babylon
took place, and among them was Daniel. The second was under Jehoiachin,
when Ezekiel was carried away. The third and final one was at the taking
of Jerusalem under Zedekiah.

[Ezekiel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 1:4</span></span>

whirlwind--emblematic of God's judgments ([Jer
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md); [Jer
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032).md).

out of the north--that is, from Chaldea, whose hostile forces would
invade Judea from a northerly direction. The prophet conceives himself
in the temple.

fire infolding itself--laying hold on whatever surrounds it, drawing it
to itself, and devouring it. Literally, "catching itself," that is,
kindling itself \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The same Hebrew occurs in [Exo
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024.md), as to the "fire mingled with the
hail."

brightness . . . about it--that is, about the "cloud."

out of the midst thereof--that is, out of the midst of the "fire."

colour of amber--rather, "the glancing brightness (literally, 'the eye',
and so the glancing appearance) of polished brass. The Hebrew, chasmal,
is from two roots, "smooth" and "brass" (compare [Eze
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007.md); [Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015).md) \[GESENIUS\]. The Septuagint and
Vulgate translate it, "electrum"; a brilliant metal compounded of gold
and silver.

[Ezekiel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 1:5</span></span>

Ezekiel was himself of a "gigantic nature, and thereby suited to
counteract the Babylonish spirit of the times, which loved to manifest
itself in gigantic, grotesque forms" \[HENGSTENBERG\].

living creatures--So the Greek ought to have been translated in the
parallel passage, [Rev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md), not as
English Version, "beasts"; for one of the "four" is a man, and man
cannot be termed "beast." [Eze 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020.md)
shows that it is the cherubim that are meant.

likeness of a man--Man, the noblest of the four, is the ideal model
after which they are fashioned ([Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md); [Eze
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014).md). The point of comparison
between him and them is the erect posture of their bodies, though
doubtless including also the general mien. Also the hands ([Eze
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#021).md).

[Ezekiel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 1:6</span></span>

Not only were there four distinct living creatures, but each of the four
had four faces, making sixteen in all. The four living creatures of the
cherubim answer by contrast to the four world monarchies represented by
four beasts, Assyria, Persia, Greece, and Rome (Dan. 7:1-28). The
Fathers identified them with the four Gospels: Matthew the lion, Mark
the ox, Luke the man, John the eagle. Two cherubim only stood over the
ark in the temple; two more are now added, to imply that, while the law
is retained as the basis, a new form is needed to be added to impart new
life to it. The number four may have respect to the four quarters of the
world, to imply that God's angels execute His commands everywhere. Each
head in front had the face of a man as the primary and prominent one: on
the right the face of a lion, on the left the face of an ox, above from
behind the face of an eagle. The Mosaic cherubim were similar, only that
the human faces were put looking towards each other, and towards the
mercy seat between, being formed out of the same mass of pure gold as
the latter ([Exo 25:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#019).md). In [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md) two wings are added to cover their
countenances; because there they stand by the throne, here under the
throne; there God deigns to consult them, and His condescension calls
forth their humility, so that they veil their faces before Him; here
they execute His commands. The face expresses their intelligence; the
wings, their rapidity in fulfilling God's will. The Shekinah or flame,
that signified God's presence, and the written name, JEHOVAH, occupied
the intervening space between the cherubim [Gen
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014.md), [Gen
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016.md); [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md) ("placed"; properly, "to place in
a tabernacle"), imply that the cherubim were appointed at the fall as
symbols of God's presence in a consecrated place, and that man was to
worship there. In the patriarchal dispensation when the flood had caused
the removal of the cherubim from Eden, seraphim or teraphim (Chaldean
dialect) were made as models of them for domestic use ([Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md), Margin; [Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030).md). The silence of the
twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth chapters of Exodus to their configuration,
whereas everything else is minutely described, is because their form was
so well-known already to Bezaleel and all Israel by tradition as to need
no detailed description. Hence Ezekiel ([Eze
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020).md) at once knows them, for he had
seen them repeatedly in the carved work of the outer sanctuary of
Solomon's temple ([Kg1 6:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023).md). He
therefore consoles the exiles with the hope of having the same cherubim
in the renovated temple which should be reared; and he assures them that
the same God who dwelt between the cherubim of the temple would be still
with His people by the Chebar. But they were not in Zerubbabel's temple;
therefore Ezekiel's foretold temple, if literal, is yet future. The ox
is selected as chief of the tame animals, the lion among the wild, the
eagle among birds, and man the head of all, in his ideal, realized by
the Lord Jesus, combining all the excellencies of the animal kingdom.
The cherubim probably represent the ruling powers by which God acts in
the natural and moral world. Hence they sometimes answer to the
ministering angels; elsewhere, to the redeemed saints (the elect Church)
through whom, as by the angels, God shall hereafter rule the world and
proclaim the manifold wisdom of God ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md); [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); [Rev
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md). The "lions" and "oxen," amidst
"palms" and "open flowers" carved in the temple, were the four-faced
cherubim which, being traced on a flat surface, presented only one
aspect of the four. The human-headed winged bulls and eagle-headed gods
found in Nineveh, sculptured amidst palms and tulip-shaped flowers, were
borrowed by corrupted tradition from the cherubim placed in Eden near
its fruits and flowers. So the Aaronic calf ([Exo
32:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004).md) and Jeroboam's calves at Dan
and Beth-el, a schismatic imitation of the sacred symbols in the temple
at Jerusalem. So the ox figures of Apis on the sacred arks of Egypt.

[Ezekiel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 1:7</span></span>

straight feet--that is, straight legs. Not protruding in any part as the
legs of an ox, but straight like a man's \[GROTIUS\]. Or, like solid
pillars; not bending, as man's, at the knee. They glided along, rather
than walked. Their movements were all sure, right, and without effort
\[KITTO, Cyclopedia\].

sole . . . calf's foot--HENDERSON hence supposes that "straight feet"
implies that they did not project horizontally like men's feet, but
vertically as calves' feet. The solid firmness of the round foot of a
calf seems to be the point of comparison.

colour--the glittering appearance, indicating God's purity.

[Ezekiel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 1:8</span></span>

The hands of each were the hands of a man. The hand is the symbol of
active power, guided by skilfulness ([Psa
78:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#072).md).

under their wings--signifying their operations are hidden from our too
curious prying; and as the "wings" signify something more than human,
namely, the secret prompting of God, it is also implied that they are
moved by it and not by their own power, so that they do nothing at
random, but all with divine wisdom.

they four had . . . faces and . . . wings--He returns to what he had
stated already in [Eze 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md); this gives
a reason why they had hands on their four sides, namely, because they
had faces and wings on the four sides. They moved whithersoever they
would, not by active energy merely, but also by knowledge (expressed by
their faces) and divine guidance (expressed by their "wings").

[Ezekiel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 1:9</span></span>

they--had no occasion to turn themselves round when changing their
direction, for they had a face ([Eze
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006).md) looking to each of the four
quarters of heaven. They made no mistakes; and their work needed not be
gone over again. Their wings were joined above in pairs (see [Eze
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 1:10</span></span>

they . . . had the face of a man--namely, in front. The human face was
the primary and prominent one and the fundamental part of the composite
whole. On its right was the lion's face; on the left, the ox's (called
"cherub," [Eze 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014).md); at the back
from above was the eagle's.

[Ezekiel 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 1:11</span></span>

The tips of the two outstretched wings reached to one another, while the
other two, in token of humble awe, formed a veil for the lower parts of
the body.

stretched upward--rather, "were parted from above" (compare Margin; see
on [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md). The joining together of
their wings above implies that, though the movements of Providence on
earth may seem conflicting and confused, yet if one lift up his eyes to
heaven, he will see that they admirably conspire towards the one end at
last.

[Ezekiel 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 1:12</span></span>

The same idea as in [Eze 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#009.md). The
repetition is because we men are so hard to be brought to acknowledge
the wisdom of God's doings; they seem tortuous and confused to us, but
they are all tending steadily to one aim.

the spirit--the secret impulse whereby God moves His angels to the end
designed. They do not turn back or aside till they have fulfilled the
office assigned them.

[Ezekiel 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 1:13</span></span>

likeness . . . appearance--not tautology. "Likeness" expresses the
general form; "appearance," the particular aspect.

coals of fire--denoting the intensely pure and burning justice wherewith
God punishes by His angels those who, like Israel, have hardened
themselves against His long-suffering. So in [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md), [Isa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006.md), instead of cherubim, the name
"seraphim," the burning ones, is applied, indicating God's consuming
righteousness; whence their cry to Him is, "Holy! holy! holy!" and the
burning coal is applied to his lips, for the message through his mouth
was to be one of judicial severance of the godly from the ungodly, to
the ruin of the latter.

lamps--torches. The fire emitted sparks and flashes of light, as torches
do.

went up and down--expressing the marvellous vigor of God's Spirit, in
all His movements never resting, never wearied.

fire . . . bright--indicating the glory of God.

out of the fire . . . lightning--God's righteousness will at last cause
the bolt of His wrath to fall on the guilty; as now, on Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 1:14</span></span>

ran and returned--Incessant, restless motion indicates the plenitude of
life in these cherubim; so in [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md), "they rest not day or night"
([Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md).

flash of lightning--rather, as distinct from "lightning" ([Eze
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#013).md), "the meteor flash," or sheet
lightning \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 1:15</span></span>

one wheel--The "dreadful height" of the wheel ([Eze
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018).md) indicates the gigantic, terrible
energy of the complicated revolutions of God's providence, bringing
about His purposes with unerring certainty. One wheel appeared
traversely within another, so that the movement might be without
turning, whithersoever the living creatures might advance ([Eze
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#017).md). Thus each wheel was composed of
two circles cutting one another at right angles, "one" only of which
appeared to touch the ground ("upon the earth"), according to the
direction the cherubim desired to move in.

with his four faces--rather, "according to its four faces" or sides; as
there was a side or direction to each of the four creatures, so there
was a wheel for each of the sides \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The four sides or
semicircles of each composite wheel pointed, as the four faces of each
of the living creatures, to the four quarters of heaven. HAVERNICK
refers "his" or "its" to the wheels. The cherubim and their wings and
wheels stood in contrast to the symbolical figures, somewhat similar,
then existing in Chaldea, and found in the remains of Assyria. The
latter, though derived from the original revelation by tradition, came
by corruption to symbolize the astronomical zodiac, or the sun and
celestial sphere, by a circle with wings or irradiations. But Ezekiel's
cherubim rise above natural objects, the gods of the heathen, to the
representation of the one true God, who made and continually upholds
them.

[Ezekiel 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 1:16</span></span>

appearance . . . work--their form and the material of their work.

beryl--rather, "the glancing appearance of the Tarshish stone"; the
chrysolite or topaz, brought from Tarshish or Tartessus in Spain. It was
one of the gems in the breastplate of the high priest ([Exo
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#020.md); [Sol
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#014.md); [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006).md).

four had one likeness--The similarity of the wheels to one another
implies that there is no inequality in all God's works, that all have a
beautiful analogy and proportion.

[Ezekiel 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 1:17</span></span>

went upon their four sides--Those faces or sides of the four wheels
moved which answered to the direction in which the cherubim desired to
move; while the transverse circles in each of the four composite wheels
remained suspended from the ground, so as not to impede the movements of
the others.

[Ezekiel 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 1:18</span></span>

rings--that is, felloes or circumferences of the wheels.

eyes--The multiplicity of eyes here in the wheels, and [Eze
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012.md), in the cherubim themselves,
symbolizes the plenitude of intelligent life, the eye being the window
through which "the spirit of the living creatures" in the wheels ([Eze
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020).md) looks forth (compare [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md). As the wheels signify the
providence of God, so the eyes imply that He sees all the circumstances
of each case, and does nothing by blind impulse.

[Ezekiel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 1:19</span></span>

went by them--went beside them.

[Ezekiel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 1:20</span></span>

the spirit was to go--that is, their will was for going whithersoever
the Spirit was for going.

over against them--rather, beside or in conjunction with them.

spirit of the living creature--put collectively for "the living
creatures"; the cherubim. Having first viewed them separately, he next
views them in the aggregate as the composite living creature in which
the Spirit resided. The life intended is that connected with God, holy,
spiritual life, in the plenitude of its active power.

[Ezekiel 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 1:21</span></span>

over against--rather, "along with" \[HENDERSON\]; or, "beside"
\[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 1:22</span></span>

upon the heads--rather, "above the heads" \[FAIRBAIRN\].

colour--glitter.

terrible crystal--dazzling the spectator by its brightness.

[Ezekiel 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 1:23</span></span>

straight--erect \[FAIRBAIRN\], expanded upright.

two . . . two . . . covered . . . bodies--not, as it might seem,
contradicting [Eze 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#011.md). The two wings
expanded upwards, though chiefly used for flying, yet up to the summit
of the figure where they were parted from each other, covered the upper
part of the body, while the other two wings covered the lower parts.

[Ezekiel 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 1:24</span></span>

voice of . . . Almighty--the thunder ([Psa
29:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003).md).

voice of speech--rather, "the voice" or "sound of tumult," as in [Jer
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md). From an Arabic root, meaning
the "impetuous rush of heavy rain."

noise of . . . host-- ([Isa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md); [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 1:25</span></span>

let down . . . wings--While the Almighty gave forth His voice, they
reverently let their wings fall, to listen stilly to His communication.

[Ezekiel 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 1:26</span></span>

The Godhead appears in the likeness of enthroned humanity, as in [Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010.md). Besides the "paved work of a
sapphire stone, as it were the body of heaven in clearness," there, we
have here the "throne," and God "as a man," with the "appearance of fire
round about." This last was a prelude of the incarnation of Messiah, but
in His character as Saviour and as Judge ([Rev
19:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md). The azure sapphire answers
to the color of the sky. As others are called "sons of God," but He "the
Son of God," so others are called "sons of man" ([Eze
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md), [Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003).md), but He "the Son of man" ([Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013).md), being the embodied
representative of humanity and the whole human race; as, on the other
hand, He is the representative of "the fulness of the Godhead" ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md). While the cherubim are movable,
the throne above, and Jehovah who moves them, are firmly fixed. It is
good news to man, that the throne above is filled by One who even there
appears as "a man."

colour of amber--"the glitter of chasmal" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. See on [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md); rather, "polished brass"
\[HENDERSON\]. Messiah is described here as in [Dan
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md); [Rev
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md).

the bow . . . in . . . rain--the symbol of the sure covenant of mercy to
God's children remembered amidst judgments on the wicked; as in the
flood in Noah's days ([Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).md). "Like
hanging out from the throne of the Eternal a fing of peace, assuring all
that the purpose of Heaven was to preserve rather than to destroy. Even
if the divine work should require a deluge of wrath, still the
faithfulness of God would only shine forth the more brightly at last to
the children of promise, in consequence of the tribulations needed to
prepare for the ultimate good" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. ([Isa
54:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008).md).

I fell upon . . . face--the right attitude, spiritually, before we enter
on any active work for God ([Eze 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002.md);
[Eze 3:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md); [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).md). In this first chapter God
gathered into one vision the substance of all that was to occupy the
prophetic agency of Ezekiel; as was done afterwards in the opening
vision of the Revelation of Saint John.
