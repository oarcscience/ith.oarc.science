### [Job Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#001)

[Job 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 15:2</span></span>

SECOND SPEECH OF ELIPHAZ. (Job 15:1-35)

a wise man--which Job claims to be.

vain knowledge--Hebrew, "windy knowledge"; literally, "of wind" ([Job
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002)). In [Ecc
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014), Hebrew, "to catch wind,"
expresses to strive for what is vain.

east wind--stronger than the previous "wind," for in that region the
east wind is the most destructive of winds ([Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008)). Thus here,--empty violence.

belly--the inward parts, the breast ([Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008)).

[Job 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 15:4</span></span>

fear--reverence for God ([Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006);
[Psa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011)).

prayer--meditation, in [Psa 104:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#034); so
devotion. If thy views were right, reasons Eliphaz, that God disregards
the afflictions of the righteous and makes the wicked to prosper, all
devotion would be at an end.

[Job 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 15:5</span></span>

The sophistry of thine own speeches proves thy guilt.

[Job 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 15:6</span></span>

No pious man would utter such sentiments.

[Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 15:7</span></span>

That is, Art thou wisdom personified? Wisdom existed before the hills;
that is, the eternal Son of God ([Pro
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#025); [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002)). Wast thou in existence before
Adam? The farther back one existed, the nearer he was to the Eternal
Wisdom.

[Job 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 15:8</span></span>

secret--rather, "Wast thou a listener in the secret council of God?" The
Hebrew means properly the cushions of a divan on which counsellors in
the East usually sit. God's servants are admitted to God's secrets ([Psa
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014); [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)).

restrain--Rather, didst thou take away, or borrow, thence (namely, from
the divine secret council) thy wisdom? Eliphaz in this ([Job
15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008)) retorts Job's words upon
himself ([Job 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002); [Job
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#002)).

[Job 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 15:9</span></span>

in us--or, "with us," Hebraism for "we are aware of."

[Job 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 15:10</span></span>

On our side, thinking with us are the aged. Job had admitted that wisdom
is with them ([Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012)). Eliphaz
seems to have been himself older than Job; perhaps the other two were
also ([Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006)). Job, in [Job
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001), does not refer to his three
friends; it therefore forms no objection. The Arabs are proud of fulness
of years.

[Job 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 15:11</span></span>

consolations--namely, the revelation which Eliphaz had stated as a
consolatory reproof to Job, and which he repeats in [Job
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014).

secret--Hast thou some secret wisdom and source of consolation, which
makes thee disregard those suggested by me? ([Job
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008)). Rather, from a different Hebrew
root, Is the word of kindness or gentleness addressed by me treated by
thee as valueless? \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 15:12</span></span>

wink--that is, why do thy eyes evince pride? ([Pro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013); [Psa
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019)).

[Job 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 15:13</span></span>

That is, frettest against God and lettest fall rash words.

[Job 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 15:14</span></span>

Eliphaz repeats the revelation ([Job
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017)) in substance, but using Job's
own words (see on [Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001), on "born
of a woman") to strike him with his own weapons.

[Job 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 15:15</span></span>

Repeated from [Job 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018); "servants"
there are "saints" here; namely, holy angels.

heavens--literally, or else answering to "angels" (see on [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018), and [Job
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005)).

[Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 15:16</span></span>

filthy--in Arabic "sour" ([Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003);
[Psa 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003)), corrupted from his
original purity.

drinketh-- ([Pro 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028)).

[Job 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 15:17</span></span>

In direct contradiction of Job's position ([Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006), &c.), that the lot of the wicked
was the most prosperous here, Eliphaz appeals (1) to his own experience,
(2) to the wisdom of the ancients.

[Job 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 15:18</span></span>

Rather, "and which as handed down from their fathers, they have not
concealed."

[Job 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 15:19</span></span>

Eliphaz speaks like a genuine Arab when he boasts that his ancestors had
ever possessed the land unmixed with foreigners \[UMBREIT\]. His words
are intended to oppose Job's ([Job
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024)); "the earth" in their case was
not "given into the hand of the wicked." He refers to the division of
the earth by divine appointment ([Gen
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005); [Gen
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#032)). Also he may insinuate that
Job's sentiments had been corrupted from original purity by his vicinity
to the Sabeans and Chaldeans \[ROSENMULLER\].

[Job 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 15:20</span></span>

travaileth--rather, "trembleth of himself," though there is no real
danger \[UMBREIT\].

and the number of his years, &c.--This gives the reason why the wicked
man trembles continually; namely, because he knows not the moment when
his life must end.

[Job 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 15:21</span></span>

An evil conscience conceives alarm at every sudden sound, though it be
in a time of peace ("prosperity"), when there is no real danger ([Lev
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036); [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006)).

[Job 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 15:22</span></span>

darkness--namely, danger or calamity. Glancing at Job, who despaired of
restoration: in contrast to good men when in darkness ([Mic
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008)).

waited for of--that is, He is destined for the sword \[GESENIUS\].
Rather (in the night of danger), "he looks anxiously towards the sword,"
as if every sword was drawn against him \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 15:23</span></span>

Wandereth in anxious search for bread. Famine in Old Testament depicts
sore need ([Isa 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013)). Contrast the
pious man's lot ([Job 5:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020)).

knoweth--has the firm conviction. Contrast the same word applied to the
pious ([Job 5:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024)).

ready at his hand--an Arabic phrase to denote a thing's complete
readiness and full presence, as if in the hand.

[Job 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 15:24</span></span>

prevail--break upon him suddenly and terribly, as a king, &c. ([Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011)).

[Job 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 15:25</span></span>

stretcheth . . . hand--wielding the spear, as a bold rebel against God
([Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004); [Isa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004)).

[Job 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 15:26</span></span>

on his neck--rather, "with outstretched neck," namely, that of the rebel
\[UMBREIT\] ([Psa 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005)).

upon . . . bucklers--rather, "with--his (the rebel's, not God's)
bucklers." The rebel and his fellows are depicted as joining shields
together, to form a compact covering over their heads against the
weapons hurled on them from a fortress \[UMBREIT and GESENIUS\].

[Job 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 15:27</span></span>

The well-nourished body of the rebel is the sign of his prosperity.

collops--masses of fat. He pampers and fattens himself with sensual
indulgences; hence his rebellion against God ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015); [Sa1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029)).

[Job 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 15:28</span></span>

The class of wicked here described is that of robbers who plunder
"cities," and seize on the houses of the banished citizens ([Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020)). Eliphaz chooses this class
because Job had chosen the same ([Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006)).

heaps--of ruins.

[Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 15:29</span></span>

Rather, he shall not increase his riches; he has reached his highest
point; his prosperity shall not continue.

perfection--rather, "His acquired wealth--what he possesses--shall not
be extended," &c.

[Job 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 15:30</span></span>

depart--that is, escape ([Job
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022)).

branches--namely, his offspring ([Job
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#018); [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035)).

dry up--The "flame" is the sultry wind in the East by which plants most
full of sap are suddenly shrivelled.

his mouth--that is, God's wrath ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)).

[Job 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 15:31</span></span>

Rather, "let him not trust in vanity or he will be deceived," &c.

vanity--that which is unsubstantial. Sin is its own punishment ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031); [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)).

[Job 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 15:32</span></span>

Literally, "it (the tree to which he is compared, [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030), or else his life) shall not be
filled up in its time"; that is, "he shall be ended before his time."

shall not be green--image from a withered tree; the childless extinction
of the wicked.

[Job 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 15:33</span></span>

Images of incompleteness. The loss of the unripe grapes is poetically
made the vine tree's own act, in order to express more pointedly that
the sinner's ruin is the fruit of his own conduct ([Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011); [Jer
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019)).

[Job 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 15:34</span></span>

Rather, The binding together of the hypocrites (wicked) shall be
fruitless \[UMBREIT\].

tabernacles of bribery--namely, dwellings of unjust judges, often
reprobated in the Old Testament ([Isa
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023)). The "fire of God" that consumed
Job's possessions ([Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016)) Eliphaz
insinuates may have been on account of Job's bribery as an Arab sheik or
emir.

[Job 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 15:35</span></span>

Bitter irony, illustrating the "unfruitfulness" ([Job
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034)) of the wicked. Their
conceptions and birthgivings consist solely in mischief, &c. ([Isa
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011)).

prepareth--hatcheth.
