### [Luke Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

[Luke 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 10:1</span></span>

MISSION OF THE SEVENTY DISCIPLES, AND THEIR RETURN. (Luke 10:1-24)

the Lord--a becoming title here, as this appointment was an act truly
lordly \[BENGEL\].

other seventy also--rather, "others (also in number), seventy"; probably
with allusion to the seventy elders of Israel on whom the Spirit
descended in the wilderness ([Num
11:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#024).md). The mission, unlike that of
the Twelve, was evidently quite temporary. All the instructions are in
keeping with a brief and hasty pioneering mission, intended to supply
what of general preparation for coming events the Lord's own visit
afterwards to the same "cities and places" ([Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001).md) would not, from want of time,
now suffice to accomplish; whereas the instructions to the Twelve,
besides embracing all those to the Seventy, contemplate world-wide and
permanent effects. Accordingly, after their return from this single
missionary tour, we never again read of the Seventy.

[Luke 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 10:2</span></span>

The harvest, &c.--(See on [Mat 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037).md).

pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth
labourers into his harvest--(See on [Mat
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038).md).

[Luke 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 10:3</span></span>

(See on [Mat 10:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#007).md).

[Luke 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 10:10</span></span>

son of peace--inwardly prepared to embrace your message of peace. See
note on "worthy," (see on [Mat 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013).md).

[Luke 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 10:12</span></span>

(See on [Mat 11:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).md).

for Sodom--Tyre and Sidon were ruined by commercial prosperity; Sodom
sank through its vile pollutions: but the doom of otherwise correct
persons who, amidst a blaze of light, reject the Saviour, shall be less
endurable than that of any of these.

[Luke 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 10:16</span></span>

He that, &c.--(See on [Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040).md).

[Luke 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 10:17</span></span>

returned--evidently not long away.

Lord, &c.--"Thou hast exceeded Thy promise, for 'even the devils,'" &c.
The possession of such power, not being expressly in their commission,
as in that to the Twelve ([Luk 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001).md),
filled them with more astonishment and joy than all else.

through thy name--taking no credit to themselves, but feeling lifted
into a region of unimagined superiority to the powers of evil simply
through their connection with Christ.

[Luke 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 10:18</span></span>

I beheld--As much of the force of this glorious statement depends on the
nice shade of sense indicated by the imperfect tense in the original, it
should be brought out in the translation: "I was beholding Satan as
lightning falling from heaven"; that is, "I followed you on your
mission, and watched its triumphs; while you were wondering at the
subjection to you of devils in My name, a grander spectacle was opening
to My view; sudden as the darting of lightning from heaven to earth, lo!
Satan was beheld falling from heaven!" How remarkable is this, that by
that law of association which connects a part with the whole, those
feeble triumphs of the Seventy seem to have not only brought vividly
before the Redeemer the whole ultimate result of His mission, but
compressed it into a moment and quickened it into the rapidity of
lightning! Note.--The word rendered "devils," is always used for those
spiritual agents employed in demoniacal possessions--never for the
ordinary agency of Satan in rational men. When therefore the Seventy
say, "the devils \[demons\] are subject to us," and Jesus replies, "Mine
eye was beholding Satan falling," it is plain that He meant to raise
their minds not only from the particular to the general, but from a very
temporary form of satanic operation to the entire kingdom of evil. (See
[Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); and compare [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012).md).

[Luke 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 10:19</span></span>

Behold, I give you, &c.--not for any renewal of their mission, though
probably many of them afterwards became ministers of Christ; but simply
as disciples.

serpents and scorpions--the latter more venomous than the former:
literally, in the first instance ([Mar
16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md); [Act
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#005).md); but the next words, "and over
all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you,"
show that the glorious power of faith to "overcome the world" and
"quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one," by the communication and
maintenance of which to His people He makes them innocuous, is what is
meant ([Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md); [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016).md).

[Luke 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 10:20</span></span>

rejoice not, &c.--that is, not so much. So far from forbidding it, He
takes occasion from it to tell them what had been passing in His own
mind. But as power over demons was after all intoxicating, He gives them
a higher joy to balance it, the joy of having their names in Heaven's
register ([Phi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003).md).

[Luke 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 10:21</span></span>

Jesus . . . said, &c.--The very same sublime words were uttered by our
Lord on a former similar occasion (see on [Mat
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025)); but (1.md) There we are merely
told that He "answered and said" thus; here, He "rejoiced in spirit and
said," &c. (2) There it was merely "at that time" (or season) that He
spoke thus, meaning with a general reference to the rejection of His
gospel by the self-sufficient; here, "In that hour Jesus said," with
express reference probably to the humble class from which He had to draw
the Seventy, and the similar class that had chiefly welcomed their
message. "Rejoice" is too weak a word. It is "exulted in
spirit"--evidently giving visible expression to His unusual emotions;
while, at the same time, the words "in spirit" are meant to convey to
the reader the depth of them. This is one of those rare cases in which
the veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like,
we may "look into it" for a moment ([Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md). Let us gaze on it with
reverential wonder, and as we perceive what it was that produced that
mysterious ecstasy, we shall find rising in our hearts a still
rapture--"Oh, the depths!"

[Luke 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 10:23</span></span>

(See on [Mat 13:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016).md).

[Luke 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 10:25</span></span>

QUESTION OF A LAWYER AND PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN. ([Luk
10:25-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025).md)

tempted him--"tested him"; in no hostile spirit, yet with no tender
anxiety for light on that question of questions, but just to see what
insight this great Galilean teacher had.

[Luke 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 10:26</span></span>

What is written in the law--apposite question to a doctor of the law,
and putting him in turn to the test \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 10:27</span></span>

Thou shalt, &c.--the answer Christ Himself gave to another lawyer. (See
on [Mar 12:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029).md).

[Luke 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 10:28</span></span>

he said, &c.--"Right; THIS do, and life is thine"--laying such emphasis
on "this" as to indicate, without expressing it, where the real
difficulty to a sinner lay, and thus nonplussing the questioner himself.

[Luke 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 10:29</span></span>

willing--"wishing," to get himself out of the difficulty, by throwing on
Jesus the definition of "neighbor," which the Jews interpreted very
narrowly and technically, as excluding Samaritans and Gentiles
\[ALFORD\].

[Luke 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 10:30</span></span>

A certain man--a Jew.

from Jerusalem to Jericho--a distance of nineteen miles northeast, a
deep and very fertile hollow--"the Temple of Judea" \[TRENCH\].

thieves--"robbers." The road, being rocky and desolate, was a notorious
haunt of robbers, then and for ages after, and even to this day.

[Luke 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 10:31</span></span>

came down a . . . priest . . . and a Levite--Jericho, the second city of
Judea, was a city of the priests and Levites, and thousands of them
lived there. The two here mentioned are supposed, apparently, to be
returning from temple duties, but they had not learnt what that meaneth,
'I will have mercy and not sacrifice' \[TRENCH\].

saw him--It was not inadvertently that he acted.

came and looked--a further aggravation.

passed by--although the law expressly required the opposite treatment
even of the beast not only of their brethren, but of their enemy ([Deu
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#004.md); [Exo
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md); compare [Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007).md).

[Luke 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 10:33</span></span>

Samaritan--one excommunicated by the Jews, a byword among them,
synonymous with heretic and devil ([Joh
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md); see on [Luk
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#018).md).

had compassion--His best is mentioned first; for "He who gives outward
things gives something external to himself, but he who imparts
compassion and tears gives him something from his very self" \[GREGORY
THE GREAT, in TRENCH\]. No doubt the priest and Levite had their
excuses--It is not safe to be lingering here; besides, he's past
recovery; and then, may not suspicion rest upon ourselves? So might the
Samaritan have reasoned, but did not \[TRENCH\]. Nor did he say, He's a
Jew, who would have had no dealings with me ([Joh
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009).md), and why should I with him?

[Luke 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 10:34</span></span>

oil and wine--the remedies used in such cases all over the East ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md), and elsewhere; the wine to
cleanse the wounds, the oil to assuage their smartings.

on his own beast--himself going on foot.

[Luke 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 10:35</span></span>

two pence--equal to two day's wages of a laborer, and enough for several
days' support.

[Luke 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 10:36</span></span>

Which . . . was neighbour?--a most dexterous way of putting the
question: (1) Turning the question from, "Whom am I to love as my
neighbour?" to "Who is the man that shows that love?" (2) Compelling the
lawyer to give a reply very different from what he would like--not only
condemning his own nation, but those of them who should be the most
exemplary. (3) Making him commend one of a deeply hated race. And he
does it, but it is almost extorted. For he does not answer, "The
Samaritan"--that would have sounded heterodox, heretical--but "He that
showed mercy on him." It comes to the same thing, no doubt, but the
circumlocution is significant.

[Luke 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 10:37</span></span>

Go, &c.--O exquisite, matchless teaching! What new fountains of charity
has not this opened up in the human spirit--rivers in the wilderness,
streams in the desert! What noble Christian institutions have not such
words founded, all undreamed of till that wondrous One came to bless
this heartless world of ours with His incomparable love--first in words,
and then in deeds which have translated His words into flesh and blood,
and poured the life of them through that humanity which He made His own!
Was this parable, now, designed to magnify the law of love, and to show
who fulfils it and who not? And who did this as never man did it, as our
Brother Man, "our Neighbor?" The priests and Levites had not
strengthened the diseased, nor bound up the broken ([Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004).md), while He bound up the
brokenhearted ([Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md), and poured
into all wounded spirits the balm of sweetest consolation. All the
Fathers saw through the thin veil of this noblest of stories, the Story
of love, and never wearied of tracing the analogy (though sometimes
fancifully enough) \[TRENCH\]. Exclaims GREGORY NAZIANZEN (in the fourth
century), "He hungered, but He fed thousands; He was weary, but He is
the Rest of the weary; He is saluted 'Samaritan' and 'Demoniac,' but He
saves him that went down from Jerusalem and fell among thieves," &c.

[Luke 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 10:38</span></span>

received him . . . her house--The house belonged to her, and she appears
throughout to be the older sister.

which also--"who for her part," in contrast with Martha.

sat--"seated herself." From the custom of sitting beneath an instructor,
the phrase "sitting at one's feet" came to mean being a disciple of any
one ([Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003).md).

heard--rather, "kept listening" to His word.

cumbered--"distracted."

came to him--"presented herself before Him," as from another apartment,
in which her sister had "left her to serve (or make preparation) alone."

carest thou not . . . my sister, &c.--"Lord, here am I with everything
to do, and this sister of mine will not lay a hand to anything; thus I
miss something from Thy lips, and Thou from our hands."

bid her, &c.--She presumes not to stop Christ's teaching by calling her
sister away, and thus leaving Him without His one auditor, nor did she
hope perhaps to succeed if she had tried.

[Luke 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 10:41</span></span>

Martha, Martha--emphatically redoubling upon the name.

careful and cumbered--the one word expressing the inward worrying
anxiety that her preparations should be worthy of her Lord; the other,
the outward bustle of those preparations.

many things--"much service" ([Luk
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040).md); too elaborate preparation,
which so engrossed her attention that she missed her Lord's teaching.

[Luke 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 10:42</span></span>

one thing, &c.--The idea of "Short work and little of it suffices for
Me" is not so much the lower sense of these weighty words, as supposed
in them, as the basis of something far loftier than any precept on
economy. Underneath that idea is couched another, as to the littleness
both of elaborate preparation for the present life and of that life
itself, compared with another.

chosen the good part--not in the general sense of Moses' choice ([Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025).md), and Joshua's ([Jos
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015).md), and David's ([Psa
119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030).md); that is, of good in
opposition to bad; but, of two good ways of serving and pleasing the
Lord, choosing the better. Wherein, then, was Mary's better than
Martha's? Hear what follows.

not be taken away--Martha's choice would be taken from her, for her
services would die with her; Mary's never, being spiritual and eternal.
Both were true-hearted disciples, but the one was absorbed in the
higher, the other in the lower of two ways of honoring their common
Lord. Yet neither despised, or would willingly neglect, the other's
occupation. The one represents the contemplative, the other the active
style of the Christian character. A Church full of Marys would perhaps
be as great an evil as a Church full of Marthas. Both are needed, each
to be the complement of the other.
