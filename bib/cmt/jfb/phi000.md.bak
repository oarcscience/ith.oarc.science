### [Philippians Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

[Philippians](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">phi 0:0</span></span>

The INTERNAL EVIDENCE for the authenticity of this Epistle is strong.
The style, manner of thought, and doctrine, accord with Paul's. The
incidental allusions also establish his authorship. PALEY \[HorÃ&brvbr;
PaulinÃ&brvbr;, ch. 7\] instances the mention of the object of
Epaphroditus' journey to Rome, the Philippian contribution to Paul's
wants, Epaphroditus' sickness ([Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md); [Phi
2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md); [Phi
4:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010).md), the fact that Timothy had
been long with Paul at Philippi ([Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Phi
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019).md), the reference to his being a
prisoner at Rome now for a long time ([Phi
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md); [Phi
2:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md), his willingness to die
(compare [Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md), with [Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008).md), the reference to the Philippians
having seen his maltreatment at Philippi ([Phi
1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md); [Phi
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001).md).

The EXTERNAL EVIDENCE is equally decisive: POLYCARP \[Epistle to the
Philippians, 3; 11\]; IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 4.18.4\]; CLEMENT OF
ALEXANDRIA \[The Instructor, 1.1, p. 107\]; EUSEBIUS \[The Epistle of
the Churches of Lyons and Vienne, in Ecclesiastical History, 5. 2\];
TERTULLIAN \[On the Resurrection of the Flesh, 23\]; ORIGEN \[Against
Celsus, 1.3, p. 122\]; CYPRIAN \[Testimonies against the Jews, 3.39\].

Philippi was the first (that is, the farthest from Rome, and first which
met Paul in entering Macedonia) Macedonian city of the district, called
Macedonia Prima (so called as lying farthest eastward). The Greek ([Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012).md) should not be translated "the
chief city," as English Version, but as above \[ALFORD\]. Not it, but
Thessalonica, was the chief city of the province, and Amphipolis, of the
district called Macedonia Prima. It was a Roman "colony" ([Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012).md), made so by Augustus, to
commemorate his famous victory over Brutus and Cassius. A colony was in
fact a portion of Rome itself transplanted to the provinces, an offshoot
from Rome, and as it were a portrait of the mother city on a small scale
\[AULUS GELLIUS, Attic Nights, 16.13\]. Its inhabitants were Roman
citizens, having the right of voting in the Roman tribes, governed by
their own senate and magistrates, and not by the governor of the
province, with the Roman law and Latin language.

Paul, with Silas and Timothy, planted the Gospel there ([Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012), &c..md), in his second missionary
journey, A.D. 51. Doubtless he visited it again on his journey from
Ephesus into Macedonia ([Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001).md);
and [Act 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md), [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md), expressly mentions his third
visit on his return from Greece (Corinth) to Syria by way of Macedonia.
His sufferings at Philippi ([Act
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019), &c..md) strengthened the Christian
bond of union between him and his Philippian converts, who also, like
him, were exposed to trials for the Gospel's sake ([Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002).md). They alone sent supplies for his
temporal wants, twice shortly after he had left them ([Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015).md), and again a third time
shortly before writing this Epistle ([Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md), [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009).md). This fervent attachment on
their part was, perhaps, also in part due to the fact that few Jews were
in Philippi, as in other scenes of his labors, to sow the seeds of
distrust and suspicion. There was no synagogue, but merely a Jewish
Proseucha, or oratory, by the riverside. So that there only do we read
of his meeting no opposition from Jews, but only from the masters of the
divining damsel, whose gains had been put an end to by her being
dispossessed.

Though the Philippian Church was as yet free from Judaizing influence,
yet it needed to be forewarned of that danger which might at any time
assail it from without ([Phi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002).md);
even as such evil influences had crept into the Galatian churches. In
[Phi 4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002.md) we find a trace of the fact
recorded in the history ([Act
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013).md), that female converts were
among the first to receive the Gospel at Philippi.

As to the state of the Church, we gather from [Co2
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md) that its members were poor, yet
most liberal; and from [Phi 1:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md),
that they were undergoing persecution. The only blemish referred to in
their character was, on the part of some members, a tendency to
dissension. Hence arise his admonitions against disputings ([Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md); [Phi
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md), [Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md), [Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md); [Phi
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002).md).

The OBJECT of the Epistle is general: not only to thank the Philippians
for their contribution sent by Epaphroditus, who was now in returning to
take back the apostle's letter, but to express his Christian love and
sympathy, and to exhort them to a life consonant with that of Christ,
and to warn them against existing dissensions and future possible
assaults of Judaizers from without. It is remarkable in this Epistle
alone, as compared with the others, that, amidst many commendations,
there are no express censures of those to whom it is addressed. No
doctrinal error, or schism, has as yet sprung up; the only blemish
hinted at is, that some of the Philippian Church were somewhat wanting
in lowliness of mind, the result of which want was disputation. Two
women, Euodias and Syntyche, are mentioned as having erred in this
respect ([Phi 4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002).md). The Epistle may
be divided into three parts: (1) Affectionate address to the
Philippians; reference to his own state as a prisoner at Rome, and to
theirs, and to his mission of Epaphroditus to them (the first and second
chapters). Epaphroditus probably held a leading office in the Philippian
Church, perhaps as a presbyter. After Tychicus and Onesimus had departed
(A.D. 62), carrying the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and
Philemon, Paul was cheered in his imprisonment by the arrival of
Epaphroditus with the Philippian contribution. That faithful "brother,
companion in labor, and fellow soldier" ([Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025).md), had brought on himself by the
fatigues of the journey a dangerous sickness ([Phi
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md), [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030).md). But now that he was recovered,
he "longed" ([Phi 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026).md) to return to
his Philippian flock, and in person to relieve their anxiety on his
behalf, in respect to his sickness; and the apostle gladly availed
himself of the opportunity of writing to them a letter of grateful
acknowledgments and Christian exhortations. (2) Caution against
Judaizing teachers, supported by reference to his own former and present
feeling towards Jewish legalism (Phi. 3:1-21). (3) Admonitions to
individuals, and to the Church in general, thanks for their seasonable
aid, and concluding benedictions and salutations (Phi. 4:1-23).

This Epistle was written from Rome during the imprisonment, the
beginning of which is related in [Act
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016.md), [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md), [Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md). The reference to
"CÃ&brvbr;sar's household" ([Phi
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022).md), and to the "palace" ([Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md), Greek, "PrÃ&brvbr;torium,"
probably, the barrack of the PrÃ&brvbr;torian bodyguard, attached to the
palace of Nero) confirms this. It must have been during his first
imprisonment at Rome, for the mention of the PrÃ&brvbr;torium agrees
with the fact that it was during his first imprisonment he was in the
custody of the PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect, and his situation, described in
[Phi 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md), agrees with his
situation in the first two years of his imprisonment ([Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030).md). The following reasons show,
moreover, that it was written towards the close of that imprisonment:
(1) He, in it, expresses his expectation of the immediate decision of
his cause ([Phi 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023)). (2.md) Enough time
had elapsed for the Philippians to hear of his imprisonment, to send
Epaphroditus to him, to hear of Epaphroditus' arrival and sickness, and
send back word to Rome of their distress ([Phi
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026)). (3.md) It must have been written
after the three other Epistles sent from Rome, namely, Colossians,
Ephesians, and Philemon; for Luke is no longer with him ([Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020).md); otherwise he would have been
specified as saluting them, having formerly labored among them, whereas
he is mentioned as with him, [Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md). Again, in [Eph
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md), his freedom to preach is
implied: but in [Phi 1:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md), his
bondage is dwelt on, and it is implied that, not himself, but others,
preached, and made his imprisonment known. Again, in [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md), he confidently anticipates his
release, which contrasts with the more depressed anticipations of this
Epistle. (4) A considerable time had elapsed since the beginning of his
imprisonment, for "his bonds" to have become so widely known, and to
have produced such good effects for the Gospel ([Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013)). (5.md) There is evidently an
increase in the rigor of his imprisonment implied now, as compared with
the early stage of it, as described in Acts 28:1-31; compare [Phi
1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md); [Phi
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md). History furnishes a probable
clue to account for this increase of vigor. In the second year of Paul's
imprisonment (A.D. 62), Burrus, the PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect, to whose
custody he had been committed ([Act
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016), "the captain of the guard".md),
died; and Nero the emperor having divorced Octavia, and married Poppoea,
a Jewish proselytess (who then caused her rival, Octavia, to be
murdered, and gloated over the head of her victim), exalted Tigellinus,
the chief promoter of the marriage, a monster of wickedness, to the
PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefecture. It was then he seems to have been removed
from his own house into the PrÃ&brvbr;torium, or barrack of the
PrÃ&brvbr;torian guards, attached to the palace, for stricter custody;
and hence he writes with less hopeful anticipations as to the result of
his trial ([Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md); [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011).md). Some of the PrÃ&brvbr;torian
guards who had the custody of him before, would then naturally make
known his "bonds," in accordance with [Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md); from the smaller
PrÃ&brvbr;torian bodyguard at the palace the report would spread to the
general permanent PrÃ&brvbr;torian camp, which Tiberius had established
north of the city, outside of the walls. He had arrived in Rome,
February, 61; the "two whole years ([Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030).md) in his own hired house" ended
February, 63, so that the date of this Epistle, written shortly after,
evidently while the danger was imminent, would be about spring or
summer, 63. The providence of God averted the danger. He probably was
thought beneath the notice of Tigellinus, who was more intent on court
intrigues. The death of Nero's favorite, Pallas, the brother of Felix,
this same year, also took out of the way another source of danger.

The STYLE is abrupt and discontinuous, his fervor of affection leading
him to pass rapidly from one theme to another ([Phi
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018.md), [Phi
2:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), [Phi
2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md); [Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md), [Phi
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md), [Phi
3:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md), [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015).md). In no Epistle does he use so
warm expressions of love. In [Phi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)
he seems at a loss for words sufficient to express all the extent and
ardor of his affection for the Philippians: "My brethren dearly beloved
and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly
beloved." The mention of bishops and deacons in [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md) is due to the late date of the
Epistle, at a time when the Church had begun to assume that order which
is laid down in the Pastoral Epistles, and which continued the prevalent
one in the first and purest age of the Church.
