[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 15:1</span></span>

ABIJAM'S WICKED REIGN OVER JUDAH. ([Kg1
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001))

Abijam--His name was at first Abijah ([Ch2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#016)); "Jah," the name of God,
according to an ancient fashion, being conjoined with it. But
afterwards, when he was found "walking in all the sins of his father"
\[[Kg1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)\], that honorable addition
was withdrawn, and his name in sacred history changed into Abijam
\[LIGHTFOOT\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 15:2</span></span>

Three years reigned he--(compare [Kg1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001) with [Kg1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009)). Parts of years are often
counted in Scripture as whole years. The reign began in Jeroboam's
eighteenth year, continued till the nineteenth, and ended in the course
of the twentieth.

his mother's name was Maachah--or Michaiah ([Ch2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002)), probably altered from the one
to the other on her becoming queen, as was very common under a change of
circumstances. She is called the daughter of Abishalom, or Absalom ([Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021)), of Uriel ([Ch2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002)). Hence, it has been thought
probable that Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ([Sa2
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027); [Sa2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018)), had been married to Uriel, and
that Maachah was their daughter.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 15:3</span></span>

his heart was not perfect with the Lord . . . , as the heart of David
his father--(Compare [Kg1 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004); [Kg1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022)). He was not positively bad at
first, for it appears that he had done something to restore the pillaged
treasures of the temple ([Kg1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)).
This phrase contains a comparative reference to David's heart. His doing
that which was right in the eyes of the Lord ([Kg1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005)) is frequently used in speaking
of the kings of Judah, and means only that they did or did not do that
which, in the general course and tendency of their government, was
acceptable to God. It furnishes no evidence as to the lawfulness or
piety of one specific act.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp--"A lamp" in one's
house is an Oriental phrase for continuance of family name and
prosperity. Abijam was not rejected only in consequence of the divine
promise to David (see on 1Ki. 11:13-36).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

ASA'S GOOD REIGN. ([Kg1 15:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009))

his mother's name was Maachah--She was properly his grandmother, and she
is here called "the king's mother," from the post of dignity which at
the beginning of his reign she possessed. Asa, as a constitutional
monarch, acted like the pious David, laboring to abolish the traces and
polluting practices of idolatry, and in pursuance of his impartial
conduct, he did not spare delinquents even of the highest rank.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen--The
sultana, or queen dowager, was not necessarily the king's natural mother
(see [Kg1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019)), nor was Maachah. Her
title, and the privileges connected with that honor and dignity which
gave her precedency among the ladies of the royal family, and great
influence in the kingdom, were taken away. She was degraded for her
idolatry.

because she had made an idol in a grove--A very obscene figure, and the
grove was devoted to the grossest licentiousness. His plans of religious
reformation, however, were not completely carried through, "the high
places were not removed" (see [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)). The suppression of this private
worship on natural or artificial hills, though a forbidden service after
the temple had been declared the exclusive place of worship, the most
pious king's laws were not able to accomplish.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 15:15</span></span>

he brought in the things which his father had dedicated--Probably the
spoils which Abijam had taken from the vanquished army of Jeroboam (see
[Ch2 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#016)).

and the things which himself had dedicated--after his own victory over
the Cushites ([Ch2 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 15:16</span></span>

there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days--Asa
enjoyed a ten years' peace after Jeroboam's defeat by Abijam, and this
interval was wisely and energetically spent in making internal reforms,
as well as increasing the means of national defense ([Ch2
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)). In the fifteenth year of his
reign, however, the king of Israel commenced hostilities against him,
and, invading his kingdom, erected a strong fortress at Ramah, which was
near Gibeah, and only six Roman miles from Jerusalem. Afraid lest his
subjects might quit his kingdom and return to the worship of their
fathers, he wished to cut off all intercourse between the two nations.
Ramah stood on an eminence overhanging a narrow ravine which separated
Israel from Judah, and therefore he took up a hostile position in that
place.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 15:18</span></span>

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the . . .
house of the Lord--Asa's religious character is now seen to decline. He
trusted not in the Lord ([Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007)).
In this emergency Asa solicited the powerful aid of the king of
Damascene-Syria; and to bribe him to break off his alliance with Baasha,
he transmitted to him the treasure lying in the temple and palace. The
Syrian mercenaries were gained. Instances are to be found, both in the
ancient and modern history of the East, of the violation of treaties
equally sudden and unscrupulous, through the presentation of some
tempting bribe. Ben-hadad poured an army into the northern provinces of
Israel, and having captured some cities in Galilee, on the borders of
Syria, compelled Baasha to withdraw from Ramah back within his own
territories.

Ben-hadad--(See on [Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 15:22</span></span>

Then king Asa made a proclamation--The fortifications which Baasha had
erected at Ramah were demolished, and with the materials were built
other defenses, where Asa thought they were needed--at Geba (now Jeba)
and Mizpeh (now Neby Samuil), about two hours' travelling north of
Jerusalem.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 15:23</span></span>

in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet--(See on [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012), where an additional proof is
given of his religious degeneracy.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

NADAB'S WICKED REIGN. ([Kg1 15:25-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025))

Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign--No record is given of him,
except his close adherence to the bad policy of his father.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 15:27</span></span>

Baasha smote him at Gibbethon--This town, within the tribe of Dan, was
given to the Levites ([Jos 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044)). It
lay on the Philistine borders, and having been seized by that people,
Nadab laid siege to recover it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 15:29</span></span>

when he reigned, he smote all the house of Jeroboam--It was according to
a barbarous practice too common in the East, for a usurper to extirpate
all rival candidates for the throne; but it was an accomplishment of
Ahijah's prophecy concerning Jeroboam ([Kg1
14:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010)).
