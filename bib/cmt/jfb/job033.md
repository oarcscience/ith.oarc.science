### [Job Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001.md)

[Job 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 33:2</span></span>

ADDRESS TO JOB, AS (Job 32:1-22) TO THE FRIENDS. (Job 33:1-33)

mouth--rather, "palate," whereby the taste discerns. Every man speaks
with his mouth, but few, as Elihu, try their words with discrimination
first, and only say what is really good ([Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030.md); [Job
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011).md).

hath spoken--rather, "proceeds to speak."

[Job 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 33:3</span></span>

I will speak according to my inward conviction.

clearly--rather, "purely"; sincerely, not distorting the truth through
passion, as the friends did.

[Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 33:4</span></span>

The Spirit of God hath made me--as He did thee: latter clause of [Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md) ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md). Therefore thou needest not fear
me, as thou wouldest God ([Job 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007.md);
[Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034).md). On the other hand, "the
breath of the Almighty hath inspired me" (as [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008).md); not as English Version, "given
me life"; therefore "I am according to thy wish ([Job
9:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032).md) in God's stead" to thee; a
"daysman," umpire, or mediator, between God and thee. So Elihu was
designed by the Holy Ghost to be a type of Jesus Christ ([Job
33:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md).

[Job 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 33:5</span></span>

Images from a court of justice.

stand up--alluding to Job's words ([Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020).md).

[Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 33:6</span></span>

(See on [Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md); [Job
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md); [Job
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md), [Job
13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#020).md).

formed--Though acting as God's representative, I am but a creature, like
thyself. Arabic, "pressed together," as a mass of clay by the potter, in
forming a vessel \[UMBREIT\]. Hebrew, "cut off," as the portion taken
from the clay to form it \[MAURER\].

[Job 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 33:7</span></span>

hand--alluding to Job's words ([Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021).md).

[Job 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 33:8</span></span>

thy words-- ([Job 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007.md); [Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md); [Job
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md); [Job
27:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005.md); [Job
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014).md). In [Job
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md); [Job
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md), Job had acknowledged sin; but
the general spirit of his words was to maintain himself to be "clean,"
and to charge God with injustice. He went too far on the opposite side
in opposing the friends' false charge of hypocrisy. Even the godly,
though willing to confess themselves sinners in general, often dislike
sin in particular to be brought as a charge against them. Affliction is
therefore needed to bring them to feel that sin in them deserves even
worse than they suffer and that God does them no injustice. Then at last
humbled under God they find, affliction is for their real good, and so
at last it is taken away either here, or at least at death. To teach
this is Elihu's mission.

[Job 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 33:9</span></span>

clean--spotless.

[Job 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 33:10</span></span>

occasions--for hostility; literally, "enmities" ([Job
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024.md); [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md); [Job
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#011.md); [Job
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021).md).

[Job 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 33:11</span></span>

([Job 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027).md).

marketh--narrowly watches ([Job 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016.md);
[Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md); [Job
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004).md).

[Job 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 33:12</span></span>

in this--view of God and His government. It cannot be that God should
jealously "watch" man, though "spotless," as an "enemy," or as one
afraid of him as an equal. For "God is greater than man!" There must be
sin in man, even though he be no hypocrite, which needs correction by
suffering for the sufferer's good.

[Job 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 33:13</span></span>

([Isa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009).md).

his matters--ways. Our part is, not to "strive" with God, but to submit.
To believe it is right because He does it, not because we see all the
reasons for His doing it.

[Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 33:14</span></span>

Translate, "Yet, man regardeth it not"; or rather, as UMBREIT, "Yea,
twice (He repeats the warning)--if man gives no heed" to the first
warning. Elihu implies that God's reason for sending affliction is
because, when God has communicated His will in various ways, man in
prosperity has not heeded it; God therefore must try what affliction
will effect ([Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002.md); [Psa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011.md); [Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010.md), [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013).md).

[Job 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 33:15</span></span>

slumberings--light is opposed to "deep sleep." Elihu has in view Eliphaz
([Job 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013).md), and also Job himself
([Job 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014).md). "Dreams" in sleep, and
"visions" of actual apparitions, were among the ways whereby God then
spake to man ([Gen 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003).md).

[Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 33:16</span></span>

Literally, "sealeth (their ears) to Himself by warnings," that is, with
the sureness and secrecy of a seal He reveals His warnings \[UMBREIT\].
To seal up securely ([Job 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007).md).

[Job 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 33:17</span></span>

purpose--Margin, "work." So [Job 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009.md).
So "business" in a bad sense ([Sa1
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019).md). Elihu alludes to Job's words
([Job 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011).md). "Pride," an open "pit"
([Job 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018).md) which God hides or covers
up, lest man should fall into it. Even the godly need to learn the
lesson which trials teach, to "humble themselves under the mighty hand
of God."

[Job 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 33:18</span></span>

his soul--his life.

the pit--the grave; a symbol of hell.

perishing by the sword--that is, a violent death; in the Old Testament a
symbol of the future punishment of the ungodly.

[Job 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 33:19</span></span>

When man does not heed warnings of the night, he is chastened, &c. The
new thought suggested by Elihu is that affliction is disciplinary ([Job
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010).md); for the good of the godly.

multitude--so the Margin, Hebrew (Keri). Better with the text (Chetib),
"And with the perpetual (strong) contest of his bones"; the
never-resting fever in his bones ([Psa
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003).md) \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 33:20</span></span>

life--that is, the appetite, which ordinarily sustains "life" ([Job
38:39](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#039.md); [Psa
107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018.md); [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005).md). The taking away of desire for
food by sickness symbolizes the removal by affliction of lust, for
things which foster the spiritual fever of pride.

soul--desire.

[Job 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 33:21</span></span>

His flesh once prominent "can no more be seen." His bones once not seen
now appear prominent.

stick out--literally, "are bare." The Margin, Hebrew (Keri) reading. The
text (Chetib) reads it a noun "(are become) bareness." The Keri was no
doubt an explanatory reading of transcribers.

[Job 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 33:22</span></span>

destroyers--angels of death commissioned by God to end man's life ([Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md); [Psa
78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049).md). The death pains personified
may, however, be meant; so "gnawers" (see on [Job
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017).md).

[Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 33:23</span></span>

Elihu refers to himself as the divinely-sent ([Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006).md) "messenger," the "interpreter"
to explain to Job and vindicate God's righteousness; such a one Eliphaz
had denied that Job could look for ([Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001).md), and Job ([Job
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033).md) had wished for such a "daysman"
or umpire between him and God. The "messenger" of good is antithetical
to the "destroyers" ([Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md).

with him--if there be vouchsafed to the sufferer. The office of the
interpreter is stated "to show unto man God's uprightness" in His
dealings; or, as UMBREIT, "man's upright course towards God" ([Pro
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002).md). The former is better; Job
maintained his own "uprightness" ([Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md); [Job
27:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005).md); Elihu on the contrary
maintains God's, and that man's true uprightness lies in submission to
God. "One among a thousand" is a man rarely to be found. So Jesus Christ
([Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010).md). Elihu, the God-sent
mediator of a temporal deliverance, is a type of the God-man Jesus
Christ the Mediator of eternal deliverance: "the messenger of the
covenant" ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md). This is the
wonderful work of the Holy Ghost, that persons and events move in their
own sphere in such a way as unconsciously to shadow forth Him, whose
"testimony is the Spirit of prophecy"; as the same point may be center
of a small and of a vastly larger concentric circle.

[Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 33:24</span></span>

Apodosis to [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md).

he--God.

Deliver--literally, "redeem"; in it and "ransom" there is reference to
the consideration, on account of which God pardons and relieves the
sufferers; here it is primarily the intercession of Elihu. But the
language is too strong for its full meaning to be exhausted by this. The
Holy Ghost has suggested language which receives its full realization
only in the "eternal redemption found" by God in the price paid by Jesus
Christ for it; that is, His blood and meritorious intercession ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md). "Obtained," literally, "found";
implying the earnest zeal, wisdom, and faithfulness of the finder, and
the newness and joyousness of the finding. Jesus Christ could not but
have found it, but still His seeking it was needed \[BENGEL\], ([Luk
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008).md). God the Father, is the Finder
([Psa 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019).md). Jesus Christ the
Redeemer, to whom He saith, Redeem (so Hebrew) him from going, &c. ([Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019).md).

ransom--used in a general sense by Elihu, but meant by the Holy Ghost in
its strict sense as applied to Jesus Christ, of a price paid for
deliverance ([Exo 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030).md), an atonement
(that is, means of selling at once, that is, reconciling "two" who are
estranged), a covering, as of the ark with pitch, typical of what covers
us sinners from wrath ([Gen 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md); [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md). The pit is primarily here the
grave ([Isa 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017).md), but the spiritual
pit is mainly shadowed forth ([Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011).md).

[Job 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 33:25</span></span>

Effects of restoration to God's favor; literally, to Job a temporal
revival; spiritually, an eternal regeneration. The striking words cannot
be restricted to their temporal meaning, as used by Elihu ([Pe1
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md).

his flesh shall be fresher than a child's--so Naaman, [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md), spiritually, [Joh
3:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md).

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 33:26</span></span>

Job shall no longer pray to God, as he complains, in vain ([Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md), [Job
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008).md). True especially to the
redeemed in Jesus Christ ([Joh
16:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023).md).

he--Job.

shall see his face--or, God shall make Job to see His face \[MAURER\].
God shall no longer "hide His face" ([Job
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024).md). True to the believer now ([Joh
14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021).md); eternally ([Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md); [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md).

his--God's

righteousness--God will again make the restored Job no longer ("I
perverted . . . right," [Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027).md)
doubt God's justice, but to justify Him in His dealings. The penitent
justifies God ([Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md). So the
believer is made to see God's righteousness in Jesus Christ ([Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md); [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013).md).

[Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 33:27</span></span>

he looketh--God. Rather, with UMBREIT, "Now he (the restored penitent)
singeth joyfully (answering to "joy," [Job
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026.md); [Psa
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012).md) before men, and saith," &c.
([Pro 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020.md); [Psa
66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md); [Psa
116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014).md).

perverted--made the straight crooked: as Job had misrepresented God's
character.

profited--literally, "was made even" to me; rather, "My punishment was
not commensurate with my sin" (so Zophar, [Job
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006).md); the reverse of what Job
heretofore said ([Job 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md); [Psa
103:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010.md); [Ezr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013).md).

[Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 33:28</span></span>

(See on [Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024).md); rather, as Hebrew
text (English Version reads as the Margin, Hebrew, Keri, "his soul, his
life"), "He hath delivered my soul . . . my life." Continuation of the
penitent's testimony to the people.

[Job 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 33:29</span></span>

[Job 33:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019.md); now, by the
"messenger," thirdly, [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md).
