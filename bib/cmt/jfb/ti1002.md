### [1 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 2:1</span></span>

PUBLIC WORSHIP. DIRECTION AS TO INTERCESSIONS FOR ALL MEN, SINCE CHRIST
IS A RANSOM FOR ALL. THE DUTIES OF MEN AND WOMEN RESPECTIVELY IN RESPECT
TO PUBLIC PRAYER. WOMAN'S SUBJECTION; HER SPHERE OF DUTY. ([Ti1
2:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001))

therefore--taking up again the general subject of the Epistle in
continuation ([Ti2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001)). "What I have
therefore to say to thee by way of a charge ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018)), is," &c.

that, first of all . . . be made--ALFORD takes it, "I exhort first of
all to make." "First of all," doubtless, is to be connected with "I
exhort"; what I begin with (for special reasons), is . . . As the
destruction of Jerusalem drew near, the Jews (including those at
Ephesus) were seized with the dream of freedom from every yoke; and so
virtually "'blasphemed" (compare [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020)) God's name by "speaking evil of
dignities" ([Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001); [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010); [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)). Hence Paul, in opposition, gives
prominence to the injunction that prayer be made for all men, especially
for magistrates and kings ([Tit 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001))
\[OLSHAUSEN\]. Some professing Christians looked down on all not
Christians, as doomed to perdition; but Paul says all men are to be
prayed for, as Christ died for all ([Ti1
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004)).

supplications--a term implying the suppliant's sense of need, and of his
own insufficiency.

prayers--implying devotion.

intercessions--properly the coming near to God with childlike
confidence, generally in behalf of another. The accumulation of terms
implies prayer in its every form and aspect, according to all the
relations implied in it.

[1 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 2:2</span></span>

For kings--an effectual confutation of the adversaries who accused the
Christians of disaffection to the ruling powers ([Act
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007); [Rom
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)).

all . . . in authority--literally, "in eminence"; in stations of
eminence. The "quiet" of Christians was often more dependent on
subordinate rulers, than on the supreme king; hence, "all . . . in
authority" are to be prayed for.

that we may lead--that we may be blessed with such good government as to
lead . . . ; or rather, as Greek, "to pass" or "spend." The prayers of
Christians for the government bring down from heaven peace and order in
a state.

quiet--not troubled from without.

peaceable--"tranquil"; not troubled from within \[OLSHAUSEN\]. "He is
peaceable (Greek) who makes no disturbance; he is quiet (Greek) who is
himself free from disturbance" \[TITTMANN\].

in all godliness--"in all (possible . . . requisite) piety" \[ALFORD\].
A distinct Greek word, [Ti1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010),
expresses "godliness."

honesty--Greek, "gravity" ([Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002),
[Tit 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007)), "decorum," or propriety of
conduct. As "piety" is in relation to God, "gravity" is propriety of
behavior among men. In the Old Testament the Jews were commanded to pray
for their heathen rulers ([Ezr 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010);
[Jer 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007)). The Jews, by Augustus'
order, offered a lamb daily for the Roman emperor, till near the
destruction of Jerusalem. The Jewish Zealots, instigated by Eleazar,
caused this custom to cease \[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 2.17\], whence
the war originated, according to JOSEPHUS.

[1 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 2:3</span></span>

this--praying for all men.

in the sight of God--not merely before men, as if it were their favor
that we sought ([Co2 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021)).

our Saviour--a title appropriate to the matter in hand. He who is "our
Saviour" is willing that all should be saved ([Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004); [Rom
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018)); therefore we should meet the
will of God in behalf of others, by praying for the salvation of all
men. More would be converted if we would pray more. He has actually
saved us who believe, being "our Saviour." He is willing that all should
be saved, even those who do not as yet believe, if they will believe
(compare [Ti1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010); [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)).

[1 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 2:4</span></span>

"Imitate God." Since He wishes that all should be saved, do you also
wish it; and if you wish it, pray for it. For prayer is the instrument
of effecting such things \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Paul does not say, "He wishes
to save all"; for then he would have saved all in matter of fact; but
"will have all men to be saved," implies the possibility of man's
accepting it (through God's prevenient grace) or rejecting it (through
man's own perversity). Our prayers ought to include all, as God's grace
included all.

to come--They are not forced.

unto the knowledge--Greek, "the full knowledge" or "recognition" (See on
[Co1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012); [Phi
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009)).

the truth--the saving truth as it is in, and by, Jesus ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003), [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)).

[1 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 2:5</span></span>

For there is one God--God's unity in essence and purpose is a proof of
His comprehending all His human children alike (created in His image) in
His offer of grace (compare the same argument from His unity, [Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030); [Gal
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020)); therefore all are to be prayed
for. [Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004) is proved from [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005); [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001), from [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004). The one God is common to all
([Isa 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022); [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026)). The one Mediator is mediator
between God and all men potentially ([Rom
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029); [Eph
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005); [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024)). They who have not this one God
by one Mediator, have none: literally, a "go-between." The Greek order
is not "and one mediator," but "one mediator also between . . . While
God will have all men to be saved by knowing God and the Mediator, there
is a legitimate, holy order in the exercise of that will wherewith men
ought to receive it. All mankind constitute, as it were, ONE MAN before
God \[BENGEL\].

the man--rather "man," absolutely and genetically: not a mere individual
man: the Second Head of humanity, representing and embodying in Himself
the whole human race and nature. There is no "the" in the Greek. This
epithet is thus the strongest corroboration of his argument, namely,
that Christ's mediation affects the whole race, since there is but the
one Mediator, designed as the Representative Man for all men alike
(compare [Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006); [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019); [Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)). His being "man" was necessary
to His being a Mediator, sympathizing with us through experimental
knowledge of our nature ([Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004);
[Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014); [Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)). Even in nature, almost all
blessings are conveyed to us from God, not immediately, but through the
mediation of various agents. The effectual intercession of Moses for
Israel ([Num 14:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013), and Deu.
9:1-29); of Abraham for Abimelech ([Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007)); of Job for his friends ([Job
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010)), the mediation being PRESCRIBED
by God while declaring His purposes of forgiveness: all prefigure the
grand mediation for all by the one Mediator. On the other hand, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016) asserts that He was also God.

[1 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 2:6</span></span>

gave himself-- ([Tit 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014)). Not only
the Father gave Him for us ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)); but the Son gave Himself ([Phi
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005)).

ransom--properly of a captive slave. Man was the captive slave of Satan,
sold under sin. He was unable to ransom himself, because absolute
obedience is due to God, and therefore no act of ours can satisfy for
the least offense. [Lev 25:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#048) allowed
one sold captive to be redeemed by one of his brethren. The Son of God,
therefore, became man in order that, being made like unto us in all
things, sin only excepted, as our elder brother He should redeem us
([Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018)). The Greek implies not merely
ransom, but a substituted or equivalent ransom: the Greek preposition,
"anti," implying reciprocity and vicarious substitution.

for all--Greek, "in behalf of all": not merely for a privileged few;
compare [Ti1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001) : the argument for
praying in behalf of all is given here.

to be testified--Greek, "the testimony (that which was to be testified
of, [Jo1 5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008)) in its own due
times," or seasons, that is, in the times appointed by God for its being
testified of ([Ti1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003)). The oneness of the Mediator,
involving the universality of redemption (which faith, however, alone
appropriates), was the great subject of Christian testimony \[ALFORD\]
([Co1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006); [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001); [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010)).

[1 Timothy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 2:7</span></span>

Whereunto--For the giving of which testimony.

I am ordained--literally, "I was set": the same Greek, as "putting me,"
&c. ([Ti1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012)).

preacher--literally, "herald" ([Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021); [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027); [Co1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011); [Ti2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003)). He recurs to himself, as in [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016), in himself a living pattern or
announcement of the Gospel, so here "a herald and teacher of (it to) the
Gentiles" ([Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009); [Eph
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023)). The universality of his
commission is an appropriate assertion here, where he is arguing to
prove that prayers are to be made "for all men" ([Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)).

I speak the truth . . . and lie not--a strong asseveration of his
universal commission, characteristic of the ardor of the apostle,
exposed to frequent conflict ([Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001); [Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)).

in faith and verity--rather, "in the faith and the truth." The sphere in
which his ministry was appointed to be exercised was the faith and the
truth ([Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004)): the Gospel truth,
the subject matter of the faith \[WIESINGER\].

[1 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 2:8</span></span>

I will--The active wish, or desire, is meant.

that men--rather as Greek, "that the men," as distinguished from "the
women," to whom he has something different to say from what he said to
the men ([Ti1 2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009); [Co1
11:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014); [Co1
14:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)). The emphasis, however, is
not on this, but on the precept of praying, resumed from [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001).

everywhere--Greek, "in every place," namely, of public prayer.
Fulfilling [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011), "In every place
. . . from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same .
. . incense shall be offered unto My name"; and Jesus' words, [Mat
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021), [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023).

lifting up holy hands--The early Christians turned up their palms
towards heaven, as those craving help do. So also Solomon ([Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022); [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002)). The Jews washed their hands
before prayer ([Psa 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006)). Paul
figuratively (compare [Job 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008)) uses language alluding to this
custom here: so [Isa 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015). The
Greek for "holy" means hands which have committed no impiety, and
observed every sacred duty. This (or at least the contrite desire to be
so) is a needful qualification for effectual prayer ([Psa
24:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003)).

without wrath--putting it away ([Mat
5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023); [Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015)).

doubting--rather, "disputing," as the Greek is translated in [Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014). Such things hinder prayer ([Luk
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046); [Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001); [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007)). BENGEL supports English Version
(compare an instance, [Kg2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002); [Mat
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#031); [Mar
11:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022); [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006)).

[1 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 2:9</span></span>

The context requires that we understand these directions as to women, in
relation to their deportment in public worship, though the rules will
hold good on other occasions also.

in modest apparel--"in seemly guise" \[ELLICOTT\]. The adjective means
properly. orderly, decorous, becoming; the noun in secular writings
means conduct, bearing. But here "apparel." Women are apt to love fine
dress; and at Ephesus the riches of some ([Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017)) would lead them to dress
luxuriously. The Greek in [Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003) is
a more general term meaning "deportment."

shamefacedness--TRENCH spells this word according to its true
derivation, "shamefastness" (that which is made fast by an honorable
shame); as "steadfastness" (compare [Ti1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)).

sobriety--"self-restraint" \[ALFORD\]. Habitual inner self-government
\[TRENCH\]. I prefer ELLICOTT'S translation, "sober-mindedness": the
well-balanced state of mind arising from habitual self-restraint.

with--Greek, "in."

braided hair--literally, "plaits," that is, plaited hair: probably with
the "gold and pearls" intertwined ([Pe1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003)). Such gaud is characteristic of
the spiritual harlot ([Rev 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004)).

[1 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 2:10</span></span>

professing--Greek, "promising": engaging to follow.

with good works--The Greek preposition is not the same as in [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009); "by means of," or "through good
works." Their adorning is to be effected by means of good works: not
that they are to be clothed in, or with, them ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)). Works, not words in public, is
their province ([Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008), [Ti1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011); [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)). Works are often mentioned in the
Pastoral Epistles in order to oppose the loose living, combined with the
loose doctrine, of the false teachers. The discharge of everyday duties
is honored with the designation, "good works."

[1 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 2:11</span></span>

learn--not "teach" ([Ti1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012); [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)). She should not even put
questions in the public assembly ([Co1
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035)).

with all subjection--not "usurping authority" ([Ti1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)). She might teach, but not in
public ([Act 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)). Paul probably
wrote this Epistle from Corinth, where the precept ([Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034)) was in force.

[1 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 2:12</span></span>

usurp authority--"to lord it over the man" \[ALFORD\], literally, "to be
an autocrat."

[1 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 2:13</span></span>

For--reason of the precept; the original order of creation.

Adam . . . first--before Eve, who was created for him ([Co1
11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#008)).

[1 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 2:14</span></span>

Adam was not deceived--as Eve was deceived by the serpent; but was
persuaded by his wife. [Gen 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017),
"hearkened unto . . . voice of . . . wife." But in [Gen
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#013), Eve says, "The serpent beguiled
me." Being more easily deceived, she more easily deceives \[BENGEL\],
([Co2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)). Last in being, she was
first in sin--indeed, she alone was deceived. The subtle serpent knew
that she was "the weaker vessel" ([Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007)). He therefore tempted her, not
Adam. She yielded to the temptations of sense and the deceits of Satan;
he, to conjugal love. Hence, in the order of God's judicial sentence,
the serpent, the prime offender, stands first; the woman, who was
deceived, next; and the man, persuaded by his wife, last ([Gen
3:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014)). In [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012), Adam is represented as the first
transgressor; but there no reference is made to Eve, and Adam is
regarded as the head of the sinning race. Hence, as here, [Ti1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011), in [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016), woman's "subjection" is
represented as the consequence of her being deceived.

being deceived--The oldest manuscripts read the compound Greek verb for
the simple, "Having been seduced by deceit": implying how completely
Satan succeeded in deceiving her.

was in the transgression--Greek, "came to be in the transgression":
became involved in the existing state of transgression, literally, "the
going beyond a command"; breach of a positive precept ([Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)).

[1 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 2:15</span></span>

be saved in childbearing--Greek, "in (literally, 'through') (her,
literally, 'the') child-bearing." Through, or by, is often so used to
express not the means of her salvation, but the circumstances AMIDST
which it has place. Thus [Co1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015),
"He . . . shall be saved: yet so as by (literally, 'through,' that is,
amidst) fire": in spite of the fiery ordeal which he has necessarily to
pass through, he shall be saved. So here, "In spite of the trial of
childbearing which she passes through (as her portion of the curse, [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016), 'in sorrow shalt thou bring
forth children'), she shall be saved." Moreover, I think it is implied
indirectly that the very curse will be turned into a condition favorable
to her salvation, by her faithfully performing her part in doing and
suffering what God has assigned to her, namely, child-bearing and home
duties, her sphere, as distinguished from public teaching, which is not
hers, but man's ([Ti1 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)). In
this home sphere, not ordinarily in one of active duty for advancing the
kingdom of God, which contradicts the position assigned to her by God,
she will be saved on the same terms as all others, namely, by living
faith. Some think that there is a reference to the Incarnation "through
THE child-bearing" (Greek), the bearing of the child Jesus. Doubtless
this is the ground of women's child-bearing in general becoming to them
a blessing, instead of a curse; just as in the original prophecy ([Gen
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)) the promise of "the Seed of
the woman" (the Saviour) stands in closest connection with the woman's
being doomed to "sorrow" in "bringing forth children," her very
child-bearing, though in sorrow, being the function assigned to her by
God whereby the Saviour was born. This may be an ulterior reference of
the Holy Spirit in this verse; but the primary reference required by the
context is the one above given. "She shall be saved (\[though\] with
childbearing)," that is, though suffering her part of the primeval curse
in childbearing; just as a man shall be saved, though having to bear his
part, namely, the sweat of the brow.

if they, &c.--"if the women (plural, taken out of 'the woman,' [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014), which is put for the whole sex)
continue," or more literally, "shall (be found at the judgment to) have
continued."

faith and charity--the essential way to salvation ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)). Faith is in relation to God.
Charity, to our fellow man. Sobriety, to one's self.

sobriety--"sober-mindedness" (see on [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009), as contrasted with the unseemly
forwardness reproved in [Ti1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)).
Mental receptivity and activity in family life were recognized in
Christianity as the destiny of woman. One reason alleged here by Paul,
is the greater danger of self-deception in the weaker sex, and the
spread of errors arising from it, especially in a class of addresses in
which sober reflectiveness is least in exercise \[NEANDER\]. The case
([Act 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009)) was doubtless in private,
not in public.
