### [Genesis Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 32:1</span></span>

VISION OF ANGELS. ([Gen 32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001).md)

angels of God met him--It is not said whether this angelic manifestation
was made in a vision by day, or a dream by night. There is an evident
allusion, however, to the appearance upon the ladder (compare [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012).md), and this occurring to Jacob on
his return to Canaan, was an encouraging pledge of the continued
presence and protection of God ([Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md); [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014).md).

[Genesis 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 32:2</span></span>

Mahanaim--"two hosts," or "camps." The place was situated between mount
Gilead and the Jabbok, near the banks of that brook.

[Genesis 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 32:3</span></span>

MISSION TO ESAU. (Gen\_32:3-32)

Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau--that is, "had sent." It was a
prudent precaution to ascertain the present temper of Esau, as the road,
on approaching the eastern confines of Canaan, lay near the wild
district where his brother was now established.

land of Seir--a highland country on the east and south of the Dead Sea,
inhabited by the Horites, who were dispossessed by Esau or his posterity
([Deu 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012).md). When and in what
circumstances he had emigrated thither, whether the separation arose out
of the undutiful conduct and idolatrous habits of his wives, which had
made them unwelcome in the tent of his parents, or whether his roving
disposition had sought a country from his love of adventure and the
chase, he was living in a state of power and affluence, and this
settlement on the outer borders of Canaan, though made of his own free
will, was overruled by Providence to pave the way for Jacob's return to
the promised land.

[Genesis 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 32:4</span></span>

Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau--The purport of the message was
that, after a residence of twenty years in Mesopotamia, he was now
returning to his native land, that he did not need any thing, for he had
abundance of pastoral wealth, but that he could not pass without
notifying his arrival to his brother and paying the homage of his
respectful obeisance. Acts of civility tend to disarm opposition and
soften hatred ([Ecc 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004).md).

Thy servant Jacob--He had been made lord over his brethren (compare [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029).md). But it is probable he thought
this referred to a spiritual superiority; or if to temporal, that it was
to be realized only to his posterity. At all events, leaving it to God
to fulfil that purpose, he deemed it prudent to assume the most kind and
respectful bearing.

[Genesis 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 32:6</span></span>

The messengers returned to Jacob--Their report left Jacob in painful
uncertainty as to what was his brother's views and feelings. Esau's
studied reserve gave him reason to dread the worst. Jacob was naturally
timid; but his conscience told him that there was much ground for
apprehension, and his distress was all the more aggravated that he had
to provide for the safety of a large and helpless family.

[Genesis 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 32:9</span></span>

Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham--In this great emergency, he had
recourse to prayer. This is the first recorded example of prayer in the
Bible. It is short, earnest, and bearing directly on the occasion. The
appeal is made to God, as standing in a covenant relation to his family,
just as we ought to put our hopes of acceptance with God in Christ. It
pleads the special promise made to him of a safe return; and after a
most humble and affecting confession of unworthiness, it breathes an
earnest desire for deliverance from the impending danger. It was the
prayer of a kind husband, an affectionate father, a firm believer in the
promises.

[Genesis 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 32:13</span></span>

took . . . a present for Esau--Jacob combined active exertions with
earnest prayer; and this teaches us that we must not depend upon the aid
and interposition of God in such a way as to supersede the exercise of
prudence and foresight. Superiors are always approached with presents,
and the respect expressed is estimated by the quality and amount of the
gift. The present of Jacob consisted of five hundred fifty head of
cattle, of different kinds, such as would be most prized by Esau. It was
a most magnificent present, skilfully arranged and proportioned. The
milch camels alone were of immense value; for the she camels form the
principal part of Arab wealth; their milk is a chief article of diet;
and in many other respects they are of the greatest use.

[Genesis 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 32:16</span></span>

every drove by themselves--There was great prudence in this arrangement;
for the present would thus have a more imposing appearance; Esau's
passion would have time to cool as he passed each successive company;
and if the first was refused, the others would hasten back to convey a
timely warning.

[Genesis 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 32:17</span></span>

he commanded the foremost--The messengers were strictly commanded to say
the same words \[[Gen 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#018.md), [Gen
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020.md)\], that Esau might be more
impressed and that the uniformity of the address might appear more
clearly to have come from Jacob himself.

[Genesis 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 32:21</span></span>

himself lodged--not the whole night, but only a part of it.

[Genesis 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 32:22</span></span>

ford Jabbok--now the Zerka--a stream that rises among the mountains of
Gilead, and running from east to west, enters the Jordan, about forty
miles south of the Sea of Tiberias. At the ford it is ten yards wide. It
is sometimes forded with difficulty; but in summer it is very shallow.

he rose up and took--Unable to sleep, Jacob waded the ford in the night
time by himself; and having ascertained its safety, he returned to the
north bank and sent over his family and attendants, remaining behind, to
seek anew, in silent prayer, the divine blessing on the means he had set
in motion.

[Genesis 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 32:24</span></span>

There wrestled a man with him--This mysterious person is called an angel
([Hos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004).md) and God ([Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md), [Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030.md); [Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005).md); and the opinion that is most
supported is that he was "the angel of the covenant," who, in a visible
form, appeared to animate the mind and sympathize with the distress of
his pious servant. It has been a subject of much discussion whether the
incident described was an actual conflict or a visionary scene. Many
think that as the narrative makes no mention in express terms either of
sleep, or dream, or vision, it was a real transaction; while others,
considering the bodily exhaustion of Jacob, his great mental anxiety,
the kind of aid he supplicated, as well as the analogy of former
manifestations with which he was favored--such as the ladder--have
concluded that it was a vision \[CALVIN, HESSENBERG, HENGSTENBERG\]. The
moral design of it was to revive the sinking spirit of the patriarch and
to arm him with confidence in God, while anticipating the dreaded scenes
of the morrow. To us it is highly instructive; showing that, to
encourage us valiantly to meet the trials to which we are subjected, God
allows us to ascribe to the efficacy of our faith and prayers, the
victories which His grace alone enables us to make.

[Genesis 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 32:26</span></span>

I will not let thee go, except thou bless me--It is evident that Jacob
was aware of the character of Him with whom he wrestled; and, believing
that His power, though by far superior to human, was yet limited by His
promise to do him good, he determined not to lose the golden opportunity
of securing a blessing. And nothing gives God greater pleasure than to
see the hearts of His people firmly adhering to Him.

[Genesis 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 32:28</span></span>

Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel--The old name was not
to be abandoned; but, referring as it did to a dishonorable part of the
patriarch's history, it was to be associated with another descriptive of
his now sanctified and eminently devout character.

[Genesis 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 32:29</span></span>

Jacob asked, Tell me . . . thy name--The request was denied that he
might not be too elated with his conquest nor suppose that he had
obtained such advantage over the angel as to make him do what he
pleased.

[Genesis 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 32:31</span></span>

halted upon his thigh--As Paul had a thorn in the flesh given to humble
him, lest he should be too elevated by the abundant revelations granted
him \[[Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md)\], so Jacob's lameness
was to keep him mindful of this mysterious scene, and that it was in
gracious condescension the victory was yielded to him. In the greatest
of these spiritual victories which, through faith, any of God's people
obtain, there is always something to humble them.

[Genesis 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 32:32</span></span>

the sinew which shrank--the nerve that fastens the thigh bone in its
socket. The practice of the Jews in abstaining from eating this in the
flesh of animals, is not founded on the law of Moses, but is merely a
traditional usage. The sinew is carefully extracted; and where there are
no persons skilled enough for that operation, they do not make use of
the hind legs at all.
