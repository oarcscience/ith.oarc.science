### [Hebrews Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)

[Hebrews 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 12:1</span></span>

EXHORTATION TO FOLLOW THE WITNESSES OF FAITH JUST MENTIONED: NOT TO
FAINT IN TRIALS: TO REMOVE ALL BITTER ROOTS OF SIN: FOR WE ARE UNDER,
NOT A LAW OF TERROR, BUT THE GOSPEL OF GRACE, TO DESPISE WHICH WILL
BRING THE HEAVIER PENALTIES, IN PROPORTION TO OUR GREATER PRIVILEGES.
(Heb. 12:1-29)

we also--as well as those recounted in [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011).

are compassed about--Greek, "have so great a cloud (a numberless
multitude above us, like a cloud, 'holy and pellucid,' \[CLEMENT OF
ALEXANDRIA\]) of witnesses surrounding us." The image is from a "race,"
an image common even in Palestine from the time of the Greco-Macedonian
empire, which introduced such Greek usages as national games. The
"witnesses" answer to the spectators pressing round to see the
competitors in their contest for the prize ([Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014)). Those "witnessed of" (Greek,
[Heb 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005), [Heb
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039)) become in their turn
"witnesses" in a twofold way: (1) attesting by their own case the
faithfulness of God to His people \[ALFORD\] ([Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012)), some of them martyrs in the
modern sense; (2) witnessing our struggle of faith; however, this second
sense of "witnesses," though agreeing with the image here if it is to be
pressed, is not positively, unequivocally, and directly sustained by
Scripture. It gives vividness to the image; as the crowd of spectators
gave additional spirit to the combatants, so the cloud of witnesses who
have themselves been in the same contest, ought to increase our
earnestness, testifying, as they do, to God's faithfulness.

weight--As corporeal unwieldiness was, through a disciplinary diet, laid
aside by candidates for the prize in racing; so carnal and worldly
lusts, and all, whether from without or within, that would impede the
heavenly runner, are the spiritual weight to be laid aside.
"Encumbrance," all superfluous weight; the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, and the pride of life, and even harmless and otherwise
useful things which would positively retard us ([Mar
10:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#050), the blind man casting away his
garment to come to Jesus; [Mar
9:42-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042); compare [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022); [Col
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009)).

the sin which doth so easily beset us--Greek, "sin which easily stands
around us"; so LUTHER, "which always so clings to us": "sinful
propensity always surrounding us, ever present and ready" \[WAHL\]. It
is not primarily "the sin," &c., but sin in general, with, however,
special reference to "apostasy," against which he had already warned
them, as one to which they might gradually be seduced; the besetting sin
of the Hebrews, UNBELIEF.

with patience--Greek, "in persevering endurance" ([Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036)). On "run" compare [Co1
9:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024).

[Hebrews 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 12:2</span></span>

Looking unto--literally, "Looking from afar" (see on [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026)); fixing the eyes upon Jesus
seated on the throne of God.

author--"Prince-leader." The same Greek is translated, "Captain (of
salvation)," [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); "Prince (of
life)," [Act 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015). Going before us as
the Originator of our faith, and the Leader whose matchless example we
are to follow always. In this He is distinguished from all those
examples of faith in Heb. 11:2-40. (Compare [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001)). On His "faith" compare [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013); [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012). Believers have ever looked to
Him ([Heb 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026); [Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008)).

finisher--Greek, "Perfecter," referring to [Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040).

of our faith--rather as Greek, "of the faith," including both His faith
(as exhibited in what follows) and our faith. He fulfilled the ideal of
faith Himself, and so, both as a vicarious offering and an example, He
is the object of our faith.

for the joy . . . set before him--namely, of presently after sitting
down at the right hand of the throne of God; including besides His own
personal joy, the joy of sitting there as a Prince and Saviour, to give
repentance and remission of sins. The coming joy disarmed of its sting
the present pain.

cross . . . shame--the great stumbling-block to the Hebrews. "Despised,"
that is, disregarded.

[Hebrews 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 12:3</span></span>

For--justifying his exhortation, "Looking unto Jesus."

consider--by way of comparison with yourselves, so the Greek.

contradiction--unbelief, and every kind of opposition ([Act
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#019)).

sinners--Sin assails us. Not sin, but sinners, contradicted Christ
\[BENGEL\].

be wearied and faint--Greek, "lest ye weary fainting." Compare [Isa
49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004), as a specimen of Jesus not
being wearied out by the contradiction and strange unbelief of those
among whom He labored, preaching as never man did, and exhibiting
miracles wrought by His inherent power, as none else could do.

[Hebrews 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 12:4</span></span>

not yet resisted unto blood--image from pugilism, as he previously had
the image of a race, both being taken from the great national Greek
games. Ye have suffered the loss of goods, and been a gazing-stock by
reproaches and afflictions; ye have not shed your blood (see on [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)). "The athlete who hath seen his
own blood, and who, though cast down by his opponent, does not let his
spirits be cast down, who as often as he hath fallen hath risen the more
determined, goes down to the encounter with great hope" \[SENECA\].

against sin--Sin is personified as an adversary; sin, whether within
you, leading you to spare your blood, or in our adversaries, leading
them to shed it, if they cannot through your faithfulness even unto
blood, induce you to apostatize.

[Hebrews 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 12:5</span></span>

forgotten--"utterly," so the Greek. Compare [Heb
12:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015), in which he implies how
utterly some of them had forgotten God's word. His exhortation ought to
have more effect on you than the cheers and exhortations of the
spectators have on the competitors striving in the games.

which--Greek, "the which," of which the following is a specimen
\[ALFORD\].

speaketh unto you--as in a dialogue or discourse, so the Greek, implying
God's loving condescension (compare [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018)).

despise not--literally, "Do not hold of little account." Betraying a
contumacious spirit of unbelief ([Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012)), as "faint" implies a
broken-down, weak, and desponding spirit. "Chastening" is to be borne
with "subjection" ([Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009));
"rebuke" (more severe than chastening) is to be borne with endurance
([Heb 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007)). "Some in adversity kick
against God's will, others despond; neither is to be done by the
Christian, who is peculiarly the child of God. To him such adverse
things occur only by the decree of God, and that designed in kindness,
namely, to remove the defilements adhering to the believer, and to
exercise his patience" \[GROTIUS\].

[Hebrews 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 12:6</span></span>

([Rev 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019).)

and--Greek, "yea and," "and moreover"; bringing out an additional
circumstance.

scourgeth--which draws forth "blood" ([Heb
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004)).

receiveth--accepts. Takes to Himself as a son "in whom He delighteth"
([Pro 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012)).

[Hebrews 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 12:7</span></span>

In [Heb 12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007) the need of
"chastening" or "discipline" is inculcated; in [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009), the duty of those to whom it is
administered.

If--The oldest manuscripts read, "With a view to chastening (that is,
since God's chastisement is with a view to your chastening, that is,
disciplinary amelioration) endure patiently"; so Vulgate. ALFORD
translates it as indicative, not so well, "It is for chastisement that
ye are enduring."

dealeth with you--"beareth Himself toward you" in the very act of
chastening.

what son is he--"What son is there" even in ordinary life? Much more God
as to His sons ([Isa 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010); [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)). The most eminent of God's
saints were the most afflicted. God leads them by a way they know not
([Isa 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016)). We too much look at each
trial by itself, instead of taking it in connection with the whole plan
of our salvation, as if a traveller were to complain of the steepness
and roughness of one turn in the path, without considering that it led
him into green pastures, on the direct road to the city of habitation.
The New Testament alone uses the Greek term for education (paideia), to
express "discipline" or correction, as of a child by a wise father.

[Hebrews 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 12:8</span></span>

if ye be without--excluded from participation in chastisement, and
wishing to be so.

all--all sons: all the worthies enumerated in the eleventh chapter: all
the witnesses ([Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)).

are--Greek, "have been made."

then are ye bastards--of whom their fathers take no care whether they
are educated or not; whereas every right-minded father is concerned for
the moral well-being of his legitimate son. "Since then not to be
chastised is a mark of bastardy, we ought \[not to refuse, but\] rejoice
in chastisement, as a mark of our genuine sonship" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Hebrews 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 12:9</span></span>

fathers . . . which corrected us--rather as Greek, "We had the fathers
of our flesh as correctors."

subjection--See the punishment of insubordination, [Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018).

Father of spirits--contrasted with "the fathers of our flesh."
"Generation by men is carnal, by God is spiritual" \[BENGEL\]. As
"Father of spirits," He is both the Originator, and the Providential and
Gracious Sustainer, at once of animal and spiritual life. Compare "and
LIVE," namely, spiritually; also [Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010), "that we might be partakers of
His holiness" ([Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004)). God is a
spirit Himself, and the Creator of spirits like Himself, in contrast to
men who are flesh, and the progenitors of flesh ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)). Jesus our pattern "learned
obedience" experimentally by suffering ([Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008)).

and live--and so, thereby live spiritually and eternally.

[Hebrews 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 12:10</span></span>

Showing wherein the chastisement of our heavenly Father is preferable to
that of earthly fathers.

for a few days--that is, with a view to our well-being in the few days
of our earthly life: so the Greek.

after their own pleasure--Greek, "according to what seemed fit to
themselves." Their rule of chastening is what may seem fit to their own
often erring judgment, temper, or caprice. The two defects of human
education are: (1) the prevalence in it of a view to the interests of
our short earthly term of days; (2) the absence in parents of the
unerring wisdom of our heavenly Father. "They err much at one time in
severity, at another in indulgence \[[Sa1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013); [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)\], and do not so much chasten as
THINK they chasten" \[BENGEL\].

that we might be partakers of his holiness--becoming holy as He is holy
([Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)). To become holy like God
is tantamount to being educated for passing eternity with God ([Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014); [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004)). So this "partaking of God's
holiness" stands in contrast to the "few days" of this life, with a view
to which earthly fathers generally educate their sons.

[Hebrews 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 12:11</span></span>

joyous . . . grievous--Greek, "matter of joy . . . matter of grief." The
objection that chastening is grievous is here anticipated and answered.
It only seems so to those being chastened, whose judgments are confused
by the present pain. Its ultimate fruit amply compensates for any
temporary pam. The real object of the fathers in chastening is not that
they find pleasure in the children's pain. Gratified wishes, our Father
knows, would often be our real curses.

fruit of righteousness--righteousness (in practice, springing from
faith) is the fruit which chastening, the tree yields ([Phi
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011)). "Peaceable" (compare [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017)): in contrast to the ordeal of
conflict by which it has been won. "Fruit of righteousness to be enjoyed
in peace after the conflict" \[THOLUCK\]. As the olive garland, the
emblem of peace as well as victory, was put on the victor's brow in the
games.

exercised thereby--as athletes exercised in training for a contest.
Chastisement is the exercise to give experience, and make the spiritual
combatant irresistibly victorious ([Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)). "Oh, happy the servant for whose
improvement his Lord is earnest, with whom he deigns to be angry, whom
He does not deceive by dissembling admonition" (withholding admonition,
and so leading the man to think he needs it not)! \[TERTULLIAN,
Patience, 11\]. Observe the "afterwards"; that is the time often when
God works.

[Hebrews 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 12:12</span></span>

He addresses them as runners in a race, and pugilists, and warriors
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]. The "wherefore" is resumed from [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).

lift up--In [Isa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003), from which Paul
here quotes, it is, "Strengthen ye the weak hands." The hand is the
symbol of one's strength. ALFORD translates, "Put straight again the
relaxed hands." English Version expresses the sense well.

feeble--literally, "paralyzed"; a word used only by Luke, Paul's
companion, in the New Testament. The exhortation has three parts: the
first relates to ourselves, [Heb
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012); the second, to others, [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014), "peace with all men"; the
third, to God, "holiness, without which," &c. The first is referred to
in [Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015), "test any man fail of
the grace of God"; the second in the words, "lest any root of
bitterness," &c.; the third in [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016), "Lest there be any fornicator
or profane person," &c. This threefold relation often occurs in Paul's
Epistles. Compare Note, see on [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012), "soberly, righteously, and
godly." The Greek active verb, not the middle or reflexive, requires the
sense to be, Lift up not only your own hands and knees, but also those
of your brethren (compare [Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015);
[Isa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004)).

[Hebrews 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 12:13</span></span>

Quoted from [Pro 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026), Septuagint,
"Make straight paths for thy feet."

straight--that is, leading by a straight road to joy and grace ([Heb
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001), [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)). Cease to "halt" between
Judaism and Christianity \[BENGEL\].

paths--literally, "wheel tracks." Let your walk be so firm and so
unanimous in the right direction that a plain track and "highway" may be
thereby established for those who accompany and follow you, to perceive
and walk in ([Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008)) \[ALFORD\].

that which is lame--those "weak in the faith" ([Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001)), having still Judaizing
prejudices.

be turned out of the way-- ([Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027)); and, so missing the way, lose
the prize of "the race" ([Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)).

rather he healed--Proper exercise of itself contributes to health; the
habit of walking straight onward in the right way tends to healing.

[Hebrews 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 12:14</span></span>

follow peace with all men--with the brethren especially ([Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019)), that so the "lame" among them
be not "turned out of the way" ([Heb
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013)), and that no one of them "fail
of the grace of God" ([Heb 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)).

holiness--a distinct Greek word from God's "holiness" ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)). Translate here
"sanctification." His is absolute holiness: our part is to put on His
holiness, becoming "holy as He is holy," by sanctification. While
"following peace with all men," we are not so to seek to please them, as
to make God's will and our sanctification a secondary object; this
latter must be our first aim. ([Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)).

without which--Greek, "apart from which."

no man shall see the Lord--no man as a son; in heavenly glory ([Rev
22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003)). In the East, none but the
greatest favorites are admitted to the honor of seeing the king (compare
[Sa2 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#024)). The Lord being pure and
holy, none but the pure and holy shall see Him ([Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008)). Without holiness in them, they
could not enjoy Him who is holiness itself ([Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020)). The connection of purity with
seeing the Lord, appears in [Jo1
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002); [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005). Contrast [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016) (compare [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003)). In [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030); [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007), it is said that all shall see the
Lord; but, that shall be as a Judge, not as their lasting portion and
God, which is meant here. The Greek verb does not denote the mere action
of seeing, but the seer's state of mind to which the object is
presented: so in [Mat 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008) they shall
truly comprehend God \[TITTMANN\]. None but the holy could appreciate
the holy God, none else therefore shall abide in His presence. "The bad
shall only see Him in His form as Son of man \[compare [Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013), with [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007); and [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030); [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031)\]; still it will be in the glory
in which He shall judge, not in the lowliness in which He was judged.
His form as God, wherein He is equal to the Father, without doubt the
ungodly shall not see; for it is only 'the pure in heart who shall see
God'" \[AUGUSTINE\]. "He shall come to judge, who stood before a judge.
He shall come in the form in which He was judged, that they may see Him
whom they pierced: He who was before hidden shall come manifested in
power: He, as Judge, shall condemn the real culprits, who was Himself
falsely made a culprit."

[Hebrews 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 12:15</span></span>

lest any . . . fall--Greek, "lest any (namely, through sloth in running)
failing," or "falling short of the grace of God . . . trouble you." The
image is taken from a company of travellers, one of whom lags behind,
and so never reaches the end of the long and laborious journey
\[CHRYSOSTOM\].

root of bitterness--not merely a "bitter root," which might possibly
bring forth sweet fruits; this, a root whose essence is "bitterness,"
never could. Paul here refers to [Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018), "Lest there should be among you
a root that beareth gall and wormwood" (compare [Act
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023)). Root of bitterness comprehends
every person (compare [Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016)) and
every principle of doctrine or practice so radically corrupt as to
spread corruption all around. The only safety is in rooting out such a
root of bitterness.

many--rather, "the many," that is, the whole congregation. So long as it
is hidden under the earth it cannot be remedied, but when it "springs
up," it must be dealt with boldly. Still remember the caution ([Mat
13:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#026)) as to rooting out persons.
No such danger can arise in rooting out bad principles.

[Hebrews 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 12:16</span></span>

fornicator-- ([Heb 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004); [Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008)).

or profane--Fornication is nearly akin to gluttony, Esau's sin. He
profanely cast away his spiritual privilege for the gratification of his
palate. [Gen 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#034) graphically
portrays him. An example well fitted to strike needful horror into the
Hebrews, whosoever of them, like Esau, were only sons of Isaac according
to the flesh \[BENGEL\].

for one morsel--The smallness of the inducement only aggravates the
guilt of casting away eternity for such a trifle, so far is it from
being a claim for mercy (compare [Gen
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006)). One single act has often the
greatest power either for good or for evil. So in the cases of Reuben
and Saul, for evil ([Gen 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004); [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001); [Sa1
13:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012)); and, on the other hand, for
good, Abraham and Phinehas ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001),
&c.; [Gen 15:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005); [Num
25:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006)).

his birthright--Greek, "his own (so the oldest manuscripts read,
intensifying the suicidal folly and sin of the act) rights of
primogeniture," involving the high spiritual privilege of being ancestor
of the promised seed, and heir of the promises in Him. The Hebrews whom
Paul addressed, had, as Christians, the spiritual rights of
primogeniture (compare [Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)): he
intimates that they must exercise holy self-control, if they wish not,
like Esau, to forfeit them.

[Hebrews 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 12:17</span></span>

afterwards--Greek, "even afterward." He despised his birthright,
accordingly also he was despised and rejected when he wished to have the
blessing. As in the believer's case, so in the unbeliever's, there is an
"afterwards" coming, when the believer shall look on his past griefs,
and the unbeliever on his past joys, in a very different light from that
in which they were respectively viewed at the time. Compare
"Nevertheless afterward," &c. [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011), with the "afterward" here.

when he would--when he wished to have. "He that will not when he may,
when he will, shall have nay" ([Pro
1:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024); [Luk
13:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034); [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042)).

he was rejected--not as to every blessing, but only that which would
have followed the primogeniture.

he found no place of repentance--The cause is here put for the effect,
"repentance" for the object which Esau aimed at in his so-called
repentance, namely, the change of his father's determination to give the
chief blessing to Jacob. Had he sought real repentance with tears he
would have found it ([Mat 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007)). But he
did not find it because this was not what he sought. What proves his
tears were not those of one seeking true repentance is, immediately
after he was foiled in his desire, he resolved to murder Jacob! He shed
tears, not for his sin, but for his suffering the penalty of his sin.
His were tears of vain regret and remorse, not of repentance. "Before,
he might have had the blessing without tears; afterwards, no matter how
many tears he shed, he was rejected. Let us use the time" ([Luk
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#027))! \[BENGEL\]. ALFORD explains
"repentance" here, a chance, by repenting, to repair (that is, to regain
the lost blessing). I agree with him that the translation, instead of
"repentance," "no place for changing HIS FATHER'S mind," is forced;
though doubtless this is what was the true aim of the "repentance" which
he sought. The language is framed to apply to profane despisers who
wilfully cast away grace and seek repentance (that is, not real; but
escape from the penalty of their sin), but in vain. Compare "afterward,"
[Mat 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#011). Tears are no proof of
real repentance ([Sa1 24:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016);
contrast [Psa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008)).

it--the blessing, which was the real object of Esau, though ostensibly
seeking "repentance."

[Hebrews 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 12:18</span></span>

For--The fact that we are not under the law, but under a higher, and
that the last dispensation, the Gospel, with its glorious privileges, is
the reason why especially the Hebrew Christians should "look
diligently," &c. ([Heb 12:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)).

are not come--Greek, "have not come near to." Alluding to [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011), "Ye came near and stood under
the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire . . . with darkness,
clouds, and thick darkness." "In your coming near unto God, it has not
been to," &c.

the mount--The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate omit "the mount." But
still, "the mount" must be supplied from [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).

that might be touched--palpable and material. Not that any save Moses
was allowed to touch it ([Exo
19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012)). The Hebrews drew near to
the material Mount Sinai with material bodies; we, to the spiritual
mount in the spirit. The "darkness" was that formed by the clouds
hanging round the mount; the "tempest" accompanied the thunder.

[Hebrews 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019)

trumpet--to rouse attention, and herald God's approach ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016)).

entreated that the word should not be spoken--literally, "that speech
should not be added to them"; not that they refused to hear the word of
God, but they wished that God should not Himself speak, but employ Moses
as His mediating spokesman. "The voice of words" was the Decalogue,
spoken by God Himself, a voice issuing forth, without any form being
seen: after which "He added no more" ([Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022)).

that which was commanded--"the interdict" \[TITTMANN\]. A stern
interdictory mandate is meant.

And--rather, "Even if a beast (much more a man) touch," &c.

or thrust through with a dart--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The
full interdict in [Exo 19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012) is
abbreviated here; the beast alone, being put for "whether man or beast";
the stoning, which applies to the human offender, alone being specified,
the beast's punishment, namely, the being thrust through with a dart,
being left to be understood.

the sight--the vision of God's majesty.

quake--Greek, "I am in trembling"; "fear" affected his mind:
"trembling," his body. Moses is not recorded in Exodus to have used
these words. But Paul, by inspiration, supplies (compare [Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)) this detail. We read in [Deu
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#019), Septuagint, of similar words
used by Moses after breaking the two tables, through fear of God's anger
at the people's sin in making the golden calves. He doubtless similarly
"feared" in hearing the ten commandments spoken by the voice of Jehovah.

[Hebrews 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 12:22</span></span>

are come--Greek, "have come near unto" (compare [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011)). Not merely, ye shall come, but,
ye have already come.

Mount Sion--antitypical Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which the
spiritual invisible Church (of which the first foundation was laid in
literal Zion, [Joh 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#015); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006)) is now the earnest; and of which
the restored literal Jerusalem hereafter shall be the earthly
representative, to be succeeded by the everlasting and "new Jerusalem,
coming down from God out of heaven" (Rev. 21:2-27; compare [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010)).

to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and
church--The city of God having been mentioned, the mention of its
citizens follows. Believers being like the angels ([Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)), "sons of God," are so their
"equals" ([Luk 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036)); and being
reconciled through Christ, are adopted into God's great and blessed
family. For the full completion of this we pray ([Mat
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#010)). English Version arrangement is
opposed: (1) by "and" always beginning each new member of the whole
sentence; (2) "general assembly and Church," form a kind of tautology;
(3) "general assembly," or rather, "festal full assembly," "the jubilant
full company" (such as were the Olympic games, celebrated with joyous
singing, dancing, &c.), applies better to the angels above, ever hymning
God's praises, than to the Church, of which a considerable part is now
militant on earth. Translate therefore, "to myriads (ten thousands,
compare [Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014); namely), the full festal
assembly of angels, and the Church of the first-born." Angels and saints
together constitute the ten thousands. Compare "all angels, all nations"
[Mat 25:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031). Messiah is
pre-eminently "the First-born," or "First-begotten" ([Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006)), and all believers become so by
adoption. Compare the type, [Num 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012),
[Num 3:45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#045), [Num
3:50](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#050); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018). As the kingly and priestly
succession was in the first-born, and as Israel was God's "first-born"
([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022); compare [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002)), and a "kingdom of priests" to
God ([Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)), so believers ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)).

[Hebrews 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 12:23</span></span>

written in heaven--enrolled as citizens there. All those who at the
coming of "God the Judge of all" (which clause therefore naturally
follows), shall be found "written in heaven," that is, in the Lamb's
book of life ([Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)). Though
still fighting the good fight on earth, still, in respect to your
destiny, and present life of faith which substantiates things hoped for,
ye are already members of the heavenly citizenship. "We are one
citizenship with angels; to which it is said in the psalm, Glorious
things are spoken of thee, thou city of God" \[AUGUSTINE\]. I think
ALFORD wrong in restricting "the Church of the first-born written in
heaven," to those militant on earth; it is rather, all those who at the
Judge's coming shall be found written in heaven (the true patent of
heavenly nobility; contrast "written in the earth," [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013), and Esau's profane sale of his
birthright, [Heb 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016)); these all,
from the beginning to the end of the world, forming one Church to which
every believer is already come. The first-born of Israel were "written"
in a roll ([Num 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040)).

the spirits of just men made perfect--at the resurrection, when the
"JUDGE" shall appear, and believers' bliss shall be consummated by the
union of the glorified body with the spirit; the great hope of the New
Testament ([Rom 8:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)). The place of this clause after
"the JUDGE OF ALL," is my objection to BENGEL and ALFORD'S explanation,
the souls of the just in their separate state perfected. Compare Notes,
see on [Heb 11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039), to which he
refers here, and which I think confirms my view; those heretofore
spirits, but now to be perfected by being clothed upon with the body.
Still the phrase, "spirits of just men made perfect," not merely "just
men made perfect," may favor the reference to the happy spirits in their
separate state. The Greek is not "the perfected spirits," but "the
spirits of the perfected just." In no other passage are the just said to
be perfected before the resurrection, and the completion of the full
number of the elect ([Rev 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011)); I
think, therefore, "spirits of the just," may here be used to express the
just whose predominant element in their perfected state shall be spirit.
So spirit and spirits are used of a man or men in the body, under the
influence of the spirit, the opposite of flesh ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)). The resurrection bodies of the
saints shall be bodies in which the spirit shall altogether preponderate
over the animal soul (see on [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)).

[Hebrews 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 12:24</span></span>

new--not the usual term (kaine) applied to the Christian covenant ([Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015)), which would mean new as
different from, and superseding the old; but Greek, "nea," "recent,"
"lately established," having the "freshness of youth," as opposed to
age. The mention of Jesus, the Perfecter of our faith ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)), and Himself perfected through
sufferings and death, in His resurrection and ascension ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Heb
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009)), is naturally suggested by the
mention of "the just made perfect" at their resurrection (compare [Heb
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022)). Paul uses "Jesus," dwelling
here on Him as the Person realized as our loving friend, not merely in
His official character as the Christ.

and to the blood of sprinkling--here enumerated as distinct from
"Jesus." BENGEL reasonably argues as follows: His blood was entirely
"poured out" of His body by the various ways in which it was shed, His
bloody sweat, the crown of thorns, the scourging, the nails, and after
death the spear, just as the blood was entirely poured out and
extravasated from the animal sacrifices of the law. It was incorruptible
([Pe1 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018)). No Scripture states it
was again put into the Lord's body. At His ascension, as our great High
Priest, He entered the heavenly holiest place "BY His own blood" (not
after shedding His blood, nor with the blood in His body, but), carrying
it separately from his body (compare the type, [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007), [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012), [Heb
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025); [Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011)). Paul does not say, by the
efficacy of His blood, but, "by His own proper blood" ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)); not MATERIAL blood, but "the
blood of Him who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without
spot unto God" ([Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)). So in [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029), the Son of God and the blood of
the covenant wherewith he (the professor) was sanctified, are mentioned
separately. Also in [Heb 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012), [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020); also compare [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019), with [Heb
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021). So in the Lord's Supper ([Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016); [Co1
11:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024)), the body and blood are
separately represented. The blood itself, therefore, continues still in
heaven before God, the perpetual ransom price of "the eternal covenant"
([Heb 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020)). Once for all Christ
sprinkled the blood peculiarly for us at His ascension ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)). But it is called "the blood of
sprinkling," on account also of its continued use in heaven, and in the
consciences of the saints on earth ([Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015)). This sprinkling is analogous
to the sprinkled blood of the Passover. Compare [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006), "In the midst of the throne, a
Lamb as it had been slain." His glorified body does not require meat,
nor the circulation of the blood. His blood introduced into heaven took
away the dragon's right to accuse. Thus Rome's theory of concomitancy of
the blood with the body, the excuse for giving only the bread to the
laity, falls to the ground. The mention of "the blood of sprinkling"
naturally follows the mention of the "covenant," which could not be
consecrated without blood ([Heb 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018),
[Heb 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)).

speaketh better things than that of Abel--namely, than the sprinkling
(the best manuscripts read the article masculine, which refers to
"sprinkling," not to "blood," which last is neuter) of blood by Abel in
his sacrifice spake. This comparison between two things of the same kind
(namely, Christ's sacrifice, and Abel's sacrifice) is more natural, than
between two things different in kind and in results (namely, Christ's
sacrifice, and Abel's own blood \[ALFORD\], which was not a sacrifice at
all); compare [Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004); [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004). This accords with the whole tenor
of the Epistle, and of this passage in particular ([Heb
12:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018)), which is to show the
superiority of Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant, to the Old
Testament sacrifices (of which Abel's is the first recorded; it,
moreover, was testified to by God as acceptable to Him above Cain's),
compare Heb. 9:1-10:39. The word "better" implies superiority to
something that is good: but Abel's own blood was not at all good for the
purpose for which Christ's blood was efficacious; nay, it cried for
vengeance. So ARCHBISHOP MAGEE, HAMMOND, and KNATCHBULL. BENGEL takes
"the blood of Abel" as put for all the blood shed on earth crying for
vengeance, and greatly increasing the other cries raised by sin in the
world; counteracted by the blood of Christ calmly speaking in heaven for
us, and from heaven to us. I prefer MAGEE'S view. Be this as it may, to
deny that Christ's atonement is truly a propitiation, overthrows
Christ's priesthood, makes the sacrifices of Moses' law an unmeaning
mummery, and represents Cain's sacrifice as good as that of Abel.

[Hebrews 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)

refuse not--through unbelief.

him that speaketh--God in Christ. As the blood of sprinkling is
represented as speaking to God for us, [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024); so here God is represented as
speaking to us ([Heb 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)). His word
now is the prelude of the last "shaking" of all things ([Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027)). The same word which is heard
in the Gospel from heaven, will shake heaven and earth ([Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026)).

who refused him--Greek, "refusing as they did." Their seemingly
submissive entreaty that the word should not be spoken to them by God
any more ([Heb 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019)), covered over
refractory hearts, as their subsequent deeds showed ([Heb
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016)).

that spake--revealing with oracular warnings His divine will: so the
Greek.

if we turn away--Greek, "we who turn away." The word implies greater
refractoriness than "refused," or "declined."

him that speaketh from heaven--God, by His Son in the Gospel, speaking
from His heavenly throne. Hence, in Christ's preaching frequent mention
is made of "the kingdom of the heavens" (Greek, [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)). In the giving of the law God
spake on earth (namely, Mount Sinai) by angels ([Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002); compare [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)). In [Exo
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022), when God says, "I talked with
you from heaven," this passage in Hebrews shows that not the highest
heavens, but the visible heavens, the clouds and darkness, are meant,
out of which God by angels proclaimed the law on Sinai.

[Hebrews 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 12:26</span></span>

then shook--when He gave the law on Sinai.

now--under the Gospel.

promised--The announcement of His coming to break up the present order
of things, is to the ungodly a terror, to the godly a promise, the
fulfilment of which they look for with joyful hope.

Yet once more--Compare Notes, see on [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006); [Hag
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021), both of which passages are
condensed into one here. The shaking began at the first coming of
Messiah; it will be completed at His second coming, prodigies in the
world of nature accompanying the overthrow of all kingdoms that oppose
Messiah. The Hebrew is literally, "it is yet one little," that is, a
single brief space till the series of movements begins ending in the
advent of Messiah. Not merely the earth, as at the establishment of the
Sinaitic covenant, but heaven also is to be shaken. The two advents of
Messiah are regarded as one, the complete shaking belonging to the
second advent, of which the presage was given in the shakings at the
first advent: the convulsions connected with the overthrow of Jerusalem
shadowing forth those about to be at the overthrow of all the
God-opposed kingdoms by the coming Messiah.

[Hebrews 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 12:27</span></span>

this word, Yet once more--So Paul, by the Spirit, sanctions the
Septuagint rendering of [Hag 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006),
giving an additional feature to the prophecy in the Hebrew, as rendered
in English Version, not merely that it shall be in a little while, but
that it is to be "once more" as the final act. The stress of his
argument is on the "ONCE." Once for all; once and for ever. "In saying
'once more,' the Spirit implies that something has already passed, and
something else shall be which is to remain, and is no more to be changed
to something else; for the once is exclusive, that is, not many times"
\[ESTIUS\].

those things that are shaken--the heaven and the earth. As the shaking
is to be total, so shall the removal be, making way for the better
things that are unremovable. Compare the Jewish economy (the type of the
whole present order of things) giving way to the new and abiding
covenant: the forerunner of the everlasting state of bliss.

as of things . . . made--namely, of this present visible creation:
compare [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001); [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011), "made with hands . . . of this
creation," that is, things so made at creation that they would not
remain of themselves, but be removed. The new abiding heaven and earth
are also made by God, but they are of a higher nature than the material
creation, being made to partake of the divine nature of Him who is not
made: so in this relation, as one with the uncreated God, they are
regarded as not of the same class as the things made. The things made in
the former sense do not remain; the things of the new heaven and earth,
like the uncreated God, "shall REMAIN before God" ([Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022)). The Spirit, the seed of the
new and heavenly being, not only of the believer's soul, but also of the
future body, is an uncreated and immortal principle.

receiving--as we do, in prospect and sure hope, also in the possession
of the Spirit the first-fruits. This is our privilege as Christians.

let us have grace--"let us have thankfulness" \[ALFORD after
CHRYSOSTOM\]. But (1) this translation is according to classical Greek,
not Paul's phraseology for "to be thankful." (2) "To God" would have
been in that case added. (3) "Whereby we may serve God," suits the
English Version "grace" (that is Gospel grace, the work of the Spirit,
producing faith exhibited in serving God), but does not suit
"thankfulness."

acceptably--Greek, "well-pleasingly."

reverence and godly fear--The oldest manuscripts read, "reverent caution
and fear." Reverent caution (same Greek as in [Heb

Greek, "For even": "for also"; introducing an additional solemn
incentive to diligence. Quoted from [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024).

10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027), [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031)).
