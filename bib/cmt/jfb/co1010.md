### [1 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 10:1</span></span>

DANGER OF FELLOWSHIP WITH IDOLATRY ILLUSTRATED IN THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL:
SUCH FELLOWSHIP INCOMPATIBLE WITH FELLOWSHIP IN THE LORD'S SUPPER. EVEN
LAWFUL THINGS ARE TO BE FORBORNE, SO AS NOT TO HURT WEAK BRETHREN. (1Co.
10:1-33)

Moreover--The oldest manuscripts read "for." Thus the connection with
the foregoing chapter is expressed. Ye need to exercise self-denying
watchfulness notwithstanding all your privileges, lest ye be castaways.
For the Israelites with all their privileges were most of them castaways
through want of it.

ignorant--with all your boasted "knowledge."

our fathers--The Jewish Church stands in the relation of parent to the
Christian Church.

all--Arrange as the Greek, "Our fathers were all under the cloud";
giving the "all" its proper emphasis. Not so much as one of so great a
multitude was detained by force or disease ([Psa
105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037).md) \[BENGEL\]. Five times the
"all" is repeated, in the enumeration of the five favors which God
bestowed on Israel ([Co1 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md). Five
times, correspondingly, they sinned ([Co1
10:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006).md). In contrast to the "all"
stands "many (rather, 'the most') of them" ([Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005).md). All of them had great
privileges, yet most of them were castaways through lust. Beware you,
having greater privileges, of sharing the same doom through a similar
sin. Continuing the reasoning ([Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024).md), "They which run in a race, run
all, but one receiveth the prize."

under the cloud--were continually under the defense of the pillar of
cloud, the symbol of the divine presence ([Exo
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md); [Psa
105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md); compare [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md).

passed through the sea--by God's miraculous interposition for them ([Exo
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#029).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 10:2</span></span>

And--"And so" \[BENGEL\].

baptized unto Moses--the servant of God and representative of the Old
Testament covenant of the law: as Jesus, the Son of God, is of the
Gospel covenant ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md); [Heb
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005).md). The people were led to believe
in Moses as God's servant by the miracle of the cloud protecting them,
and by their being conducted under him safely through the Red Sea;
therefore they are said to be "baptized unto" him ([Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md). "Baptized" is here equivalent
to "initiated": it is used in accommodation to Paul's argument to the
Corinthians; they, it is true, have been "baptized," but so also
virtually were the Israelites of old; if the virtual baptism of the
latter availed not to save them from the doom of lust, neither will the
actual baptism of the former save them. There is a resemblance between
the symbols also: for the cloud and sea consist of water, and as these
took the Israelites out of sight, and then restored them again to view,
so the water does to the baptized \[BENGEL\]. OLSHAUSEN understands "the
cloud" and "the sea" as symbolizing the Spirit and water respectively
([Joh 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md); [Act
10:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044).md). Christ is the pillar cloud
that screens us from the heat of God's wrath. Christ as "the light of
the world" is our "pillar of fire" to guide us in the darkness of the
world. As the rock when smitten sent forth the waters, so Christ, having
been once for all smitten, sends forth the waters of the Spirit. As the
manna bruised in mills fed Israel, so Christ, when "it pleased the Lord
to bruise Him," has become our spiritual food. A strong proof of
inspiration is given in this fact, that the historical parts of
Scripture, without the consciousness even of the authors, are covert
prophecies of the future.

[1 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 10:3</span></span>

same spiritual meat--As the Israelites had the water from the rock,
which answered to baptism, so they had the manna which corresponded to
the other of the two Christian sacraments, the Lord's Supper. Paul
plainly implies the importance which was attached to these two
sacraments by all Christians in those days: "an inspired protest against
those who lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" \[ALFORD\].
Still he guards against the other extreme of thinking the mere external
possession of such privileges will ensure salvation. Moreover, had there
been seven sacraments, as Rome teaches, Paul would have alluded to them,
whereas he refers to only the two. He does not mean by "the same" that
the Israelites and we Christians have the "same" sacrament; but that
believing and unbelieving Israelites alike had "the same" spiritual
privilege of the manna (compare [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017).md). It was "spiritual meat" or
food; because given by the power of God's spirit, not by human labor
\[GROTIUS and ALFORD\] [Gal 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md),
"born after the Spirit," that is, supernaturally. [Psa
78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024.md), "corn of heaven" ([Psa
105:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040).md). Rather, "spiritual" in its
typical signification, Christ, the true Bread of heaven, being signified
([Joh 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032).md). Not that the Israelites
clearly understood the signification; but believers among them would
feel that in the type something more was meant; and their implicit and
reverent, though indistinct, faith was counted to them for
justification, of which the manna was a kind of sacramental seal. "They
are not to be heard which feign that the old fathers did look only for
transitory promises" \[Article VII, Church of England\], as appears from
this passage (compare [Heb 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 10:4</span></span>

drink-- ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006).md). In [Num
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md), "the beasts" also are mentioned
as having drunk. The literal water typified "spiritual drink," and is
therefore so called.

spiritual Rock that followed them--rather, "accompanied them." Not the
literal rock (or its water) "followed" them, as ALFORD explains, as if
Paul sanctioned the Jews' tradition (Rabbi Solomon on [Num
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002).md) that the rock itself, or at
least the stream from it, followed the Israelites from place to place
(compare [Deu 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021).md). But Christ, the
"Spiritual Rock" ([Psa 78:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#020.md), [Psa
78:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#035.md); [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md), [Deu
32:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md), [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md), accompanied them ([Exo
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015).md). "Followed" implies His
attending on them to minister to them; thus, though mostly going before
them, He, when occasion required it, followed "behind" ([Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md). He satisfied all alike as to
their bodily thirst whenever they needed it; as on three occasions is
expressly recorded ([Exo 15:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#024.md);
[Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md); [Num
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008).md); and this drink for the body
symbolized the spiritual drink from the Spiritual Rock (compare [Joh
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md); see on [Co1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 10:5</span></span>

But--though they had so many tokens of God's presence.

many of them--rather, "the majority of them"; "the whole part." All
except Joshua and Caleb of the first generation.

not--in the Greek emphatically standing in the beginning of the
sentence: "Not," as one might have naturally expected, "with the more
part of them was," &c.

God--whose judgment alone is valid.

for--the event showed, they had not pleased God.

overthrown--literally, "strewn in heaps."

in the wilderness--far from the land of promise.

[1 Corinthians 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 10:6</span></span>

were--Greek, "came to pass as."

our examples--samples to us of what will befall us, if we also with all
our privileges walk carelessly.

lust--the fountain of all the four other offenses enumerated, and
therefore put first ([Jam 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md);
compare [Psa 106:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#014).md). A particular
case of lust was that after flesh, when they pined for the fish, leeks,
&c., of Egypt, which they had left ([Num
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md), [Num
11:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033).md). These are included in the
"evil things," not that they are so in themselves, but they became so to
the Israelites when they lusted after what God withheld, and were
discontented with what God provided.

[1 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 10:7</span></span>

idolaters--A case in point. As the Israelites sat down (a deliberate
act), ate, and drank at the idol feast to the calves in Horeb, so the
Corinthians were in danger of idolatry by a like act, though not
professedly worshipping an idol as the Israelites ([Co1
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md); [Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014.md), [Co1
10:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md); [Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006).md). He passes here from the first
to the second person, as they alone (not he also) were in danger of
idolatry, &c. He resumes the first person appropriately at [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md).

some--The multitude follow the lead of some bad men.

play--with lascivious dancing, singing, and drumming round the calf
(compare "rejoiced," [Act 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 10:8</span></span>

fornication--literally, Fornication was generally, as in this case (Num.
25:1-18), associated at the idol feasts with spiritual fornication, that
is, idolatry. This all applied to the Corinthians ([Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md), [Co1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md); [Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md), [Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md), [Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md); [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010).md). Balaam tempted Israel to both
sins with Midian ([Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md). Compare
[Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md), [Co1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md), "stumbling-block," "eat . . .
thing offered unto . . . idol."

three and twenty thousand--in [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009.md) "twenty and four thousand." If
this were a real discrepancy, it would militate rather against
inspiration of the subject matter and thought, than against verbal
inspiration. The solution is: Moses in Numbers includes all who died "in
the plague"; Paul, all who died "in one day"; one thousand more may have
fallen the next day \[KITTO, Biblical CyclopÃ&brvbr;dia\]. Or, the real
number may have been between twenty-three thousand and twenty-four
thousand, say twenty-three thousand five hundred, or twenty-three
thousand six hundred; when writing generally where the exact figures
were not needed, one writer might quite veraciously give one of the two
round numbers near the exact one, and the other writer the other
\[BENGEL\]. Whichever be the true way of reconciling the seeming
discrepant statements, at least the ways given above prove they are not
really irreconcilable.

[1 Corinthians 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 10:9</span></span>

tempt Christ--So the oldest versions, IRENÃ†US (264), and good
manuscripts read. Some of the oldest manuscripts read "Lord"; and one
manuscript only "God." If "Lord" be read, it will mean Christ. As
"Christ" was referred to in one of the five privileges of Israel ([Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004).md), so it is natural that He should
be mentioned here in one of the five corresponding sins of that people.
In [Num 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md) it is "spake against God"
(whence probably arose the alteration in the one manuscript, [Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md), "God," to harmonize it with [Num
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005).md). As either "Christ" or "Lord" is
the genuine reading, "Christ" must be "God." Compare "Why do ye tempt
the Lord?" ([Exo 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md), [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md). Compare [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md), with [Isa
45:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022).md). Israel's discontented
complainings were temptings of Christ especially, the "Angel" of the
covenant ([Exo 23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009).md). Though they drank of "that Rock
. . . Christ" ([Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004).md), they yet
complained for want of water ([Exo
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md), [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md). Though also eating the same
spiritual meat (Christ, "the true manna," "the bread of life"), they yet
murmured, "Our soul loatheth this light bread." In this case, being
punished by the fiery serpents, they were saved by the brazen serpent,
the emblem of Christ (compare [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md); [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026).md). The Greek for "tempt" means,
tempt or try, so as to wear out the long-suffering of Christ (compare
[Psa 95:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md); [Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).md). The Corinthians were in danger
of provoking God's long-suffering by walking on the verge of idolatry,
through overweening confidence in their knowledge.

[1 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 10:10</span></span>

some of them . . . murmured--upon the death of Korah and his company,
who themselves were murmurers ([Num
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#041.md), [Num
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#049).md). Their murmurs against Moses
and Aaron were virtually murmurs against God (compare [Exo
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md), [Exo
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010).md). Paul herein glances at the
Corinthian murmurs against himself, the apostle of Christ.

destroyed--fourteen thousand seven hundred perished.

the destroyer--THE same destroying angel sent by God as in [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md), and [Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016.md).

[1 Corinthians 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 10:11</span></span>

Now . . . these things . . . ensamples--resuming the thread of [Co1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md). The oldest manuscripts read, "by
way of example."

the ends of the world--literally, "of the ages"; the New Testament
dispensation in its successive phases (plural, "ends") being the winding
up of all former "ages." No new dispensation shall appear till Christ
comes as Avenger and Judge; till then the "ends," being many, include
various successive periods (compare [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026).md). As we live in the last
dispensation, which is the consummation of all that went before, our
responsibilities are the greater; and the greater is the guilt, Paul
implies, to the Corinthians, which they incur if they fall short of
their privileges.

[1 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 10:12</span></span>

thinketh he standeth--stands and thinks that he stands \[BENGEL\]; that
is, stands "by faith . . . well pleasing" to God; in contrast to [Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md), "with many of them God was not
well pleased" ([Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020).md).

fall--from his place in the Church of God (compare [Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008), "fell".md). Both temporally and
spiritually ([Rom 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004).md). Our security,
so far as relates to God, consists in faith; so far as relates to
ourselves, it consists in fear.

[1 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 10:13</span></span>

Consolation to them, under their temptation; it is none but such as is
"common to man," or "such as man can bear," "adapted to man's powers of
endurance" \[WAHL\].

faithful-- ([Psa 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md); [Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md), [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008.md); [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010).md). "God is faithful" to the
covenant which He made with you in calling you ([Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024).md). To be led into temptation is
distinct from running into it, which would be "tempting God" ([Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md); [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007).md).

way to escape-- ([Jer 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009).md). The Greek is, "the way of
escape"; the appropriate way of escape in each particular temptation;
not an immediate escape, but one in due time, after patience has had her
perfect work ([Jam 1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md), [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012).md). He "makes" the way of escape
simultaneously with the temptation which His providence permissively
arranges for His people.

to bear it--Greek, "to bear up under it," or "against it." Not, He will
take it away ([Co2 12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 10:14</span></span>

Resuming the argument, [Co1 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007.md); [Co1
8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md).

flee--Do not tamper with it by doubtful acts, such as eating idol meats
on the plea of Christian liberty. The only safety is in wholly shunning
whatever borders on idolatry ([Co2
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md). The Holy Spirit herein also
presciently warned the Church against the idolatry, subsequently
transferred from the idol feast to the Lord's Supper itself, in the
figment of transubstantiation.

[1 Corinthians 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 10:15</span></span>

Appeal to their own powers of judgment to weigh the force of the
argument that follows: namely, that as the partaking of the Lord's
Supper involves a partaking of the Lord Himself, and the partaking of
the Jewish sacrificial meats involved a partaking of the altar of God,
and, as the heathens sacrifice to devils, to partake of an idol feast is
to have fellowship with devils. We cannot divest ourselves of the
responsibility of "judging" for ourselves. The weakness of private
judgment is not an argument against its use, but its abuse. We should
the more take pains in searching the infallible word, with every aid
within our reach, and above all with humble prayer for the Spirit's
teaching ([Act 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011).md). If Paul, an
inspired apostle, not only permits, but urges, men to judge his sayings
by Scripture, much more should the fallible ministers of the present
visible Church do so.

To wise men--refers with a mixture of irony to the Corinthian boast of
"wisdom" ([Co1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010.md); [Co2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019).md). Here you have an opportunity
of exercising your "wisdom" in judging "what I say."

[1 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 10:16</span></span>

The cup of blessing--answering to the Jewish "cup of blessing," over
which thanks were offered in the Passover. It was in doing so that
Christ instituted this part of the Lord's Supper ([Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027.md); [Luk
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#017.md), [Luk
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020).md).

we bless--"we," not merely ministers, but also the congregation. The
minister "blesses" (that is, consecrates with blessing) the cup, not by
any priestly transmitted authority of his own, but as representative of
the congregation, who virtually through him bless the cup. The
consecration is the corporate act of the whole Church. The act of joint
blessing by him and them (not "the cup" itself, which, as also "the
bread," in the Greek is in the accusative), and the consequent drinking
of it together, constitute the communion, that is, the joint
participation "of the blood of Christ." Compare [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md), "They who eat . . . are
partakers" (joint communicants). "Is" in both cases in this verse is
literal, not represents. He who with faith partakes of the cup and the
bread, partakes really but spiritually of the blood and body of Christ
([Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md), [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md), and of the benefits of His
sacrifice on the cross (compare [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018).md). In contrast to this is to have
"fellowship with devils" ([Co1 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020).md).
ALFORD explains, "The cup . . . is the \[joint\] participation (that is,
that whereby the act of participation takes place) of the blood," &c. It
is the seal of our living union with, and a means of our partaking of,
Christ as our Saviour ([Joh 6:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053).md).
It is not said, "The cup . . . is the blood," or "the bread . . . is the
body," but "is the communion \[joint-participation\] of the blood . . .
body." If the bread be changed into the literal body of Christ, where is
the sign of the sacrament? Romanists eat Christ "in remembrance of
Himself." To drink literal blood would have been an abomination to Jews,
which the first Christians were ([Lev
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).md). Breaking the bread was part
of the act of consecrating it, for thus was represented the crucifixion
of Christ's body ([Co1 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024).md). The
distinct specification of the bread and the wine disproves the Romish
doctrine of concomitancy, and exclusion of the laity from the cup.

one bread--rather, "loaf." One loaf alone seems to have been used in
each celebration.

and one body--Omit "and"; "one loaf \[that is\], one body." "We, the
many (namely, believers assembled; so the Greek), are one bread (by our
partaking of the same loaf, which becomes assimilated to the substance
of all our bodies; and so we become), one body" (with Christ, and so
with one another).

we . . . all--Greek, "the whole of us."

Israel after the flesh--the literal, as distinguished from the
spiritual, Israel ([Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Rom
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md); [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md); [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md).

partakers of the altar--and so of God, whose is the altar; they have
fellowship in God and His worship, of which the altar is the symbol.

[1 Corinthians 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 10:19</span></span>

What say I then?--The inference might be drawn from the analogies of the
Lord's Supper and Jewish sacrifices, that an idol is really what the
heathen thought it to be, a god, and that in eating idol-meats they had
fellowship with the god. This verse guards against such an inference:
"What would I say then? that a thing sacrificed to an idol is any real
thing (in the sense that the heathen regard it), or that an idol is any
real thing?" (The oldest manuscripts read the words in this order.
Supply "Nay") "But \[I say\] that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils (demons)." Paul here introduces a
new fact. It is true that, as I said, an idol has no reality in the
sense that the heathen regard it, but it has a reality in another sense;
heathendom being under Satan's dominion as "prince of this world," he
and his demons are in fact the powers worshipped by the heathen, whether
they are or are not conscious of it ([Deu
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md); [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md); [Ch2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md); [Psa
106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037.md); [Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020).md). "Devil" is in the Greek
restricted to Satan; "demons" is the term applied to his subordinate
evil spirits. Fear, rather than love, is the motive of heathen worship
(compare the English word "panic," from PAN, whose human form with horns
and cloven hoofs gave rise to the vulgar representations of Satan which
prevail now); just as fear is the spirit of Satan and his demons ([Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 10:20</span></span>

I would not that ye . . . have fellowship with devils--by partaking of
idol feasts ([Co1 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010).md).

[1 Corinthians 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 10:21</span></span>

Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord--really and spiritually; though ye
may outwardly ([Kg1 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021).md).

cup of devils--in contrast to the cup of the Lord. At idol feasts
libations were usually made from the cup to the idol first, and then the
guests drank; so that in drinking they had fellowship with the idol.

the Lord's table--The Lord's Supper is a feast on a table, not a
sacrifice on an altar. Our only altar is the cross, our only sacrifice
that of Christ once for all. The Lord's Supper stands, however, in the
same relation, analogically, to Christ's sacrifice, as the Jews'
sacrificial feasts did to their sacrifices (compare [Mal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007), "altar . . . table of the Lord".md),
and the heathen idol feasts to their idolatrous sacrifices ([Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md). The heathen sacrifices were
offered to idol nonentities, behind which Satan lurked. The Jews'
sacrifice was but a shadow of the substance which was to come. Our one
sacrifice of Christ is the only substantial reality; therefore, while
the partaker of the Jew's sacrificial feast partook rather "of the
altar" ([Co1 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018).md) than of GOD
manifested fully, and the heathen idol-feaster had fellowship really
with demons, the communicant in the Lord's Supper has in it a real
communion of, or fellowship in, the body of Christ once sacrificed, and
now exalted as the Head of redeemed humanity.

[1 Corinthians 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 10:22</span></span>

Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?--by dividing our fellowship between
Him and idols ([Eze 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039).md). Is it our
wish to provoke Him to assert His power? [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md) is before the apostle's mind
\[ALFORD\], ([Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md).

are we stronger?--that we can risk a contest with Him.

[1 Corinthians 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 10:23</span></span>

All things are lawful for me, &c.--Recurring to the Corinthian plea
([Co1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012).md), he repeats his
qualification of it. The oldest manuscripts omit both times "for me."

edify not--tend not to build up the spiritual temple, the Church, in
faith and love. Paul does not appeal to the apostolic decision (Acts
15:1-29), which seems to have been not so much regarded outside of
Palestine, but rather to the broad principle of true Christian freedom,
which does not allow us to be governed by external things, as though,
because we can use them, we must use them ([Co1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012).md). Their use or non-use is to be
regulated by regard to edification.

The ground on which such eating without questioning is justified is, the
earth and all its contents ("the fulness thereof," [Psa

50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012).md), including all meats, belong to
the Lord, and are appointed for our use; and where conscience suggests
no scruple, all are to be eaten ([Rom

14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md); [Ti1

idol feast, but a general entertainment, at which, however, there might
be meat that had been offered to an idol.

offered in sacrifice unto idols--The oldest manuscripts omit "unto
idols." At a heathen's table the expression, offensive to him, would
naturally be avoided.

for conscience' sake--not to cause a stumbling-block to the conscience
of thy weak brother ([Co1 8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010).md).

for the earth is the Lord's, &c.--not in the oldest manuscripts.

Conscience . . . of the other--the weak brother introduced in [Co1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028.md).

for why is my liberty judged off another man's conscience?--Paul passes
to the first person, to teach his converts by putting himself as it were
in their position. The Greek terms for "the other" and "another" are
distinct. "The other" is the one with whom Paul's and his Corinthian
converts' concern is; "another" is any other with whom he and they have
no concern. If a guest know the meat to be idol meat while I know it
not, I have "liberty" to eat without being condemned by his "conscience"
\[GROTIUS\]. Thus the "for," &c., is an argument for [Co1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027.md), "Eat, asking no questions." Or,
Why should I give occasion by the rash use of my liberty that another
should condemn it \[ESTIUS\], or that my liberty should cause the
destruction of my weak brother?" \[MENOCHIUS\]. Or, the words are those
of the Corinthian objector (perhaps used in their letter, and so quoted
by Paul), "Why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?" Why should
not I be judged only by my own, and have liberty to do whatever it
sanctions? Paul replies in [Co1 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md),
Your doing so ought always to be limited by regard to what most tends
"to the glory of God" \[VATABLUS, CONYBEARE and HOWSON\]. The first
explanation is simplest; the "for," &c., in it refers to "not thine own"
(that is, "not my own," in Paul's change to the first person); I am to
abstain only in the case of liability to offend another's conscience; in
cases where my own has no scruple, I am not bound, in God's judgment, by
any other conscience than my own.

affecting Christian doctrine and practice, even in the smallest detail,
we must not swerve from principle, whatever offense may be the result
([Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023).md). Giving offense is
unnecessary, if our own spirit cause it; necessary, if it be caused by
the truth.
