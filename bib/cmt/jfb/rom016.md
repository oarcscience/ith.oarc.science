### [Romans Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

[Romans 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 16:1</span></span>

CONCLUSION, EMBRACING SUNDRY SALUTATIONS AND DIRECTIONS, AND A CLOSING
PRAYER. (Rom. 16:1-27)

I commend unto you PhÅ“bebe our sister, which is a servant--or
"deaconess"

of the church which is at Cenchrea--The word is "CenchreÃ&brvbr;," the
eastern part of Corinth ([Act 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018).md).
That in the earliest churches there were deaconesses, to attend to the
wants of the female members, there is no good reason to doubt. So early
at least as the reign of Trajan, we learn from PLINY'S celebrated letter
to that emperor--A.D. 110, or 111--that they existed in the Eastern
churches. Indeed, from the relation in which the sexes then stood to
each other, something of this sort would seem to have been a necessity.
Modern attempts, however, to revive this office have seldom found favor;
either from the altered state of society, or the abuse of the office, or
both.

[Romans 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 16:2</span></span>

Receive her in the Lord--that is, as a genuine disciple of the Lord
Jesus.

as--"so as"

becometh saints--so as saints should receive saints.

assist her in whatsoever business she hath--"may have"

need of you--some private business of her own.

for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also--(See [Psa
41:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md); [Ti2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016).md).

[Romans 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 16:3</span></span>

Salute Priscilla--The true reading here is "Prisca" (as in [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).md), a contracted form of Priscilla,
as "Silas" of "Silvanus."

and Aquila my helpers--The wife is here named before the husband (as in
[Act 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md), and [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md), according to the true reading;
also in [Ti2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).md), probably as being
the more prominent and helpful to the Church.

[Romans 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 16:4</span></span>

who have for my life laid down--"who did for my life lay down"

their own necks--that is, risked their lives; either at Corinth ([Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md), [Act
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009).md), or more probably at Ephesus
([Act 19:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#030.md); and compare [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md). They must have returned from
Ephesus (where we last find them in the history of the Acts) to Rome,
whence the edict of Claudius had banished them ([Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md); and doubtless, if not the
principal members of that Christian community, they were at least the
most endeared to our apostle.

unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the
Gentiles--whose special apostle this dear couple had rescued from
imminent danger.

[Romans 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 16:5</span></span>

Likewise the church that is in their house--The Christian assembly that
statedly met there for worship. "From his occupation as tent-maker, he
had probably better accommodations for the meetings of the church than
most other Christians" \[HODGE\]. Probably this devoted couple had
written to the apostle such an account of the stated meetings at their
house, as made him feel at home with them, and include them in this
salutation, which doubtless would be read at their meetings with
peculiar interest.

Salute my well beloved EpÃ&brvbr;netus, who is the first-fruits--that
is, the first convert

of Achaia unto Christ--The true reading here, as appears by the
manuscripts, is, "the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ"--that is,
Proconsular Asia (see [Act 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006).md). In
[Co1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md) it is said that "the
household of Stephanas was the first-fruit of Achaia"; and though if
EpÃ&brvbr;netus was one of that family, the two statements might be
reconciled according to the received text, there is no need to resort to
this supposition, as that text is in this instance without authority.
EpÃ&brvbr;netus, as the first believer in that region called Proconsular
Asia, was dear to the apostle. (See [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md); [Mic
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).md). None of the names mentioned from
[Rom 16:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md) are otherwise known. One
wonders at the number of them, considering that the writer had never
been at Rome. But as Rome was then the center of the civilized world, to
and from which journeys were continually taken to the remotest parts,
there is no great difficulty in supposing that so active a travelling
missionary as Paul would, in course of time, make the acquaintance of a
considerable number of the Christians then residing at Rome.

[Romans 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 16:6</span></span>

Greet--or "salute"

Mary, who bestowed much labour on us--labor, no doubt, of a womanly
kind.

[Romans 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 16:7</span></span>

Andronicus and Junia--or, as it might be, "Junias," a contracted form of
"Junianus"; in this case, it is a man's name. But if, as is more
probable, the word be, as in our version, "Junia," the person meant was
no doubt either the wife or the sister of Andronicus.

my kinsmen--or, "relatives."

and my fellow prisoners--on what occasion, it is impossible to say, as
the apostle elsewhere tells us that he was "in prisons more frequent"
([Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023).md).

which are of note among the apostles--Those who think the word "apostle"
is used in a lax sense, in the Acts and Epistles, take this to mean
"noted apostles" \[CHRYSOSTOM, LUTHER, CALVIN, BENGEL, OLSHAUSEN,
THOLUCK, ALFORD, JOWETT\]; others, who are not clear that the word
"apostle" is applied to any without the circle of the Twelve, save where
the connection or some qualifying words show that the literal meaning of
"one sent" is the thing intended, understand by the expression used
here, "persons esteemed by the apostles" \[BEZA, GROTIUS, DE WETTE,
MEYER, FRITZSCHE, STUART, PHILIPPI, HODGE\]. And of course, if "Junia"
is to be taken for a woman, this latter must be the meaning.

who also were in Christ before me--The apostle writes as if he envied
them this priority in the faith. And, indeed, if to be "in Christ" be
the most enviable human condition, the earlier the date of this blessed
translation, the greater the grace of it. This latter statement about
Andronicus and Junia seems to throw some light on the preceding one.
Very possibly they may have been among the first-fruits of Peter's
labors, gained to Christ either on the day of Pentecost or on some of
the succeeding days. In that case they may have attracted the special
esteem of those apostles who for some time resided chiefly at Jerusalem
and its neighborhood; and our apostle, though he came late in contact
with the other apostles, if he was aware of this fact, would have
pleasure in alluding to it.

[Romans 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 16:8</span></span>

Amplias--a contracted form of "Ampliatus."

my beloved in the Lord--an expression of dear Christian affection.

[Romans 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 16:9</span></span>

Urbane--rather, "Urbanus." It is a man's name.

our helper--"fellow labourer"

in Christ.

[Romans 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 16:10</span></span>

Salute Apelles approved--"the approved"

in Christ--or, as we should say, "that tried Christian"; a noble
commendation.

Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household--It would seem, from
what is said of Narcissus in [Rom
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011.md), that this Aristobulus himself
had not been a Christian; but that the Christians of his household
simply were meant; very possibly some of his slaves.

[Romans 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 16:11</span></span>

Salute Herodion, my kinsman--(See on [Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007).md).

Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the
Lord--which implies that others in his house, including probably
himself, were not Christians.

[Romans 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 16:12</span></span>

Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord--two active women.

Salute the beloved Persis--another woman.

which laboured much in the Lord--referring probably, not to official
services, such as would fall to the deaconesses, but to such higher
Christian labors--yet within the sphere competent to woman--as Priscilla
bestowed on Apollos and others ([Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018).md).

[Romans 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 16:13</span></span>

Salute Rufus, chosen--"the chosen"

in the Lord--meaning, not "who is one of the elect," as every believer
is, but "the choice" or "precious one" in the Lord. (See [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md); [Jo2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#013).md). We read in [Mar
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021.md) that Simon of Cyrene, who was
compelled to bear our Lord's cross, was "the father of Alexander and
Rufus." From this we naturally conclude that when Mark wrote his Gospel,
Alexander and Rufus must have been well known as Christians among those
by whom he expected his Gospel to be first read; and, in all likelihood,
this was that very "Rufus"; in which case our interest is deepened by
what immediately follows about his mother.

and--salute.

his mother and mine--The apostle calls her "his own mother," not so much
as our Lord calls every elderly woman believer His mother ([Mat
12:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049).md), but in grateful
acknowledgment of her motherly attentions to himself, bestowed no doubt
for his Master's sake, and the love she bore to his honored servants. To
us it seems altogether likely that the conversion of Simon the Cyrenian
dated from that memorable day when "passing \[casually\] by, as he came
from the country" ([Mar 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021).md), "they
compelled him to bear the" Saviour's cross. Sweet compulsion, if what he
thus beheld issued in his voluntarily taking up his own cross! Through
him it is natural to suppose that his wife would be brought in, and that
this believing couple, now "heirs together of the grace of life" ([Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007).md), as they told their two sons,
Alexander and Rufus, what honor had unwittingly been put upon their
father at that hour of deepest and dearest moment to all Christians,
might be blessed to the inbringing of both of them to Christ. In this
case, supposing the elder of the two to have departed to be with Christ
ere this letter was written, or to have been residing in some other
place, and Rufus left alone with his mother, how instructive and
beautiful is the testimony here borne to her!

[Romans 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 16:14</span></span>

Salute Asyncritus, &c.--These have been thought to be the names of ten
less notable Christians than those already named. But this will hardly
be supposed if it be observed that they are divided into two pairs of
five each, and that after the first of these pairs it is added, "and the
brethren which are with them," while after the second pair we have the
words, "and all the saints which are with them." This perhaps hardly
means that each of the five in both pairs had "a church at his house,"
else probably this would have been more expressly said. But at least it
would seem to indicate that they were each a center of some few
Christians who met at his house--it may be for further instruction, for
prayer, for missionary purposes, or for some other Christian objects.
These little peeps into the rudimental forms which Christian fellowship
first took in the great cities, though too indistinct for more than
conjecture, are singularly interesting. Our apostle would seem to have
been kept minutely informed as to the state of the church at Rome, both
as to its membership and its varied activities, probably by Priscilla
and Aquila.

[Romans 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 16:16</span></span>

Salute one another with an holy kiss--So [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md); [Th1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026.md); [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md). The custom prevailed among the
Jews, and doubtless came from the East, where it still obtains. Its
adoption into the Christian churches, as the symbol of a higher
fellowship than it had ever expressed before, was probably as immediate
as it was natural. In this case the apostle's desire seems to be that on
receipt of his epistle, with its salutations, they should in this manner
expressly testify their Christian affection. It afterwards came to have
a fixed place in the church service, immediately after the celebration
of the Supper, and continued long in use. In such matters, however, the
state of society and the peculiarities of different places require to be
studied.

The churches of Christ salute you--The true reading is, "All the
churches"; the word "all" gradually falling out, as seeming probably to
express more than the apostle would venture to affirm. But no more seems
meant than to assure the Romans in what affectionate esteem they were
held by the churches generally; all that knew he was writing to Rome
having expressly asked their own salutations to be sent to them. (See
[Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019).md).

[Romans 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 16:17</span></span>

Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned--"which ye
learned."

and avoid them--The fomentors of "divisions" here referred to are
probably those who were unfriendly to the truths taught in this epistle,
while those who caused "offenses" were probably those referred to in
[Rom 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md) as haughtily disregarding
the prejudices of the weak. The direction as to both is, first, to
"mark" such, lest the evil should be done ere it was fully discovered;
and next, to "avoid" them (compare [Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md), [Th2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014).md), so as neither to bear any
responsibility for their procedure, nor seem to give them the least
countenance.

[Romans 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 16:18</span></span>

For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ--"our Lord
Christ" appears to be the true reading.

but their own belly--not in the grosset sense, but as "living for low
ends of their own" (compare [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md).

and by good words and fair speeches deceive the simple--the unwary, the
unsuspecting. (See [Pro 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015).md).

[Romans 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 16:19</span></span>

For your obedience--that is, tractableness

is come abroad unto all. I am glad therefore on your behalf--"I rejoice
therefore over you," seems the true reading.

but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and
simple--"harmless," as in [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md),
from which the warning is taken.

concerning--"unto"

evil--"Your reputation among the churches for subjection to the teaching
ye have received is to me sufficient ground of confidence in you; but ye
need the serpent's wisdom to discriminate between transparent truth and
plausible error, with that guileless simplicity which instinctively
cleaves to the one and rejects the other."

[Romans 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 16:20</span></span>

And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly--The
apostle encourages the Romans to persevere in resisting the wiles of the
devil with the assurance that, as good soldiers of Jesus Christ, they
are "shortly" to receive their discharge, and have the satisfaction of
"putting their feet upon the neck" of that formidable enemy--symbol
familiar, probably, in all languages to express not only the
completeness of the defeat, but the abject humiliation of the conquered
foe. (See [Jos 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md); [Sa2
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#041.md); [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md); [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013).md). Though the apostle here styles
Him who is thus to bruise Satan, the God of peace," with special
reference to the "divisions" ([Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017).md) by which the church at Rome was
in danger of being disturbed, this sublime appellation of God has here a
wider sense, pointing to the whole "purpose for which the Son of God was
manifested, to destroy the works of the devil" ([Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008).md); and indeed this assurance is but
a reproduction of the first great promise, that the Seed of the woman
should bruise the Serpent's head ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md).

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen--The "Amen" here
has no manuscript authority. What comes after this, where one would have
expected the epistle to close, has its parallel in [Phi
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020.md), &c., and being in fact common in
epistolary writings, is simply a mark of genuineness.

[Romans 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 16:21</span></span>

Timotheus, my work-fellow--"my fellow labourer"; see [Act
16:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md). The apostle mentions him here
rather than in the opening address to this church, as he had not been at
Rome \[BENGEL\].

and Lucius--not Luke, for the fuller form of "Lucas" is not "Lucius" but
"Lucanus." The person meant seems to be "Lucius of Cyrene," who was
among the "prophets and teachers" at Antioch with our apostle, before he
was summoned into the missionary field ([Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001).md).

and Jason--See [Act 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md). He had
probably accompanied or followed the apostle from Thessalonica to
Corinth.

Sosipater--See [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md).

[Romans 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 16:22</span></span>

I, Tertius, who wrote this--"the"

epistle--as the apostle's amanuensis, or penman.

salute you in the Lord--So usually did the apostle dictate his epistles,
that he calls the attention of the Galatians to the fact that to them he
wrote with his own hand ([Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011).md).
But this Tertius would have the Romans to know that, far from being a
mere scribe, his heart went out to them in Christian affection; and the
apostle, by giving his salutation a place here, would show what sort of
assistants he employed.

[Romans 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 16:23</span></span>

Gaius mine host, and--the host

of the whole church--(See [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004).md).
It would appear that he was one of only two persons whom Paul baptized
with his own hand (compare [Jo3 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001).md).
His Christian hospitality appears to have been something uncommon.

Erastus the chamberlain--"treasurer."

of the city--doubtless of Corinth. (See [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md); [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md).

and Quartus a brother--rather, "the" or "our brother"; as Sosthenes and
Timothy are called ([Co1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001), Greek.md). Nothing more is known of
this Quartus.

[Romans 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 16:24</span></span>

The grace, &c.--a repetition of the benediction precisely as in [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md), save that it is here invoked on
them "all."

[Romans 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 16:25</span></span>

Now to him that is of power--more simply, as in [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024.md), "to Him that is able."

to stablish--confirm, or uphold

you, according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ--that is,
in conformity with the truths of that Gospel which I preach, and not I
only, but all to whom has been committed "the preaching of Jesus
Christ."

according to the revelation of the mystery--(See on [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md).

which was kept secret since the world began--literally, "which hath been
kept in silence during eternal ages."

[Romans 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 16:26</span></span>

But is now made manifest--The reference here is to that peculiar feature
of the Gospel economy which Paul himself was specially employed to carry
into practical effect and to unfold by his teaching--the introduction of
the Gentile believers to an equality with their Jewish brethren, and the
new, and, to the Jews, quite unexpected form which this gave to the
whole Kingdom of God (compare [Eph
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), &c..md). This the apostle calls
here a mystery hitherto undisclosed, in what sense [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md) will show, but now fully
unfolded; and his prayer for the Roman Christians, in the form of a
doxology to Him who was able to do what he asked, is that they might be
established in the truth of the Gospel, not only in its essential
character, but specially in that feature of it which gave themselves, as
Gentile believers, their whole standing among the people of God.

and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of
the everlasting God, made known to all nations for--in order to

the obedience of faith--Lest they should think, from what he had just
said, that God had brought in upon his people so vast a change on their
condition without giving them any previous notice, the apostle here adds
that, on the contrary, "the Scriptures of the prophets" contain all that
he and other preachers of the Gospel had to declare on these topics, and
indeed that the same "everlasting God," who "from eternal ages" had kept
these things hid, had given "commandment" that they should now,
according to the tenor of those prophetic Scriptures, be imparted to
every nation for their believing acceptance.

[Romans 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 16:27</span></span>

To God, &c.--"To the only wise God through Jesus Christ, be"--literally,
"to whom be"; that is, "to Him, I say, be the glory for ever. Amen." At
its outset, this is an ascription of glory to the power that could do
all this; at its close it ascribes glory to the wisdom that planned and
that presides over the gathering of a redeemed people out of all
nations. The apostle adds his devout "Amen," which the reader--if he has
followed him with the astonishment and delight of him who pens these
words--will fervently echo.

On this concluding section of the Epistle, Note, (1) In the minute and
delicate manifestations of Christian feeling, and lively interest in the
smallest movements of Christian life, love, and zeal, which are here
exemplified, combined with the grasp of thought and elevation of soul
which this whole Epistle displays, as indeed all the writings of our
apostle, we have the secret of much of that grandeur of character which
has made the name of Paul stand on an elevation of its own in the
estimation of enlightened Christendom in every age, and of that
influence which under God, beyond all the other apostles, he has already
exercised, and is yet destined to exert, over the religious thinking and
feeling of men. Nor can any approach him in these peculiarities without
exercising corresponding influence on all with whom they come in contact
(Rom. 16:1-16). (2) "The wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of
the dove"--in enjoining which our apostle here only echoes the teaching
of his Lord ([Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016).md) --is a
combination of properties the rarity of which among Christians is only
equalled by its vast importance. In every age of the Church there have
been real Christians whose excessive study of the serpent's wisdom has
so sadly trenched upon their guileless simplicity, as at times to excite
the distressing apprehension that they were no better than wolves in
sheep's clothing. Nor is it to be denied, on the other hand, that,
either from inaptitude or indisposition to judge with manly
discrimination of character and of measures, many eminently simple,
spiritual, devoted Christians, have throughout life exercised little or
no influence on any section of society around them. Let the apostle's
counsel on this head ([Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019).md) be
taken as a study, especially by young Christians, whose character has
yet to be formed, and whose permanent sphere in life is but partially
fixed; and let them prayerfully set themselves to the combined exercise
of both those qualities. So will their Christian character acquire
solidity and elevation, and their influence for good be proportionably
extended. (3) Christians should cheer their own and each other's hearts,
amidst the toils and trials of their protracted warfare, with the
assurance that it will have a speedy and glorious end; they should
accustom themselves to regard all opposition to the progress and
prosperity of Christ's cause--whether in their own souls, in the
churches with which they are connected, or in the world at large--as
just "Satan" in conflict, as ever, with Christ their Lord; and they
should never allow themselves to doubt that "the God of peace" will
"shortly" give them the neck of their Enemy, and make them to bruise the
Serpent's head ([Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020)). (4.md) As
Christians are held up and carried through solely by divine power,
working through the glorious Gospel, so to that power, and to the wisdom
that brought that Gospel nigh to them, they should ascribe all the glory
of their stability now, as they certainly will of their victory at last
([Rom 16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025)). (5.md) "Has the
everlasting God . . . commanded" that the Gospel "mystery," so long kept
hid but now fully disclosed, shall be "made known to all nations for the
obedience of faith" ([Rom 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026).md)?
Then, what "necessity is laid upon" all the churches and every
Christian, to send the Gospel "to every creature!" And we may rest well
assured that the prosperity or decline of churches, and of individual
Christians, will have not a little to do with their faithfulness or
indifference to this imperative duty.

The ancient subscription at the end of this epistle--though of course of
no authority--appears to be in this case quite correct.
