### [Acts Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

[Acts 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 4:1</span></span>

PETER AND JOHN BEFORE THE SAMHEDRIM. ([Act
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001).md)

the captain--of the Levitical guard.

of the temple--annoyed at the disturbance created around it.

and the Sadducees--who "say that there is no resurrection" ([Act
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008).md), irritated at the apostles
"preaching through (rather, 'in') Jesus the resurrection from the dead";
for the resurrection of Christ, if a fact, effectually overthrew the
Sadducean doctrine.

[Acts 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 4:4</span></span>

the number of the men--or males, exclusive of women; though the word
sometimes includes both.

about five thousand--and this in Jerusalem, where the means of detecting
the imposture or crushing the fanaticism, if such it had been, were
within everyone's reach, and where there was every inducement to sift it
to the bottom.

[Acts 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 4:5</span></span>

their rulers, &c.--This was a regular meeting of the Sanhedrim (see on
[Mat 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004).md).

[Acts 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 4:6</span></span>

Annas . . . and Caiaphas--(See on [Luk
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002).md).

John and Alexander--of whom nothing is known.

[Acts 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 4:7</span></span>

By what power or . . . name have ye done this--thus admitting the
reality of the miracle, which afterwards they confess themselves unable
to deny ([Act 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016).md).

[Acts 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 4:8</span></span>

Then, filled with the Holy Ghost, said--(See [Mar
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md); [Luk
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015).md).

[Acts 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 4:10</span></span>

Be it known unto you . . . and to all the people of Israel--as if
emitting a formal judicial testimony to the entire nation through its
rulers now convened.

by the name of Jesus, &c.--(See on [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013), &c..md).

even by him doth this man stand before you whole--for from [Act
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#014.md) it appears that the healed man
was at that moment before their eyes.

[Acts 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 4:11</span></span>

This is the stone which was set at naught of you builders, &c.--This
application of [Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md), already
made by our Lord Himself before some of the same "builders" ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md), is here repeated with peculiar
propriety after the deed of rejection had been consummated, and the
rejected One had, by His exaltation to the right hand of the Majesty on
high, become "the head of the corner."

[Acts 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 4:12</span></span>

Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name
under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved--How sublimely
does the apostle, in these closing words, shut up these rulers of Israel
to Jesus for salvation, and in what universal and emphatic terms does he
hold up his Lord as the one Hope of men!

[Acts 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 4:13</span></span>

perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men--that is,
uninstructed in the learning of the Jewish schools, and of the common
sort; men in private life, untrained to teaching.

took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus--recognized them as
having been in His company; remembering possibly, that they had seen
them with Him \[MEYER, BLOOMFIELD, ALFORD\]; but, more probably,
perceiving in their whole bearing what identified them with Jesus: that
is, "We thought we had got rid of Him; but lo! He reappears in these
men, and all that troubled us in the Nazarene Himself has yet to be put
down in these His disciples." What a testimony to these primitive
witnesses! Would that the same could be said of their successors!

[Acts 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 4:16</span></span>

a notable miracle . . . done by them is manifest to all . . . in
Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it--And why should ye wish to deny it, O
ye rulers, but that ye hate the light, and will not come to the light
lest your deeds should be reproved?

[Acts 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 4:17</span></span>

But that it spread no further . . . let us straitly--strictly.

threaten . . . that they speak henceforth to no man in this
name--Impotent device! Little knew they the fire that was burning in the
bones of those heroic disciples.

[Acts 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 4:18</span></span>

Whether it be right . . . to hearken to you more than . . . God, judge
ye.

[Acts 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 4:20</span></span>

For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard--There
is here a wonderful union of sober, respectful appeal to the better
reason of their judges, and calm, deep determination to abide the
consequences of a constrained testimony, which betokens a power above
their own resting upon them, according to promise.

[Acts 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 4:21</span></span>

finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people--not
at a loss for a pretext, but at a loss how to do it so as not to rouse
the opposition of the people.

[Acts 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 4:23</span></span>

PETER AND JOHN DISMISSED FROM THE SAMHEDRIM, REPORT THE PROCEEDINGS TO
THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES--THEY ENGAGE IN PRAYER--THE ASTONISHING ANSWER
AND RESULTS. ([Act 4:23-37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023).md)

being let go, they went to their own company--Observe the two opposite
classes, representing the two interests which were about to come into
deadly conflict.

[Acts 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 4:24</span></span>

they lifted up their voice--the assembled disciples, on hearing Peter's
report.

with one accord--the breasts of all present echoing every word of this
sublime prayer.

Lord--(See on [Luk 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029).md). Applied to
God, the term expresses absolute authority.

God which hast made heaven and earth--against whom, therefore, all
creatures are powerless.

[Acts 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 4:25</span></span>

by the mouth of . . . David--to whom the Jews ascribed the second Psalm,
though anonymous; and internal evidence confirms it. David's spirit sees
with astonishment "the heathen, the people, the kings and princes of the
earth," in deadly combination against the sway of Jehovah and His
Anointed (his Messiah, or Christ), and asks "why" it is. This fierce
confederacy our praying disciples see in full operation, in the
"gathering together of Herod and Pilate, the Gentiles (the Roman
authority), and the people of Israel, against God's holy Child
('Servant') Jesus." (See on [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013).md). The best ancient copies read,
after "were gathered together," "in this city," which probably answers
to "upon my holy hill of Zion," in the [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md).

[Acts 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 4:28</span></span>

thy hand and thy counsel determined . . . to be done--that is, "Thy
counsel" determined to be done by "Thy hand."

[Acts 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 4:29</span></span>

now, Lord, behold their threatenings--Recognizing in the threatenings of
the Sanhedrim a declaration of war by the combined powers of the world
against their infant cause, they seek not enthusiastically to hide from
themselves its critical position, but calmly ask the Lord of heaven and
earth to "look upon their threatenings."

that with all boldness they may speak thy word--Rising above self, they
ask only fearless courage to testify for their Master, and divine
attestation to their testimony by miracles of healing, &c., in His name.

[Acts 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 4:31</span></span>

place was shaken--glorious token of the commotion which the Gospel was
to make ([Act 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md); compare [Act
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#026).md), and the overthrow of all
opposing powers in which this was to issue.

they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake, &c.--The Spirit
rested upon the entire community, first, in the very way they had asked,
so that they "spake the word with boldness" ([Act
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029.md), [Act
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031).md); next, in melting down all
selfishness, and absorbing even the feeling of individuality in an
intense and glowing realization of Christian unity. The community of
goods was but an outward expression of this, and natural in such
circumstances.

[Acts 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 4:33</span></span>

with great power--effect on men's minds.

great grace was upon them all--The grace of God copiously rested on the
whole community.

[Acts 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 4:35</span></span>

laid . . . at the apostles' feet--sitting, it may be, above the rest.
But the expression may be merely derived from that practice, and here
meant figuratively.

[Acts 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 4:36</span></span>

Joses, &c.--This is specified merely as an eminent example of that
spirit of generous sacrifice which pervaded all.

son of consolation--no doubt so surnamed from the character of his
ministry.

a Levite--who, though as a tribe having no inheritance, might and did
acquire property as individuals ([Deu
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008).md).

Cyprus--a well-known island in the Mediterranean.
