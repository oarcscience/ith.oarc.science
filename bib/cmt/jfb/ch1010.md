### [1 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 10:1</span></span>

SAUL'S OVERTHROW AND DEATH. ([Ch1
10:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001).md)

Now the Philistines fought against Israel--The details of this chapter
have no relation to the preceding genealogies and seem to be inserted
solely to introduce the narrative of David's elevation to the throne of
the whole kingdom. The parallel between the books of Samuel and
Chronicles commences with this chapter, which relates the issue of the
fatal battle of Gilboa almost in the very same words as [Sa1
31:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md).

[1 Chronicles 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 10:3</span></span>

the battle went sore against Saul; and the archers hit him, and he was
wounded--The Hebrew words may be thus rendered: "The archers found
(attacked) him, and he feared the archers." He was not wounded, at least
not dangerously, when he resolved on committing suicide. The deed was
the effect of sudden terror and overwhelming depression of spirits
\[CALMET\].

[1 Chronicles 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 10:4</span></span>

his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid--He was, of course,
placed in the same perilous condition as Saul. But it is probable that
the feelings that restrained him from complying with Saul's wish were a
profound respect for royalty, mingled with apprehension of the shock
which such a catastrophe would give to the national feelings and
interests.

[1 Chronicles 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 10:6</span></span>

Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house--his sons and courtiers
who were there engaged in the battle. But it appears that Ish-bosheth
and Mephibosheth were kept at Gibeah on account of their youth.

[1 Chronicles 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 10:10</span></span>

THE PHILISTINES TRIUMPH OVER HIM. ([Ch1
10:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#008).md)

put his armour in the house of their gods--It was common among the
heathen to vow to a national or favorite deity, that, in the event of a
victory, the armor of the enemy's king, or of some eminent leader,
should be dedicated to him as an offering of gratitude. Such trophies
were usually suspended on the pillars of the temple.

fastened his head in the temple of Dagon--while the trunk or headless
corpse was affixed to the wall of Beth-shan ([Sa1
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010).md).

[1 Chronicles 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 10:13</span></span>

Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord--in
having spared the king of the Amalekites and taken the flocks of the
people as spoils \[[Sa1 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009.md)\], as
well as in having consulted a pythoness \[[Sa1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md)\]. Both of these acts were great
sins--the first as a violation of God's express and positive command
\[[Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md)\], and the second as
contrary to a well-known statute of the kingdom ([Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).md).

[1 Chronicles 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 10:14</span></span>

And inquired not of the Lord--He had done so in form ([Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006).md), but not in the spirit of a
humble penitent, nor with the believing confidence of a sincere
worshipper. His enquiry was, in fact, a mere mockery, and his total want
of all right religious impressions was manifested by his rushing from
God to a wretched impostor in the service of the devil \[[Sa1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md)\].
