[Genesis 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

PHARAOH'S DREAM. (Gen. 41:1-24)

at the end of two full years--It is not certain whether these years are
reckoned from the beginning of Joseph's imprisonment, or from the events
described in the preceding chapter--most likely the latter. What a long
time for Joseph to experience the sickness of hope deferred! But the
time of his enlargement came when he had sufficiently learned the
lessons of God designed for him; and the plans of Providence were
matured.

Pharaoh dreamed--"Pharaoh," from an Egyptian word Phre, signifying the
"sun," was the official title of the kings of that country. The prince,
who occupied the throne of Egypt, was Aphophis, one of the Memphite
kings, whose capital was On or Heliopolis, and who is universally
acknowledged to have been a patriot king. Between the arrival of Abraham
and the appearance of Joseph in that country, somewhat more than two
centuries had elapsed. Kings sleep and dream, as well as their subjects.
And this Pharaoh had two dreams in one night so singular and so similar,
so distinct and so apparently significant, so coherent and vividly
impressed on his memory, that his spirit was troubled.

[Genesis 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 41:8</span></span>

he called for all the magicians of Egypt--It is not possible to define
the exact distinction between "magicians" and "wise men"; but they
formed different branches of a numerous body, who laid claim to
supernatural skill in occult arts and sciences, in revealing mysteries,
explaining portents, and, above all, interpreting dreams. Long practice
had rendered them expert in devising a plausible way of getting out of
every difficulty and framing an answer suitable to the occasion. But the
dreams of Pharaoh baffled their united skill. Unlike their Assyrian
brethren ([Dan 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004).md), they did not
pretend to know the meaning of the symbols contained in them, and the
providence of God had determined that they should all be nonplussed in
the exercise of their boasted powers, in order that the inspired wisdom
of Joseph might appear the more remarkable.

[Genesis 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 41:9</span></span>

then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
faults--This public acknowledgment of the merits of the young Hebrew
would, tardy though it was, have reflected credit on the butler had it
not been obviously made to ingratiate himself with his royal master. It
is right to confess our faults against God, and against our fellow men
when that confession is made in the spirit of godly sorrow and
penitence. But this man was not much impressed with a sense of the fault
he had committed against Joseph; he never thought of God, to whose
goodness he was indebted for the prophetic announcement of his release,
and in acknowledging his former fault against the king, he was
practising the courtly art of pleasing his master.

[Genesis 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 41:14</span></span>

Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph--Now that God's set time had come
([Psa 105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019).md), no human power nor
policy could detain Joseph in prison. During his protracted confinement,
he might have often been distressed with perplexing doubts; but the
mystery of Providence was about to be cleared up, and all his sorrows
forgotten in the course of honor and public usefulness in which his
services were to be employed.

shaved himself--The Egyptians were the only Oriental nation that liked a
smooth chin. All slaves and foreigners who were reduced to that
condition, were obliged, on their arrival in that country, to conform to
the cleanly habits of the natives, by shaving their beards and heads,
the latter of which were covered with a close cap. Thus prepared, Joseph
was conducted to the palace, where the king seemed to have been
anxiously waiting his arrival.

[Genesis 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 41:15</span></span>

Pharaoh said, . . . I have dreamed a dream--The king's brief statement
of the service required brought out the genuine piety of Joseph;
disclaiming all merit, he ascribed whatever gifts or sagacity he
possessed to the divine source of all wisdom, and he declared his own
inability to penetrate futurity; but, at the same time, he expressed his
confident persuasion that God would reveal what was necessary to be
known.

[Genesis 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 41:17</span></span>

Pharaoh said, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the
river--The dreams were purely Egyptian, founded on the productions of
that country and the experience of a native. The fertility of Egypt
being wholly dependent on the Nile, the scene is laid on the banks of
that river; and oxen being in the ancient hieroglyphics symbolical of
the earth and of food, animals of that species were introduced in the
first dream.

[Genesis 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 41:18</span></span>

there came up out of the river seven kine--Cows now, of the buffalo
kind, are seen daily plunging into the Nile; when their huge form is
gradually emerging, they seem as if rising "out of the river."

and they fed in a meadow--Nile grass, the aquatic plants that grow on
the marshy banks of that river, particularly the lotus kind, on which
cattle were usually fattened.

[Genesis 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 41:19</span></span>

behold, seven other kine . . . poor and ill-favoured--The cow being the
emblem of fruitfulness, the different years of plenty and of famine were
aptly represented by the different condition of those kine--the plenty,
by the cattle feeding on the richest fodder; and the dearth, by the lean
and famishing kine, which the pangs of hunger drove to act contrary to
their nature.

[Genesis 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 41:22</span></span>

I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears--that is, of Egyptian wheat,
which, when "full and good," is remarkable in size (a single seed
sprouting into seven, ten, or fourteen stalks) and each stalk bearing an
ear.

[Genesis 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 41:23</span></span>

blasted with the east wind--destructive everywhere to grain, but
particularly so in Egypt; where, sweeping over the sandy deserts of
Arabia, it comes in the character of a hot, blighting wind, that quickly
withers all vegetation (compare [Eze
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012.md); [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015).md).

[Genesis 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 41:24</span></span>

the thin ears devoured the seven good ears--devoured is a different word
from that used in [Gen 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#004.md) and
conveys the idea of destroying, by absorbing to themselves all the
nutritious virtue of the soil around them.

[Genesis 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 41:25</span></span>

JOSEPH INTERPRETS PHARAOH'S DREAMS. ([Gen
41:25-36](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025).md)

Joseph said, . . . The dream . . . is one--They both pointed to the same
event--a remarkable dispensation of seven years of unexampled abundance,
to be followed by a similar period of unparalleled dearth. The
repetition of the dream in two different forms was designed to show the
absolute certainty and speedy arrival of this public crisis; the
interpretation was accompanied by several suggestions of practical
wisdom for meeting so great an emergency as was impending.

[Genesis 41:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 41:33</span></span>

Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man--The explanation given, when
the key to the dreams was supplied, appears to have been satisfactory to
the king and his courtiers; and we may suppose that much and anxious
conversation arose, in the course of which Joseph might have been asked
whether he had anything further to say. No doubt the providence of God
provided the opportunity of his suggesting what was necessary.

[Genesis 41:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 41:34</span></span>

and let him appoint officers over the land--overseers, equivalent to the
beys of modern Egypt.

take up the fifth part of the land--that is, of the land's produce, to
be purchased and stored by the government, instead of being sold to
foreign corn merchants.

[Genesis 41:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">gen 41:38</span></span>

JOSEPH MADE RULER OF EGYPT. (Gen. 41:37-57)

Pharaoh said unto his servants--The kings of ancient Egypt were assisted
in the management of state affairs by the advice of the most
distinguished members of the priestly order; and, accordingly, before
admitting Joseph to the new and extraordinary office that was to be
created, those ministers were consulted as to the expediency and
propriety of the appointment.

a man in whom the Spirit of God is--An acknowledgment of the being and
power of the true God, though faint and feeble, continued to linger
amongst the higher classes long after idolatry had come to prevail.

[Genesis 41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 41:40</span></span>

Thou shalt be over my house--This sudden change in the condition of a
man who had just been taken out of prison could take place nowhere,
except in Egypt. In ancient as well as modern times, slaves have often
risen to be its rulers. But the special providence of God had determined
to make Joseph governor of Egypt; and the way was paved for it by the
deep and universal conviction produced in the minds both of the king and
his councillors, that a divine spirit animated his mind and had given
him such extraordinary knowledge.

according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled--literally, "kiss."
This refers to the edict granting official power to Joseph, to be issued
in the form of a firman, as in all Oriental countries; and all who
should receive that order would kiss it, according to the usual Eastern
mode of acknowledging obedience and respect for the sovereign
\[WILKINSON\].

[Genesis 41:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">gen 41:41</span></span>

Pharaoh said, . . . See, I have set thee over all the land--These words
were preliminary to investiture with the insignia of office, which were
these: the signet-ring, used for signing public documents, and its
impression was more valid than the sign-manual of the king; the khelaat
or dress of honor, a coat of finely wrought linen, or rather cotton,
worn only by the highest personages; the gold necklace, a badge of rank,
the plain or ornamental form of it indicating the degree of rank and
dignity; the privilege of riding in a state carriage, the second
chariot; and lastly--

[Genesis 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 41:43</span></span>

they cried before him, Bow the knee--abrech, an Egyptian term, not
referring to prostration, but signifying, according to some, "father"
(compare [Gen 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#008).md); according to
others, "native prince"--that is, proclaimed him naturalized, in order
to remove all popular dislike to him as a foreigner.

[Genesis 41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">gen 41:44</span></span>

These ceremonies of investiture were closed in usual form by the king in
council solemnly ratifying the appointment.

I am Pharaoh, and without thee, &c.--a proverbial mode of expression for
great power.

[Genesis 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">gen 41:45</span></span>

Zaphnath-paaneah--variously interpreted, "revealer of secrets"; "saviour
of the land"; and from the hieroglyphics, "a wise man fleeing from
pollution"--that is, adultery.

gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of--His naturalization was
completed by this alliance with a family of high distinction. On being
founded by an Arab colony, Poti-pherah, like Jethro, priest of Midian,
might be a worshipper of the true God; and thus Joseph, a pious man,
will be freed from the charge of marrying an idolatress for worldly
ends.

On--called Aven ([Eze 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017).md) and also
Beth-shemesh ([Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013).md). In looking
at this profusion of honors heaped suddenly upon Joseph, it cannot be
doubted that he would humbly yet thankfully acknowledge the hand of a
special Providence in conducting him through all his checkered course to
almost royal power; and we, who know more than Joseph did, cannot only
see that his advancement was subservient to the most important purposes
relative to the Church of God, but learn the great lesson that a
Providence directs the minutest events of human life.

[Genesis 41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">gen 41:46</span></span>

Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh--seventeen when
brought into Egypt, probably three in prison, and thirteen in the
service of Potiphar.

went out . . . all the land--made an immediate survey to determine the
site and size of the storehouses required for the different quarters of
the country.

[Genesis 41:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">gen 41:47</span></span>

the earth brought forth by handfuls--a singular expression, alluding not
only to the luxuriance of the crop, but the practice of the reapers
grasping the ears, which alone were cut.

[Genesis 41:48](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">gen 41:48</span></span>

he gathered up all the food of the seven years--It gives a striking idea
of the exuberant fertility of this land, that, from the superabundance
of the seven plenteous years, corn enough was laid up for the
subsistence, not only of its home population, but of the neighboring
countries, during the seven years of dearth.

[Genesis 41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 41:50</span></span>

unto Joseph were born two sons--These domestic events, which increased
his temporal happiness, develop the piety of his character in the names
conferred upon his children.

[Genesis 41:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 41:53</span></span>

The seven years of plenteousness . . . ended--Over and above the
proportion purchased for the government during the years of plenty, the
people could still have husbanded much for future use. But improvident
as men commonly are in the time of prosperity, they found themselves in
want, and would have starved by thousands had not Joseph anticipated and
provided for the protracted calamity.

[Genesis 41:57](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">gen 41:57</span></span>

The famine was sore in all lands--that is, the lands contiguous to
Egypt--Canaan, Syria, and Arabia.
