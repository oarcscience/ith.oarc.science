### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

CAPTIVITY OF ZEDEKIAH AND THE PEOPLE FORETOLD FOR THEIR DISOBEDIENCE AND
PERFIDY. (Jer. 34:1-22)

Jerusalem and . . . all the cities thereof--(see on [Jer
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#015)). It was amazing blindness in
the king, that, in such a desperate position, he should reject
admonition.

[Jeremiah 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 34:3</span></span>

([Jer 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 34:4</span></span>

Mitigation of Zedekiah's punishment.

[Jeremiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 34:5</span></span>

the burnings of thy fathers--Thy funeral shall be honored with the same
burning of aromatic spices as there was at the funerals of thy fathers
([Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014); [Ch2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019)). The honors here mentioned were
denied to Jehoiakim ([Jer 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)).

Ah, lord!--The Hebrews in their chronology (Sederolam) mention the
wailing used over him, "Alas! King Zedekiah is dead, drinking the dregs
(that is, paying the penalty for the sins) of former ages."

[Jeremiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 34:7</span></span>

these . . . retained--alone (compare [Ch2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005), [Ch2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

By the law a Hebrew, after having been a bond-servant for six years, on
the seventh was to be let go free ([Exo
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022); [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012)).

Zedekiah made a covenant--with solemn ceremonial in the temple ([Jer
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015), [Jer
34:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018)).

them--bond-servants ([Jer 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 34:9</span></span>

none . . . serve himself of a Jew-- ([Lev
25:39-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039)).

[Jeremiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 34:11</span></span>

During the interruption of the siege by Pharaoh-hophra (compare [Jer
34:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021), with [Jer
37:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005)), the Jews reduced their
servants to bondage again.

[Jeremiah 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 34:13</span></span>

The last year of Zedekiah was the sabbatical year. How just the
retribution, that they who, against God's law and their own covenant,
enslaved their brethren, should be doomed to bondage themselves: and
that the bond-servants should enjoy the sabbatical freedom at the hands
of the foe ([Jer 52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016)) which their
own countrymen denied them!

[Jeremiah 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 34:14</span></span>

At the end of seven years--that is, not on the eighth year, but within
the limit of the seventh year, not later than the end of the seventh
year ([Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002); [Exo
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010); [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012)). So "at the end of three years"
([Deu 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028); [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010)), and "after three days, I will
rise again" ([Mat 27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063)), that is, on
the third day (compare [Mat 27:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#064)).

[Jeremiah 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 34:15</span></span>

in the house . . . called by my name--the usual place of making such
covenants ([Kg2 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003); compare [Kg1
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031); [Neh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029)).

[Jeremiah 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 34:16</span></span>

polluted my name--by violating your oath ([Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 34:17</span></span>

not . . . proclaiming liberty--Though the Jews had ostensibly
emancipated their bond-servants, they virtually did not do so by
revoking the liberty which they had granted. God looks not to outward
appearances, but to the sincere intention.

I proclaim a liberty--retribution answering to the offense ([Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002); [Mat
18:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#032); [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)). The Jews who would not give
liberty to their brethren shall themselves receive "a liberty"
calamitous to them. God will manumit them from His happy and safe
service ([Psa 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003)), which is real
"liberty" ([Psa 119:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#045); [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036); [Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)), only to pass under the terrible
bondage of other taskmasters, the "sword," &c.

to be removed--The Hebrew expresses agitation (see on [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004)). Compare [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025), [Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048), [Deu
28:64-65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064), as to the restless agitation
of the Jews in their ceaseless removals from place to place in their
dispersion.

[Jeremiah 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 34:18</span></span>

passed between the parts thereof--The contracting parties in the
"covenant" (not here the law in general, but their covenant made before
God in His house to emancipate their slaves, [Jer
34:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008)) passed through the parts of
the animal cut in two, implying that they prayed so to be cut in sunder
([Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051); Greek, "cut in two") if
they should break the covenant ([Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010), [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017)).

[Jeremiah 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 34:20</span></span>

I will even give--resuming the sentence begun, but not completed ([Jer
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018)), "I will give," &c.

seek their life--implacably: satisfied with nothing short of their
blood; not content with booty.

dead bodies--The breakers of the covenant shall be cut in pieces, as the
calf between whose parts they passed.

[Jeremiah 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 34:21</span></span>

gone up--that is, raised the siege in order to meet Pharaoh-hophra ([Jer
37:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007)). The departure of the
Chaldeans was a kind of manumission of the Jews; but as their
manumission of their bond-servants was recalled, so God revoked His
manumission of them from the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 34:22</span></span>

I will command--Nebuchadnezzar, impelled unconsciously by a divine
instigation, returned on the withdrawal of the Egyptians.

By the obedience of the Rechabites to their father, Jeremiah condemns
the disobedience of the Jews to God their Father. The Holy Spirit has
arranged Jeremiah's prophecies by the moral rather than the
chronological connection. From the history of an event fifteen years
before, the Jews, who had brought back their manumitted servants into
bondage, are taught how much God loves and rewards obedience, and hates
and punishes disobedience.
