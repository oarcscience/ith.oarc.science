### [Job Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md)

[Job 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 32:1</span></span>

SPEECH OF ELIHU. (Job 32:1-37:24)

Prose (poetry begins with "I am young").

because, &c.--and because they could not prove to him that he was
unrighteous.

[Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 32:2</span></span>

Elihu--meaning "God is Jehovah." In his name and character as messenger
between God and Job, he foreshadows Jesus Christ ([Job
33:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md).

Barachel--meaning "God blesses." Both names indicate the piety of the
family and their separation from idolaters.

Buzite--Buz was son of Nahor, brother of Abraham. Hence was named a
region in Arabia-Deserta ([Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023).md).

Ram--Aram, nephew of Buz. Job was probably of an older generation than
Elihu. However, the identity of names does not necessarily prove the
identity of persons. The particularity with which Elihu's descent is
given, as contrasted with the others, led LIGHTFOOT to infer Elihu was
the author of the book. But the reason for particularity was, probably,
that Elihu was less known than the three called "friends" of Job; and
that it was right for the poet to mark especially him who was mainly to
solve the problem of the book.

rather than God--that is, was more eager to vindicate himself than God.
In [Job 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md), Job denies that man can
be more just than God. UMBREIT translates, "Before (in the presence of)
God."

[Job 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 32:3</span></span>

Though silenced in argument, they held their opinion still.

[Job 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 32:4</span></span>

had spoken--Hebrew, "in words," referring rather to his own "words" of
reply, which he had long ago ready, but kept back in deference to the
seniority of the friends who spoke.

[Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 32:6</span></span>

was afraid--The root meaning in Hebrew is "to crawl" ([Deu
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024).md).

[Job 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 32:7</span></span>

Days--that is, the aged ([Job 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010).md).

[Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 32:8</span></span>

Elihu claims inspiration, as a divinely commissioned messenger to Job
([Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006.md), [Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md); and that claim is not
contradicted in [Job 42:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#004.md).
Translate: "But the spirit (which God puts) in man, and the inspiration
. . . is that which giveth," &c.; it is not mere "years" which give
understanding ([Pro 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md); [Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022).md).

[Job 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 32:9</span></span>

Great--rather, "old" ([Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006).md). So
Hebrew, in [Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md). "Greater, less"
for the older, the younger.

judgment--what is right.

[Job 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 32:10</span></span>

Rather, "I say."

opinion--rather, "knowledge."

[Job 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 32:11</span></span>

Therefore Elihu was present from the first.

reasons--literally, "understandings," that is, the meaning intended by
words.

whilst--I waited until you should discover a suitable reply to Job.

[Job 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 32:13</span></span>

This has been so ordered, "lest you should" pride yourselves on having
overcome him by your "wisdom" ([Jer
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md), the great aim of the Book of
Job); and that you may see, "God alone can thrust him down," that is,
confute him, "not man." So Elihu grounds his confutation, not on the
maxims of sages, as the friends did, but on his special commission from
God ([Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md), [Job
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006).md).

[Job 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 32:14</span></span>

I am altogether unprejudiced. For it is not I, whom he addressed. "Your
speeches" have been influenced by irritation.

[Job 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 32:15</span></span>

Here Elihu turns from the friends to Job: and so passes from the second
person to the third; a transition frequent in a rebuke ([Job
18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#003).md).

they left off--Words were taken from them.

[Job 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 32:17</span></span>

my part--for my part.

opinion--knowledge.

[Job 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 32:18</span></span>

"I am full of words," whereas the friends have not a word more to say.

the spirit-- ([Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Job
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004.md); [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md); [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005).md).

[Job 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 32:19</span></span>

belly--bosom: from which the words of Orientalists in speaking seem to
come more than with us; they speak gutturally. "Like (new) wine (in
fermentation) without a vent," to work itself off. New wine is kept in
new goatskin bottles. This fittingly applies to the young Elihu, as
contrasted with the old friends ([Mat
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#007).md).

[Job 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 32:20</span></span>

refreshed--literally, "that there may be air to me" ([Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023).md).

[Job 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 32:21</span></span>

"May I never accept," &c. Elihu alludes to Job's words ([Job
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md), [Job
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#010).md), wherein he complains that the
friends plead for God partially, "accepting His person." Elihu says he
will not do so, but will act impartially between God and Job. "And I
will not give flattery," &c. ([Pro
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023).md).

[Job 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 32:22</span></span>

take me away--as a punishment ([Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024).md).
