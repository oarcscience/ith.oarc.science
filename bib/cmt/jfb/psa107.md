### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001)

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

Although the general theme of this Psalm may have been suggested by
God's special favor to the Israelites in their restoration from
captivity, it must be regarded as an instructive celebration of God's
praise for His merciful providence to all men in their various
emergencies. Of these several are given--captivity and bondage,
wanderings by land and sea, and famine; some as evidences of God's
displeasure, and all the deliverances as evidence of His goodness and
mercy to them who humbly seek Him. (Psa. 107:1-43)

This call for thankful praise is the burden or chorus (compare [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008), [Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015), &c.).

Babylonian empire.

114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003)), which was on the south.

[Psalms 107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 107:4</span></span>

A graphic picture is given of the sufferings of those who from distant
lands returned to Jerusalem; or,

[Psalms 107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 107:5</span></span>

fainted--was overwhelmed ([Psa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#003);
[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003)).

[Psalms 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 107:8</span></span>

To the chorus is added, as a reason for praise, an example of the
extreme distress from which they had been delivered--extreme hunger, the
severest privation of a journey in the desert.

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

Their sufferings were for their rebellion against ([Psa
105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028)) the words, or purposes, or
promises, of God for their benefit. When humbled they cry to God, who
delivers them from bondage, described as a dark dungeon with doors and
bars of metal, in which they are bound in iron--that is, chains and
fetters.

23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004)).

Whether the same or not, this exigency illustrates that dispensation of
God according to which sin brings its own punishment.

disease, denoted by loathing of food, and drawing

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 107:20</span></span>

sent his word--that is, put forth His power.

their destructions--that is, that which threatened them. To the chorus
is added the mode of giving thanks, by a sacrifice and joyful singing
([Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)).

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 107:24</span></span>

These see . . . deep--illustrated both by the storm He raises and the
calm He makes with a word ([Psa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009)).

waves thereof--literally, "His waves" (God's, [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007)).

and teaching.

[Psalms 107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 107:33</span></span>

He turneth rivers into a wilderness, &c.--God's providence is
illustriously displayed in His influence on two great elements of human
prosperity, the earth's productiveness and the powers of government. He
punishes the wicked by destroying the sources of fertility, or, in
mercy, gives fruitfulness to deserts, which become the homes of a busy
and successful agricultural population. By a permitted misrule and
tyranny, this scene of prosperity is changed to one of adversity. He
rules rulers, setting up one and putting down another.

[Psalms 107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 107:40</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 107:42</span></span>

In this providential government, good men will rejoice, and the cavils
of the wicked will be stopped ([Job
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015)), and all who take right views
will appreciate God's unfailing mercy and unbounded love.
