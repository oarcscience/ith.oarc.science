### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 36:1</span></span>

THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE INHERITANCE. ([Num
36:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001).md)

the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead--Being the
tribal governors in Manasseh, they consulted Moses on a case that
affected the public honor and interests of their tribe. It related once
more to the daughters of Zelophehad. Formerly they had applied, at their
own instance, to be recognized, for want of male heirs in their family,
as entitled to inherit their father's property \[[Num
27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md)\]; now the application was
made on behalf of the tribe to which they belonged--that steps might be
taken to prevent the alienation of their patrimony by their alliance
with husbands of another tribe. The unrestricted marriages of daughters
in such circumstances threatened seriously to affect the tenure of land
in Israel, as their inheritance would go to their children, who, by the
father's side, would belong to another tribe, and thus lead, through a
complication of interests and the confusion of families, to an evil for
which even the Jubilee could not afford a remedy. \[See on [Lev
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013.md)\].

[Numbers 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 36:5</span></span>

Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the
Lord--The plea appeared just and reasonable; and, accordingly an
enactment was made by which the daughters of Zelophehad, while left to
the free choice of their husbands, were restricted to marry not only
within their own tribe, but within the family of their father's
tribe--that is, one of their cousins. This restriction, however, was
imposed only on those who were heiresses. The law was not applicable to
daughters in different circumstances ([Ch1
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#022).md) --for they might marry into
another tribe; but if they did so, they were liable to forfeit their
patrimonial inheritance, which, on the death of their father or
brothers, went to the nearest of the family kinsmen. Here was an
instance of progressive legislation (see also [Exo
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027).md) in Israel, the enactments made
being suggested by circumstances. But it is deserving of special notice
that those additions to, or modifications of, the law were confined to
civil affairs; while the slightest change was inadmissible in the laws
relating to worship or the maintenance of religion.

[Numbers 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 36:13</span></span>

These are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded
by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of
Moab--The Israelitish encampment was on an extensive plateau north of
the Arnon, which, though wrested from the Moabites by Sihon and Og,
still retained the name of its original possessors. The particular site,
as indicated by the words "Jordan near Jericho," is now called
El-Koura--a large plain lying not far from Nebo, between the Arnon and a
small tributary stream, the Wael \[BURCKHARDT\]. It was a desert plain
on the eastern bank, and marked only by groves of the wild, thorny
acacia tree.
