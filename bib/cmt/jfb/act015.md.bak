### [Acts Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md)

[Acts 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 15:1</span></span>

COUNCIL AT JERUSALEM TO DECIDE ON THE NECESSITY OF CIRCUMCISION FOR THE
GENTILE CONVERTS. (Acts 15:1-35)

certain men--See the description of them in [Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004.md).

[Acts 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 15:2</span></span>

Paul and Barnabas--now the recognized heads of the Church at Antioch.

had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined--that
is, the church did.

that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them--Titus was one ([Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001).md); probably as an uncircumcised
Gentile convert endowed with the gifts of the Spirit. He is not
mentioned in the Acts, but only in Second Corinthians, Galatians, Second
Timothy, and the Epistle addressed to him \[ALFORD\].

should go up to Jerusalem . . . about this question--That such a
deputation should be formally despatched by the Church of Antioch was
natural, as it might be called the mother church of Gentile
Christianity.

[Acts 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 15:3</span></span>

being brought on their way by the church--a kind of official escort.

they passed through Phenice--(See on [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019).md).

and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and they caused
great joy to the brethren--As the converts in those parts were Jewish
([Act 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019).md), their spirit contrasts
favorably with that of others of their nation.

[Acts 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 15:4</span></span>

And when they were come to Jerusalem--This was Paul's THIRD VISIT TO
JERUSALEM after his conversion, and on this occasion took place what is
related in [Gal 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001). (See there.md).

were received of the church, and the apostles and elders--evidently at a
meeting formally convened for this purpose: the deputation being one so
influential, and from a church of such note.

they declared all things that God had done with them--(See on [Act
14:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014).md).

[Acts 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 15:6</span></span>

the apostles and elders came together to consider of this--but in
presence, as would seem, of the people ([Act
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md), [Act
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022).md).

[Acts 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 15:7</span></span>

Peter, &c.--This is the last mention of him in the Acts, and one worthy
of his standing, as formally pronouncing, from the divine decision of
the matter already in his own case, in favor of the views which all of
Paul's labors were devoted to establishing.

a good while ago--probably about fifteen years before this.

made choice . . . that the Gentiles by my mouth--(See on [Act
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#021).md).

[Acts 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 15:8</span></span>

God, which knoweth the hearts--implying that the real question for
admission to full standing in the visible Church is the state of the
heart. Hence, though that cannot be known by men, no principle of
admission to church privileges which reverses this can be sound.

[Acts 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 15:9</span></span>

put no difference between us and them: purifying their hearts by
faith--"Purification" here refers to "sprinkling (of the conscience by
the blood of Jesus) from dead works to serve the living God." (See on
[Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011).md). How rich is this brief
description of the inward revolution wrought upon the genuine disciples
of the Lord Jesus!

[Acts 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 15:10</span></span>

why tempt--"try," "provoke"

ye God--by standing in the way of His declared purpose.

to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, &c.--He that was
circumcised became thereby bound to keep the whole law. (See [Gal
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).md). It was not then the mere yoke
of burdensome ceremonies, but of an obligation which the more earnest
and spiritual men became, the more impossible they felt it to fulfil.
(See [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md); [Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004), &c..md).

[Acts 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 15:11</span></span>

through the grace of the Lord Jesus--that is, by that only.

we shall be saved, even as they--circumcision in our case being no
advantage, and in their case uncircumcision no loss; but grace doing all
for both, and the same for each.

[Acts 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 15:12</span></span>

Then all . . . gave audience to Barnabas and Paul--On this order of the
names here, see on [Act 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025.md).

declaring what miracles and signs God wrought among the Gentiles by
them--This detail of facts, immediately following up those which Peter
had recalled to mind, would lead all who waited only for divine teaching
to see that God had Himself pronounced the Gentile converts to be
disciples in as full standing as the Jews, without circumcision; and the
attesting miracles to which Paul here refers would tend, in such an
assembly to silence opposition.

[Acts 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 15:13</span></span>

James answered, saying, &c.--Whoever this James was (see on [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md), he was the acknowledged head of
the church at Jerusalem, and here, as president of the assembly, speaks
last, winding up the debate. His decision, though given as his own
judgment only, could not be of great weight with the opposing party,
from his conservative reverence for all Jewish usages within the circle
of Israelitish Christianity.

[Acts 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 15:14</span></span>

Simeon--a Hebrew variation of Simon, as in [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001); (Greek.md), the Jewish and family
name of Peter.

hath declared how God at the first--answering to Peter's own expression
"a good while ago" ([Act 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007).md).

did visit the Gentiles to take out of them--in the exercise of His
adorable sovereignty.

a people for his name--the honor of his name, or for His glory.

[Acts 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 15:15</span></span>

to this agree the words of the prophets--generally; but those of Amos
([Amo 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md) are specified (nearly as
in the Septuagint version). The point of the passage lies in the
predicted purpose of God, under the new economy, that "the heathen" or
"Gentiles" should be "called by His name," or have "His name called upon
them." By the "building again of the fallen tabernacle of David," or
restoring its decayed splendor, is meant that only and glorious recovery
which it was to experience under David's "son and Lord."

[Acts 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 15:18</span></span>

Known unto God are all his works from the beginning--He who announced
these things so long before, and He who had now brought them to pass,
were one and the same; so that they were no novelty.

[Acts 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 15:19</span></span>

Wherefore, my sentence--or "judgment."

is, that we trouble not--with Jewish obligations.

them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God--rather, "are
turning." The work is regarded as in progress, and indeed was rapidly
advancing.

[Acts 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 15:20</span></span>

But . . . that they abstain from pollutions of idols--that is, things
polluted by having been offered in sacrifice to idols. The heathen were
accustomed to give away or sell portions of such animals. From such food
James would enjoin the Gentile converts to abstain, lest it should seem
to the Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry.

and from fornication--The characteristic sin of heathendom, unblushingly
practiced by all ranks and classes, and the indulgence of which on the
part of the Gentile converts would to Jews, whose Scriptures branded it
as an abomination of the heathen, proclaim them to be yet joined to
their old idols.

and from things strangled--which had the blood in them.

and from blood--in every form, as peremptorily forbidden to the Jews,
and the eating of which, therefore, on the part of the Gentile converts,
would shock their prejudices. See on [Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md).

[Acts 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 15:21</span></span>

For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him . . .
every sabbath day--thus keeping alive in every Jew those feelings which
such practices would shock, and which, therefore, the Gentile converts
must carefully respect if the oneness of both classes in Christ was to
be practically preserved. The wisdom of these suggestions commended
itself to all present.

[Acts 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 15:22</span></span>

Judas surnamed Barsabas--therefore not the apostle "Judas the brother of
James" ([Act 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).md), surnamed
"Thaddeus" ([Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md); nor can it be
shown that he was a brother of "Joseph called Barsabas" ([Act
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023).md). But nothing is known of him
beyond what is here said.

and Silas--the same as "Silvanus" in the Epistles. He became Paul's
companion on his second missionary journey ([Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040).md).

chief men among the brethren--selected purposely as such, to express the
honor in which they held the church at Antioch, and the deputies they
had sent to the council, and, as the matter affected all Gentile
converts, to give weight to the written decision of this important
assembly. They were "prophets," [Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md) (and see on [Act
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027).md), and as such doubtless their
eminence in the church at Jerusalem had been obtained.

[Acts 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 15:23</span></span>

And they wrote . . . by them--This is the first mention in the New
Testament history of writing as an element in its development. And the
combination here of written and oral transmission of an important
decision reminds us of the first occasion of writing mentioned in the
Old Testament, where a similar combination occurs ([Exo
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014).md). But whereas there it is the
deep difference between Israel and the Gentiles which is proclaimed,
here it is the obliteration of that difference through faith in the Lord
Jesus \[BAUMGARTEN\].

greeting--The only other place in the New Testament where this word
occurs (except in the letter of Lysias, [Act
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026).md) is [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md), which seems to show that both
letters were drawn up by the same hand \[BENGEL\].

the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia--showing that churches
then existed in Cilicia as well as Syria, which owed their existence, in
all likelihood, to Paul's labors during the interval between his return
to Tarsus ([Act 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030).md) and his
departure in company with Barnabas for Antioch (see on [Act
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025).md).

[Acts 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 15:24</span></span>

Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have
troubled you with words--without authority or even knowledge of the
church at Jerusalem, though they belonged to it, and probably pretended
to represent its views.

subverting your souls--Such strong language is evidently designed to
express indignation at this attempt, by an unauthorized party, to bring
the whole Christian Church under judicial and legal bondage.

[Acts 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 15:25</span></span>

our beloved Barnabas and Paul--Barnabas is put first here, and in [Act
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md), on account of his former
superior position in the church at Jerusalem (see [Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md); [Act
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#022).md) --an evidence this that we have
the document precisely as written, as also of the credibility of this
precious history.

[Acts 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 15:26</span></span>

Men that have hazarded--literally, "rendered up," as in will they did.

their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--Noble testimony to
those beloved men! It was doubtless prompted more immediately by the
narrative they had just listened to from their own lips ([Act
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012).md), and judiciously inserted in
this letter, to give them the highest weight as the bearers of it, along
with their own deputies.

Judas and Silas . . . shall tell you the same . . . by mouth--Mark here
how considerate and tender it was to send men who would be able to say
of Barnabas and Paul what could not be expected to come from themselves.

[Acts 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 15:28</span></span>

For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, &c.--The One, inwardly
guiding to and setting His seal on the decision come to: the other, the
external ecclesiastical authority devoutly embracing, expressing, and
conveying to the churches that decision:--a great principle this for the
Church in all time.

to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things . . . from
which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well--The whole language of
these prohibitions, and of [Act
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md), implies that they were
designed as concessions to Jewish feelings on the part of the Gentile
converts, and not as things which were all of unchanging obligation. The
only cause for hesitation arises from "fornication" being mixed up with
the other three things; which has led many to regard the whole as
permanently prohibited. But the remarks on [Act
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md) may clear this (see on [Act
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020).md). The then state of heathen
society in respect of all the four things seems the reason for so mixing
them up.

[Acts 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 15:31</span></span>

they rejoiced for the consolation--As the same word is in [Act
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031.md) properly rendered "exhorted,"
the meaning probably is "rejoiced for the exhortation" (Margin), or
advice; so wise in itself and so contrary to the imposition attempted to
be practiced upon them by the Judaizers.

[Acts 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 15:32</span></span>

Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves--that is, inspired teachers.

exhorted the brethren with many words--"much discourse."

and confirmed them--opening up, no doubt, the great principle involved
in the controversy now settled, of gratuitous salvation, or the
purification of the heart by faith alone (as expressed by Peter, [Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md), [Act
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011).md), and dwelling on the necessity
of harmony in principle and affection between the Gentile disciples and
their Jewish brethren.

[Acts 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 15:33</span></span>

were let go in peace--with peace, as the customary parting salutation.

[Acts 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 15:34</span></span>

it pleased Silas--Silas determined.

to abide there still--(The authorities against the insertion of this
verse are strong. It may have been afterwards added to explain [Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040).md). Doubtless the attraction to
Antioch for Silas was Paul's presence there, to whom he seems to have
now formed that permanent attachment which the sequel of this book and
Paul's Epistles show to have existed.

[Acts 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 15:35</span></span>

Paul . . . and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching--to the
disciples.

and preaching--to those without.

the word of the Lord, with many others--other laborers.

also--How rich must Antioch at this time have been in the ministrations
of the Gospel! (For a painful scene on this occasion between Paul and
Peter, see [Gal 2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011).md).

[Acts 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 15:36</span></span>

DISSENSION BETWEEN PAUL AND BARNABAS--THEY PART COMPANY TO PROSECUTE
SEPARATE MISSIONARY TOURS. ([Act
15:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#036).md)

And some days after--How long is a matter of conjecture.

Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren--the true
reading is, "the brethren."

in every city where we have preached . . . and see how they do--whether
they were advancing or declining, &c.: a pattern for churches and
successful missionaries in every age. ("Reader, how stands it with
thee?") \[BENGEL\]. "Paul felt that he was not called to spend a
peaceful, though laborious life at Antioch, but that his true work was
far off among the Gentiles." We notice here, for the first time, a trace
of that tender solicitude for his converts, that earnest longing to see
their faces, which appears in the letters which he wrote afterwards, as
one of the most remarkable and attractive features of his character. He
thought, doubtless, of the Pisidians and Lycaonians, as he thought
afterwards at Athens and Corinth of the Thessalonians, from whom he had
been lately "taken in presence, not in heart, night and day praying
exceedingly that he might see their face and perfect that which was
lacking in their faith" \[HOWSON\].

[Acts 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 15:37</span></span>

Barnabas determined to take with them John . . . Mark--his nephew ([Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md).

[Acts 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 15:38</span></span>

But Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from
them--that is, who had departed; but the word is stronger than
this--"who stood aloof" or "turned away" from them.

from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work--the work yet before
them. The allusion is to what is recorded in [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md) (see on [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013).md).

[Acts 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 15:39</span></span>

And the contention was so sharp between them--such was the "irritation,"
or "exacerbation."

that they departed asunder one from the other--Said they not truly to
the Lystrians that they were "men of like passions with them"; ([Act
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015)). But who was to blame? (1.md) That
John Mark had either tired of the work or shrunk from the dangers and
fatigues that yet lay before them, was undeniable; and Paul concluded
that what he had done he might, and probably would, do again. Was he
wrong in this? (See [Pro 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019).md). But
(2) To this Barnabas might reply that no rule was without exception;
that one failure, in a young Christian, was not enough to condemn him
for life; that if near relationship might be thought to warp his
judgment, it also gave him opportunities of knowing the man better than
others; and that as he was himself anxious to be allowed another trial
(and the result makes this next to certain), in order that he might wipe
out the effect of his former failure and show what "hardness he could
now endure as a good soldier of Jesus Christ," his petition ought not to
be rejected. Now, since John Mark did retrieve his character in these
respects, and a reconciliation took place between Paul and him, so
cordial that the apostle expresses more than once the confidence he had
in him and the value he set upon his services ([Col
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011).md), it may seem that events showed
Barnabas to be in the right, and Paul too harsh and hasty in his
judgment. But, in behalf of Paul, it may well be answered, that not
being able to see into the future he had only the unfavorable past to
judge by; that the gentleness of Barnabas ([Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md); [Act
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024).md) had already laid him open to
imposition (see on [Gal 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013).md), to
which near relationship would in this case make him more liable; and
that in refusing to take John Mark on this missionary journey he was not
judging his Christian character nor pronouncing on his fitness for
future service, but merely providing in the meantime against being again
put to serious inconvenience and having their hands weakened by a
possible second desertion. On the whole, then, it seems clear that each
of these great servants of--Christ had something to say for himself, in
defense of the position which they respectively took up; that while
Barnabas was quite able to appreciate the grounds on which Paul
proceeded, Paul was not so competent to judge of the considerations
which Barnabas probably urged; that while Paul had but one object in
view, to see that the companion of their arduous work was one of
thoroughly congenial spirit and sufficient nerve, Barnabas, over and
above the same desire, might not unreasonably be afraid for the soul of
his nephew, lest the refusal to allow him to accompany them on their
journey might injure his Christian character and deprive the Church of a
true servant of Jesus Christ; and that while both sought only the glory
of their common Master, each looked at the question at issue, to some
extent, through the medium of his own temperament, which grace
sanctifies and refines, but does not destroy--Paul, through the medium
of absolute devotion to the cause and kingdom of Christ, which, warm and
womanly as his affections were, gave a tinge of lofty sternness to his
resolves where that seemed to be affected; Barnabas, through the medium
of the same singleness of heart in Christ's service, though probably not
in equal strength ([Gal 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013).md), but
also of a certain natural gentleness which, where a Christian relative
was concerned, led him to attach more weight to what seemed for his
spiritual good than Paul could be supposed to do. In these
circumstances, it seems quite possible that they might have amicably
"agreed to differ," each taking his own companion, as they actually did.
But the "paroxysm" (as the word is), the "exacerbation" which is
expressly given as the cause of their parting, shows but too plainly,
that human infirmity amidst the great labors of the Church at Antioch at
length sundered those who had sweetly and lovingly borne together the
heat and burden of the day during a protracted tour in the service of
Christ. "Therefore let no man glory in men" ([Co1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021).md). As for John Mark, although
through his uncle's warm advocacy of his cause he was put in a condition
to dissipate the cloud that hung over him, how bitter to him must have
ever afterwards been the reflection that it was his culpable conduct
which gave occasion to whatever was sinful in the strife between Paul
and Barnabas, and to a separation in action, though no doubt with a
mutual Christian regard, between those who had till then wrought nobly
together! How watchful does all this teach Christians, and especially
Christian ministers and missionaries, to be against giving way to rash
judgment and hot temper towards each other, especially where on both
sides the glory of Christ is the ground of difference! How possible is
it that in such cases both parties may, on the question at issue, be
more or less in the right! How difficult is it even for the most
faithful and devoted servants of Christ, differing as they do in their
natural temperament even under the commanding influence of grace, to see
even important questions precisely in the same light! And if, with every
disposition to yield what is unimportant, they still feel it a duty each
to stand to his own point, how careful should they be to do it lovingly,
each pursuing his own course without disparagement of his Christian
brother! And how affectingly does the Lord overrule such difference of
judgment and such manifestations of human infirmity, by making them
"turn out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel"; as in this case is
eminently seen in the two missionary parties instead of one, not
travelling over the same ground and carrying their dispute over all the
regions of their former loving labors, but dividing the field between
them!

and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; and Paul chose
Silas--(See on [Act 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#034).md) --going two
and two, as the Twelve and the Seventy ([Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md); [Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001).md).

and departed, being recommended . . . to the grace of God--(No doubt by
some solemn service; see [Act 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003).md),
as in [Act 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026.md). It does not follow
from the historian's silence that Barnabas was not so recommended, too;
for this is the last mention of Barnabas in the history, whose sole
object now is to relate the proceedings of Paul. Nor does it seem quite
fair (with DE WETTE, MEYER, HOWSON, ALFORD, HACKET, WEBSTER and
WILKINSON, &c.) to conclude from this that the Church at Antioch took
that marked way of showing their sympathy with Paul in opposition to
Barnabas.

and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches--"It is
very likely that Paul and Barnabas made a deliberate and amicable
arrangement to divide the region of their first mission between them;
Paul taking the continental, and Barnabas the insular, part of the
proposed visitation. If Barnabas visited Salamis and Paphos, and if Paul
(travelling westward), after passing through Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium,
went as far as Antioch in Pisidia, the whole circuit of the proposed
visitation was actually accomplished, for it does not appear that any
converts had been made at Perga and Attalia" \[HOWSON\]. "This second
missionary tour appears to have proceeded at first solely from the
desire of visiting the churches already planted. In the end, however, it
took a much wider sweep, for it brought the apostle to Europe"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

he went through Syria and Cilicia--(See on [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023).md). Taking probably the same route
as when despatched in haste from Jerusalem to Tarsus, he then went by
land (see on [Act 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030).md).
