### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

MARY'S VISIT TO THE SEPULCHRE, AND RETURN TO IT WITH PETER AND JOHN--HER
RISEN LORD APPEARS TO HER. (John 20:1-18)

The first day . . . cometh Mary Magdalene early, &c.--(See on [Mar
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md); and [Mat
28:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001).md).

she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom
Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of
the sepulchre--Dear disciple! thy dead Lord is to thee "the Lord" still.

[John 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 20:3</span></span>

Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came first to
the sepulchre--These particulars have a singular air of artless truth
about them. Mary, in her grief, runs to the two apostles who were soon
to be so closely associated in proclaiming the Saviour's resurrection,
and they, followed by Mary, hasten to see with their own eyes. The
younger disciple outruns the older; love haply supplying swifter wings.
He stoops, he gazes in, but enters not the open sepulchre, held back
probably by a reverential fear. The bolder Peter, coming up, goes in at
once, and is rewarded with bright evidence of what had happened.

[John 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 20:6</span></span>

seeth the linen clothes lie--lying.

And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen
clothes--not loosely, as if hastily thrown down, and indicative of a
hurried and disorderly removal.

but wrapped--folded.

together in a place by itself--showing with what grand tranquillity "the
Living One" had walked forth from "the dead" ([Luk
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005).md). "Doubtless the two attendant
angels ([Joh 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012).md) did this service
for the Rising One, the one disposing of the linen clothes, the other of
the napkin" \[BENGEL\].

[John 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 20:8</span></span>

Then went in . . . that other disciple which came first to the
sepulchre--The repetition of this, in connection with his not having
gone in till after Peter, seems to show that at the moment of penning
these words the advantage which each of these loving disciples had of
the other was present to his mind.

and he saw and believed--Probably he means, though he does not say, that
he believed in his Lord's resurrection more immediately and certainly
than Peter.

[John 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 20:9</span></span>

For as yet they knew--that is, understood.

not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead--In other words,
they believed in His resurrection at first, not because they were
prepared by Scripture to expect it; but facts carried resistless
conviction of it in the first instance to their minds, and furnished a
key to the Scripture predictions of it.

[John 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 20:11</span></span>

But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping, &c.--Brief was the stay
of those two men. But Mary, arriving perhaps by another direction after
they left, lingers at the spot, weeping for her missing Lord. As she
gazes through her tears on the open tomb, she also ventures to stoop
down and look into it, when lo! "two angels in white" (as from the world
of light, and see on [Mat 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003).md) appear
to her in a "sitting" posture, "as having finished some business, and
awaiting some one to impart tidings to" \[BENGEL\].

[John 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 20:12</span></span>

one at the head, and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had
lain--not merely proclaiming silently the entire charge they had had of
the body, of Christ \[quoted in LUTHARDT\], but rather, possibly,
calling mute attention to the narrow space within which the Lord of
glory had contracted Himself; as if they would say, Come, see within
what limits, marked off by the interval here between us two, the Lord
lay! But she is in tears, and these suit not the scene of so glorious an
Exit. They are going to point out to her the incongruity.

[John 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 20:13</span></span>

Woman, why weepest thou?--You would think the vision too much for a lone
woman. But absorbed in the one Object of her affection and pursuit, she
speaks out her grief without fear.

Because, &c.--that is, Can I choose but weep, when "they have taken
away," &c., repeating her very words to Peter and John. On this she
turned herself and saw Jesus Himself standing beside her, but took Him
for the gardener. Clad therefore in some such style He must have been.
But if any ask, as too curious interpreters do, whence He got those
habiliments, we answer \[with OLSHAUSEN and LUTHARDT\] where the two
angels got theirs. Nor did the voice of His first words disclose Him to
Mary--"Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?" He will try her ere
he tell her. She answers not the stranger's question, but comes straight
to her point with him.

[John 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 20:15</span></span>

Sir, if thou have borne him hence--borne whom? She says not. She can
think only of One, and thinks others must understand her. It reminds one
of the question of the Spouse, "Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?" ([Sol
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003).md).

tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away--Wilt thou,
dear fragile woman? But it is the language of sublime affection, that
thinks itself fit for anything if once in possession of its Object. It
is enough. Like Joseph, He can no longer restrain Himself ([Gen
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001).md).

[John 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 20:16</span></span>

Jesus saith unto her, Mary--It is not now the distant, though
respectful, "Woman." It is the oft-repeated name, uttered, no doubt,
with all the wonted manner, and bringing a rush of unutterable and
overpowering associations with it.

She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni!--But that single word of
transported recognition was not enough for woman's full heart. Not
knowing the change which had passed upon Him, she hastens to express by
her action what words failed to clothe; but she is checked.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father--Old familiarities must now give place to new and more awful yet
sweeter approaches; but for these the time has not come yet. This seems
the spirit, at least, of these mysterious words, on which much
difference of opinion has obtained, and not much that is satisfactory
said.

but go to my brethren--(Compare [Mat
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010.md); [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md), [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017).md). That He had still our Humanity,
and therefore "is not ashamed to call us brethren," is indeed grandly
evidenced by these words. But it is worthy of most reverential notice,
that we nowhere read of anyone who presumed to call Him Brother. "My
brethren: Blessed Jesus, who are these? Were they not Thy followers?
yea, Thy forsakers? How dost Thou raise these titles with Thyself! At
first they were Thy servants; then disciples; a little before Thy death,
they were Thy friends; now, after Thy resurrection, they were Thy
brethren. But oh, mercy without measure! how wilt Thou, how canst Thou
call them brethren whom, in Thy last parting, Thou foundest fugitives?
Did they not run from Thee? Did not one of them rather leave his inmost
coat behind him than not be quit of Thee? And yet Thou sayest, 'Go, tell
My brethren! It is not in the power of the sins of our infirmity to
unbrother us'" \[BISHOP HALL\].

I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your
God--words of incomparable glory! Jesus had called God habitually His
Father, and on one occasion, in His darkest moment, His God. But both
are here united, expressing that full-orbed relationship which embraces
in its vast sweep at once Himself and His redeemed. Yet, note well, He
says not, Our Father and our God. All the deepest of the Church fathers
were wont to call attention to this, as expressly designed to
distinguish between what God is to Him and to us--His Father
essentially, ours not so: our God essentially, His not so: His God only
in connection with us: our God only in connection with Him.

[John 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 20:18</span></span>

Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
and that he had spoken these things unto her--To a woman was this honor
given to be the first that saw the risen R edeemer, and that woman was
not His mother. (See on [Mar 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009).md).

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

JESUS APPEARS TO THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES. ([Joh
20:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).md)

the same day at evening, the first day of the week, the doors being shut
where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came
Jesus--plainly not by the ordinary way of entrance.

and saith unto them Peace be unto you--not the mere wish that even His
own exalted peace might be theirs ([Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027).md), but conveying it into their
hearts, even as He "opened their understandings to understand the
scriptures" ([Luk 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045).md).

[John 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 20:20</span></span>

And when he had so said, he showed them his hands and his side--not only
as ocular and tangible evidence of the reality of His resurrection (See
on [Luk 24:37-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#037).md), but as through "the
power of that resurrection" dispensing all His peace to men.

Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.

[John 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 20:21</span></span>

Then said Jesus--prepared now to listen to Him in a new character.

Peace be unto you. As my Father hath sent me, so send I you--(See on
[Joh 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018).md).

[John 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 20:22</span></span>

he breathed on them--a symbolical conveyance to them of the Spirit.

and saith, Receive ye the Holy Ghost--an earnest and first-fruits of the
more copious Pentecostal effusion.

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, &c.--In any
literal and authoritative sense this power was never exercised by one of
the apostles, and plainly was never understood by themselves as
possessed by them or conveyed to them. (See on [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019).md). The power to intrude upon the
relation between men and God cannot have been given by Christ to His
ministers in any but a ministerial or declarative sense--as the
authorized interpreters of His word, while in the actings of His
ministers, the real nature of the power committed to them is seen in the
exercise of church discipline.

[John 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 20:24</span></span>

JESUS AGAIN APPEARS TO THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES. ([Joh
20:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024).md)

But Thomas--(See on [Joh 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016).md).

was not with them when Jesus came--why, we know not, though we are loath
to think (with STIER, ALFORD and LUTHARDT) it was intentional, from
sullen despondency. The fact merely is here stated, as a loving apology
for his slowness of belief.

[John 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 20:25</span></span>

We have seen the Lord--This way of speaking of Jesus (as [Joh
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020.md) and [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007).md), so suited to His
resurrection-state, was soon to become the prevailing style.

Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my linger into
the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
believe--The very form of this speech betokens the strength of the
unbelief. "It is not, If I shall see I shall believe, but, Unless I
shall see I will not believe; nor does he expect to see, although the
others tell him they had" \[BENGEL\]. How Christ Himself viewed this
state of mind, we know from [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md), "He upbraided them with their
unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had
seen Him after He was risen." But whence sprang this pertinacity of
resistance in such minds? Not certainly from reluctance to believe, but
as in Nathanael (see on [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046).md)
from mere dread of mistake in so vital a matter.

[John 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 20:26</span></span>

And after eight days--that is, on the eighth, or first day of the
preceding week. They probably met every day during the preceding week,
but their Lord designedly reserved His second appearance among them till
the recurrence of His resurrection day, that He might thus inaugurate
the delightful sanctities of THE LORD'S DAY ([Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010).md).

disciples were within, and Thomas with them . . . Jesus . . . stood in
the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

[John 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 20:27</span></span>

Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither . . . behold . . . put it into my
side, and be not faithless, but believing--"There is something
rhythmical in these words, and they are purposely couched in the words
of Thomas himself, to put him to shame" \[LUTHARDT\]. But wish what
condescension and gentleness is this done!

[John 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 20:28</span></span>

Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God--That Thomas did
not do what Jesus invited him to do, and what he had made the condition
of his believing, seems plain from [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md) ("Because thou hast seen Me,
thou hast believed"). He is overpowered, and the glory of Christ now
breaks upon him in a flood. His exclamation surpasses all that had been
yet uttered, nor can it be surpassed by anything that ever will be
uttered in earth or heaven. On the striking parallel in Nathanael, see
on [Joh 1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049.md). The Socinian invasion of
the supreme divinity of Christ here manifestly taught--as if it were a
mere call upon God in a fit of astonishment--is beneath notice, save for
the profanity it charges upon this disciple, and the straits to which it
shows themselves reduced.

[John 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 20:29</span></span>

because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed--words of measured
commendation, but of indirect and doubtless painfully--felt rebuke: that
is, 'Thou hast indeed believed; it is well: it is only on the evidence
of thy senses, and after peremptorily refusing all evidence short of
that.'

blessed they that have not seen, and yet have believed--"Wonderful
indeed and rich in blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this
closing word of the Gospel" \[ALFORD\].

[John 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 20:30</span></span>

FIRST CLOSE OF THIS GOSPEL. ([Joh
20:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030).md)

many other signs--miracles.

[John 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 20:31</span></span>

But these are written--as sufficient specimens.

personal, title.

6:51-54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051).md).
