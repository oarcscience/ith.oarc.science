### [Revelation Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 9:1</span></span>

THE FIFTH TRUMPET: THE FALLEN STAR OPENS THE ABYSS WHENCE ISSUE LOCUSTS.
THE SIXTH TRUMPET. FOUR ANGELS AT THE EUPHRATES LOOSED. (Rev. 9:1-21)

The last three trumpets of the seven are called, from [Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013.md), the woe-trumpets.

fall--rather as Greek, "fallen." When John saw it, it was not in the act
of falling, but had fallen already. This is a connecting link of this
fifth trumpet with [Rev 12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008.md), [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md), "Woe to the inhabiters of the
earth, for the devil is come down," &c. Compare [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md), "How art thou fallen from
heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning!"

the bottomless pit--Greek, "the pit of the abyss"; the orifice of the
hell where Satan and his demons dwell.

[Revelation 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 9:3</span></span>

upon--Greek, "unto," or "into."

as the scorpions of the earth--as contrasted with the "locusts" which
come up from hell, and are not "of the earth."

have power--namely, to sting.

[Revelation 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 9:4</span></span>

not hurt the grass . . . neither . . . green thing . . . neither . . .
tree--the food on which they ordinarily prey. Therefore, not natural and
ordinary locusts. Their natural instinct is supernaturally restrained to
mark the judgment as altogether divine.

those men which--Greek, "the men whosoever."

in, &c.--Greek, "upon their forehead." Thus this fifth trumpet is proved
to follow the sealing in [Rev 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md),
under the sixth seal. None of the saints are hurt by these locusts,
which is not true of the saints in Mohammed's attack, who is supposed by
many to be meant by the locusts; for many true believers fell in the
Mohammedan invasions of Christendom.

[Revelation 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 9:5</span></span>

they . . . they--The subject changes: the first "they" is the locusts;
the second is the unsealed.

five months--the ordinary time in the year during which locusts continue
their ravages.

their torment--the torment of the sufferers. This fifth verse and [Rev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006.md) cannot refer to an invading army.
For an army would kill, and not merely torment.

[Revelation 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 9:6</span></span>

shall desire--Greek, "eagerly desire"; set their mind on.

shall flee--So B, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read. But A and Aleph
read, "fleeth," namely continually. In [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md), which is at a later stage of
God's judgments, the ungodly seek annihilation, not from the torment of
their suffering, but from fear of the face of the Lamb before whom they
have to stand.

[Revelation 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 9:7</span></span>

prepared unto battle--Greek, "made ready unto war." Compare Note, see on
[Joe 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md), where the resemblance of
locusts to horses is traced: the plates of a horse armed for battle are
an image on a larger scale of the outer shell of the locust.

crowns-- ([Nah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017).md). ELLIOTT explains
this of the turbans of Mohammedans. But how could turbans be "like
gold?" ALFORD understands it of the head of the locusts actually ending
in a crown-shaped fillet which resembled gold in its material.

as the faces of men--The "as" seems to imply the locusts here do not
mean men. At the same time they are not natural locusts, for these do
not sting men ([Rev 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#005).md). They must be
supernatural.

[Revelation 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 9:8</span></span>

hair of women--long and flowing. An Arabic proverb compares the antlers
of locusts to the hair of girls. EWALD in ALFORD understands the
allusion to be to the hair on the legs or bodies of the locusts: compare
"rough caterpillars," [Jer 51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md).

as the teeth of lions-- ([Joe 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md), as
to locusts).

[Revelation 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 9:9</span></span>

as it were breastplates of iron--not such as forms the thorax of the
natural locust.

as . . . chariots-- ([Joe 2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005).md).

battle--Greek, "war."

[Revelation 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 9:10</span></span>

tails like unto scorpions--like unto the tails of scorpions.

and there were stings--There is no oldest manuscript for this reading.
A, B, Aleph, Syriac, and Coptic read, "and (they have) stings: and in
their tails (is) their power (literally, 'authority': authorized power)
to hurt."

[Revelation 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 9:11</span></span>

And--so Syriac. But A, B, and Aleph, omit "and."

had--Greek, "have."

a king . . . which is the angel--English Version, agreeing with A,
Aleph, reads the (Greek) article before "angel," in which reading we
must translate, "They have as king over them the angel," &c. Satan
(compare [Rev 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001).md). Omitting the
article with B, we must translate, "They have as king an angel," &c.:
one of the chief demons under Satan: I prefer from [Rev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md), the former.

bottomless pit--Greek, "abyss."

Abaddon--that is, perdition or destruction ([Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md); [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020).md). The locusts are supernatural
instruments in the hands of Satan to torment, and yet not kill, the
ungodly, under this fifth trumpet. Just as in the case of godly Job,
Satan was allowed to torment with elephantiasis, but not to touch his
life. In [Rev 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md), these two
woe-trumpets are expressly called "plagues." ANDREAS OF CÃ†SAREA, A.D.
500, held, in his Commentary on Revelation, that the locusts mean evil
spirits again permitted to come forth on earth and afflict men with
various plagues.

[Revelation 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 9:12</span></span>

Greek, "The one woe."

hereafter--Greek, "after these things." I agree with ALFORD and DE
BURGH, that these locusts from the abyss refer to judgments about to
fall on the ungodly immediately before Christ's second advent. None of
the interpretations which regard them as past, are satisfactory. [Joe
1:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md); [Joe
2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), is strictly parallel and
expressly refers ([Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011).md) to THE
DAY OF THE LORD GREAT AND VERY TERRIBLE: [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md) gives the portents accompanying
the day of the Lord's coming, the earth quaking, the heavens trembling,
the sun, moon, and stars, withdrawing their shining: [Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md), [Joe
2:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md), also point to the immediately
succeeding deliverance of Jerusalem: compare also, the previous last
conflict in the valley of Jehoshaphat, and the dwelling of God
thenceforth in Zion, blessing Judah. DE BURGH confines the locust
judgment to the Israelite land, even as the sealed in [Rev
7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md) are Israelites: not that there
are not others sealed as elect in the earth; but that, the judgment
being confined to Palestine, the sealed of Israel alone needed to be
expressly excepted from the visitation. Therefore, he translates
throughout, "the land" (that is, of Israel and Judah), instead of "the
earth." I incline to agree with him.

[Revelation 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 9:13</span></span>

a voice--literally, "one voice."

from--Greek, "out of."

the four horns--A, Vulgate (Amiatinus manuscript), Coptic, and Syriac
omit "four." B and CYPRIAN support it. The four horns together gave
forth their voice, not diverse, but one. God's revelation (for example,
the Gospel), though in its aspects fourfold (four expressing world-wide
extension: whence four is the number of the Evangelists), still has but
one and the same voice. However, from the parallelism of this sixth
trumpet to the fifth seal ([Rev
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009).md), the martyrs' cry for the
avenging of their blood from the altar reaching its consummation under
the sixth seal and sixth trumpet, I prefer understanding this cry from
the four corners of the altar to refer to the saints' prayerful cry from
the four quarters of the world, incensed by the angel, and ascending to
God from the golden altar of incense, and bringing down in consequence
fiery judgments. Aleph omits the whole clause, "one from the four
horns."

[Revelation 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 9:14</span></span>

in, &c.--Greek, "epi to potamo"; "on," or "at the great river."

Euphrates--(Compare [Rev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012).md). The
river whereat Babylon, the ancient foe of God's people was situated.
Again, whether from the literal region of the Euphrates, or from the
spiritual Babylon (the apostate Church, especially ROME), four angelic
ministers of God's judgments shall go forth, assembling an army of
horsemen throughout the four quarters of the earth, to slay a third of
men, the brunt of the visitation shall be on Palestine.

[Revelation 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 9:15</span></span>

were--"which had been prepared" \[TREGELLES rightly\].

for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year--rather as Greek, "for
(that is, against) THE hour, and day, and month, and year," namely,
appointed by God. The Greek article (teen), put once only before all the
periods, implies that the hour in the day, and the day in the month, and
the month in the year, and the year itself, had been definitely fixed by
God. The article would have been omitted had a sum-total of periods been
specified, namely, three hundred ninety-one years and one month (the
period from A.D. 1281, when the Turks first conquered the Christians, to
1672, their last conquest of them, since which last date their empire
has declined).

slay--not merely to "hurt" ([Rev
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#010).md), as in the fifth trumpet.

third part--(See on [Rev 8:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007).md).

of men--namely, of earthy men, [Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013.md), "inhabiters of the earth," as
distinguished from God's sealed people (of which the sealed of Israel,
[Rev 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001), form the nucleus.md).

[Revelation 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 9:16</span></span>

Compare with these two hundred million, [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md). The hosts here are evidently,
from their numbers and their appearance ([Rev
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017).md), not merely human hosts, but
probably infernal, though constrained to work out God's will (compare
[Rev 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001).md).

and I heard--A, B, Aleph, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and CYPRIAN omit
"and."

[Revelation 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 9:17</span></span>

thus--as follows.

of fire--the fiery color of the breastplates answering to the fire which
issued out of their mouths.

of jacinth--literally, "of hyacinth color," the hyacinth of the ancients
answering to our dark blue iris: thus, their dark, dull-colored
breastplates correspond to the smoke out of their mouths.

brimstone--sulphur-colored: answering to the brimstone or sulphur out of
their mouths.

[Revelation 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 9:18</span></span>

By these three--A, B, C, and Aleph read (apo for kupo), "From"; implying
the direction whence the slaughter came; not direct instrumentality as
"by" implies. A, B, C, Aleph also add "plagues" after "three." English
Version reading, which omits it, is not well supported.

by the fire--Greek, "owing to the fire," literally, "out of."

[Revelation 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 9:19</span></span>

their--A, B, C and Aleph read, "the power of the horses."

in their mouth--whence issued the fire, smoke, and brimstone ([Rev
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017).md). Many interpreters understand
the horsemen to refer to the myriads of Turkish cavalry arrayed in
scarlet, blue, and yellow (fire, hyacinth, and brimstone), the
lion-headed horses denoting their invincible courage, and the fire and
brimstone out of their mouths, the gunpowder and artillery introduced
into Europe about this time, and employed by the Turks; the tails, like
serpents, having a venomous sting, the false religion of Mohammed
supplanting Christianity, or, as ELLIOTT thinks, the Turkish pachas'
horse tails, worn as a symbol of authority. (!) All this is very
doubtful. Considering the parallelism of this sixth trumpet to the sixth
seal, the likelihood is that events are intended immediately preceding
the Lord's coming. "The false prophet" (as [Isa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#015) proves.md), or second beast, having
the horns of a lamb, but speaking as the dragon, who supports by lying
miracles the final Antichrist, seems to me to be intended. Mohammed,
doubtless, is a forerunner of him, but not the exhaustive fulfiller of
the prophecy here: Satan will, probably, towards the end, bring out all
the powers of hell for the last conflict (see on [Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md), on "devils"; compare [Rev
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md), [Rev
9:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017).md).

with them--with the serpent heads and their venomous fangs.

[Revelation 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 9:20</span></span>

the rest of the men--that is, the ungodly.

yet--So A, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic. B and Aleph read, "did not even
repent of," namely, so as to give up "the works," &c. Like Pharaoh
hardening his heart against repentance notwithstanding the plagues.

of their hands-- ([Deu 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#029).md).
Especially the idols made by their hands. Compare [Rev
13:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md), "the image of the beast"
[Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md).

that they should not--So B reads. But A, C, and Aleph read "that they
shall not": implying a prophecy of certainty that it shall be so.

devils--Greek, "demons" which lurk beneath the idols which idolaters
worship.

[Revelation 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 9:21</span></span>

sorceries--witchcrafts by means of drugs (so the Greek). One of the
fruits of the unrenewed flesh: the sin of the heathen: about to be
repeated by apostate Christians in the last days, [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md), "sorcerers." The heathen who
shall have rejected the proffered Gospel and clung to their fleshly
lusts, and apostate Christians who shall have relapsed into the same
shall share the same terrible judgments. The worship of images was
established in the East in A.D. 842.

fornication--singular: whereas the other sins are in the plural. Other
sins are perpetrated at intervals: those lacking purity of heart indulge
in one perpetual fornication \[BENGEL\].
