<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 31:2</span></span>

What, my son?--that is, What shall I say? Repetitions denote
earnestness.

son of my womb--as our phrase, "my own son," a term of special
affection.

son of my vows--as one dedicated to God; so the word "Lemuel" may mean.

[Proverbs 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 31:3</span></span>

Succinct but solemn warnings against vices to which kings are peculiarly
tempted, as carnal pleasures and oppressive and unrighteous government
are used to sustain sensual indulgence.

strength--mental and bodily resources for health and comfort.

thy ways--or course of life.

to that . . . kings--literally, "to the destroying of kings," avoid
destructive pleasures (compare [Pro
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009); [Pro
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022), [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027); [Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011)).

[Proverbs 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 31:4</span></span>

Stimulants enfeeble reason, pervert the heart, and do not suit rulers,
who need clear and steady minds, and well-governed affections (compare
[Pro 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001); [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029)).

pervert . . . afflicted--They give unrighteous decisions against the
poor.

[Proverbs 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 31:6</span></span>

The proper use of such drinks is to restore tone to feeble bodies and
depressed minds (compare [Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015)).

[Proverbs 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 31:8</span></span>

72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012); [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017)).

appointed to destruction--who are otherwise ruined by their oppressors
(compare [Pro 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#014), [Pro
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016)).

[Proverbs 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 31:10</span></span>

This exquisite picture of a truly lovely wife is conceived and drawn in
accordance with the customs of Eastern nations, but its moral teachings
suit all climes. In Hebrew the verses begin with the letters of the
Hebrew alphabet in order (compare Introduction to Poetical Books).

Who . . . woman--The question implies that such are rare, though not
entirely wanting (compare [Pro 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022);
[Pro 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014)).

virtuous--literally, "of strength," that is, moral courage (compare [Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004); [Rut
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#011)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 31:12</span></span>

do . . . good--contribute good to him.

[Proverbs 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 31:13</span></span>

Ancient women of rank thus wrought with their hands; and such, indeed,
were the customs of Western women a few centuries since. In the East
also, the fabrics were articles of merchandise.

[Proverbs 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 31:15</span></span>

[Proverbs 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 31:17</span></span>

To energy she adds a watchfulness in bargains, and a protracted and
painful industry. The last clause may figuratively denote that her
prosperity (compare [Pro 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020)) is not
short lived.

[Proverbs 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#019)

[Proverbs 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 31:20</span></span>

Industry enables her to be charitable.

[Proverbs 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#021)

a matter of taste also; the color suits cold.

[Proverbs 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 31:22</span></span>

coverings of tapestry--or, "coverlets," that is, for beds.

silk--or, "linen" (compare [Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001);
[Exo 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009))

and purple--that is, the most costly goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 31:23</span></span>

His domestic comfort promotes his advancement in public dignity.

[Proverbs 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 31:24</span></span>

fine linen--or, "linen shirts," or the material for them.

girdles--were often costly and highly valued ([Sa2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011)).

delivereth--or, "giveth as a present" or "to sell."

[Proverbs 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 31:25</span></span>

Strength and honour--Strong and beautiful is her clothing; or,
figuratively, for moral character, vigorous and honorable.

shall rejoice . . . come--in confidence of certain maintenance.

[Proverbs 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 31:26</span></span>

Her conversation is wise and gentle.

[Proverbs 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 31:27</span></span>

(Compare [Ti1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005)). She adds to her example a wise
management of those under her control.

[Proverbs 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 31:28</span></span>

[Proverbs 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 31:30</span></span>

Favour--or, "Grace" of personal manner.

beauty--of face, or form (compare [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022)). True piety alone commands
permanent respect and affection ([Pe1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003)).

[Proverbs 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 31:31</span></span>

The result of her labor is her best eulogy. Nothing can add to the
simple beauty of this admirable portrait. On the measure of its
realization in the daughters of our own day rest untold results, in the
domestic, and, therefore, the civil and religious, welfare of the
people.
