### [Job Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md)

[Job 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 31:1</span></span>

(Job 31:1-40)

Job proceeds to prove that he deserved a better lot. As in the
twenty-ninth chapter, he showed his uprightness as an emir, or
magistrate in public life, so in this chapter he vindicates his
character in private life.

He asserts his guarding against being allured to sin by his senses.

think--rather, "cast a (lustful) look." He not merely did not so, but
put it out of the question by covenanting with his eyes against leading
him into temptation ([Pro 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025.md); [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028).md).

[Job 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 31:2</span></span>

Had I let my senses tempt me to sin, "what portion (would there have
been to me, that is, must I have expected) from (literally, of) God
above, and what inheritance from (literally, of) the Almighty," &c.
\[MAURER\] ([Job 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md); [Job
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013).md).

[Job 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 31:3</span></span>

Answer to the question in [Job 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#002.md).

strange--extraordinary.

[Job 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 31:4</span></span>

Doth not he see? &c.--Knowing this, I could only have expected
"destruction" ([Job 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#003).md), had I
committed this sin ([Pro 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021).md).

[Job 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 31:5</span></span>

Job's abstinence from evil deeds.

vanity--that is, falsehood ([Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002).md).

[Job 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 31:6</span></span>

Parenthetical. Translate: "Oh, that God would weigh me . . . then would
He know," &c.

[Job 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 31:7</span></span>

Connected with [Job 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#006.md).

the way--of God ([Job 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md); [Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005).md). A godly life.

heart . . . after . . . eyes--if my heart coveted, what my eyes beheld
([Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md); [Jos
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021).md).

hands-- ([Psa 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004).md).

[Job 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 31:8</span></span>

Apodosis to [Job 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#005.md), [Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007.md); the curses which he imprecates
on himself, if he had done these things ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md); [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md); [Psa
128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002).md).

offspring--rather, "what I plant," my harvests.

[Job 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 31:9</span></span>

Job asserts his innocence of adultery.

deceived--hath let itself be seduced ([Pro
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#008.md); [Gen
39:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007).md).

laid wait--until the husband went out.

[Job 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 31:10</span></span>

grind--turn the handmill. Be the most abject slave and concubine ([Isa
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md); [Sa2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011).md).

[Job 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 31:11</span></span>

In the earliest times punished with death ([Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024).md). So in later times ([Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022).md). Heretofore he had spoken only
of sins against conscience; now, one against the community, needing the
cognizance of the judge.

[Job 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 31:12</span></span>

([Pro 6:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027.md); [Pro
8:6-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md), [Pro
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#026).md). No crime more provokes God
to send destruction as a consuming fire; none so desolates the soul.

[Job 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 31:13</span></span>

Job affirms his freedom from unfairness towards his servants, from
harshness and oppression towards the needy.

despise the cause--refused to do them justice.

[Job 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 31:14</span></span>

Parenthetical; the reason why Job did not despise the cause of his
servants. Translate: What then (had I done so) could I have done, when
God arose (to call me to account); and when He visited (came to
enquire), what could I have answered Him?

[Job 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 31:15</span></span>

Slaveholders try to defend themselves by maintaining the original
inferiority of the slave. But [Mal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md); [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md); [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md) make the common origin of masters
and servants the argument for brotherly love being shown by the former
to the latter.

[Job 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 31:16</span></span>

fail--in the vain expectation of relief ([Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020).md).

[Job 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 31:17</span></span>

Arabian rules of hospitality require the stranger to be helped first,
and to the best.

[Job 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 31:18</span></span>

Parenthetical: asserting that he did the contrary to the things in [Job
31:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md).

he--the orphan.

guided her--namely, the widow, by advice and protection. On this and "a
father," see [Job 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#016.md).

[Job 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 31:19</span></span>

perish--that is, ready to perish ([Job
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#013).md).

[Job 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 31:20</span></span>

loins--The parts of the body benefited by Job are poetically described
as thanking him; the loins before naked, when clad by me, wished me
every blessing.

[Job 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 31:21</span></span>

when--that is, "because."

I saw--that I might calculate on the "help" of a powerful party in the
court of justice--("gate"), if I should be summoned by the injured
fatherless.

[Job 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 31:22</span></span>

Apodosis to [Job 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013.md), [Job
31:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md), [Job
31:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#019.md). If I had done those crimes,
I should have made a bad use of my influence ("my arm," figuratively,
[Job 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#021).md): therefore, if I have done
them let my arm (literally) suffer. Job alludes to Eliphaz' charge ([Job
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009).md). The first "arm" is rather the
shoulder. The second "arm" is the forearm.

from the bone--literally, "a reed"; hence the upper arm, above the
elbow.

[Job 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 31:23</span></span>

For--that is, the reason why Job guarded against such sins. Fear of God,
though he could escape man's judgment ([Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009).md). UMBREIT more spiritedly
translates, Yea, destruction and terror from God might have befallen me
(had I done so): mere fear not being the motive.

highness--majestic might.

endure--I could have availed nothing against it.

[Job 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 31:24</span></span>

Job asserts his freedom from trust in money ([Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017).md). Here he turns to his duty
towards God, as before he had spoken of his duty towards himself and his
neighbor. Covetousness is covert idolatry, as it transfers the heart
from the Creator to the creature ([Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md). In [Job
31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md) he passes to overt idolatry.

[Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 31:26</span></span>

If I looked unto the sun (as an object of worship) because he shined; or
to the moon because she walked, &c. Sabaism (from tsaba, "the heavenly
hosts") was the earliest form of false worship. God is hence called in
contradistinction, "Lord of Sabaoth." The sun, moon, and stars, the
brightest objects in nature, and seen everywhere, were supposed to be
visible representatives of the invisible God. They had no temples, but
were worshipped on high places and roofs of houses ([Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md); [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md), [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md). The Hebrew here for "sun" is
light. Probably light was worshipped as the emanation from God, before
its embodiments, the sun, &c. This worship prevailed in Chaldea;
wherefore Job's exemption from the idolatry of his neighbors was the
more exemplary. Our "Sun-day," "Mon-day," or Moon-day, bear traces of
Sabaism.

[Job 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 31:27</span></span>

enticed--away from God to idolatry.

kissed . . . hand--"adoration," literally means this. In worshipping
they used to kiss the hand, and then throw the kiss, as it were, towards
the object of worship ([Kg1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md);
[Hos 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002).md).

[Job 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 31:28</span></span>

The Mosaic law embodied subsequently the feeling of the godly from the
earliest times against idolatry, as deserving judicial penalties: being
treason against the Supreme King ([Deu
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md); [Deu
17:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md); [Eze
8:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014).md). This passage therefore does
not prove Job to have been subsequent to Moses.

[Job 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 31:29</span></span>

lifted up myself--in malicious triumph ([Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md); [Pro
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#017.md); [Psa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004).md).

[Job 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 31:30</span></span>

mouth--literally, "palate." (See on [Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030).md).

wishing--literally, "so as to demand his (my enemy's) soul," that is,
"life by a curse." This verse parenthetically confirms [Job
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030.md). Job in the patriarchal age of
the promise, anterior to the law, realizes the Gospel spirit, which was
the end of the law (compare [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md); [Deu
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#006.md), with [Mat
5:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043).md).

[Job 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 31:31</span></span>

That is, Job's household said, Oh, that we had Job's enemy to devour, we
cannot rest satisfied till we have! But Job refrained from even wishing
revenge ([Sa1 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008.md); [Sa2
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009).md). So Jesus Christ ([Luk
9:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054).md). But, better (see [Job
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032).md), translated, "Who can show
(literally, give) the man who was not satisfied with the flesh (meat)
provided by Job?" He never let a poor man leave his gate without giving
him enough to eat.

[Job 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 31:32</span></span>

traveller--literally, "way," that is, wayfarers; so expressed to include
all of every kind ([Sa2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#004).md).

[Job 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 31:33</span></span>

Adam--translated by UMBREIT, "as men do" ([Hos
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007), where see Margin.md). But English
Version is more natural. The very same word for "hiding" is used in [Gen
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md), [Gen
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#010.md), of Adam hiding himself from God.
Job elsewhere alludes to the flood. So he might easily know of the fall,
through the two links which connect Adam and Abraham (about Job's time),
namely, Methuselah and Shem. Adam is representative of fallen man's
propensity to concealment ([Pro
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013).md). It was from God that Job did
not "hide his iniquity in his bosom," as on the contrary it was from God
that "Adam" hid in his lurking-place. This disproves the translation,
"as men"; for it is from their fellow men that "men" are chiefly anxious
to hide their real character as guilty. MAGEE, to make the comparison
with Adam more exact, for my "bosom" translates, "lurking-place."

[Job 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 31:34</span></span>

Rather, the apodosis to [Job 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md),
"Then let me be fear-stricken before a great multitude, let the
contempt, &c., let me keep silence (the greatest disgrace to a patriot,
heretofore so prominent in assemblies), and not go out," &c. A just
retribution that he who hides his sin from God, should have it exposed
before man ([Sa2 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012).md). But Job had
not been so exposed, but on the contrary was esteemed in the assemblies
of the "tribes"--("families"); a proof, he implies, that God does not
hold him guilty of hiding sin ([Job
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#016.md), contrast with [Job
29:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#021).md).

[Job 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 31:35</span></span>

Job returns to his wish ([Job 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022.md);
[Job 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023).md). Omit "is"; "Behold my
sign," that is, my mark of subscription to the statements just given in
my defense: the mark of signature was originally a cross; and hence the
letter Tau or T. Translate, also "Oh, that the Almighty," &c. He marks
"God" as the "One" meant in the first clause.

adversary--that is, he who contends with me, refers also to God. The
vagueness is designed to express "whoever it be that judicially opposes
me"--the Almighty if it be He.

had written a book--rather, "would write down his charge."

[Job 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">job 31:36</span></span>

So far from hiding the adversary's "answer" or "charge" through fear,

I would take it on my shoulders--as a public honor ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

a crown--not a mark of shame, but of distinction ([Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md).

[Job 31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 31:37</span></span>

A good conscience imparts a princely dignity before man and free
assurance in approaching God. This can be realized, not in Job's way
([Job 42:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005).md); but only through Jesus
Christ ([Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md).

[Job 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">job 31:38</span></span>

Personification. The complaints of the unjustly ousted proprietors are
transferred to the lands themselves ([Job
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#020.md); [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md); [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011).md). If I have unjustly acquired
lands ([Job 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#002.md); [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008).md).

furrows--The specification of these makes it likely, he implies in this,
"If I paid not the laborer for tillage"; as [Job
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039.md), "If I paid him not for
gathering in the fruits." Thus of the four clauses in [Job
31:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038.md), the first refers to the same
subject as the fourth, the second is connected with the third by
introverted parallelism. Compare [Jam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md), which plainly alludes to this
passage: compare "Lord of Sabaoth" with [Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md) here.

[Job 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">job 31:39</span></span>

lose . . . life--not literally, but "harassed to death"; until he gave
me up his land gratis \[MAURER\]; as in [Jdg
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#016.md); "suffered him to languish" by
taking away his means of living \[UMBREIT\] ([Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019).md).

[Job 31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">job 31:40</span></span>

thistles--or brambles, thorns.

cockle--literally, "noxious weeds."

The words . . . ended--that is, in the controversy with the friends. He
spoke in the book afterwards, but not to them. At [Job
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037.md) would be the regular conclusion
in strict art. But [Job 31:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038.md) are
naturally added by one whose mind in agitation recurs to its sense of
innocence, even after it has come to the usual stopping point; this
takes away the appearance of rhetorical artifice. Hence the
transposition by EICHORN of [Job
31:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038.md) to follow [Job
31:25](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#025.md) is quite unwarranted.
