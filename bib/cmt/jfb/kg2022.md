### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 22:1</span></span>

JOSIAH'S GOOD REIGN. ([Kg2 22:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001).md)

Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign--Happier than his
grandfather Manasseh, he seems to have fallen during his minority under
the care of better guardians, who trained him in the principles and
practice of piety; and so strongly had his young affections been
enlisted on the side of true and undefiled religion, that he continued
to adhere all his life, with undeviating perseverance, to the cause of
God and righteousness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 22:3</span></span>

HE PROVIDES FOR THE REPAIR OF THE TEMPLE. ([Kg2
22:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).md)

in the eighteenth year of king Josiah--Previous to this period, he had
commenced the work of national reformation. The preliminary steps had
been already taken; not only the builders were employed, but money had
been brought by all the people and received by the Levites at the door,
and various other preparations had been made. But the course of this
narrative turns on one interesting incident which happened in the
eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, and hence that date is specified. In
fact the whole land was thoroughly purified from every object and all
traces of idolatry. The king now addressed himself to the repair and
embellishment of the temple and gave directions to Hilkiah the high
priest to take a general survey, in order to ascertain what was
necessary to be done (see on [Ch2
34:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 22:8</span></span>

HILKIAH FINDS THE BOOK OF THE LAW. ([Kg2
22:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md)

Hilkiah said . . . I have found the book of the law in the house of the
Lord, &c.--that is, the law of Moses, the Pentateuch. It was the temple
copy which, had been laid ([Deu
31:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#025).md) beside the ark in the most
holy place. During the ungodly reigns of Manasseh and Amon--or perhaps
under Ahaz, when the temple itself had been profaned by idols, and the
ark also ([Ch2 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003).md) removed from its
site; it was somehow lost, and was now found again during the repair of
the temple \[KEIL\]. Delivered by Hilkiah the discoverer to Shaphan the
scribe \[[Kg2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md)\], it was by the
latter shown and read to the king. It is thought, with great
probability, that the passage read to the king, and by which the royal
mind was so greatly excited, was a portion of Deuteronomy, the
twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth chapters, in which is
recorded a renewal of the national covenant, and an enumeration of the
terrible threats and curses denounced against all who violated the law,
whether prince or people. The impressions of grief and terror which the
reading produced on the mind of Josiah have seemed to many
unaccountable. But, as it is certain from the extensive and familiar
knowledge displayed by the prophets, that there were numbers of other
copies in popular circulation, the king must have known its sacred
contents in some degree. But he might have been a stranger to the
passage read him, or the reading of it might, in the peculiar
circumstances, have found a way to his heart in a manner that he never
felt before. His strong faith in the divine word, and his painful
consciousness that the woeful and long-continued apostasies of the
nation had exposed them to the infliction of the judgments denounced,
must have come with overwhelming force on the heart of so pious a
prince.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 22:12</span></span>

the king commanded . . . Go, inquire of the Lord for me, &c.--The
agitated feelings of the king prompted him to ask immediate counsel how
to avert those curses under which his kingdom lay; and forthwith a
deputation of his principal officers was sent to one endowed with the
prophetic spirit.

Ahikam--a friend of Jeremiah ([Jer
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 22:14</span></span>

Achbor--or Abdon ([Ch2 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#020).md), a man
of influence at court ([Jer 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022).md).
The occasion was urgent, and therefore they were sent--not to Zephaniah
([Zep 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001).md), who was perhaps young--nor
to Jeremiah, who was probably absent at his house in Anathoth, but to
one who was at hand and known for her prophetic gifts--to Huldah, who
was probably at this time a widow. Her husband Shallum was grandson of
one Harhas, "keeper of the wardrobe." If this means the priestly
wardrobe, \[Harhas\] must have been a Levite. But it probably refers to
the royal wardrobe.

she dwelt . . . in the college--rather, "in the Misnah," taking the
original word as a proper name, not a school or college, but a
particular suburb of Jerusalem. She was held in such veneration that
Jewish writers say she and Jehoiada the priest were the only persons not
of the house of David ([Ch2 24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015).md)
who were ever buried in Jerusalem.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 22:15</span></span>

she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell the man that
sent you to me--On being consulted, she delivered an oracular response
in which judgment was blended with mercy; for it announced the impending
calamities that at no distant period were to overtake the city and its
inhabitants. But at the same time the king was consoled with an
assurance that this season of punishment and sorrow should not be during
his lifetime, on account of the faith, penitence, and pious zeal for the
divine glory and worship which, in his public capacity and with his
royal influence, he had displayed.
