### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 7:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 7:1-29)

(See on [Ecc 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012).md).

name--character; a godly mind and life; not mere reputation with man,
but what a man is in the eyes of God, with whom the name and reality are
one thing ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md). This alone is
"good," while all else is "vanity" when made the chief end.

ointment--used lavishly at costly banquets and peculiarly refreshing in
the sultry East. The Hebrew for "name" and for "ointment," have a happy
paronomasia, Sheem and Shemen. "Ointment" is fragrant only in the place
where the person is whose head and garment are scented, and only for a
time. The "name" given by God to His child ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md) is for ever and in all lands. So
in the case of the woman who received an everlasting name from Jesus
Christ, in reward for her precious ointment ([Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005.md); [Mar
14:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003).md). Jesus Christ Himself hath
such a name, as the Messiah, equivalent to Anointed ([Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003).md).

and the day of \[his\] death, &c.--not a general censure upon God for
creating man; but, connected with the previous clause, death is to him,
who hath a godly name, "better" than the day of his birth; "far better,"
as [Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md) has it.

[Ecclesiastes 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 7:2</span></span>

Proving that it is not a sensual enjoyment of earthly goods which is
meant in [Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md). A thankful use of these is
right, but frequent feasting Solomon had found dangerous to piety in his
own case. So Job's fear ([Ecc 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004).md).
The house of feasting often shuts out thoughts of God and eternity. The
sight of the dead in the "house of mourning" causes "the living" to
think of their own "end."

[Ecclesiastes 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 7:3</span></span>

Sorrow--such as arises from serious thoughts of eternity.

laughter--reckless mirth ([Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002).md).

by the sadness . . . better-- ([Psa
126:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md); [Heb
12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010).md). MAURER translates: "In
sadness of countenance there is (may be) a good (cheerful) heart." So
Hebrew, for "good," equivalent to "cheerful" ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009).md); but the parallel clause
supports English Version.

[Ecclesiastes 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 7:5</span></span>

([Psa 141:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004).md). Godly reproof offends
the flesh, but benefits the spirit. Fools' songs in the house of mirth
please the flesh, but injure the soul.

[Ecclesiastes 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 7:6</span></span>

crackling--answers to the loud merriment of fools. It is the very fire
consuming them which produces the seeming merry noise ([Joe
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005).md). Their light soon goes out in the
black darkness. There is a paronomasia in the Hebrew, Sirim ("thorns"),
Sir ("pot"). The wicked are often compared to "thorns" ([Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md); [Nah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010).md). Dried cow-dung was the common
fuel in Palestine; its slowness in burning makes the quickness of a fire
of thorns the more graphic, as an image of the sudden end of fools ([Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 7:7</span></span>

oppression--recurring to the idea ([Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008).md). Its connection with [Ecc
7:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004.md) is, the sight of "oppression"
perpetrated by "fools" might tempt the "wise" to call in question God's
dispensations, and imitate the folly (equivalent to "madness") described
([Ecc 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#005),6.md). WEISS, for "oppression,"
translates, "distraction," produced by merriment. But [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md) favors English Version.

a gift--that is, the sight of bribery in "places of judgment" ([Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016).md) might cause the wise to lose
their wisdom (equivalent to "heart"), ([Job
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md); [Job
21:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006.md); [Job
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001), &c..md). This suits the parallelism
better than "a heart of gifts"; a benevolent heart, as WEISS.

[Ecclesiastes 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 7:8</span></span>

connected with [Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md). Let the
"wise" wait for "the end," and the "oppressions" which now (in "the
beginning") perplex their faith, will be found by God's working to be
overruled to their good. "Tribulation worketh patience" ([Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003).md), which is infinitely better than
"the proud spirit" that prosperity might have generated in them, as it
has in fools ([Psa 73:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md), [Psa
73:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md), [Psa
73:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md); [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 7:9</span></span>

angry--impatient at adversity befalling thee, as Job was ([Ecc
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md); [Pro
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 7:10</span></span>

Do not call in question God's ways in making thy former days better than
thy present, as Job did ([Job 29:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002).md).
The very putting of the question argues that heavenly "wisdom" (Margin)
is not as much as it ought made the chief good with thee.

[Ecclesiastes 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 7:11</span></span>

Rather, "Wisdom, as compared with an inheritance, is good," that is, is
as good as an inheritance; "yea, better (literally, and a profit) to
them that see the sun" (that is, the living, [Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md); [Job
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016.md); [Psa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 7:12</span></span>

Literally, (To be) in (that is, under) the shadow ([Isa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002)) of wisdom (is the same as to be.md)
in (under) the shadow of money; wisdom no less shields one from the ills
of life than money does.

is, that--rather, "the excellency of the knowledge of wisdom giveth
life," that is, life in the highest sense, here and hereafter ([Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md); [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003)). Wisdom (religion.md) cannot be lost
as money can. It shields one in adversity, as well as prosperity; money,
only in prosperity. The question in [Ecc
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md) implies a want of it.

[Ecclesiastes 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 7:13</span></span>

Consider as to God's work, that it is impossible to alter His
dispensations; for who can, &c.

straight . . . crooked--Man cannot amend what God wills to be "wanting"
and "adverse" ([Ecc 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015.md); [Job
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 7:14</span></span>

consider--resumed from [Ecc 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md).
"Consider," that is, regard it as "the work of God"; for "God has made
(Hebrew, for 'set') this (adversity) also as well as the other
(prosperity)." "Adversity" is one of the things which "God has made
crooked," and which man cannot "make straight." He ought therefore to be
"patient" ([Ecc 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008).md).

after him--equivalent to "that man may not find anything (to blame)
after God" (that is, after "considering God's work," [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013).md). Vulgate and Syriac, "against
Him" (compare [Ecc 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010.md); [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 7:15</span></span>

An objection entertained by Solomon

in the days of his vanity--his apostasy ([Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md); [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md).

just . . . perisheth-- ([Kg1 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013).md).
Temporal not eternal death ([Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028).md). But see on [Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md); "just" is probably a
self-justiciary.

wicked . . . prolongeth--See the antidote to the abuse of this statement
in [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 7:16</span></span>

HOLDEN makes [Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md) the scoffing
inference of the objector, and [Ecc
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md) the answer of Solomon, now
repentant. So ([Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md) the
skeptic's objection; ([Co1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033).md) the
answer. However, "Be not righteous over much," may be taken as Solomon's
words, forbidding a self-made righteousness of outward performances,
which would wrest salvation from God, instead of receiving it as the
gift of His grace. It is a fanatical, pharisaical righteousness,
separated from God; for the "fear of God" is in antithesis to it ([Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md); [Ecc
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003.md), [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md); [Mat
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md); [Mat
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014.md); [Mat
23:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md); [Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md); [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003).md).

over wise-- ([Job 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md); [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md), [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016).md), presumptuously
self-sufficient, as if acquainted with the whole of divine truth.

destroy thyself--expose thyself to needless persecution, austerities and
the wrath of God; hence to an untimely death. "Destroy thyself" answers
to "perisheth" ([Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md); "righteous
over much," to "a just man." Therefore in [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md) it is self-justiciary, not a
truly righteous man, that is meant.

[Ecclesiastes 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 7:17</span></span>

over much wicked--so worded, to answer to "righteous over much." For if
not taken thus, it would seem to imply that we may be wicked a little.
"Wicked" refers to "wicked man" ([Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md); "die before thy time," to
"prolongeth his life," antithetically. There may be a wicked man spared
to "live long," owing to his avoiding gross excesses ([Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md). Solomon says, therefore, Be not
so foolish (answering antithetically to "over wise," [Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016).md), as to run to such excess of
riot, that God will be provoked to cut off prematurely thy day of grace
([Rom 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005).md). The precept is addressed
to a sinner. Beware of aggravating thy sin, so as to make thy case
desperate. It refers to the days of Solomon's "vanity" (apostasy, [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md), when only such a precept would
be applicable. By litotes it includes, "Be not wicked at all."

[Ecclesiastes 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 7:18</span></span>

this . . . this--the two opposite excesses ([Ecc
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016).md), fanatical, self-wise
righteousness, and presumptuous, foolhardy wickedness.

he that feareth God shall come forth of them all--shall escape all such
extremes ([Pro 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 7:19</span></span>

Hebrew, "The wisdom," that is, the true wisdom, religion ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md).

than ten mighty--that is, able and valiant generals ([Ecc
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md); [Ecc
9:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md); [Pro
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022.md); [Pro
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005).md). These "watchmen wake in vain,
except the Lord keep the city" ([Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 7:20</span></span>

Referring to [Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md). Be not
"self-righteous," seek not to make thyself "just" before God by a
superabundance of self-imposed performances; "for true 'wisdom,' or
'righteousness,' shows that there is not a just man," &c.

[Ecclesiastes 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 7:21</span></span>

As therefore thou being far from perfectly "just" thyself, hast much to
be forgiven by God, do not take too strict account, as the
self-righteous do ([Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md); [Luk
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md), [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011).md), and thereby shorten their
lives ([Ecc 7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md), of words spoken
against thee by others, for example, thy servant: Thou art their "fellow
servant" before God ([Mat 18:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#032).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 7:22</span></span>

([Kg1 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#044).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 7:23</span></span>

All this--resuming the "all" in [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md); [Ecc
7:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md) is therefore the fruit of his
dearly bought experience in the days of his "vanity."

I will be wise--I tried to "be wise," independently of God. But true
wisdom was then "far from him," in spite of his human wisdom, which he
retained by God's gift. So "over wise" ([Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 7:24</span></span>

That . . . far off . . . deep--True wisdom is so when sought
independently of "fear of God" ([Ecc
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md); [Deu
30:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012.md); [Job
11:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md); [Job
28:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012.md), [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); [Psa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006.md); [Rom
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 7:25</span></span>

Literally, "I turned myself and mine heart to." A phrase peculiar to
Ecclesiastes, and appropriate to the penitent turning back to commune
with his heart on his past life.

wickedness of folly--He is now a step further on the path of penitence
than in [Ecc 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017.md); [Ecc
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md), where "folly" is put without
"wickedness" prefixed.

reason--rather, "the right estimation" of things. HOLDEN translates also
"foolishness (that is, sinful folly, answering to 'wickedness' in the
parallel) of madness" (that is, of man's mad pursuits).

[Ecclesiastes 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 7:26</span></span>

"I find" that, of all my sinful follies, none has been so ruinous a
snare in seducing me from God as idolatrous women ([Kg1
11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md); [Pro
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md); [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014).md). As "God's favor is better than
life," she who seduces from God is "more bitter than death."

whoso pleaseth God--as Joseph ([Gen
39:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002.md), [Gen
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009).md). It is God's grace alone that
keeps any from falling.

[Ecclesiastes 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ecc 7:27</span></span>

this--namely, what follows in [Ecc
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028.md).

counting one by one--by comparing one thing with another \[HOLDEN and
MAURER\].

account--a right estimate. But [Ecc
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028.md) more favors GESENIUS.
"Considering women one by one."

[Ecclesiastes 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ecc 7:28</span></span>

Rather, referring to his past experience, "Which my soul sought further,
but I found not."

one man--that is, worthy of the name, "man," "upright"; not more than
one in a thousand of my courtiers ([Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md); [Psa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001).md). Jesus Christ alone of men fully
realizes the perfect ideal of "man." "Chiefest among ten thousand" ([Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010).md). No perfect "woman" has ever
existed, not even the Virgin Mary. Solomon, in the word "thousand,"
alludes to his three hundred wives and seven hundred concubines. Among
these it was not likely that he should find the fidelity which one true
wife pays to one husband. Connected with [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md), not an unqualified condemnation
of the sex, as [Pro 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md); [Pro
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010.md), &c., prove.

[Ecclesiastes 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ecc 7:29</span></span>

The "only" way of accounting for the scarcity of even comparatively
upright men and women is that, whereas God made man upright, they (men)
have, &c. The only account to be "found" of the origin of evil, the
great mystery of theology, is that given in Holy Writ (Gen. 2:1-3:24).
Among man's "inventions" was the one especially referred to in [Ecc
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md), the bitter fruits of which
Solomon experienced, the breaking of God's primeval marriage law,
joining one man to "one" woman ([Mat
