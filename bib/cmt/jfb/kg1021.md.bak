[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 21:1</span></span>

NABOTH REFUSES AHAB HIS VINEYARD. ([Kg1
21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).md)

Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel--Ahab was
desirous, from its contiguity to the palace, to possess it for a
vegetable garden. He proposed to Naboth to give him a better in
exchange, or to obtain it by purchase; but the owner declined to part
with it. In persisting in his refusal, Naboth was not actuated by any
feelings of disloyalty or disrespect to the king, but solely from a
conscientious regard to the divine law, which, for important reasons,
had prohibited the sale of a paternal inheritance \[[Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md); [Num
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007.md)\]; or if, through extreme poverty
or debt, an assignation of it to another was unavoidable, the conveyance
was made on the condition of its being redeemable at any time \[[Lev
25:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025.md)\]; at all events, of its
reverting at the jubilee to the owner \[[Lev
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#028.md)\]. In short, it could not be
alienated from the family, and it was on this ground that Naboth ([Kg1
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003).md) refused to comply with the
king's demand. It was not, therefore, any rudeness or disrespect that
made Ahab heavy and displeased, but his sulky and pettish demeanor
betrays a spirit of selfishness that could not brook to be disappointed
of a favorite object, and that would have pushed him into lawless
tyranny had he possessed any natural force of character.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 21:4</span></span>

turned away his face--either to conceal from his attendants the vexation
of spirit he felt, or, by the affectation of great sorrow, rouse them to
devise some means of gratifying his wishes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 21:7</span></span>

JEZEBEL CAUSES NABOTH TO BE STONED. ([Kg1
21:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#005).md)

Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?--This is not so much a
question as an exclamation--a sarcastic taunt; "A pretty king thou art!
Canst not thou use thy power and take what thy heart is set upon?"

arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the
vineyard--After upbraiding Ahab for his pusillanimity and bidding him
act as a king, Jezebel tells him to trouble himself no more about such a
trifle; she would guarantee the possession of the vineyard.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 21:8</span></span>

So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal--The
seal-ring contained the name of the king and gave validity to the
documents to which it was affixed ([Est
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008.md); [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017).md). By allowing her the use of his
signet-ring, Ahab passively consented to Jezebel's proceeding. Being
written in the king's name, it had the character of a royal mandate.

sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his
city--They were the civic authorities of Jezreel, and would, in all
likelihood, be the creatures and fit tools of Jezebel. It is evident
that, though Ahab had recently been in Jezreel, when he made the offer
to Naboth, both he and Jezebel were now in Samaria ([Kg1
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 21:9</span></span>

Proclaim a fast, &c.--Those obsequious and unprincipled magistrates did
according to orders. Pretending that a heavy guilt lay on one, or some
unknown party, who was charged with blaspheming God and the king and
that Ahab was threatening vengeance on the whole city unless the culprit
were discovered and punished, they assembled the people to observe a
solemn fast. Fasts were commanded on extraordinary occasions affecting
the public interests of the state ([Ch2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md); [Ezr
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md); [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md); [Jon
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005).md). The wicked authorities of
Jezreel, by proclaiming the fast, wished to give an external appearance
of justice to their proceedings and convey an impression among the
people that Naboth's crime amounted to treason against the king's life.

set Naboth on high--During a trial the panel, or accused person, was
placed on a high seat, in the presence of all the court; but as the
guilty person was supposed to be unknown, the setting of Naboth on high
among the people must have been owing to his being among the
distinguished men of the place.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 21:13</span></span>

there came in two men--worthless fellows who had been bribed to swear a
falsehood. The law required two witnesses in capital offenses ([Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md); [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md); [Mat
26:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#060).md). Cursing God and cursing the
king are mentioned in the law ([Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).md) as offenses closely connected,
the king of Israel being the earthly representative of God in His
kingdom.

they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him--The law, which
forbade cursing the rulers of the people, does not specify the penalty
for this offense but either usage had sanctioned or the authorities of
Jezreel had originated stoning as the proper punishment. It was always
inflicted out of the city ([Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 21:14</span></span>

Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession--Naboth's execution having
been announced, and his family being involved in the same fatal sentence
([Kg2 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026).md), his property became
forfeited to the crown, not by law, but traditionary usage (see [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 21:16</span></span>

Ahab rose up to go down--from Samaria to Jezreel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 21:17</span></span>

ELIJAH DENOUNCES JUDGMENTS AGAINST AHAB AND JEZEBEL. ([Kg1
21:17-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#017).md)

Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?--While Ahab was in the act
of surveying his ill-gotten possession, Elijah, by divine commission,
stood before him. The appearance of the prophet, at such a time, was
ominous of evil, but his language was much more so (compare [Eze
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008.md); [Eze
46:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#016).md). Instead of shrinking with
horror from the atrocious crime, Ahab eagerly hastened to his newly
acquired property.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 21:19</span></span>

In the place where dogs licked, &c.--a righteous retribution of
Providence. The prediction was accomplished, not in Jezreel, but in
Samaria; and not on Ahab personally, in consequence of his repentance
([Kg1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029).md), but on his son ([Kg2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025).md). The words "in the place where"
might be rendered "in like manner as."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 21:20</span></span>

thou hast sold thyself to work evil--that is, allowed sin to acquire the
unchecked and habitual mastery over thee ([Kg2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017.md); [Rom
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 21:21</span></span>

will make thine house, &c.--(see on [Kg1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029.md) and [Kg1
16:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#003).md). Jezebel, though included
among the members of Ahab's house, has her ignominious fate expressly
foretold (see [Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 21:27</span></span>

Ahab . . . rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and
fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly--He was not obdurate, like
Jezebel. This terrible announcement made a deep impression on the king's
heart, and led, for a while, to sincere repentance. Going softly, that
is, barefoot, and with a pensive manner, within doors. He manifested all
the external signs, conventional and natural, of the deepest sorrow. He
was wretched, and so great is the mercy of God, that, in consequence of
his humiliation, the threatened punishment was deferred.
