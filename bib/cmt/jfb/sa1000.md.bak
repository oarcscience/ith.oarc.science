### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 0:0</span></span>

THE FIRST AND SECOND BOOKS OF SAMUEL. The two were, by the ancient Jews,
conjoined so as to make one book, and in that form could be called the
Book of Samuel with more propriety than now, the second being wholly
occupied with the relation of transactions that did not take place till
after the death of that eminent judge. Accordingly, in the Septuagint
and the Vulgate, it is called the First and Second Books of Kings. The
early portion of the First Book, down to the end of the twenty-fourth
chapter, was probably written by Samuel; while the rest of it and the
whole of the Second, are commonly ascribed to Nathan and Gad, founding
the opinion on [Ch1 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md).
Commentators, however, are divided about this, some supposing that the
statements in [Sa1 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026.md); [Sa1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md), indicate the hand of the judge
himself, or a contemporary; while some think, from [Sa1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md); [Sa1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#005.md); [Sa1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006.md), that its composition must be
referred to a later age. It is probable, however, that these supposed
marks of an after-period were interpolations of Ezra. This uncertainty,
however, as to the authorship does not affect the inspired authority of
the book, which is indisputable, being quoted in the New Testament ([Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md) in [Act
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md), and [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md) in [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005).md), as well as in many of the
Psalms.
