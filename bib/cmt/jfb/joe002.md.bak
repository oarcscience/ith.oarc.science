### [Joel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md)

[Joel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 2:1</span></span>

THE COMING JUDGMENT A MOTIVE TO REPENTANCE. PROMISE OF BLESSINGS IN THE
LAST DAYS. (Joel 2:1-32)

A more terrific judgment than that of the locusts is foretold, under
imagery drawn from that of the calamity then engrossing the afflicted
nation. He therefore exhorts to repentance, assuring the Jews of
Jehovah's pity if they would repent. Promise of the Holy Spirit in the
last days under Messiah, and the deliverance of all believers in Him.

Blow . . . trumpet--to sound an alarm of coming war ([Num
10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md); [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md); [Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006).md); the office of the priests. [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md) is an anticipation of the fuller
prophecy in this chapter.

[Joel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 2:2</span></span>

darkness . . . gloominess . . . clouds . . . thick
darkness--accumulation of synonyms, to intensify the picture of calamity
([Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022).md). Appropriate here, as the
swarms of locusts intercepting the sunlight suggested darkness as a fit
image of the coming visitation.

as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people--Substitute a
comma for a colon after mountains: As the morning light spreads itself
over the mountains, so a people numerous \[MAURER\] and strong shall
spread themselves. The suddenness of the rising of the morning light,
which gilds the mountain tops first, is less probably thought by others
to be the point of comparison to the sudden inroad of the foe. MAURER
refers it to the yellow splendor which arises from the reflection of the
sunlight on the wings of the immense hosts of locusts as they approach.
This is likely; understanding, however, that the locusts are only the
symbols of human foes. The immense Assyrian host of invaders under
Sennacherib (compare [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md)
destroyed by God ([Joe 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md), [Joe
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020).md), may be the primary objects
of the prophecy; but ultimately the last antichristian confederacy,
destroyed by special divine interposition, is meant (see on [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002).md).

there hath not been ever the like--(Compare [Joe
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md); [Exo
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014).md).

[Joel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joe 2:3</span></span>

before . . . behind--that is, on every side ([Ch1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#010).md).

fire . . . flame--destruction . . . desolation ([Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017).md).

as . . . Eden . . . wilderness--conversely ([Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md); [Eze
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035).md).

[Joel 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 2:4</span></span>

appearance . . . of horses-- ([Rev
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007).md). Not literal, but figurative
locusts. The fifth trumpet, or first woe, in the parallel passage ([Rev
9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001).md), cannot be literal: for in
[Rev 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011.md) it is said, "they had a king
over them, the angel of the bottomless pit"--in the Hebrew, Abaddon
("destroyer"), but in the Greek, Apollyon--and ([Rev
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007).md) "on their heads were as it were
crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men." Compare
[Joe 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md), "the day of the Lord . . .
great and very terrible"; implying their ultimate reference to be
connected with Messiah's second coming in judgment. The locust's head is
so like that of a horse that the Italians call it cavalette. Compare
[Job 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020.md), "the horse . . . as the
grasshopper," or locust.

run--The locust bounds, not unlike the horse's gallop, raising and
letting down together the two front feet.

[Joel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 2:5</span></span>

Like the noise of chariots--referring to the loud sound caused by their
wings in motion, or else the movement of their hind legs.

on the tops of mountains--MAURER connects this with "they," that is, the
locusts, which first occupy the higher places, and thence descend to the
lower places. It may refer (as in English Version) to "chariots," which
make most noise in crossing over rugged heights.

[Joel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 2:6</span></span>

much pained--namely, with terror. The Arab proverb is, "More terrible
than the locusts."

faces shall gather blackness-- ([Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md); [Jer
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006.md); [Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010).md). MAURER translates, "withdraw
their brightness," that is, wax pale, lose color (compare [Joe
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015).md).

[Joel 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joe 2:7</span></span>

Depicting the regular military order of their advance, "One locust not
turning a nail's breadth out of his own place in the march" \[JEROME\].
Compare [Pro 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027.md), "The locusts have
no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands."

[Joel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 2:8</span></span>

Neither shall one thrust another--that is, press upon so as to thrust
his next neighbor out of his place, as usually occurs in a large
multitude.

when they fall upon the sword--that is, among missiles.

not be wounded--because they are protected by defensive armor
\[GROTIUS\]. MAURER translates, "Their (the locusts') ranks are not
broken when they rush among missiles" (compare [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022).md).

[Joel 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 2:9</span></span>

run to and fro in the city--greedily seeking what they can devour.

the wall--surrounding each house in Eastern buildings.

enter in at the windows--though barred.

like a thief-- ([Joh 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md); compare
[Jer 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021).md).

[Joel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 2:10</span></span>

earth . . . quake before them--that is, the inhabitants of the earth
quake with fear of them.

heavens . . . tremble--that is, the powers of heaven ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md); its illumining powers are
disturbed by the locusts which intercept the sunlight with their dense
flying swarms. These, however, are but the images of revolutions of
states caused by such foes as were to invade Judea.

[Joel 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joe 2:11</span></span>

Lord . . . his army--So among Mohammedans, "Lord of the locusts" is a
title of God.

his voice--His word of command to the locusts, and to the antitypical
human foes of Judea, as "His army."

strong that executeth his word-- ([Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008).md).

[Joel 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joe 2:12</span></span>

With such judgments impending over the Jews, Jehovah Himself urges them
to repentance.

also now--Even now, what none could have hoped or believed possible, God
still invites you to the hope of salvation.

fasting . . . weeping . . . mourning--Their sin being most heinous needs
extraordinary humiliation. The outward marks of repentance are to
signify the depth of their sorrow for sin.

[Joel 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joe 2:13</span></span>

Let there be the inward sorrow of heart, and not the mere outward
manifestation of it by "rending the garment" ([Jos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006).md).

the evil--the calamity which He had threatened against the impenitent.

[Joel 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 2:14</span></span>

leave . . . a meat offering and a drink offering--that is, give
plentiful harvests, out of the first-fruits of which we may offer the
meat and drink offering, now "cut off" through the famine ([Joe
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md), [Joe
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md), [Joe
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#016).md). "Leave behind Him": as God in
visiting His people now has left behind Him a curse, so He will, on
returning to visit them, leave behind Him a blessing.

[Joel 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 2:15</span></span>

Blow the trumpet--to convene the people ([Num
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#003).md). Compare [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md). The nation was guilty, and
therefore there must be a national humiliation. Compare Hezekiah's
proceedings before Sennacherib's invasion (2Ch. 30:1-27).

[Joel 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joe 2:16</span></span>

sanctify the congregation--namely, by expiatory rites and purification
with water \[CALVIN\], ([Exo 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md),
[Exo 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022).md). MAURER translates,
"appoint a solemn assembly," which would be a tautological repetition of
[Joe 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md).

elders . . . children--No age was to be excepted ([Ch2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013).md).

bridegroom--ordinarily exempted from public duties ([Deu
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md); compare [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md), [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029).md).

closet--or, nuptial bed, from a Hebrew root "to cover," referring to the
canopy over it.

[Joel 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joe 2:17</span></span>

between the porch and . . . altar--the porch of Solomon's temple on the
east ([Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003).md); the altar of burnt
offerings in the court of the priests, before the porch ([Ch2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#012.md); compare [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md); [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md). The suppliants thus were to
stand with their backs to the altar on which they had nothing to offer,
their faces towards the place of the Shekinah presence.

heathen should rule over them--This shows that not locusts, but human
foes, are intended. The Margin translation, "use a byword against them,"
is not supported by the Hebrew.

wherefore should they say . . . Where is their God?--that is, do not for
thine own honor's sake, let the heathen sneer at the God of Israel, as
unable to save His people ([Psa 79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md);
[Psa 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002).md).

[Joel 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 2:18</span></span>

Then--when God sees His people penitent.

be jealous for his land--as a husband jealous of any dishonor done to
the wife whom he loves, as if done to himself. The Hebrew comes from an
Arabic root, "to be flushed in face" through indignation.

[Joel 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 2:19</span></span>

corn . . . wine . . . oil--rather, as Hebrew, "the corn . . . the wine .
. . the oil," namely, which the locusts have destroyed \[HENDERSON\].
MAURER not so well explains, "the corn, &c., necessary for your
sustenance." "The Lord will answer," namely, the prayers of His people,
priests, and prophets. Compare in the case of Sennacherib, [Kg2
19:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020.md).

[Joel 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 2:20</span></span>

the northern army--The Hebrew expresses that the north in relation to
Palestine is not merely the quarter whence the invader comes, but is his
native land, "the Northlander"; namely, the Assyrian or Babylonian
(compare [Jer 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md); [Zep
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013).md). The locust's native country is
not the north, but the south, the deserts of Arabia, Egypt, and Libya.
Assyria and Babylon are the type and forerunner of all Israel's foes
(Rome, and the final Antichrist), from whom God will at last deliver His
people, as He did from Sennacherib ([Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md).

face . . . hinder part--more applicable to a human army's van and rear,
than to locusts. The northern invaders are to be dispersed in every
other direction but that from which they had come: "a land barren and
desolate," that is, Arabia-Deserta: "the eastern (or front) sea," that
is, the Dead Sea: "the utmost (or hinder) sea," that is, the
Mediterranean. In front and behind mean east and west; as, in marking
the quarters of the world, they faced the east, which was therefore "in
front"; the west was behind them; the south was on their right, and the
north on their left.

stink--metaphor from locusts, which perish when blown by a storm into
the sea or the desert, and emit from their putrefying bodies such a
stench as often breeds a pestilence.

because he hath done great things--that is, because the invader hath
haughtily magnified himself in his doings. Compare as to Sennacherib,
[Kg2 19:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#011.md), [Kg2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022.md), [Kg2
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028.md). This is quite inapplicable to
the locusts, who merely seek food, not self-glorification, in invading a
country.

[Joel 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joe 2:21</span></span>

In an ascending gradation, the land destroyed by the enemy, the beasts
of the field, and the children of Zion, the land's inhabitants, are
addressed, the former two by personification.

Lord will do great things--In contrast to the "great things" done by the
haughty foe ([Joe 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020).md) to the hurt of
Judah stand the "great things" to be done by Jehovah for her benefit
(compare [Psa 126:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002).md).

[Joel 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joe 2:22</span></span>

([Zac 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012).md). As before ([Joe
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018.md), [Joe
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020).md) he represented the beasts as
groaning and crying for want of food in the "pastures," so now he
reassures them by the promise of springing pastures.

[Joel 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joe 2:23</span></span>

rejoice in the Lord--not merely in the springing pastures, as the brute
"beasts" which cannot raise their thoughts higher ([Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); [Hab
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018).md).

former rain . . . the rain . . . the former . . . the latter rain--The
autumnal, or "former rain," from the middle of October to the middle of
December, is put first, as Joel prophesies in summer when the locusts'
invasion took place, and therefore looks to the time of early sowing in
autumn, when the autumnal rain was indispensably required. Next, "the
rain," generically, literally, "the showering" or "heavy rain." Next,
the two species of the latter, "the former and the latter rain" (in
March and April). The repetition of the "former rain" implies that He
will give it not merely for the exigence of that particular season when
Joel spake, but also for the future in the regular course of nature, the
autumn and the spring rain; the former being put first, in the order of
nature, as being required for the sowing in autumn, as the latter is
required in spring for maturing the young crop. The Margin, "a teacher
of righteousness," is wrong. For the same Hebrew word is translated
"former rain" in the next sentence, and cannot therefore be differently
translated here. Besides, Joel begins with the inferior and temporal
blessings, and not till [Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)
proceeds to the higher and spiritual ones, of which the former are the
pledge.

moderately--rather, "in due measure," as much as the land requires;
literally, "according to right"; neither too much nor too little, either
of which extremes would hurt the crop (compare [Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md); [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015.md); [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md); see on [Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003).md). The phrase, "in due measure," in
this clause is parallel to "in the first month," in the last clause
(that is, "in the month when first it is needed," each rain in its
proper season). Heretofore the just or right order of nature has been
interrupted through your sin; now God will restore it. See my
Introduction to Joel.

[Joel 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joe 2:24</span></span>

The effect of the seasonable rains shall be abundance of all articles of
food.

[Joel 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joe 2:25</span></span>

locust . . . cankerworm . . . caterpiller . . . palmer worm--the reverse
order from [Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md), where (see on
[Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md) God will restore not only
what has been lost by the full-grown consuming locust, but also what has
been lost by the less destructive licking locust, and swarming locust,
and gnawing locust.

[Joel 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joe 2:26</span></span>

never be ashamed--shall no longer endure the "reproach of the heathen
([Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md), \[MAURER\]; or rather,
"shall not bear the shame of disappointed hopes," as the husbandmen had
heretofore ([Joe 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011).md). So
spiritually, waiting on God, His people shall not have the shame of
disappointment in their expectations from Him ([Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033).md).

[Joel 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joe 2:27</span></span>

know that I am in the midst of Israel--As in the Old Testament
dispensation God was present by the Shekinah, so in the New Testament
first, for a brief time by the Word made flesh dwelling among us ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md), and to the close of this
dispensation by the Holy Spirit in the Church ([Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).md), and probably in a more
perceptible manner with Israel when restored ([Eze
37:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026).md).

never be ashamed--not an unmeaning repetition from [Joe
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md). The twice-asserted truth
enforces its unfailing certainty. As the "shame" in [Joe
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#026.md) refers to temporal blessings, so
in this verse it refers to the spiritual blessings flowing from the
presence of God with His people (compare [Jer
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

[Joel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joe 2:28</span></span>

afterward--"in the last days" ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002).md) under Messiah after the invasion
and deliverance of Israel from the northern army. Having heretofore
stated the outward blessings, he now raises their minds to the
expectation of extraordinary spiritual blessings, which constitute the
true restoration of God's people ([Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md). Fulfilled in earnest ([Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017).md) on Pentecost; among the Jews and
the subsequent election of a people among the Gentiles; hereafter more
fully at the restoration of Israel ([Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md), [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md); [Eze
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md) and the consequent conversion
of the whole world ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md); [Isa
66:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md). As the Jews have been the
seedmen of the elect Church gathered out of Jews and Gentiles, the first
Gospel preachers being Jews from Jerusalem, so they shall be the harvest
men of the coming world-wide Church, to be set up at Messiah's
appearing. That the promise is not restricted to the first Pentecost
appears from Peter's own words: "The promise is (not only) unto you and
to your children, (but also) to all that are afar off (both in space and
in time), even as many as the Lord our God shall call" ([Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039).md). So here "upon all flesh."

I will pour out--under the new covenant: not merely, let fall drops, as
under the Old Testament ([Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039).md).

my spirit--the Spirit "proceeding from the Father and the Son," and at
the same time one with the Father and the Son (compare [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md).

sons . . . daughters . . . old . . . young--not merely on a privileged
few ([Num 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#029).md) as the prophets of
the Old Testament, but men of all ages and ranks. See [Act
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md); [Co1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md), as to "daughters," that is,
women, prophesying.

dreams . . . visions-- ([Act 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010.md);
[Act 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009).md). The "dreams" are
attributed to the "old men," as more in accordance with their years;
"visions" to the "young men," as adapted to their more lively minds. The
three modes whereby God revealed His will under the Old Testament ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md), "prophecy, dreams, and
visions," are here made the symbol of the full manifestation of Himself
to all His people, not only in miraculous gifts to some, but by His
indwelling Spirit to all in the New Testament ([Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md), [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015).md). In [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md); [Act
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009.md), the term used is "vision,"
though in the night, not a dream. No other dream is mentioned in the New
Testament save those given to Joseph in the very beginning of the New
Testament, before the full Gospel had come; and to the wife of Pilate, a
Gentile ([Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md); [Mat
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013.md); [Mat
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#019).md). "Prophesying" in the New
Testament is applied to all speaking under the enlightenment of the Holy
Spirit, and not merely to foretelling events. All true Christians are
"priests" and "ministers" of our God ([Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006).md), and have the Spirit ([Eze
36:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026).md). Besides this, probably, a
special gift of prophecy and miracle-working is to be given at or before
Messiah's coming again.

[Joel 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joe 2:29</span></span>

And also--"And even." The very slaves by becoming the Lord's servants
are His freemen ([Co1 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md); [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016).md). Therefore, in [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018.md) it is quoted, "My servants" and
"My handmaidens"; as it is only by becoming the Lord's servants they are
spiritually free, and partake of the same spirit as the other members of
the Church.

[Joel 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joe 2:30</span></span>

As Messiah's manifestation is full of joy to believers, so it has an
aspect of wrath to unbelievers, which is represented here. Thus when the
Jews received Him not in His coming of grace, He came in judgment on
Jerusalem. Physical prodigies, massacres, and conflagrations preceded
its destruction \[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews\]. To these the language
here may allude; but the figures chiefly symbolize political revolutions
and changes in the ruling powers of the world, prognosticated by
previous disasters ([Amo 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Luk
21:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025).md), and convulsions such as
preceded the overthrow of the Jewish polity. Such shall probably occur
in a more appalling degree before the final destruction of the ungodly
world ("the great and terrible day of Jehovah," compare [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005).md), of which Jerusalem's overthrow
is the type and earnest.

[Joel 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joe 2:32</span></span>

call on . . . name of . . . Lord--Hebrew, JEHOVAH. Applied to Jesus in
[Rom 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md) (compare [Act
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002).md). Therefore, Jesus is JEHOVAH; and
the phrase means, "Call on Messiah in His divine attributes."

shall be delivered--as the Christians were, just before Jerusalem's
destruction, by retiring to Pella, warned by the Saviour ([Mat
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016).md); a type of the spiritual
deliverance of all believers, and of the last deliverance of the elect
"remnant" of Israel from the final assault of Antichrist. "In Zion and
Jerusalem" the Saviour first appeared; and there again shall He appear
as the Deliverer ([Zac 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001).md).

as the Lord hath said--Joel herein refers, not to the other prophets,
but to his own words preceding.

call--metaphor from an invitation to a feast, which is an act of
gratuitous kindness ([Luk 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016).md). So
the remnant called and saved is according to the election of grace, not
for man's merits, power, or efforts ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md).
