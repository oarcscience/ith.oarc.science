<p>
<p>second year of . . . Nebuchadnezzar-- <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005">Dan 1:5</A> shows that "three years" had elapsed since Nebuchadnezzar had taken Jerusalem. The solution of this difficulty is: Nebuchadnezzar first ruled as subordinate to his father Nabopolassar, to which time the first chapter refers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001">Dan 1:1</A>); whereas "the second year" in the second chapter is dated from his sole sovereignty. The very difficulty is a proof of genuineness; all was clear to the writer and the original readers from their knowledge of the circumstances, and so he adds no explanation. A forger would not introduce difficulties; the author did not then see any difficulty in the case. Nebuchadnezzar is called "king" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001">Dan 1:1</A>), by anticipation. Before he left Judea, he became actual king by the death of his father, and the Jews always called him "king," as commander of the invading army. 
<p>
<p>dreams--It is significant that not to Daniel, but to the then world ruler, Nebuchadnezzar, the dream is vouchsafed. It was from the first of its representatives who had conquered the theocracy, that the world power was to learn its doom, as about to be in its turn subdued, and for ever by the kingdom of God. As this vision opens, so that in the seventh chapter developing the same truth more fully, closes the first part. Nebuchadnezzar, as vicegerent of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037">Dan 2:37</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009">Jer 25:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012">Eze 28:12-15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001">Rom 13:1</A>), is honored with the revelation in the form of a dream, the appropriate form to one outside the kingdom of God. So in the cases of Abimelech, Pharaoh, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003">Gen 20:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001">Gen 41:1-7</A>), especially as the heathen attached such importance to dreams. Still it is not he, but an Israelite, who interprets it. Heathendom is passive, Israel active, in divine things, so that the glory redounds to "the God of heaven."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">dan 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>Chaldeans--here, a certain order of priest-magicians, who wore a peculiar dress, like that seen on the gods and deified men in the Assyrian sculptures. Probably they belonged exclusively to the Chaldeans, the original tribe of the Babylonian nation, just as the Magians were properly Medes.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#003">Daniel 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">dan 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>troubled to know the dream--He awoke in alarm, remembering that something solemn had been presented to him in a dream, without being able to recall the form in which it had clothed itself. His thoughts on the unprecedented greatness to which his power had attained (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029">Dan 2:29</A>) made him anxious to know what the issue of all this should be. God meets this wish in the way most calculated to impress him.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004">Daniel 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">dan 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>Here begins the Chaldee portion of Daniel, which continues to the end of the seventh chapter. In it the course, character, and crisis of the Gentile power are treated; whereas, in the other parts, which are in Hebrew, the things treated apply more particularly to the Jews and Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>Syriac--the Aramean Chaldee, the vernacular tongue of the king and his court; the prophet, by mentioning it here, hints at the reason of his own adoption of it from this point. 
<p>
<p>live for ever--a formula in addressing kings, like our "Long live the king!" Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031">Kg1 1:31</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005">Daniel 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">dan 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>The thing--that is, The dream, "is gone from me." GESENIUS translates, "The decree is gone forth from me," irrevocable (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</A>); namely, that you shall be executed, if you do not tell both the dream and the interpretation. English Version is simpler, which supposes the king himself to have forgotten the dream. Pretenders to supernatural knowledge often bring on themselves their own punishment. 
<p>
<p>cut in pieces-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033">Sa1 15:33</A>). 
<p>
<p>houses . . . dunghill--rather, "a morass heap." The Babylonian houses were built of sun-dried bricks; when demolished, the rain dissolves the whole into a mass of mire, in the wet land, near the river [STUART]. As to the consistency of this cruel threat with Nebuchadnezzar's character, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017">Dan 4:17</A>, "basest of men"; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005">Jer 39:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009">Jer 52:9-11</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">dan 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>rewards--literally, "presents poured out in lavish profusion."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008">Daniel 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">dan 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>gain . . . time--literally, "buy." Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016">Eph 5:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5</A>, where the sense is somewhat different. 
<p>
<p>the thing is gone from me--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005">Dan 2:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#009">Daniel 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">dan 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>one decree--There can be no second one reversing the first (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011">Est 4:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>corrupt--deceitful. 
<p>
<p>till the time be changed--till a new state of things arrive, either by my ceasing to trouble myself about the dream, or by a change of government (which perhaps the agitation caused by the dream made Nebuchadnezzar to forebode, and so to suspect the Chaldeans of plotting). 
<p>
<p>tell . . . dream, and I shall know . . . ye can show . . . interpretation--If ye cannot tell the past, a dream actually presented to me, how can ye know, and show, the future events prefigured in it?
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#010">Daniel 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">dan 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>There is not a man . . . that can show--God makes the heathen out of their own mouth, condemn their impotent pretensions to supernatural knowledge, in order to bring out in brighter contrast His power to reveal secrets to His servants, though but "men upon the earth" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022">Dan 2:22-23</A>). 
<p>
<p>therefore, &amp;c.--that is, If such things could be done by men, other absolute princes would have required them from their magicians; as they have not, it is proof such things cannot be done and cannot be reasonably asked from us.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#011">Daniel 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">dan 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh--answering to "no man upon the earth"; for there were, in their belief, "men in heaven," namely, men deified; for example, Nimrod. The supreme gods are referred to here, who alone, in the Chaldean view, could solve the difficulty, but who do not communicate with men. The inferior gods, intermediate between men and the supreme gods, are unable to solve it. Contrast with this heathen idea of the utter severance of God from man, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</A>, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us"; Daniel was in this case made His representative.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">dan 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>Daniel and his companions do not seem to have been actually numbered among the Magi or Chaldeans, and so were not summoned before the king. Providence ordered it so that all mere human wisdom should be shown vain before His divine power, through His servant, was put forth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024">Dan 2:24</A> shows that the decree for slaying the wise men had not been actually executed when Daniel interposed.

<p>
<p>the thing--the agitation of the king as to his dream, and his abortive consultation of the Chaldeans. It is plain from this that Daniel was till now ignorant of the whole matter.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016">Daniel 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">dan 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>Daniel went in--perhaps not in person, but by the mediation of some courtier who had access to the king. His first direct interview seems to have been <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#025">Dan 2:25</A> [BARNES]. 
<p>
<p>time--The king granted "time" to Daniel, though he would not do so to the Chaldeans because they betrayed their lying purpose by requiring him to tell the dream, which Daniel did not. Providence doubtless influenced his mind, already favorable (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#019">Dan 1:19-20</A>), to show special favor to Daniel.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#017">Daniel 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">dan 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>Here appears the reason why Daniel sought "time" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016">Dan 2:16</A>), namely he wished to engage his friends to join him in prayer to God to reveal the dream to him.

The "times" are the phases and periods of duration of empires (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025">Dan 7:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032">Ch1 12:32</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030">Ch1 29:30</A>); the "seasons" the fitting times for their culmination, decline, and fall (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001">Ecc 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007">Act 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001">Th1 5:1</A>). The vicissitudes of states, with their times and seasons, are not regulated by chance or fate, as the heathen thought, but by God.

<p>

Apocalypse (or "revelation") signifies a divine, prophecy a human, activity. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006">Co1 14:6</A>, where the two are distinguished. The prophet is connected with the outer world, addressing to the congregation the words with which the Spirit of God supplies him; he speaks in the Spirit, but the apocalyptic seer is in the Spirit in his whole person (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010">Rev 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002">Rev 4:2</A>). The form of the apocalyptic revelation (the very term meaning that the veil that hides the invisible world is taken off) is subjectively either the dream, or, higher, the vision. The interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream was a preparatory education to Daniel himself. By gradual steps, each revelation preparing him for the succeeding one, God fitted him for disclosures becoming more and more special. In the second and fourth chapters he is but an interpreter of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams; then he has a dream himself, but it is only a vision in a dream of the night (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001">Dan 7:1-2</A>); then follows a vision in a waking state (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001">Dan 8:1-3</A>); lastly, in the two final revelations (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020">Dan 9:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004">Dan 10:4-5</A>) the ecstatic state is no longer needed. The progression in the form answers to the progression in the contents of his prophecy; at first general outlines, and these afterwards filled up with minute chronological and historical details, such as are not found in the Revelation of John, though, as became the New Testament, the form of revelation is the highest, namely, clear waking visions [AUBERLEN].

<p>

So far from it being a discrepancy, that he says nothing of the previous understanding between him and Daniel, or of Daniel's application to the king (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#015">Dan 2:15-16</A>), it is just what we should expect. Arioch would not dare to tell an absolute despot that he had stayed the execution of his sanguinary decree, on his own responsibility; but would, in the first instance, secretly stay it until Daniel had got, by application from the king, the time required, without Arioch seeming to know of Daniel's application as the cause of the respite; then, when Daniel had received the revelation, Arioch would in trembling haste bring him in, as if then for the first time he had "found" him. The very difficulty when cleared up is a proof of genuineness, as it never would be introduced by a forger.

The "as for me," disclaiming extraordinary merit, contrasts elegantly with "as for thee," whereby Daniel courteously, but without flattery, implies, that God honored Nebuchadnezzar, as His vicegerent over the world kingdoms, with a revelation on the subject uppermost in his thoughts, the ultimate destinies of those kingdoms.

<p>the thoughts of thy heart--thy subject of thought before falling asleep. Or, perhaps the probation of Nebuchadnezzar's character through this revelation may be the meaning intended (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031">Ch2 32:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035">Luk 2:35</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">dan 2:31</A></FONT></span></p>The world power in its totality appears as a colossal human form: Babylon the head of gold, Medo-Persia the breast and two arms of silver, Gr&Atilde;&brvbr;co-Macedonia the belly and two thighs of brass, and Rome, with its Germano-Slavonic offshoots, the legs of iron and feet of iron and clay, the fourth still existing. Those kingdoms only are mentioned which stand in some relation to the kingdom of God; of these none is left out; the final establishment of that kingdom is the aim of His moral government of the world. The colossus of metal stands on weak feet, of clay. All man's glory is as ephemeral and worthless as chaff (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024">Pe1 1:24</A>). But the kingdom of God, small and unheeded as a "stone" on the ground is compact in its homogeneous unity; whereas the world power, in its heterogeneous constituents successively supplanting one another, contains the elements of decay. The relation of the stone to the mountain is that of the kingdom of the cross (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023">Mat 16:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026">Luk 24:26</A>) to the kingdom of glory, the latter beginning, and the former ending when the kingdom of God breaks in pieces the kingdoms of the world (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015">Rev 11:15</A>). Christ's contrast between the two kingdoms refers to this passage. 
<p>
<p>a great image--literally, "one image that was great." Though the kingdoms were different, it was essentially one and the same world power under different phases, just as the image was one, though the parts were of different metals.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">dan 2:32</A></FONT></span></p>On ancient coins states are often represented by human figures. The head and higher parts signify the earlier times; the lower, the later times. The metals become successively baser and baser, implying the growing degeneracy from worse to worse. Hesiod, two hundred years before Daniel, had compared the four ages to the four metals in the same order; the idea is sanctioned here by Holy Writ. It was perhaps one of those fragments of revelation among the heathen derived from the tradition as to the fall of man. The metals lessen in specific gravity, as they downwards; silver is not so heavy as gold, brass not so heavy as silver, and iron not so heavy as brass, the weight thus being arranged in the reverse of stability [TREGELLES]. Nebuchadnezzar derived his authority from God, not from man, nor as responsible to man. But the Persian king was so far dependent on others that he could not deliver Daniel from the princes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#014">Dan 6:14-15</A>); contrast <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018">Dan 5:18-19</A>, as to Nebuchadnezzar's power from God, whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014">Ezr 7:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#013">Est 1:13-16</A>). Gr&Atilde;&brvbr;co-Macedonia betrays its deterioration in its divisions, not united as Babylon and Persia. Iron is stronger than brass, but inferior in other respects; so Rome hardy and strong to tread down the nations, but less kingly and showing its chief deterioration in its last state. Each successive kingdom incorporates its predecessor (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#028">Dan 5:28</A>). Power that in Nebuchadnezzar's hands was a God-derived (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037">Dan 2:37-38</A>) autocracy, in the Persian king's was a rule resting on his nobility of person and birth, the nobles being his equals in rank, but not in office; in Greece, an aristocracy not of birth, but individual influence, in Rome, lowest of all, dependent entirely on popular choice, the emperor being appointed by popular military election.

In its relation to the Church, the same stone which destroys the image is the foundation of the Church (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020">Eph 2:20</A>). In its relation to the Gentile world power, the stone is its destroyer (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035">Dan 2:35</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044">Dan 2:44</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003">Zac 12:3</A>). Christ saith (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044">Mat 21:44</A>, referring to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14-15</A>), "Whosoever shall fall on this stone (that is, stumble, and be offended, at Him, as the Jews were, from whom, therefore, He says, 'The kingdom shall be taken') shall be broken; but (referring to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034">Dan 2:34-35</A>) on whomsoever it shall fall (referring to the world power which had been the instrument of breaking the Jews), it will (not merely break, but) grind him to powder" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024">Co1 15:24</A>). The falling of the stone of the feet of the image cannot refer to Christ at His first advent, for the fourth kingdom was not then as yet divided--no toes were in existence (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044">Dan 2:44</A>). 
<p>
<p>cut out--namely, from "the mountain" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045">Dan 2:45</A>); namely, Mount Zion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2</A>), and antitypically, the heavenly mount of the Father's glory, from whom Christ came. 
<p>
<p>without hands--explained in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044">Dan 2:44</A>, "The God of heaven shall set up a kingdom," as contrasted with the image which was made with hands of man. Messiah not created by human agency, but conceived by the Holy Ghost (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020">Mat 1:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035">Luk 1:35</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006">Zac 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058">Mar 14:58</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011">Heb 9:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024">Heb 9:24</A>). So "not made with hands," that is, heavenly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</A>; spiritual, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011">Col 2:11</A>. The world kingdoms were reared by human ambition: but this is the "kingdom of heaven"; "not of this world" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036">Joh 18:36</A>). As the fourth kingdom, or Rome, was represented in a twofold state, first strong, with legs of iron, then weak, with toes part of iron, part of clay; so this fifth kingdom, that of Christ, is seen conversely, first insignificant as a "stone," then as a "mountain" filling the whole earth. The ten toes are the ten lesser kingdoms into which the Roman kingdom was finally to be divided; this tenfold division here hinted at is not specified in detail till the seventh chapter. The fourth empire originally was bounded in Europe pretty nearly by the line of the Rhine and Danube; in Asia by the Euphrates. In Africa it possessed Egypt and the north coasts; South Britain and Dacia were afterwards added but were ultimately resigned. The ten kingdoms do not arise until a deterioration (by mixing clay with the iron) has taken place; they are in existence when Christ comes in glory, and then are broken in pieces. The ten have been sought for in the invading hosts of the fifth and sixth century. But though many provinces were then severed from Rome as independent kingdoms, the dignity of emperor still continued, and the imperial power was exercised over Rome itself for two centuries. So the tenfold divisions cannot be looked for before A.D. 731. But the East is not to be excluded, five toes being on each foot. Thus no point of time before the overthrow of the empire at the taking of Constantinople by the Turks (A.D. 1453) can be assigned for the division. It seems, therefore, that the definite ten will be the ultimate development of the Roman empire just before the rise of Antichrist, who shall overthrow three of the kings, and, after three and a half years, he himself be overthrown by Christ in person. Some of the ten kingdoms will, doubtless, be the same as some past and present divisions of the old Roman empire, which accounts for the continuity of the connection between the toes and legs, a gap of centuries not being interposed, as is objected by opponents of the futurist theory. The lists of the ten made by the latter differ from one another; and they are set aside by the fact that they include countries which were never Roman, and exclude one whole section of the empire, namely, the East [TREGELLES].

NEWTON, who understands the Roman empire to be parted into the ten kingdoms already (whereas TREGELLES makes them future), explains the "clay" mixture as the blending of barbarous nations with Rome by intermarriages and alliances, in which there was no stable amalgamation, though the ten kingdoms retained much of Rome's strength. The "mingling with the seed of men" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044">Dan 2:44</A>) seems to refer to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002">Gen 6:2</A>, where the marriages of the seed of godly Seth with the daughters of ungodly Cain are described in similar words. The reference, therefore, seems to be to the blending of the Christianized Roman empire with the pagan nations, a deterioration being the result. Efforts have been often made to reunite the parts into one great empire, as by Charlemagne and Napoleon, but in vain. Christ alone shall effect that.

For "these kings" cannot mean the four successional monarchies, as they do not coexist as the holders of power; if the fourth had been meant, the singular, not the plural, would be used. The falling of the stone on the image must mean, destroying judgment on the fourth Gentile power, not gradual evangelization of it by grace; and the destroying judgment cannot be dealt by Christians, for they are taught to submit to the powers that be, so that it must be dealt by Christ Himself at His coming again. We live under the divisions of the Roman empire which began fourteen hundred years ago, and which at the time of His coming shall be definitely ten. All that had failed in the hand of man shall then pass away, and that which is kept in His own hand shall be introduced.

As other servants of God refused such honors (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025">Act 10:25-26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013">Act 14:13-15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008">Rev 22:8-9</A>) would not taste defiled food, nor give up prayer to God at the cost of his life (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007">Dan 6:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010">Dan 6:10</A>), it seems likely that Daniel rejected the proffered divine honors. The word "answered" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047">Dan 2:47</A>) implies that Daniel had objected to these honors; and in compliance with his objection, "the king answered, Of a truth, your God is a God of gods." Daniel had disclaimed all personal merit in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030">Dan 2:30</A>, giving God all the glory (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045">Dan 2:45</A>).

<p>in the gate--the place of holding courts of justice and levees in the East (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019">Est 2:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007">Job 29:7</A>). So "the Sublime Porte," or "Gate," denotes the sultan's government, his counsels being formerly held in the entrance of his palace. Daniel was a chief counsellor of the king, and president over the governors of the different orders into which the Magi were divided.
<p>
<p>Between the vision of Nebuchadnezzar in the second chapter and that of Daniel in the seventh, four narratives of Daniels and his friends' personal history are introduced. As the second and seventh chapters go together, so chapters the third and sixth chapters (the deliverance from the lions' den), and the fourth and fifth chapters. Of these last two pairs, the former shows God's nearness to save His saints when faithful to Him, at the very time they seem to be crushed by the world power. The second pair shows, in the case of the two kings of the first monarchy, how God can suddenly humble the world power in the height of its insolence. The latter advances from mere self-glorification, in the fourth chapter, to open opposition to God in the fifth. Nebuchadnezzar demands homage to be paid to his image (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001">Dan 3:1-6</A>), and boasts of his power (Dan. 4:1-18). But Belshazzar goes further, blaspheming God by polluting His holy vessels. There is a similar progression in the conduct of God's people. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego refuse positive homage to the image of the world power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012">Dan 3:12</A>); Daniel will not yield it even a negative homage, by omitting for a time the worship of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010">Dan 6:10</A>). Jehovah's power manifested for the saints against the world in individual histories (the third through sixth chapters) is exhibited in the second and seventh chapters, in world-wide prophetical pictures; the former heightening the effect of the latter. The miracles wrought in behalf of Daniel and his friends were a manifestation of God's glory in Daniel's person, as the representative of the theocracy before the Babylonian king, who deemed himself almighty, at a time when God could not manifest it in His people as a body. They tended also to secure, by their impressive character, that respect for the covenant-people on the part of the heathen powers which issued in Cyrus' decree, not only restoring the Jews, but ascribing honor to the God of heaven, and commanding the building of the temple (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1-4</A>) [AUBERLEN].
