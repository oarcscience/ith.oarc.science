The GENUINENESS of this Epistle is attested by JUSTIN MARTYR \[Dialogue
with Trypho, p. 311, B.\], who quotes "the first-born of every
creature," in reference to Christ, from [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH \[To
Autolychus, 2, p. 100\]. IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 3.14.1\], quotes
expressly from this "Epistle to the Colossians" ([Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014).md). CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 1. p. 325\], quotes [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md); also elsewhere he quotes [Col
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md), [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md); [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md), &c.; [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md), [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md); [Col
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002.md), &c. TERTULLIAN \[The
Prescription against Heretics, 7\], quotes [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md); \[On the Resurrection of the
Flesh, 23\], and quotes [Col 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md),
[Col 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md); [Col
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md). ORIGEN \[Against Celsus, 5.8\],
quotes [Col 2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md).

Colosse (or, as it is spelt in the best manuscripts, "ColassÃ&brvbr;")
was a city of Phrygia, on the river Lycus, a branch of the Meander. The
Church there was mainly composed of Gentiles (compare [Col
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013).md). ALFORD infers from [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md) (see on [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md), that Paul had not seen its
members, and therefore could not have been its founder, as THEODORET
thought. [Col 1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md) suggests the
probability that Epaphras was the first founder of the Church there. The
date of its foundation must have been subsequent to Paul's visitation,
"strengthening in order" all the churches of Galatia and Phrygia ([Act
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024).md); for otherwise we must have
visited the Colossians, which [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)
implies he had not. Had Paul been their father in the faith, he would
doubtless have alluded to the fact, as in [Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md), [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md); [Th1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md). It is only in the Epistles,
Romans and Ephesians, and this Epistle, such allusions are wanting; in
that to the Romans, because, as in this Church of Colosse, he had not
been the instrument of their conversion; in that to the Ephesians, owing
to the general nature of the Epistle. Probably during the "two years" of
Paul's stay at Ephesus, when "all which dwelt in Asia heard the word of
the Lord Jesus" ([Act 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md), [Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026).md), Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus,
Apphia and the other natives of Colosse, becoming converted at Ephesus,
were subsequently the first sowers of the Gospel seed in their own city.
This will account for their personal acquaintance with, and attachment
to, Paul and his fellow ministers, and for his loving language as to
them, and their counter salutations to him. So also with respect to
"them at Laodicea," ([Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md).

The OBJECT of the Epistle is to counteract Jewish false teaching, by
setting before the Colossians their true standing in Christ alone
(exclusive of all other heavenly beings), the majesty of His person, and
the completeness of the redemption wrought by Him; hence they ought to
be conformed to their risen Lord, and to exhibit that conformity in all
the relations of ordinary life [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md), "new moon, sabbath days," shows
that the false teaching opposed in this Epistle is that of Judaizing
Christians. These mixed up with pure Christianity Oriental theosophy and
angel-worship, and the asceticism of certain sections of the Jews,
especially the Essenes. Compare JOSEPHUS \[Wars of the Jews, 2.8,13\].
These theosophists promised to their followers a deeper insight into the
world of spirits, and a nearer approach to heavenly purity and
intelligence, than the simple Gospel affords. CONYBEARE and HOWSON think
that some Alexandrian Jew had appeared at Colosse, imbued with the Greek
philosophy of PHILO'S school, combining with it the Rabbinical theosophy
and angelology which afterwards was embodied in the Cabbala. Compare
JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 12.3,4\], from which we know that Alexander the
Great had garrisoned the towns of Lydia and Phrygia with two thousand
Mesopotamian and Babylonian Jews in the time of a threatened revolt. The
Phrygians themselves had a mystic tendency in their worship of Cybele,
which inclined them to receive the more readily the incipient Gnosticism
of Judaizers, which afterward developed itself into the strangest
heresies. In the Pastoral Epistles, the evil is spoken of as having
reached a more deadly phase ([Ti1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md); [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005).md), whereas he brings no charge of
immorality in this Epistle: a proof of its being much earlier in date.

The PLACE from which it was written seems to have been Rome, during his
first imprisonment there ([Act
28:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017).md). In my Introduction to the
Epistle to the Ephesians, it was shown that the three Epistles,
Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, were sent at the same time, namely,
during the freer portion of his imprisonment, before the death of
Burrus. [Col 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md); [Eph
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md), imply greater freedom than he
had while writing to the Philippians, after the promotion of Tigellinus
to be PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect. See Introduction to Philippians.

This Epistle, though carried by the same bearer, Tychicus, who bore that
to the Ephesians, was written previously to that Epistle; for many
phrases similar in both appear in the more expanded form in the Epistle
to the Ephesians (compare also Note, see on [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021).md). The Epistle to the Laodiceans
([Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016).md) was written before that to
the Colossians, but probably was sent by him to Laodicea at the same
time with that to the Church at Colosse.

The STYLE is peculiar: many Greek phrases occur here, found nowhere
else. Compare [Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), "spoil you";
"making a show of them openly" ([Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md); "beguile of your reward," and
"intruding" ([Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md);
"will-worship"; "satisfying" ([Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023).md); "filthy communication" ([Col
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008).md); "rule" ([Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015).md); "comfort" ([Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011).md). The loftiness and artificial
elaboration of style correspond to the majestic nature of his theme, the
majesty of Christ's person and office, in contrast to the beggarly
system of the Judaizers, the discussion of which was forced on him by
the controversy. Hence arises his use of unusual phraseology. On the
other hand, in the Epistle of the Ephesians, subsequently written, in
which he was not so hampered by the exigencies of controversy, he
dilates on the same glorious truths, so congenial to him, more at large,
freely and uncontroversially, in the fuller outpouring of his spirit,
with less of the elaborate and antithetical language of system, such as
was needed in cautioning the Colossians against the particular errors
threatening them. Hence arises the striking similarity of many of the
phrases in the two Epistles written about the same time, and generally
in the same vein of spiritual thought; while the peculiar phrases of the
Epistle to the Colossians are such as are natural, considering the
controversial purpose of that Epistle.
