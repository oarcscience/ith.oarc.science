### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

SENNACHERIB INVADES JUDAH. (2Ch. 32:1-20)

After these things, and the establishment thereof--that is, the
restoration of the temple-worship. The precise date is given, [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md). Determined to recover the
independence of his country, Hezekiah had decided to refuse to pay the
tribute which his father had bound himself to pay to Assyria.

Sennacherib . . . entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced
cities--The whole land was ravaged; the strong fortresses of Ashdod
([Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md) and Lachish had fallen;
the siege of Libnah had commenced, when the king of Judah, doubting his
ability to resist, sent to acknowledge his fault, and offer terms of
submission by paying the tribute. The commencement of this Assyrian war
was disastrous to Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013).md). But the misfortunes of the
early period of the war are here passed over, as the historian hastens
to relate the remarkable deliverance which God wrought for His kingdom
of Judah.

[2 Chronicles 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 32:2</span></span>

when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib . . . was purposed to fight against
Jerusalem--An account of the means taken to fortify Jerusalem against
the threatened siege is given only in this passage. The polluting or
filling up of wells, and the altering of the course of rivers, is an old
practice that still obtains in the wars of the East. Hezekiah's plan was
to cover the fountain heads, so that they might not be discovered by the
enemy, and to carry the water by subterranean channels or pipes into the
city--a plan which, while it would secure a constant supply to the
inhabitants, would distress the besiegers, as the country all around
Jerusalem was very destitute of water.

[2 Chronicles 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 32:4</span></span>

So there was gathered much people . . . who stopped all the fountains,
and the brook that ran through the midst of the land--"Where these
various fountains were, we have now no positive means of ascertaining;
though En-rogel, and the spring now called the Virgin's Fount, may well
be numbered among them. JOSEPHUS mentions the existence of various
fountains without the city, but does not mention any of them in this
connection but Siloam. 'The brook,' however, is located with sufficient
precision to enable us to trace it very definitely. We are told that it
'ran through the midst of the land.' Now a stream running through either
the Kedron or Hinnom Valley, could, in no proper sense, be said to run
through the midst of the land, but one flowing through the true Gihon
valley, and separating Akra and Zion from Bezetha, Moriah, and Ophel, as
a stream once, doubtless, did, could, with peculiar propriety, be said
to run through the midst of the land on which the \[Holy\] City was
built. And that this is the correct meaning of the phrase is not only
apparent from the force of circumstances, but is positively so declared
in the Septuagint, where, moreover, it is called a 'river,' which, at
least, implies a much larger stream than the Kedron, and comports well
with the marginal reading, where it is said to overflow through the
midst of the land. Previous to the interference of man, there was, no
doubt, a very copious stream that gushed forth in the upper portion of
that shallow, basin-like concavity north of Damascus Gate, which is
unquestionably the upper extremity of the Gihon valley, and pursuing its
meandering course through this valley, entered the TyropÅ“on at its
great southern curve, down which it flowed into the valley of the
Kedron" \[BARCLAY, City of the Great King\].

[2 Chronicles 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 32:5</span></span>

he strengthened himself--He made a careful inspection of the city
defenses for the purpose of repairing breaches in the wall here,
renewing the masonry there, raising projecting machines to the towers,
and especially fortifying the lower portion of Zion, that is, Millo,
"(in) the original city of David." "In" is a supplement of our
translators, and the text reads better without it, for it was not the
whole city that was repaired, but only the lower portion of Zion, or the
original "city of David."

[2 Chronicles 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 32:6</span></span>

he . . . gathered them together . . . in the street--that is, the large
open space at the gate of Eastern cities. Having equipped his soldiers
with a full suit of military accoutrements, he addressed them in an
animated strain, dwelling on the motives they had to inspire courage and
confidence of success, especially on their consciousness of the favor
and helping power of God.

[2 Chronicles 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 32:9</span></span>

(See on 2Ki. 18:17-35; also 2Ki. 19:8-34).

[2 Chronicles 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 32:18</span></span>

they cried with a loud voice . . . unto the people of Jerusalem . . . on
the wall--It appears that the wall on the west side of the city reached
as far to the side of the uppermost pool of Gihon at that time as it
does now, if not farther; and the wall was so close to that pool that
those sent to negotiate with the Assyrian general answered him in their
own tongue (see on [Kg2 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027).md).

[2 Chronicles 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 32:21</span></span>

AN ANGEL DESTROYS THE ASSYRIANS. ([Ch2
32:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021).md)

an angel . . . cut off all the mighty men--(See on [Kg2
19:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md).

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

HEZEKIAH'S SICKNESS AND RECOVERY. ([Ch2
32:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024).md)

In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death--(See on [Kg2
20:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001).md).

[2 Chronicles 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 32:27</span></span>

HIS RICHES AND WORKS. ([Ch2 32:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027).md)

he had exceeding much riches and honour--(compare [Kg2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013.md); [Isa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002).md). A great portion of his personal
wealth, like that of David and Uzziah, consisted in immense possessions
of agricultural and pastoral produce. Besides, he had accumulated large
treasures in gold, silver, and precious things, which he had taken as
spoils from the Philistines, and which he had received as presents from
neighboring states, among which he was held in great honor as a king
under the special protection of Heaven. Much of his great wealth he
expended in improving his capital, erecting forts, and promoting the
internal benefit of his kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch2 32:30</span></span>

stopped the . . . watercourse of Gihon, and brought it . . . to the west
side of the city, &c.--(Compare [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020).md). Particular notice is here
taken of the aqueduct, as among the greatest of Hezekiah's works. "In
exploring the subterranean channel conveying the water from Virgin's
Fount to Siloam, I discovered a similar channel entering from the north,
a few yards from its commencement; and on tracing it up near the
Mugrabin gate, where it became so choked with rubbish that it could be
traversed no farther, I there found it turn to the west in the direction
of the south end of the cleft, or saddle, of Zion, and if this channel
was not constructed for the purpose of conveying the waters of
Hezekiah's aqueduct, I am unable to suggest any purpose to which it
could have been applied. Perhaps the reason why it was not brought down
on the Zion side, was that Zion was already well-watered in its lower
portion by the Great Pool, 'the lower pool of Gihon.' And accordingly
WILLIAMS \[Holy City\] renders this passage, 'He stopped the upper
outflow of the waters of Gihon, and led them down westward to the city'"
\[BARCLAY, City of the Great King\]. The construction of this aqueduct
required not only masonic but engineering skill; for the passage was
bored through a continuous mass of rock. Hezekiah's pool or reservoir
made to receive the water within the northwest part of the city still
remains. It is an oblong quadrangular tank, two hundred forty feet in
length, from one hundred forty-four to one hundred fifty in breadth,
but, from recent excavations, appears to have extended somewhat farther
towards the north.

[2 Chronicles 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 32:31</span></span>

in the business of the ambassadors who sent . . . to inquire of the
wonder that was done in the land, &c.--They brought a present ([Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md); see on [Kg2
20:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012).md), and a letter of
congratulation on his recovery, in which particular enquiries were made
about the miracle of the sun's retrocession--a natural phenomenon that
could not fail to excite great interest and curiosity at Babylon, where
astronomy was so much studied. At the same time, there is reason to
believe that they proposed a defensive league against the Assyrians.

God left him, to try him, &c.--Hezekiah's offense was not so much in the
display of his military stores and treasures, as in not giving to God
the glory both of the miracle and of his recovery, and thus leading
those heathen ambassadors to know Him.
