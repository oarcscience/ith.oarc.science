### [Acts Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md)

[Acts 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 13:1</span></span>

BARNABAS AND SAUL, DIVINELY CALLED TO LABOR AMONG THE GENTILES, ARE SET
APART AND SENT FORTH BY THE CHURCH AT ANTIOCH. ([Act
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001).md)

there were . . . certain prophets--(See on [Act
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027).md).

and teachers; as Barnabas, &c.--implying that there were others there,
besides; but, according to what appears the true reading, the meaning is
simply that those here mentioned were in the Church at Antioch as
prophets and teachers.

Simeon . . . Niger--of whom nothing is known.

Lucius of Cyrene-- ([Act 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020).md). He is
mentioned, in [Rom 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md), as one of
Paul's kinsmen.

Manaen--or Menahem, the name of one of the kings of Israel ([Kg2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014).md).

which had been brought up with--or, the foster brother of.

Herod the tetrarch--that is, Antipas, who was himself "brought up with a
certain private person at Rome" \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 17.1,3\]. How
differently did these two foster brothers turn out--the one, abandoned
to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most
distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of
reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the
Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch! But this is only what
may be seen in every age: "Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in
Thy sight.' If the courtier, whose son, at the point of death, was
healed by our Lord ([Joh 4:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046).md) was of
Herod's establishment, while Susanna's husband was his steward ([Luk
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003).md), his foster brother's becoming a
Christian and a prophet is something remarkable.

and Saul--last of all, but soon to become first. Henceforward this book
is almost exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New
Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount.

[Acts 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 13:2</span></span>

As they ministered to the Lord--The word denotes the performance of
official duties of any kind, and was used to express the priestly
functions under the Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding
ministrations of the Christian Church.

and fasted--As this was done in other cases on special occasions ([Act
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003.md), [Act
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014.md), [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023).md), it is not improbable that they
had been led to expect some such prophetic announcement at this time.

the Holy Ghost said--through some of the prophets mentioned in [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md).

Separate me--So [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md).

for the work whereunto I have called them--by some communication,
perhaps, to themselves: in the case of Saul at least, such a designation
was indicated from the first ([Act
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021).md). Note.--While the personality
of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity
will appear equally so by comparing it with [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md).

[Acts 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 13:3</span></span>

laid their hands on them--(See on [Act
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006).md) --"recommending them to the grace
of God for the work which they had to fulfil" ([Act
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026).md).

sent them away--with the double call--of the Spirit first, and next of
the Church. So clothed, their mission is thus described: "They being
sent forth by the Holy Ghost." Have we not here for all time the true
principle of appointment to sacred offices?

[Acts 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 13:4</span></span>

ARRIVING IN CYPRUS THEY PREACH IN THE SYNAGOGUES OF SALAMIS--AT PAPHOS,
ELYMAS IS STRUCK BLIND, AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND IS CONVERTED.
([Act 13:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004).md)

departed unto Seleucia--the seaport of Antioch, from which it lay nearly
due west fifteen miles, and five from the Mediterranean shore, on the
river Orontes.

thence sailed to Cyprus--whose high mountain summits are easily seen in
clear weather from the coast \[COLONEL CHESNEY in HOWSON\]. "Four
reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1) Its
nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of Barnabas, and
since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and brought him to
Jesus, and "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus," family
ties had not been without effect on the progress of the Gospel. (3) It
could not be unnatural to suppose that the truth would be welcomed in
Cyprus when brought by Barnabas and his kinsman Mark, to their own
connections or friends. The Jews were numerous in Salamis. By sailing to
that city, they were following the track of the synagogues; and though
their mission was chiefly to the Gentiles, their surest course for
reaching them was through the proselytes and Hellenizing Jews. (4) Some
of the Cypriotes were already Christians. Indeed, no one place out of
Palestine, except Antioch, had been so honorably associated with the
work of successful evangelization" \[HOWSON\].

[Acts 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 13:5</span></span>

and when they were at Salamis--the Grecian capital of the island, on the
eastern side, and not many hours' sail from Seleucia. At this busy
mercantile port immense numbers of Jews were settled, which accounts for
what is here said, that they had more than one synagogue, in which
Barnabas and Saul preached, while other cities had one only.

they had . . . John--Mark.

to their minister--"for their officer". (See on [Luk
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020).md). With what fruit they preached
here is not said. Probably their feeling was what Paul afterwards
expressed at Antioch in Pisidia ([Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046).md).

[Acts 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 13:6</span></span>

when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos--on the opposite or west
side of the island, about one hundred miles by land, along the south
coast; the Roman capital, where the governor resided.

they found a . . . sorcerer--one of a numerous class of impostors who,
at this time of general unbelief, were encouraged even by cultivated
Romans.

[Acts 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 13:7</span></span>

Which was with the deputy--properly, "the proconsul." This name was
reserved for the governors of settled provinces, which were placed under
the Roman Senate, and is never given in the New Testament to Pilate,
Felix, or Festus, who were but procurators, or subordinate
administrators of unsettled, imperial, military provinces. Now as
Augustus reserved Cyprus for himself, its governor would in that case
have been not a proconsul, but simply a procurator, had not the emperor
afterwards restored it to the Senate, as a Roman historian \[DIO
CASSIUS\] expressly states. In most striking confirmation of this minute
accuracy of the sacred historian, coins have actually been found in the
island, stamped with the names of proconsuls, both in Greek and Latin
\[AKERMAN, Numismatic Illustrations of the New Testament\]. (GROTIUS and
BENGEL, not aware of this, have missed the mark here).

Sergius Paulus, a prudent man--an intelligent man, who thirsting for
truth, sent for Barnabas and Saul, desiring ("earnestly desiring") to
hear the Word of God.

[Acts 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 13:8</span></span>

But Elymas--or "the wise."

for so is his name by interpretation--the word is from the Arabic.

withstood them--perceiving, probably, how eagerly the proconsul was
drinking in the word, and fearing a dismissal. (Compare [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md).

[Acts 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 13:9</span></span>

Then Saul . . . also . . . called Paul--and henceforward Paul only; a
softening of his former name, in accommodation to Roman ears, and (as
the word signifies "little") probably with allusion as elsewhere to his
insignificance of stature and appearance ([Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010).md) \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

filled with the Holy Ghost--the Spirit coming mightily upon him.

set his eyes on him and said--Henceforward Barnabas sinks into the
background. The whole soul of his great colleague, now drawn out, as
never before, shoots, by the lightning gaze of his eye, through the dark
and tortuous spirit of the sorcerer. What a picture!

[Acts 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 13:10</span></span>

full of all subtlety--referring to his magic arts.

and all malice--The word signifies "readiness for anything," knavish
dexterity.

thou child of the devil . . . enemy of all righteousness--These were not
words of passion, for immediately before uttering them, it is said he
was "filled with the Holy Ghost" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord--referring to
his having to that hour made a trade of leading his fellow creatures
astray.

[Acts 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 13:11</span></span>

the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind for a
season--the judgment being mercifully designed to lead him to
repentance. The tradition that it did is hardly to be depended on.

there fell on him a mist, &c.--This is in Luke's medical style.

[Acts 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 13:12</span></span>

Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished
at the doctrine of the Lord--so marvellously attested; compare [Mar
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027.md). What fruit, if any, followed
this remarkable conversion, or how long after it the missionaries
remained at Paphos, we know not.

[Acts 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 13:13</span></span>

AT PERGA JOHN MARK FORSAKES THEM--AT ANTIOCH IN PISIDIA, PAUL PREACHES
WITH GLORIOUS EFFECT--THE JEWS, ENRAGED, EXPEL THEM OUT OF THEM COASTS.
(Acts 13:13-52)

they came to Perga in Pamphylia--The distance from Paphos to Attalia, on
the Gulf of Pamphylia (see on [Act
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025).md), sailing in a northwest
direction, is not much greater than from Seleucia to Salamis on the
east. Perga was the metropolis of Pamphylia, on the river Cestrus, and
about seven miles inland from Attalia.

and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem--As Paul afterwards
peremptorily refused to take Mark with him on his second missionary
journey, because he "had departed \[or 'fallen off'\] from them and had
not gone with them to the work" ([Act
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038).md), there can be no doubt that he
had either wearied of it or been deterred by the prospect of the dangers
which lay before him. (But see on [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037), &c..md).

[Acts 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 13:14</span></span>

departed from Perga--apparently without making any stay or doing any
work: compare the different language of [Act
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025.md), and see immediately below.

came to Antioch in Pisidia--usually so called, to distinguish it from
Antioch in Syria, from which they had started, though it actually lies
in Phrygia, and almost due north from Perga. It was a long journey, and
as it lay almost entirely through rugged mountain passes, while "rivers
burst out at the base of huge cliffs, or dash down wildly through narrow
ravines," it must have been a perilous one. The whole region was, and to
this day is, infested by robbers, as ancient history and modern travels
abundantly attest; and there can be but little doubt that to this very
journey Paul many years after alludes, when he speaks amidst his
"journeyings often," of his "perils of rivers" (as the word is), and his
"perils of robbers" ([Co2 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026).md). If
this journey were taken in May--and earlier than that the passes would
have been blocked up with snow--it would account for their not staying
at Perga, whose hot streets are then deserted; "men, women, and
children, flocks, herds, camels, and asses, all ascending at the
beginning of the hot season from the plains to the cool basin-like
hollows on the mountains, moving in the same direction with our
missionaries" \[HOWSON\].

[Acts 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 13:15</span></span>

Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand--as was his manner on
such occasions ([Act 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md); and see
[Act 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001).md).

Men of Israel, and ye that fear God--by the latter expression meaning
religious proselytes, who united with the Jews in all acts of ordinary
worship.

and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in Egypt--by
marvellous interpositions for them in their deepest depression.

[Acts 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 13:18</span></span>

forty years suffered he their manners--rather, according to what appears
the true reading, "cherished he them" (as a nurse the infant in her
bosom).

[Acts 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 13:20</span></span>

after that he gave . . . judges . . . about the space of four hundred
and fifty years--As this appears to contradict [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md), various solutions have been
proposed. Taking the words as they stand in the Greek, thus, "after
that, by the space of four hundred fifty years, He gave judges," the
meaning may be, that about four hundred fifty years elapsed from the
time of the covenant with Abraham until the period of the judges; which
is historically correct, the word "about" showing that chronological
exactness was not aimed at. But taking the sense to be as in our
version, that it was the period of the judges itself which lasted about
four hundred fifty years, this statement also will appear historically
correct, if we include in it the interval of subjection to foreign
powers which occurred during the period of the judges, and understand it
to describe the whole period from the settlement of the tribes in Canaan
to the establishment of royalty. Thus, from the Exodus to the building
of the temple were five hundred ninety-two years \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 8.3.1\]; deduct forty years in the wilderness; twenty-five
years of Joshua's rule \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 5.1.29\]; forty years of
Saul's reign ([Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).md); forty of
David's and the first four years of Solomon's reign ([Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001).md), and there remain, just four
hundred forty-three years; or, in round numbers, "about four hundred
fifty years."

[Acts 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 13:21</span></span>

God gave . . . them Saul . . . of the tribe of Benjamin--That the
speaker was himself of the same name and of the same tribe, has often
been noticed as in all likelihood present to the apostle's mind while
speaking.

forty years--With this length of Saul's reign (not mentioned in the Old
Testament), JOSEPHUS coincides \[Antiquities, 6.14.9\].

[Acts 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 13:22</span></span>

I have found David, &c.--This quotation is the substance of [Psa
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md); [Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md); and perhaps also of [Psa
78:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070.md).

[Acts 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 13:23</span></span>

Of this man's seed hath God, according to . . . promise, raised unto
Israel a Saviour, Jesus--The emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the
seed from which Christ sprang--David's--and the promise to that effect,
which was thus fulfilled; (2) on the character in which this promised
Christ was given of God--"a SAVIOUR." His personal name "JESUS" is
emphatically added, as designed to express that very character. (See on
[Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md).

[Acts 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 13:26</span></span>

children . . . of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God--Gentile
proselytes.

to you is the word of this salvation sent--both being regarded as one
class, as "the Jew first," to whom the Gospel was to be addressed in the
first instance.

[Acts 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 13:27</span></span>

For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew
him not, &c.--The apostle here speaks as if the more immediate guilt of
Christ's death lay with the rulers and people of the metropolis, to
which he fondly hoped that those residing at such a distance as Antioch
would not set their seal.

[Acts 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 13:28</span></span>

found no cause of death--though they sought it ([Mat
26:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059).md).

[Acts 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 13:29</span></span>

they took him down . . . and laid him in a sepulchre--Though the burial
of Christ was an act of honor and love to Him by the disciples to whom
the body was committed, yet since His enemies looked after it and
obtained a guard of soldiers to keep watch over it as the remains of
their own victim, the apostle regards this as the last manifestation on
their part of enmity to the Saviour, that they might see how God laughed
all their precautions to scorn by "raising Him from the dead."

[Acts 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 13:31</span></span>

he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to
Jerusalem, &c.--that is, by those who, having gone out and in with Him
in closest intimacy during all His public ministry, which lay chiefly in
Galilee, and having accompanied Him on His last journey to Jerusalem,
could not possibly be mistaken as to the identity of the risen One, and
were therefore unexceptionable and sufficient witnesses.

[Acts 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 13:33</span></span>

God hath fulfilled the same--"hath completely fulfilled."

in that he hath raised up Jesus again--literally, "raised up"; but the
meaning is (notwithstanding the contrary opinion of many excellent
interpreters) "from the dead"; as the context plainly shows.

as it is written in the second psalm--in many manuscripts "the first
Psalm"; what we call the first being regarded by the ancient Jews as
only an introduction to the Psalter, which was considered to begin with
the second.

this day have I begotten thee--As the apostle in [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md) regards the resurrection of Christ
merely as the manifestation of a prior Sonship, which he afterwards
([Act 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032).md) represents as essential,
it is plain that this is his meaning here. (Such declarative meaning of
the verb "to be" is familiar to every reader of the Bible). See [Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md), "So shall ye be," that is, be
seen to be "My disciples." It is against the whole sense of the New
Testament to ascribe the origin of Christ's Sonship to His resurrection.

[Acts 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 13:34</span></span>

now no more to return to corruption--that is, to the grave where death
reigns; and compare [Rom 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009.md), "Christ
being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion
over him."

I will give you the sure mercies of David-- ([Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).md). The word rendered "mercies" is
peculiar, denoting the sanctity of them, as comprehending the whole
riches of the new covenant; while the other word, "sure," points to the
certainty with which they would, through David's Seed, be at length all
substantiated. See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). But
how do these words prove the resurrection of Christ? "They presuppose
it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised to David, the Ruler of
this kingdom could not remain under the power of death. But to
strengthen the indefinite prediction by one more definite, the apostle
adduces [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md), of which Peter had
given the same explanation (see on [Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md); [Act
2:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030).md), both apostles denying the
possibility of its proper reference to David" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Acts 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 13:36</span></span>

For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
God--rather, "served," in his own generation, the will (or "counsel") of
God; yielding himself an instrument for the accomplishment of God's high
designs, and in this respect being emphatically "the man after God's own
heart." This done, he "fell asleep, and was gathered to his fathers, and
saw corruption." David, therefore (argues the apostle), could not be the
subject of his own prediction, which had its proper fulfilment only in
the resurrection of the uncorrupted body of the Son of God, emphatically
God's "Holy One."

[Acts 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 13:38</span></span>

the forgiveness of sins--the first necessity of the sinner, and so the
first experienced blessing of the Gospel.

[Acts 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 13:39</span></span>

by him all that believe are justified from all things--The sense
requires that a pause in the sentence be made here: "By him the believer
is absolved from all charges of the law." What follows,

from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses--is not an
exceptional but an explanatory clause. The meaning is not, "Though the
law justifies from many things, it cannot justify from all things, but
Christ makes up all deficiencies"; but the meaning is, "By Christ the
believer is justified from all things, whereas the law justifies from
nothing." (Note.--The deeper sense of justification, the positive side
of it, is reserved for the Epistles, addressed to the justified
themselves: and whereas it is the resurrection of Christ here, and
throughout the Acts chiefly, which is dwelt on, because the first thing
in order to bring peace to the guilty through Christ was to establish
His Messiahship by His resurrection, in the Epistles to believers His
death as the way of reconciliation is fully unfolded).

[Acts 13:40](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 13:40</span></span>

Beware, therefore, &c.--By this awful warning of the Old Testament the
apostle would fain "shut them up unto the faith."

[Acts 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 13:41</span></span>

ye will not believe though a man declare it unto you--that is, even on
unexceptionable testimony. The words, from [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md), were originally a merciful but
fruitless warning against the approaching destruction of Jerusalem by
the Chaldeans and the Babylonish captivity. As such nothing could more
fitly describe the more awful calamity impending over the generation
which the apostle addressed.

[Acts 13:42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 13:42</span></span>

And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought
that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath--rather
(according to what is beyond doubt the true reading), "Now, as they were
going out \[of the synagogue\], they besought"--that is, not the
Gentiles, whose case comes in afterwards, but the mixed congregation of
Jews and proselytes, to whom the discourse had been addressed, entreated
to have another hearing of such truths; those of them, that is, who had
been impressed. "And after the breaking up of the synagogue, many of"
both classes, Jews and religious; proselytes, followed Paul and Barnabas
(observe, from this time forward, the inverted order of these names;
except [Act 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md); [Act
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007.md); [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); see on [Act
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md); [Act
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007.md); [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025).md). These names evidently been won
to the Gospel by what they had heard, and felt a clinging to their
spiritual benefactors.

[Acts 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 13:43</span></span>

who, speaking to them--following up the discourse in the synagogue by
some further words of encouragement.

persuaded them to continue in the grace of God--which they had
experienced through the Gospel. (Compare [Act
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023).md).

[Acts 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 13:44</span></span>

the next sabbath came almost the whole city together to hear the word of
God--the intervening days having been spent in further inquiry and
instruction, and the excitement reaching the Gentiles, who now for the
first time crowded, along with the usual worshippers, into the
synagogue.

[Acts 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 13:45</span></span>

But when the Jews--those zealots of exclusive Judaism.

saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy--rather, "indignation,"
and broke out in their usual manner.

contradicting and blaspheming--There is nothing more awful than Jewish
fury and execration of the name of Jesus of Nazareth, when thoroughly
roused.

[Acts 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 13:46</span></span>

Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, &c.--This is in the highest
style of a last and solemn protestation.

It was necessary that the word should first have been spoken to you--See
the direction of Christ in [Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md);
also [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md).

since ye judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life--pass sentence
upon yourselves.

[Acts 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 13:47</span></span>

For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, &c.--These and other
predictions must have been long before this brought vividly home to
Paul's mind in connection with his special vocation to the Gentiles.

I have set thee--that is, Messiah; from which Paul inferred that he was
but following out this destination of his Lord, in transferring to the
Gentiles those "unsearchable riches" which were now by the Jews rejected
and despised.

[Acts 13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 13:48</span></span>

when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad--to perceive that their
accession to Christ was a matter of divine arrangement as well as
apostolic effort.

and glorified the word of the Lord--by a cordial reception of it.

and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed--a very remarkable
statement, which cannot, without force, be interpreted of anything lower
than this, that a divine ordination to eternal life is the cause, not
the effect, of any man's believing.

[Acts 13:49](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">act 13:49</span></span>

And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
region--implying some stay in Antioch and missionary activity in its
vicinity.

[Acts 13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">act 13:50</span></span>

the devout and honourable women--female proselytes of distinction,
jaundiced against the new preachers by those Jewish ecclesiastics to
whom they had learned to look up. The potent influence of the female
character both for and against the truth is seen in every age of the
Church's history.

expelled them--an easier thing than to refute them.

shook off the dust of their feet against them--as directed ([Mat
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014).md).

came unto Iconium--a populous city about forty-five miles southeast from
Pisidian Antioch: at the foot of Mount Taurus; on the borders of
Lycaonia, Phrygia, and Pisidia; and in later times largely contributing
to the consolidation of the Turkish empire.

[Acts 13:52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">act 13:52</span></span>

the disciples--who, though not themselves expelled, had to endure
sufferings for the Gospel, as we learn from [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md).

were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost--who not only raised them
above shame and fear, as professed disciples of the Lord Jesus, but
filled them with holy and elevated emotions.
