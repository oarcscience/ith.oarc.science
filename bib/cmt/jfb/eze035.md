### [Ezekiel Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 35:2</span></span>

JUDGMENT ON EDOM. ([Eze 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001))

Mount Seir--that is, Idumea ([Gen
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#009)). Singled out as badly
pre-eminent in its bitterness against God's people, to represent all
their enemies everywhere and in all ages. So in [Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005); [Isa
63:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001), Edom, the region of the
greatest enmity towards God's people, is the ideal scene of the final
judgments of all God's foes. "Seir" means "shaggy," alluding to its
rugged hills and forests.

[Ezekiel 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 35:3</span></span>

most desolate--literally, "desolation and desolateness" ([Jer
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017), &c.). It is only in their
national character of foes to God's people, that the Edomites are to be
utterly destroyed. A remnant of Edom, as of the other heathen, is to be
"called by the name of God" ([Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012)).

[Ezekiel 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 35:5</span></span>

perpetual hatred-- ([Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011); [Oba
1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010)). Edom perpetuated the
hereditary hatred derived from Esau against Jacob.

shed the blood of, &c.--The literal translation is better. "Thou hast
poured out the children of Israel"; namely, like water. So [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014); [Psa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010), Margin; [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021). Compare [Sa2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014).

by the force of the sword--literally, "by" or "upon the hands of the
sword"; the sword being personified as a devourer whose "hands" were the
instruments of destruction.

in the time that their iniquity had an end--that is, had its
consummation ([Eze 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025), [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029)). Edom consummated his guilt
when he exulted over Jerusalem's downfall, and helped the foe to destroy
it ([Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007); [Oba
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 35:6</span></span>

I will prepare thee unto blood--I will expose thee to slaughter.

sith--old English for "seeing that" or "since."

thou hast not hated blood--The Hebrew order is, "thou hast hated not
blood"; that is, thou couldst not bear to live without bloodshed
\[GROTIUS\]. There is a play on similar sounds in the Hebrew; Edom
resembling dam, the Hebrew for "blood"; as "Edom" means "red," the
transition to "blood" is easy. Edom, akin to blood in name, so also in
nature and acts; "blood therefore shall pursue thee." The measure which
Edom meted to others should be meted to himself ([Psa
109:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017); [Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002); [Mat
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)).

[Ezekiel 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 35:7</span></span>

cut off . . . him that passeth--that is, every passer to and fro; "the
highways shall be unoccupied" ([Eze
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011); [Jdg
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 35:9</span></span>

shall not return--to their former state ([Eze
16:55](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#055)); shall not be restored. The
Hebrew text (Chetib) reads, "shall not be inhabited" (compare [Eze
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020); [Mal
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 35:10</span></span>

So far from being allowed to enter on Israel's vacated inheritance, as
Edom hoped ([Eze 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005); [Psa
83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004), [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012); [Oba
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013)), it shall be that he shall be
deprived of his own; and whereas Israel's humiliation was temporary,
Edom's shall be perpetual.

Lord was there-- ([Eze 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035); [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001), [Psa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003); [Psa
132:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013)). Jehovah claimed Judea as
His own, even when the Chaldeans had overthrown the state; they could
not remove Him, as they did the idols of heathen lands. The broken
sentences express the excited feelings of the prophet at Edom's wicked
presumption. The transition from the "two nations and two countries" to
"it" marks that the two are regarded as one whole. The last clause, "and
Jehovah was there," bursts in, like a flash of lightning, reproving the
wicked presumption of Edom's thought.

[Ezekiel 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 35:11</span></span>

according to thine anger-- ([Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)). As thou in anger and envy hast
injured them, so I will injure thee.

I will make myself known among them--namely, the Israelites. I will
manifest My favor to them, after I have punished thee.

[Ezekiel 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 35:12</span></span>

blasphemies . . . against . . . Israel . . . against me--God regards
what is done against His people as done against Himself ([Mat
25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045); [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002), [Act
9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004)). Edom implied, if he did not
express it, in his taunts against Israel, that God had not sufficient
power to protect His people. A type of the spirit of all the foes of God
and His people ([Sa1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003); [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 35:14</span></span>

([Isa 65:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013)). "The whole earth"
refers to Judea and the nations that submit themselves to Judea's God;
when these rejoice, the foes of God and His people, represented by Edom
as a nation, shall be desolate. Things shall be completely reversed;
Israel, that now for a time mourns, shall then rejoice and for ever.
Edom, that now rejoices over fallen Israel, shall then, when elsewhere
all is joy, mourn, and for ever ([Isa
65:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017); [Mat
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004); [Luk
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025)). HAVERNICK loses this striking
antithesis by translating, "According to the joy of the whole land (of
Edom), so I will make thee desolate"; which would make [Eze
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015) a mere repetition of this.

[Ezekiel 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 35:15</span></span>

([Oba 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012), [Oba
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015)).

The distinction between Israel and the heathen (as Edom) is: Israel has
a covenant relation to God ensuring restoration after chastisement, so
that the heathen's hope of getting possession of the elect people's
inheritance must fail, and they themselves be made desolate ([Eze
36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001)). The reason for the
chastisement of Israel was Israel's sin and profanation of God's name
([Eze 36:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016)). God has good in store
for Israel, for His own name's sake, to revive His people; first, by a
spiritual renewal of their hearts, and, next, by an external restoration
to prosperity ([Eze 36:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022)). The
result is that the heathen shall be impressed with the power and
goodness of God manifested so palpably towards the restored people ([Eze
36:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#034)).
