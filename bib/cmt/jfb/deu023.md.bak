### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

WHO MAY AND WHO MAY NOT ENTER INTO THE CONGREGATION. (Deu. 23:1-25)

He that is wounded . . ., shall not enter into the congregation of the
Lord--"To enter into the congregation of the Lord" means either
admission to public honors and offices in the Church and State of
Israel, or, in the case of foreigners, incorporation with that nation by
marriage. The rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of
friendship or marriage connections with them leading the people into
idolatry, were not admissible till their conversion to the Jewish faith.
But this passage describes certain limitations of the general rule. The
following parties were excluded from the full rights and privileges of
citizenship: (1) Eunuchs--It was a very ancient practice for parents in
the East by various arts to mutilate their children, with a view to
training them for service in the houses of the great. (2) Bastards--Such
an indelible stigma in both these instances was designed as a
discouragement to practices that were disgraceful, but too common from
intercourse with foreigners. (3) Ammonites and Moabites--Without
provocation they had combined to engage a soothsayer to curse the
Israelites; and had further endeavored, by ensnaring them into the guilt
and licentious abominations of idolatry, to seduce them from their
allegiance to God.

[Deuteronomy 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 23:3</span></span>

even to the their tenth generation shall they not enter--Many eminent
writers think that this law of exclusion was applicable only to males;
at all events that a definite is used for an indefinite number ([Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001.md); [Rut
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010.md); [Kg2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#002).md). Many of the Israelites being
established on the east side of Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of
those people, God raised this partition wall between them to prevent the
consequences of evil communications. More favor was to be shown to
Edomites and Egyptians--to the former from their near relationship to
Israel; and to the latter, from their early hospitalities to the family
of Jacob, as well as the many acts of kindness rendered them by private
Egyptians at the Exodus ([Exo 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036).md).
The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared
admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and
by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson
of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the
forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from
those two nations.

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from
every wicked thing--from the excesses incident to camp life, as well as
from habits of personal neglect and impurity.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which has escaped
from his master unto thee--evidently a servant of the Canaanites or some
of the neighboring people, who was driven by tyrannical oppression, or
induced, with a view of embracing the true religion, to take refuge in
Israel.

[Deuteronomy 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 23:19</span></span>

Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother . . . Unto a stranger thou
mayest lend upon usury--The Israelites lived in a simple state of
society, and hence they were encouraged to lend to each other in a
friendly way without any hope of gain. But the case was different with
foreigners, who, engaged in trade and commerce, borrowed to enlarge
their capital, and might reasonably be expected to pay interest on their
loans. Besides, the distinction was admirably conducive to keeping the
Israelites separate from the rest of the world.

[Deuteronomy 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 23:21</span></span>

When thou shalt vow a vow--(See on [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002).md).

[Deuteronomy 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 23:24</span></span>

When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat
grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure--Vineyards, like cornfields
mentioned in the next verse \[[Deu
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025.md)\], were often unenclosed. In
vine-growing countries grapes are amazingly cheap; and we need not
wonder, therefore, that all within reach of a person's arm, was free;
the quantity plucked was a loss never felt by the proprietor, and it was
a kindly privilege afforded to the poor and wayfaring man.
