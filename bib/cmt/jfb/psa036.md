### [Psalms Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001)

[Psalms 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 36:1</span></span>

On servant of the Lord, see on [Psa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001), title. The wickedness of man
contrasted with the excellency of God's perfections and dispensations;
and the benefit of the latter sought, and the evils of the former
deprecated. ([Psa 36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001))

The general sense of this difficult verse is, "that the wicked have no
fear of God." The first clause may be rendered, "Saith transgression in
my heart, in respect to the wicked, there is no fear," &c., that is,
such is my reflection on men's transgressions.

[Psalms 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 36:2</span></span>

This reflection detailed.

until his iniquity--literally, "for finding his iniquity for hating";
that is, he persuades himself God will not so find it--"for hating"
involving the idea of punishing. Hence his words of iniquity and deceit,
and his bold rejection of all right principles of conduct. The climax is
that he deliberately adopts and patronizes evil. The negative forms
affirm more emphatically their contraries.

[Psalms 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 36:5</span></span>

mercy . . . and . . . faithfulness--as mercy and truth ([Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010)).

[Psalms 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 36:6</span></span>

righteousness \[and\] judgments--qualities of a good government ([Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008); [Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001)). These all are set forth, by the
figures used, as unbounded.

[Psalms 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 36:7</span></span>

shadow of thy wings--(Compare [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011); [Psa
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001)).

[Psalms 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 36:8</span></span>

fatness--richness.

thy house--residence--for the privileges and blessings of communion with
God ([Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006); [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004)).

river of thy pleasures--plenteous supply; may allude to Eden.

[Psalms 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 36:9</span></span>

Light is an emblem of all blessings, given of God as a means to gain
more.

[Psalms 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 36:10</span></span>

that know thee--right knowledge of God is the source of right affections
and conduct.

[Psalms 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 36:11</span></span>

foot of . . . hand . . . wicked--all kinds of violent dealing.

[Psalms 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 36:12</span></span>

There--in the acting of violence, they are overthrown. A signal defeat.
