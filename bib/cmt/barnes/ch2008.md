Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 8:1</span></span>

Compare the references to 1 Kings.

[2 Chronicles 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 8:2</span></span>

The cities which Huram had restored to Solomon - These cities had not
been mentioned previously by the writer of Chronicles, who, however,
seems to assume that the fact of their having been given by Hiram to
Solomon is known to his readers. See [Kg1
9:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011.md).

[2 Chronicles 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 8:3</span></span>

Hamath-zobah - Usually identified with the "great Hamath" [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002.md); the capital of Coele-Syria; but
probably a town of Zobah otherwise unknown, which revolted from Solomon,
and was reduced to subjection.

[2 Chronicles 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 8:5</span></span>

Built - "Rebuilt," or "repaired" (as in [Ch2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002).md). The two Beth-borons were both
ancient cities (see [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 8:10</span></span>

On the number compare [Kg1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 8:11</span></span>

Of Pharaoh - Here again the writer of Chronicles assumes in his reader a
knowledge of the facts recorded in the marginal references

[2 Chronicles 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 8:14</span></span>

The man of God - This phrase, so common in Kings (see the introduction
to Kings, 4th note), is rare in Chronicles, and is applied only to Moses
[Ch1 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014.md), David, and one other
prophet [Ch2 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#007.md), [Ch2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#009.md).

[2 Chronicles 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 8:18</span></span>

It has been supposed that these ships were conveyed from Tyre to
Ezion-geber, either

\(1\) round the continent of Africa, or

\(2\) across the isthmus of Suez.

But the writer probably only means that ships were given by Hiram to
Solomon at this time, and in connection with the Ophir enterprise. These
vessels may have been delivered at Joppa, and have been there carefully
studied by the Jewish shipwrights, who then preceeded to Ezion-geber,
and, assisted by Phoenicians, constructed ships after their pattern.

Four hundred and fifty talents - "Four hundred and twenty talents" in
Kings [Kg1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028.md). One or other of the
two texts has suffered from that corruption to which numbers are so
especially liable.
