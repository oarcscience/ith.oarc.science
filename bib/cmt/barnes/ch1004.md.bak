### [1 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 4:3</span></span>

Read, "These are the sons of the father (i. e. chief) of Etam" [Ch2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md), a city of Judah, not far from
Bethlehem.

[1 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 4:9</span></span>

It is remarkable that Jabez should be introduced without description, or
patronymic, as if a well-known personage. We can only suppose that he
was known to those for whom Chronicles was written, either by tradition,
or by writings which have perished. In [Ch1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010.md) Jabez alludes to his name,
"sorrowful" (margin): "Grant that the grief implied in my name may not
come upon me!"

[1 Chronicles 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 4:11</span></span>

It has been conjectured from the strangeness of all the names in this
list, that we have here a fragment of Canaanite record, connected with
the family of the "Shua," whose daughter Judah took to wife [Ch1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md); [Gen
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#002.md), and whose family thus became
related to the tribe of Judah.

[1 Chronicles 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 4:14</span></span>

The words "and Meonothai" should he added to the end of [Ch1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#013.md); but they should be retained also
at the commencement of [Ch1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md). Or,
see the marginal note.

[1 Chronicles 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 4:17</span></span>

She bare Miriam - Rather, "she conceived." The mother is not mentioned,
and it seems impossible to restore the original text with any certainty.

[1 Chronicles 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 4:18</span></span>

His wife - i. e. Mered's. Mered, it would seem, had two wives, Bithiah,
an Egyptian woman, and a Jewish wife (see the margin), whose name is not
given. If Mered was a chief of rank, Bithlah may have been married to
him with the consent of her father, for the Egyptian kings often gave
their daughters in marriage to foreigners. Or she may have elected to
forsake her countrymen and cleave to a Jewish husband, becoming a
convert to his religion. Her name, Bithiah, "daughter of Yahweh," is
like that of a convert.

[1 Chronicles 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 4:19</span></span>

His wife Hodiah - Not as in the margin, but rather, "the sons of the
wife of Hodiah." Hodiah is elsewhere always a man's name [Neh
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007.md); [Neh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md); [Neh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#010.md), [Neh
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#013.md), [Neh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#018.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 4:22</span></span>

Who had the dominion in Moab - Moab was conquered by David [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md), and again by Omri, after which it
remained subject until the death of Ahab [Kg2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md). But a more ancient rule, in times
of which we have no further record, is probably intended.

[1 Chronicles 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 4:23</span></span>

Among plants and hedges - Rather, "in Netaim and Gederah" [Jos
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036.md).

With the king - Or, probably, "on the king's property." Both David and
several of the later kings had large territorial possessions in various
parts of Judaea [Ch1 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md), [Ch1
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#031.md); [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md); [Ch2
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004.md); [Ch2
32:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 4:31</span></span>

Unto the reign of David - It is not quite clear why this clause is
added. Perhaps the writer is quoting from a document belonging to
David's reign. Or, he may mean that some of the cities, as Ziklag [Sa1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006.md), were lost to Simeon about
David's time.

[1 Chronicles 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 4:33</span></span>

And their genealogy - Rather, "and their register was according thereto"
- they were registered, i. e. according to the places where they dwelt.

[1 Chronicles 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 4:38</span></span>

These mentioned by their names were princes - The registered chiefs of
the cities in the first list [Ch1
4:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md), in the time of Hezekiah [Ch1
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 4:39</span></span>

Gedor - Rather read, "Gerar" (Septuagint) a fertile district [Gen
26:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#006.md); [Ch2
14:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014.md) in Philistine country.

[1 Chronicles 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 4:41</span></span>

The habitations - Rather, "the Mehunim" (compare [Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007).md), called also "Maonites" (see
[Jdg 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012) note.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 4:43</span></span>

Unto this day - These words are probably taken from the record which the
writer of Chronicles had before him, and do not imply that the
Simeonites remained undisturbed in their conquests until after the
return from the captivity. So [Ch1
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md).
