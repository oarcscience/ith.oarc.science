### [1 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 10:1</span></span>

The present chapter contains two facts not found in [Sa1
31:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md) - the fastening of Saul's head
in the temple of Dagon [Ch1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010.md), and
the burial of his bones, and those of his sons, under an oak [Ch1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#012.md). Otherwise the narrative differs
from [Sa1 31:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md) only by being
abbreviated (see especially [Ch1
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006.md), [Ch1
10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#011).md), and by having some moral
reflections attached to it [Ch1
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 10:6</span></span>

All his house died together - Not the whole of his family, nor even "all
his sons" (see [Sa2 2:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md); [Sa2
3:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#006.md); [Sa2
4:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001).md). The phrase is perhaps an
abbreviation of the expression in the parallel passage of Samuel [Sa1
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#006.md).

[1 Chronicles 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 10:13</span></span>

For his transgression - Compare [Ch1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md). The "transgression" intended is
probably the disobedience with respect to Amalek, recorded in [Sa1
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md) (compare [Sa1
28:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#017).md).
