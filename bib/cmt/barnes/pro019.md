### [Proverbs Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 19:1</span></span>

The "perverse" man is the rich fool, as contrasted with the poor man who
is upright.

[Pro 19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md) are missing in the
Septuagint.

[Proverbs 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 19:3</span></span>

The non-wisdom which, having brought about disasters by its own
perverseness, then turns round and "fretteth," i. e., angrily complains
against the Providence of God.

Perverteth - Rather, "overturneth," "maketh to fail."

[Proverbs 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 19:6</span></span>

Intreat the favor ... - literally, "stroke the face" of the man of
princely nature, who gives munificently.

[Proverbs 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 19:7</span></span>

It seems best to follow the Vulgate in taking the last clause as a
separate maxim, He who pursues words, nought are they; i. e., the fair
speeches and promises of help come to nothing. A various reading in the
Hebrew gives, "he pursues after words, and these he shall have" - i. e.,
these, and nothing else.

This and other like maxims do not in reality cast scorn and shame on a
state which Christ has pronounced "blessed." Side by side with them is
[Pro 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md), setting forth the honor of
an upright poverty. But as there is an honorable poverty, so there is
one which is altogether inglorious, caused by sloth and folly, leading
to shame and ignominy, and it is well that the man who wishes to live
rightly should avoid this. The teaching of Christ is, of course, higher
than that of the Book of Proverbs, being based upon a fuller revelation
of the divine will, pointing to a higher end and a nobler standard of
duty, and transcending the common motives and common facts of life.

[Proverbs 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 19:8</span></span>

Wisdom - literally, as in the margin, to gain a "heart," i. e., the
higher faculties both of reason and feeling, is identical with gaining
wisdom, i. e., the faculty which seeks and finds.

[Proverbs 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 19:10</span></span>

"Delight," high unrestrained enjoyment, is to the "fool" who lacks
wisdom but a temptation and a snare. The second clause carries the
thought on to what the despotism of Eastern monarchies often presented,
the objectionable rule of some favored slave, it might be, of alien
birth, over the princes and nobles of the land.

[Proverbs 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 19:13</span></span>

Calamity - The Hebrew word is plural (as in [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md); [Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003).md), and seems to express the
multiplied and manifold sorrow caused by the foolish son.

Continual dropping - The irritating, unceasing, sound of the fall, drop
after drop, of water through the chinks in the roof.

[Proverbs 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 19:15</span></span>

Casteth into a deep sleep - Better, causeth deep sleep to fall.

[Proverbs 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 19:16</span></span>

Keepeth his own soul - i. e., His life in the truest and highest sense.

[Proverbs 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 19:17</span></span>

Note the original greatness of the thought. We give to the poor. Have we
lost our gift? No, what we gave, we have lent to One who will repay with
usury. Compare the yet nobler truth of our Lord's teaching [Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md).

[Proverbs 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 19:18</span></span>

While there is hope - While he is still young, and capable of being
reformed.

Crying - Better, as in the margin, Do not set thy soul on his
destruction; words which either counsel forbearance in the act of
chastisement (compare [Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md); [Col
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021).md); or urge that a false clemency
is a real cruelty. The latter sense is preferable. The father is warned
that to forbear from chastising is virtually to expose the son who needs
it to a far worse penalty.

[Proverbs 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 19:19</span></span>

The sense of the last words seems to be that the connection between
wrath and punishment is so invariable, that all efforts to save the
passionate man from the disastrous consequences which he brings on his
own head are made in vain.

[Proverbs 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 19:21</span></span>

Contrast the many purposes of man, shifting, changing, from good to
better, from bad to worse, and the one unchanging righteous "counsel" of
Yahweh.

[Proverbs 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 19:22</span></span>

The "liar" is probably the man, who makes false excuses for not giving,
and so is inferior to the poor man, whose "desire," the wish to do good,
is taken, in the absence of means to carry it into effect, for the act
of kindness itself.

[Proverbs 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 19:23</span></span>

Shall abide satisfied - Better, one that is satisfied hath a sure
abiding-place. The word "abide" has, most probably, here as elsewhere,
its original sense of "passing the night." Even in the hour of darkness
he shall be free from fear.

[Proverbs 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 19:24</span></span>

Hideth his hand in his bosom - Better, dippeth his hand in the dish
(compare [Kg2 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013).md). The scene
brought before us is that of an Eastern feast. There are no knives, or
forks, or spoons. Every guest has to help himself, or be helped by the
host. Compare [Joh 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md).

[Proverbs 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 19:25</span></span>

Words which embrace nearly the whole theory of punishment. If the man
who offends is a "scorner," hardened beyond all hope of reformation,
then punish him by way of retribution and example, and let the penalty
be sharp, that even the unwary and careless may beware. If the man be
"understanding," then let the punishment take the form of discipline.
Admonish, reprove, educate.

[Proverbs 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 19:26</span></span>

Or, A son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach, is one that wasteth
his father, and chaseth away his mother.

[Proverbs 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 19:27</span></span>

literally, Cease, my son, to hear instruction, that thou mayest err from
the words of knowledge; advice given ironically to do that to which his
weakness leads him, with a clear knowledge of the evil to which he is
drifting.

[Proverbs 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 19:28</span></span>

Ungodly witness - literally, "Witness of Belial," "worthless,"
"untruthful."

Devoureth iniquity - Seizes on it eagerly, as a dainty, lives on it.
