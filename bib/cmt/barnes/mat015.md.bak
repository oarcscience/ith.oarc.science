### [Matthew Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 15:1</span></span>

See also [Mar 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md).

Then came to Jesus ... - Mark says that they saw the disciples of Jesus
eating with unwashed hands.

[Mat 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md)

Transgress the tradition of the elders - The world "elders" literally
means "old men." Here it means the "ancients," or their "ancestors." The
"tradition of the elders" meant something handed down from one to
another by memory; some precept or custom not commanded in the written
law, but which scribes and Pharisees held themselves bound to observe.

They supposed that when Moses was on Mount Sinai two sets of laws were
delivered to him: one, they said, was recorded, and is that contained in
the Old Testament; the other was handed down from father to son, and
kept uncorrupted to their day. They believed that Moses, before he died,
delivered this law to Joshua; he to the Judges; they to the prophets; so
that it was kept pure until it was recorded in the Talmuds. In these
books these pretended laws are now contained. They are exceedingly
numerous and very trifling. They are, however, regarded by the Jews as
more important than either Moses or the prophets.

One point in which the Pharisees differed from the Sadducees was in
holding to these traditions. It seems, however, that in the particular
traditions mentioned here, all the Jews were united; for Mark adds [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md) that "the Pharisees and all the
Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition
of the elders." Mark has also added that this custom of washing extended
not merely to their hands before eating, but in coming from the market;
and also to cups, and pots, and brass vessels, and tables, [Mar
7:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md). They did this professedly for
the sake of cleanliness. So far it was well. But they also made it a
matter of superstition. They regarded external purity as of much more
importance than the purity of the heart. They had many foolish rules
about it respecting the quantity of water that was to be used, the way
in which it should be applied, the number of times it should be changed,
the number of those that might wash at a time, etc. Our Saviour did not
think it proper to regard these rules, and this was the reason why they
"found fault" with him.

[Mat 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md)

But he answered ... - They accused him of violating their traditions, as
though they were obligatory.

In his answer he implied that his disciples were not bound to obey their
traditions - they were invented by human beings. He said, also, that
those traditions could not be binding, as they violated the commandments
of God. He proceeded to specify a case in which their tradition made
void one of the plain laws of God; and if that was their character, then
they could not blame him for not regarding them.

[Mat 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md)

For God commanded ... - That is, in the fifth commandment [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md), and in [Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md). To "honor" is to obey, to
reverence, to speak kindly to, to speak and think well of. To "curse" is
to disobey, to treat with irreverence, to swear at, to speak ill of, to
think evil of in the heart, to meditate or do any evil to a parent. All
this is included in the original word.

Let him die the death - This is a Hebrew phrase, the same as saying,
"let him surely die." The Jewish law punished this crime with death.
This duty of honoring and obeying a parent was what Christ said they had
violated by their traditions. He proceeds to state the way in which it
was done.

[Mat 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005.md)

It is a gift - In Mark it is "corban." The word "corban" is a Hebrew
word denoting a gift.

Here it means a thing dedicated to the service of God, and therefore not
to be appropriated to any other use. The Jews were in the habit of
making such dedications. They devoted their property to God for sacred
uses, as they pleased. In doing this they used the word קרבן qaarbaan or
κορβᾶν korban, or some similar word, saying, this thing is "corban," i.
e., it is a gift to God, or is sacred to him. The law required that when
a dedication of this kind was made it should be fulfilled. "Vow and pay
unto the Lord your God," [Psa 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md).
See [Deu 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md). The law of God
required that a son should honor his parent; i. e., among other things,
that he should provide for his needs when he was old and in distress.
Yet the Jewish teachers said that it was more important for a man to
dedicate his property to God than to provide for the needs of his
parent.

If he had once devoted his property once said it was "corban," or a gift
to God - it could not be appropriated even to the support of a parent.
If a parent was needy and poor, and if he should apply to a son for
assistance, and the son should reply, though in anger, "It is devoted to
God; this property which you need, and by which you might be profited by
me, is "corban" - I have given it to God;" the Jews said the property
could not be recalled, and the son was not under obligation to aid a
parent with it. He had done a more important thing in giving it to God.
The son was free. He could not be required to do anything for his father
after that. Thus, he might, in a moment, free himself from the
obligation to obey his father or mother. In a sense somewhat similar to
this, the chiefs and priests of the Sandwich Islands had the power of
devoting anything to the service of the gods by saying that it was
"taboo," or "tabooed;" that is, it became consecrated to the service of
religion; and, no matter who had been the owner, it could then be
appropriated for no other use. In this way they had complete power over
all the possessions of the people, and could appropriate them for their
own use under the pretence of devoting them to religion. Thus, they
deprived the people of their property under the plea that it was
consecrated to the gods. The Jewish son deprived his parents of a
support under the plea that the property was devoted to the service of
religion. The principle was the same, and both systems were equally a
violation of the rights of others.

Besides, the law said that a man should die who cursed his father, i.
e., that refused to obey him, or to provide for him, or spoke in anger
to him. Yet the Jews said that, though in anger, and in real spite and
hatred, a son said to his father, "All that I have which could profit
you I have given to God," he should be free from blame. Thus, the whole
law was made void, or of no use, by what appeared to have the appearance
of piety. "No man, according to their views, was bound to obey the fifth
commandment and support an aged and needy parent, if, either from
superstition or spite, he chose to give his property to God, that is, to
devote it to some religious use."

Our Saviour did not mean to condemn the practice of giving to God, or to
religious and charitable objects. The law and the gospel equally
required this. Jesus commended even a poor widow that gave all her
living, [Mar 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044.md), but he condemned
the practice of giving to God where it interfered with our duty to
parents and relations; where it was done to get rid of the duty of
aiding them; and where it was done out of a malignant and rebellious
spirit, with the semblance of piety, to get clear of doing to earthly
parents what God required.

[Mat 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007.md)

Ye hypocrites! - See the notes at [Mat
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#005.md). Hypocrisy is the concealment of
some base principle under the pretence of religion. Never was there a
clearer instance of it than this an attempt to get rid of the duty of
providing for needy parents under an appearance of piety toward God.

Esaias - That is, Isaiah. This prophecy is found in [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md).

Prophesy of you - That is, he spoke of the people of his day of the
Jews, as Jews - in terms that apply to the whole people. He properly
characterized the nation in calling them hypocrites. The words are
applicable to the nation at all times, and they apply, therefore, to
you. He did not mean particularly to speak of the nation in the time of
Christ, but he spoke of them as having a national character of
hypocrisy. Compare the notes at [Mat
1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md).

[Mat 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md)

Draweth nigh unto me with their mouth ... - That is, they are regular in
the forms of worship; they are strict in ceremonial observances, and
keep the law outwardly; but God requires the heart, and that they have
not rendered.

[Mat 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md)

In vain do they worship me - That is, their attempts to worship are
"vain," or are not real worship - they are mere "forms."

Teaching for doctrines ... - The word "doctrines," here, means the
requirements of religion - things to be believed and practiced in
religion.

God only has a right to declare what shall be done in his service; but
they held their traditions to be superior to the written word of God,
and taught them as doctrines binding the conscience. See the notes at
[Isa 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 15:10</span></span>

See also [Mar 7:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#015.md).

And he called the multitude - In opposition to the doctrines of the
Pharisees, the Saviour took occasion to show them that the great source
of pollution was the heart. They supposed that external things chiefly
defiled a man. On this all their doctrines about purification were
founded. This opinion of the Jews it was of great importance to correct.
The Saviour took occasion, therefore, to direct the people to the true
source of defilement - their own hearts. He particularly directed them
to it as of importance - "Hear and understand."

[Mat 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md)

Not that which goeth into the mouth ... - The disciples were charged
with being sinners for transgressing the tradition of the elders in
eating with unwashed hands.

Christ replies that what they should eat could not render them sinners.
The man, the moral agent, the soul, could not be polluted by anything
that was eaten. What proceeds from the man himself, from his heart,
would defile him.

Defileth - Pollutes, corrupts, or renders sinful.

[Mat 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#012.md)

The Pharisees were offended - They were so zealous of their traditions
that they could not endure that their absurdities should be exposed.

[Mat 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md)

Every plant ... - Religious doctrine is not inaptly compared to a plant.
See [Co1 3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md). It is planted in the
mind for the purpose of producing fruit in the life, or right conduct.
Jesus here says that all those doctrines of which his Father was not the
author must be rooted up or corrected. The false doctrines of the
Pharisees, therefore, must be attacked, and it was no wonder if they
were indignant. It could not be helped. It was his duty to attack them.
He was not surprised that they were enraged; but, notwithstanding their
opposition, their doctrine should be destroyed.

[Mat 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md)

Let them alone - That is, do not be troubled at their rage.

Be not anxious about it. This result is to be expected. They are greatly
attached to their traditions, and you are not to wonder that they are
indignant. They lead, also, the blind. They have a vast influence over
the multitude, and it is to be expected that they will be enraged at any
doctrines that go to lessen their authority or influence. By commanding
them "to let them alone," Christ does not mean that they were to be
suffered to remain in error without any attempt to refute or correct
them, for this he was doing then; but he meant to charge his disciples
not to mind them or to regard their opposition - it was to be expected.

If the blind lead the blind ... - This was a plain proposition. A blind
man, attempting to conduct blind men, would fall into every ditch that
was in the way. So with religious teachers. If these Pharisees,
themselves ignorant and blind, should be suffered to lead the ignorant
multitude, both would be destroyed. This was another reason for
confuting their errors, or for rooting up the plants which God had not
planted. He wished, by doing it, to save the deluded multitude.

God often suffers one man to lead many to ruin. A rich and profligate
man, an infidel, a man of learning, a politician, or a teacher, is
allowed to sweep multitudes to ruin. This is not unjust, for those who
are led are not compelled to follow such people. They are free in
choosing such leaders, and they are answerable for being led to ruin.

[Matthew 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 15:15</span></span>

See also [Mar 7:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#017.md).

Then answered Peter, and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable -
See the notes at [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md). The word
"parable" sometimes means a dark or obscure saying, [Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md). Peter meant, "Explain to us more
fully this obscure and novel doctrine." To us, now, it is plain; to the
disciples, just coming out of Judaism, the doctrine of Jesus was
obscure. Mark says that the disciples asked him. There is no
contradiction. The question was put by Peter in the name of the
disciples; or several of them put the question, though Matthew has
mentioned only one. An omission is not a contradiction.

[Mat 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#016.md)

Are ye also yet without understanding? - Jesus appeals, in explaining
this, to their common sense; and he wonders that they had not yet
learned to judge the foolish traditions of the Jews by the decisions of
common sense and by his own instructions.

[Mat 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#017.md)

Do ye not understand ... - The meaning of this may be thus expressed:
The food which is eaten does not affect the mind, and therefore cannot
pollute it.

The doctrine of the Pharisees, that neglect of washing and of similar
observances defiles a man, cannot be true. Those things pertain to the
body as much as food does, and they cannot affect the soul. That must be
purified by something else than external washing, and it is polluted by
other things than a neglect of mere outward ceremonies. The seat of
corruption is within - it is the heart itself; and if people would be
made pure, this must be cleansed. If that is corrupt, the whole man is
corrupt.

[Mat 15:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018.md)

Christ proceeds to state what does defile the man, or render him a
sinner:

1\. "Evil thoughts" These are the first things - these are the fountains
of all others. Thought precedes action. Thought, or purpose, or motive,
gives its character to conduct. All evil thoughts are here intended.
Though we labor to suppress them, yet they defile us. They leave
pollution behind them.

2\. "Murders." Taking the life of others with malice. The malice has its
seat in the heart, and the murder therefore proceeds from the heart,
[Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md).

3\. "Adulteries, fornication." See [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md).

4\. "Thefts." Theft is the taking and carrying away the goods of others
without their knowledge or consent. Thefts are caused by coveting the
property of others. They proceed, therefore, from the heart, and violate
at the same time two commandments - the tenth commandment in thought and
the eighth commandment in act.

5\. "False witness." Giving wrong testimony. Concealing the truth, or
stating what we know to be false - a violation of the ninth commandment.
It proceeds from a desire to injure others, to take away their character
or property, or to do them injustice. It proceeds thus from the heart.

6\. "Blasphemies." See the notes at [Mat
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003.md). Blasphemy proceeds from
opposition to God, hatred of his character [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md), and from a desire that there
should be no God. It proceeds from the heart. See [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). Mark adds several things to
those enumerated by Matthew:

\(a\) "Covetousness." The unlawful desire of what others possess, this
always proceeds from the heart.

\(b\) "Wickedness." The original here means malice, or a desire of
injuring others, [Rom 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md).

\(c\) "Deceit," i. e., fraud, concealment, cheating in trade. This
proceeds from a desire to benefit ourselves by doing injustice to
others, and this proceeds from the heart.

\(d\) Lasciviousness. Lust, obscenity, unbridled passion - a strong,
evil desire of the heart.

\(e\) "An evil eye." That is, an eye that is sour, malignant, proud; or
an eye of lust and passion. See [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md); [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md); [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md), "Having eyes full of adultery,
that cannot cease from sin."

\(f\) "Pride." An improper estimate of our own importance; thinking that
we are of much more consequence than we really are. This is always the
work of an evil heart.

\(g\) "Foolishness." Not a lack of intellect - man is not to blame for
that - but a moral folly, consisting in choosing evil ends and the bad
means of gaining them; or, in other words, sin and wickedness. All sin
is folly. It is foolish for a man to disobey God, and foolish for anyone
to go to hell.

[Mat 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#020.md)

These are the things which defile a man - These are the true sources of
pollution in man.

These are what corrupt and degrade. It is not the neglect of washing the
body which defiles; it is the deep, inward corruption of the heart. And
what a fountain of pollution is the human soul! What an array of crimes
to proceed from the heart of man! What a proof of guilt! What strictness
is there in the law of God! How universal is depravity!

[Matthew 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 15:21</span></span>

This narrative is also found in [Mar
7:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md).

The coasts of Tyre and Sidon - These cities were on the seacoast or
shore of the Mediterranean. See the notes at [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md). Jesus went there for the
purpose of concealment [Mar 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md),
perhaps still to avoid Herod.

[Mat 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022.md)

A woman of Canaan - This woman is called, also, a Greek, a
Syro-Phoenician by birth, [Mar 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026.md)

In ancient times, the whole land, including Tyre and Sidon, was in the
possession of the Canaanites, and called Canaan. The Phoenicians were
descended from the Canaanites. The country, including Tyre and Sidon,
was called Phoenicia, or Syro-Phoenicia. That country was taken by the
Greeks under Alexander the Great, and those cities, in the time of
Christ, were Greek cities. This woman was therefore a Gentile, living
under the Greek government, and probably speaking the Greek language.
She was by birth a Syro-Phoenician, born in that country, and descended,
therefore, from the ancient Canaanites. All these names might, with
propriety, be given to her.

Coasts - Regions or countries.

Thou son of David - Descendant of David. See the notes at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). The phrase here means the
Messiah.

Is grievously vexed with a devil - See the notes at [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md). The woman showed great
earnestness. She cried unto him, and fell at his feet, [Mar
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#025.md).

[Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md)

But he answered her not a word - This was done to test her faith, and
that there might be exhibited to the apostles an example of the effect
of persevering supplication.

The result shows that it was not unwillingness to aid her, or neglect of
her. It was proper that the strength of her faith should be fully tried.

[Mat 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md)

But he answered and said, I am not sent ... - This answer was made to
the woman, not to the disciples.

The "lost sheep of the house of Israel" were the Jews. He came first to
them. He came as their expected Messiah. He came to preach the gospel
himself to the Jews only. Afterward it was preached to the Gentiles, but
the ministry of Jesus was confined almost entirely to the Jews.

[Mat 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#025.md)

She came and worshipped - That is, bowed down to him or did him
reverence.

See the notes at [Mat 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md).

Lord, help me! - A proper cry for a poor sinner, who needs the help of
the Lord Jesus.

[Mat 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md)

But he answered and said, It is not meet ... - That is, it is not
appropriate or proper.

Children's bread - The Jews considered themselves as the special
children of God.

To all other nations they were accustomed to apply terms of contempt, of
which dogs was the most common. The Muslims still apply the term "dogs"
to Christians, and Christians and Jews to each other. The term is
designed as an expression of the highest contempt. The Saviour means to
say that he was sent to the Jews. The woman was a Gentile. He meant
merely using a term in common use, and designed to test her faith in the
strongest manner - that it did not comport with the design of his
personal ministry to apply benefits intended for the Jews to others.
Evidently he cannot be understood as intending to justify or sanction
the use of such terms, or calling names. He meant to try her faith. As
if he had said, "You are a Gentile; I am a Jew. The Jews call themselves
children of God. You they vilify and abuse, calling you a dog. Are you
willing to receive of a Jew, then, a favor? Are you willing to submit to
these appellations to receive a favor of one of that nation, and to
acknowledge your dependence on a people that so despise you?" It was,
therefore, a trial of her faith, and was not a lending of his sanction
to the propriety of the abusive term. He regarded her with a different
feeling.

[Mat 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027.md)

And she said, Truth, Lord ... - What you say is true.

Let it be that the best food should be given to the children - let the
Jews have the chief benefit of thy ministry; but the dogs beneath the
table eat the crumbs. So let me be regarded as a dog, a pagan, as
unworthy of everything. Yet grant one exertion of that almighty power
displayed so signally among the Jews, and heal the despised daughter of
a despised heathen mother."

[Mat 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028.md)

Great is thy faith - That is, thy trust, confidence.

The word here seems to include, also, the humility and perseverance
manifested in pressing her suit. The daughter was healed then. Going
home, she found her well and composed, [Mar
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#030.md).

[Matthew 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 15:29</span></span>

Sea of Galilee - That is, the Lake of Gennesaret. For an account of the
principal diseases mentioned here, see the notes at [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

Maimed - Those to whom a hand or foot was wanting. See [Mat
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#008.md). To cure them - that is, to
restore a hand or foot - was a direct act of creative power. It is no
wonder, therefore, that the people wondered.

And they glorified the God of Israel - To glorify here means to praise;
to acknowledge his power and goodness. The God of Israel was the God
that the Israelites or Jews worshipped.

[Matthew 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 15:32</span></span>

The miracle recorded here - the feeding of the four thousand - took
place on a mountain near the Sea of Galilee. The same account is
recorded in [Mar 8:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md). The
circumstances of the miracle are so similar to the one recorded in [Mat
14:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014.md), as to need little additional
explanation.

[Mat 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md)

Three days, and have nothing to eat - This is not, perhaps, to be taken
literally, but only that during that time they had been deprived of
their ordinary or regular food.

They had had only a very scanty supply, and on the third day even that
began to fail.

[Mat 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039.md)

Coasts of Magdala - Mark says, "The parts of Dalmanutha." Magdala was
probably the same place which was formerly called Migdol, [Jos
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#038.md). It is now called Mejdel, and is
situated a few miles north of the city of Tiberias, in the land of
Gennesaret, on the western side of the Sea of Tiberias, and directly
east of Cana of Galilee. "It is a wretched hamlet of a dozen low huts
huddled into one, and the whole ready to tumble into a dismal heap of
black basaltic rubbish." - The Land and the Book (Thomson), vol. ii. p.
108. This was the birthplace of Mary Magdalene, out of whom the Saviour
cast seven devils, [Mar 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md).
Dalmanutha was probably a small village near to Magdala, of which no
remains have been discovered. There is no contradiction in the
statements of the two evangelists here, for they do not say that Jesus
went to either of these towns, but only to the coasts or parts where
they were situated.

Remarks On Matthew 15

We learn from this chapter:

1\. That people are often far more attached to traditions and the
commandments of human beings than to the Law of God, [Mat
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md).

2\. That people are strongly disposed to explain away the law of God, if
possible. It is too strict for them, and too spiritual. They dare not
often attack it directly, but they will explain it and dilute it so as
to make it mean nothing. Wicked people do not love God's law, [Mat
15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md).

3\. People are prone to introduce foolish rites into religion. They do
not love what God has commanded, and they attempt to compensate for not
loving his doctrines by being great sticklers for their own, [Mat
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md); [Mar
7:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md).

4\. All addition to the law of God is evil, [Mat
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md). All ceremonies in religion which
are not authorized by the New Testament are wrong. Man has no right to
ordain rites to bind the conscience where God has commanded none, [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md). People come the nearest to that
which is right when they live nearest to just what God has commanded in
the Bible.

5\. Hypocrites should be unmasked and detected, [Mat
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007.md). He does a great service to
people who detects their hypocrisy. That close and faithful preaching
which lays open the heart, and shows people what they are, is that which
comes nearest to the example of Christ. It may pain them, but the wounds
of a friend are faithful [Pro 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md);
and we should honor and love the man that, by the grace of God, can show
us our own hearts. We always honor most the physician of the body that
is most skilled in detecting and curing disease, and so should we the
physician of the soul.

6\. We should be exceedingly cautious in avoiding formality in worship,
[Mat 15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md). It is hypocrisy. God
requires the heart. To render to him only the service of the lips is to
mock him. Nothing can be acceptable but true piety, genuine love, and
hearty obedience; nothing more hateful than an appearance of worshipping
God, while the heart is in sin and the world.

7\. The duty of honoring parents, [Mat
15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md). Nothing can explain away this
duty. It is binding on all. Parents should be obeyed, loved, respected.
God requires it and we cannot be free from the duty. Under age, a child
is bound always to obey a parent where the parent does not command
anything contrary to the Bible; but when the parent commands anything
contrary to the Bible, the child is not bound to obey, [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md). After the child is of age, he is
to respect, love, and honor the parent; and, if poor and needy, to
provide for his wants until he dies. It is certainly proper that we
should do all that we can to comfort those in old age who did so much
for us in childhood. A child can never repay a parent for his kindness
to him.

8\. We are not at liberty to give to anything else not even to religious
uses - what is necessary to render our parents comfortable, [Mat
15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md). They have the first claim on
us. And though it is our duty to do much in the cause of benevolence,
yet our first duty should be to see that our parents do not suffer.

9\. People easily take offence when they are faithfully reproved, and
especially when their hypocrisy is exposed; and especially if this
exposure is about some small matter on which they have greatly set their
hearts some ceremony in worship or some foolish rite, [Mat
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#012.md).

10\. Every false doctrine is to be opposed and should be rooted up, [Mat
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md). It is to be opposed by
arguments and candid investigation, and not by abuse and
misrepresentation. Christ never misrepresented any man's doctrine. He
always stated it just as it was - just as they held it; and then, by
argument and the word of God, he showed it was wrong. This is the proper
way to manage all controversies.

11\. It is of great importance to search the heart, [Mat
15:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019.md). It is a fountain of evil. It
is the source of all crime. External conduct is comparatively of little
importance. In the sight of God, the heart is of more importance; and if
that were pure, all would be well.

12\. The doctrine of man's depravity is true, [Mat
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019.md). If the heart produces those
things which are specified by the Saviour it cannot be pure. And yet who
is there from whose heart, at some time, these things have not
proceeded? Alas, the world is full of instances that prove that the
human heart may produce all these things.

13\. In our distress, and the distress of our children and friends, we
should go to Jesus. We should, indeed, use all proper means to restore
our friends when they are sick; but we should feel that God only can
grant returning health and life, [Mat
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022.md).

14\. We should not be discouraged that our prayers are not immediately
answered. God knows the proper time to answer them, and it may be of
great importance to us that the answer should be deferred, [Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md).

15\. We should still persevere, [Mat
15:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md). We should not be
discouraged. We should not be disheartened even by the appearance of
neglect or unkind treatment.

16\. Our prayers will be answered if we persevere, [Mat
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028.md). They that seek shall find. In
due time - in the best and most proper time - a gracious God will lend
an ear to our request, and grant the thing we need.

17\. We should come with humility and faith, [Mat
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027.md). We can never think too little
of ourselves, or too much of the mercy and faithfulness of Christ.
Prayers of humility and faith only are answered.

18\. Christ will take care of his poor and needy followers. We may be
assured that he has power to give us all we need, and that in times of
necessity he will supply our wants, [Mat
15:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md).

19\. The great number of poor in the world is no reason why he should
not supply them, [Mat 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#038.md). He daily
supplies the wants of nine hundred millions of human beings, besides
countless numbers of the beasts of the field, of the fowls of heaven,
and the fishes of the sea. It is a small thing to supply the needs of
the few poor people on the earth, and He who feeds the world will take
care of us in the time of need.

20\. We should be grateful to God for our daily food. We should render
to him proper thanksgiving, [Mat
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#036.md).
