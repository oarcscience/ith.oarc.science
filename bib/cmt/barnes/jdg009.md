### [Judges Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md)

[Judges 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 9:1</span></span>

We are not told how soon after the death of Gideon these events
happened. There must have been time for the apostacy and establishment
of Baal-worship, and for the development of ill-will between Abimelech
and his brethren.

[Judges 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 9:2</span></span>

The men of Shechem - literally, "the masters." Compare [Jos
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#011.md); [Sa1
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011.md).

[Judges 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 9:3</span></span>

The Ephraimite pride revolted from Abi-ezrite rulers, and inclined them
to one who was a Shechemite by birth. (Compare the same spirit in the
time of David and Rehoboam, [Sa2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md);
[Kg1 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016)..md)

[Judges 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 9:5</span></span>

Such wholesale slaughters have always been common in Eastern monarchies,
and are among the fruits of polygamy.

[Judges 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 9:6</span></span>

Millo must have been a fortified place close to, but separate from,
Shechem, and perhaps the same as the tower of Shechem mentioned in [Jdg
9:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md). The building or enlarging of
the better-known Millo, at Jerusalem was one of Solomon's great works
[Kg1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md), [Kg1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024.md). The population dwelling in Millo
though perhaps numerically small, had great weight from possessing the
stronghold. Their giving Abimelech the title of king indicates the
strong Canaanite influence at Shechem. All the Canaanite chiefs were
called kings, but it was a title hitherto unknown in Israel. This title
had not been named by those Israelites who offered to make Gideon their
hereditary ruler [Jdg 8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#022.md).

The plain of the pillar ... - Rather "the oak of the garrison which is
in Shechem." The oak in question was probably called the "garrison oak,"
from a garrison being stationed near it.

[Judges 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 9:7</span></span>

The top of Mount Gerizim - The ancient Shechem was perhaps situated
there. The population of Shechem is supposed to have been keeping some
public festival outside the city when Jotham addressed them.

[Judges 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 9:8</span></span>

This fable and that noted in the marginal reference are the only two of
the kind found in Scripture. Somewhat different are the parables of the
Old Testament, [Sa2 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md); [Sa2
14:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#005.md); [Kg1
20:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#039.md).

[Jdg 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009.md)

Honour God and man - Alluding to the constant use of oil in the
meat-offerings Lev. 2:1-16, and in the holy ointment [Exo
30:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#024.md). In like manner, the allusion
in [Jdg 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013.md) is to the drink-offerings
of wine. See [Lev 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013.md); [Num
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#010.md).

[Jdg 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#014.md)

The bramble - Said to be the Rhamnus Paliurus of Linnaeus, otherwise
called Spina-Christi, or Christ's Thorn, a shrub with sharp thorns. The
application is obvious. The noble Gideon and his worthy sons had
declined the proffered kingdom. The vile, base-born Abimelech had
accepted it, and his act would turn out to the mutual ruin of himself
and his subjects.

[Jdg 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md)

If in truth - i. e. consistently with truth, honor, and uprightness, as
explained in the interpretation in [Jdg
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#016.md), [Jdg
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#019.md).

Let fire come out ... - The propriety of the image is strictly
preserved, for even the thorns of the worthless bramble might kindle a
flame which would burn the stately cedars to the ground. See [Psa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md).

[Jdg 9:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#016.md)

These verses contain the interpretation of the fable. In them Jotham
points out the base ingratitude of the people in raising Abimelech upon
the ruin of Gideon's house, and foretells the retribution which would
fall upon both parties.

[Judges 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 9:22</span></span>

Had reigned - Rather, "had ruled." It is not the phrase used in [Jdg
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md). It looks as if the Shechemites
alone had made him king, and the rest of Israel had submitted to his
dominion, without allowing his title of king.

[Judges 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 9:26</span></span>

It does not appear who Gaal, son of Ebed, was; he may have been an
officer sent by Abimelech with a force to bring the men of Shechem back
to their allegiance, but who tried to turn the rebellion to his own
account. He got into Shechem with a band of men, "his brethren,"
unopposed by Zebul, Abimelech's officer, and soon gained the confidence
of the Shechemites,

[Judges 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 9:27</span></span>

Seditious and lawless acts [Jdg
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#025.md) now broke out into open
rebellion. It was at an idolatrous feast in the house of Baal-berith, on
occasion of the vintage, and when they were excited with wine, that the
rebellion was matured. Those present began to "curse Abimelech," to
speak insultingly of him, and to revile him (compare [Lev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md); [Sa2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#021.md); [Isa
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021).md). Gaal, the son of Ebed, who was
watching the opportunity, immediately incited them to revolt from the
dominion of Abimelech, offering himself to be their captain; adding a
message of defiance to Abimelech, addressed, probably, to Zebul, who was
present but too weak to resent it on the spot.

[Jdg 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027.md)

Made merry - The word translated "merry" occurs only here and in [Lev
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#024.md). Its etymology gives the sense
of "praises", "thanksgivings"; and its use in these two passages rather
indicates that the fruits themselves which were brought to the House of
God with songs of praise, and eaten or drunken with religious service,
were so called. The thank-offerings would be a portion of the new wine
of the vintage which they had just gathered in.

[Jdg 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#028.md)

Shechem is another designation of Abimelech. Sheehem means the son and
heir of Sheehem, Abimelech's mother being a Canaanite [Jdg
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#018.md).

[Judges 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 9:31</span></span>

Privily - See the margin. The word is probably the name of a place in
"Tormah", some think the same as "Arumah" [Jdg
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#041.md). Zebul was faithful to Abimelech,
but dissembled his sentiments, from being too weak to oppose Gaal, until
Abimelech came with his army [Jdg
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#038.md).

[Judges 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 9:37</span></span>

The plain of Meonenim - Translate "the oak of the soothsayers" (see the
margin). Some well-known oak, so called, but which is not mentioned
elsewhere.

[Judges 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jdg 9:42</span></span>

After Gaal's expulsion, "the people went out into the field," either to
complete the vintage, or for some other agricultural operation. "They"
(Zebul and his party) sent word of this to Abimelech.

[Judges 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jdg 9:44</span></span>

This verse explains the purpose of both the present and the former
division of Abimelech's forces into several companies, namely, that
while some of the companies attacked the men of Shechem in the field,
another company, starting from their ambush, might occupy the approach
to the city gate, and so cut off their retreat.

[Judges 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jdg 9:45</span></span>

Sowed it with salt - Expressing by this action his hatred, and his wish,
that when utterly destroyed as a city, it might not even be a fruitful
field. Salt is the emblem of barrenness (see the marginal references).

[Judges 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jdg 9:46</span></span>

An hold of the house of the god Berith - As combining the advantages of
a "sanctuary" (compare [Kg1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028).md) and
a fortress. The word rendered "hold" occurs elsewhere only in [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md), where it is rendered
"high-place." Its exact signification is uncertain.

[Judges 9:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jdg 9:48</span></span>

Zalmon - A lofty and thickly-wooded hill, as the etymology of the name
("shady") implies, in the immediate neighborhood of Shechem: perhaps the
same as Ebal. The setting fire to the hold, where the men of Shechem
were all crowded together, with their wives and children, was the
literal fulfillment of Jotham's curse in [Jdg
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#020.md).

[Judges 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jdg 9:50</span></span>

The men of Thebez (modern Tubas) had, doubtless, joined the Shechemites
in their rebellion against Abimelech.

[Judges 9:52](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">jdg 9:52</span></span>

Went hard unto the door ... - i. e. went close to the door. An act of
manifest danger, seeing the roof was covered with persons who would be
likely to throw down missiles of all sorts on the heads of their
assailants. But the hatred of Abimelech, and his thirst for revenge,
made him despise danger.

[Judges 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">jdg 9:53</span></span>

The phrase "all" to is now obsolete, and means "quite," "entirely," as
in Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton.
