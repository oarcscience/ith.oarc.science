Heritage

### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 16:1</span></span>

A couple of donkeys saddled - Those that Mephibosheth and his servant
should have ridden. See [Sa2 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026.md)
note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 16:3</span></span>

Thy master's son - Meaning Saul's grandson [Sa2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#006.md). David asks the question,
evidently hurt at the apparent ingratitude of Mephibosheth. It is
impossible to say whether Mephibosheth was quite guiltless or not. If
Ps. 116 was composed by David, and after the quelling of Absalom's
rebellion, [Sa2 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011.md) may contain
David's confession of his present hasty judgment [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md) in the matter.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 16:5</span></span>

Bahurim - See [Sa2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016.md) note. It seems
to have lain off the road, on a ridge [Sa2
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#013.md), separated from it by a narrow
ravine, so that Shimei was out of easy reach though within hearing, and
within a stone's throw [Sa2 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#006.md), [Sa2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md).

Shimei, the son of Gera - In the title to Ps. 7 he is apparently called
"Cush the Benjamite." On Gera, see [Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md) note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 16:7</span></span>

Come out - Rather, "Go out," namely, of the land, into banishment.
Compare [Jer 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md).

Thou bloody man - See the margin. The Lord's word to David [Ch1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008.md) was probably known to Shimei and
now cast in David's teeth by him, with special reference to the innocent
blood of Uriah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 16:8</span></span>

All the blood of the house of Saul - Shimei probably put to David's
account the death of Saul, and Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,
slain in battle by the Philistines with whom David was in league; of
Ish-bosheth, slain in consequence of David's league with Abner; that of
Abner himself, which he attributed to David's secret orders; and all the
360 slain in the battle between Joab and Abner [Sa2
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#031.md). Some, too, think that the death
of seven men of Saul's immediate family [Sa2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008.md) had occurred before David's
flight, and was referred to by Shimei. Shimei's hatred and virulence is
an indication that the Benjamites resented the loss of royalty in their
tribe, even in the palmiest days of David's monarchy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 16:9</span></span>

This dead dog - See the marginal reference and [Sa2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008.md) note.

Go over - The ravine, possibly with a stream of water [Sa2
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#020.md), which lay between them and
Shimei.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 16:10</span></span>

What have I to do ... - See the marginal references compare [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md); [Joh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md), and a similar complaint about the
sons of Zeruiah [Sa2 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039.md). And for a
like striking incident in the life of the Son of David, see [Luk
9:52-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 16:12</span></span>

His cursing - Another reading has "my curse," i. e., the curse that has
fallen upon me. David recognizes in every word and action that he was
receiving the due reward of his sin, and that which Nathan had foretold.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 16:21</span></span>

Taking possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty
(see [Kg1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022).md). It was also the
greatest offence and insult that could be offered. Such an act on
Absalom's part made reconciliation impossible. A further motive has been
found in this advice, namely, the desire on the part of Ahithophel to
make David taste the bitterness of that cup which he had caused others
(Uriah and all Bath-sheba's family) to drink, and receive the measure
which he had meted withal.
