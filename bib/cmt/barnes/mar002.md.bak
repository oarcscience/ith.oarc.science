### [Mark Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

Into Capernaum - See the notes at [Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md).

After some days - The number of days is not known. Jesus probably
remained long enough in the desert to heal the sick who were brought to
him, and to give instructions to the multitudes who attended his
preaching. Capernaum was not "the city" mentioned in [Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045.md), and it is probable that there
was no difficulty in his remaining there and preaching.

And it was noised ... - He entered the city, doubtless, privately; but
his being there was soon known, and so great had his popularity become
that multitudes pressed to hear him.

[Mark 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 2:2</span></span>

So much as about the door - In the "court" or "yard" before the door.
They could not get near enough to hear him.

Preached the word unto them - The word of God; the revelation or
doctrine which he came to deliver, called "the Word," and "the Word of
God," because it was spoken or revealed by God. Compare [Act
6:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md).

[Mark 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 2:3</span></span>

See this miracle explained in [Mat
9:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md).

Palsy - See the notes at [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

Borne of four - Carried upon a couch [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md) by four men.

[Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md)

The press - The crowd, the multitude of people. Jesus was probably in
the large open area or hall in the center of the house. See the notes at
[Mat 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md). The people pressed into the
area, and blocked up the door so that they could not have access to him.

They uncovered the roof where he was - See the notes at [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md).

When they had broken it up - When they had removed the awning or
covering, so that they could let the man down. See the notes at [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md).

[Mar 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#005.md)

Their faith - Their confidence or belief that he could heal them.

Son - Literally, "child." The Hebrews used the words "son" and "child"
with a great latitude of signification. They were applied to children,
to grandchildren, to adopted children, to any descendants, to disciples,
followers, young people, and to dependents. See the notes at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). In this place it denotes
affection or kindness. It was a word of consolation - an endearing
appellation, applied by the Saviour to the sick man to show his
"compassion," to inspire confidence, and to assure him that he would
heal him.

We never saw it on this fashion - Literally, "We never saw it so." We
never saw anything like this.

[Mark 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 2:13</span></span>

By the sea-side - That is, by the Sea of Tiberias, on the shore of which
Capernaum was situated. See the notes at [Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md).

[Mark 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 2:14</span></span>

Levi, the son of Alpheus - The same, undoubtedly, as "Matthew," the
writer of the gospel which bears his name. It was not uncommon among the
Jews to have two names.

The receipt of custom - See the notes at [Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md).

[Mark 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 2:15</span></span>

Sat at meat in the house - The words "at meat" are not in the original.
The phrase means "as he reclined at his meal," or "as he was eating."
This feast was made by Matthew in honor of the Saviour. See [Luk
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#029.md).

Publicans - See the notes at [Mat
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#047.md).

Sinners - Sinners of abandoned character - of the same character that
publicans commonly sustained - fit companions of publicans - great
sinners.

There were many - That is, many "disciples." Their following him,
leaving their homes, and going with him from place to place, was proof
of their attachment to him. There is no doubt that our Saviour, in the
early part of his ministry, was extremely popular. Multitudes of the
common people attended him, and gave conclusive evidence that they were
his real disciples, and it was only after much opposition from the rich
and the great that he ever became unpopular among the people. Perhaps no
preacher has ever attracted so universal attention, and produced so
decisive effects upon mankind, as did our Lord in his personal ministry.

[Mark 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 2:16</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 9:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012.md).

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast - Were
accustomed often to fast. Compare [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md); [Luk
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012.md).

And they come and say - The disciples of John come, [Mat
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#004.md).

[Mark 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 2:19</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md).

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

See [Mat 12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md).

The cornfields - The fields sown with wheat or barley. The word "corn,"
in the Bible, refers only to grain of that kind, and never to "maize" or
"Indian corn."

To pluck the ears of corn - They were hungry, [Mat
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md). They therefore gathered the
wheat or barley as they walked and rubbed it in their hands to shell it,
and thus to satisfy their appetite. Though our Lord was with them, and
though he had all things at his control, yet he suffered them to resort
to this method of supplying their wants. When Jesus, thus "with" his
disciples, suffered them to be "poor," we may learn that poverty is not
disgraceful; that God often suffers it for the good of his people; and
that he will take care, in some way, that their wants shall be supplied.
It was "lawful" for them thus to supply their needs. Though the property
belonged to another, yet the law of Moses allowed the poor to satisfy
their desires when hungry. See [Deu
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025.md).

[Mar 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#024.md)

That which is not lawful - That is, that which they esteemed to be
unlawful on the "Sabbath day." It was made lawful by Moses, without any
distinction of days, but "they" had denied its lawfulness on the
Sabbath. Christ shows them from their own law that it was "not"
unlawful.

[Mar 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025.md)

Have ye never read ... - See the notes at [Mat
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md).

[Mar 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md)

Abiathar the priest - From [Sa1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md),
it appears that Ahimelech was high priest at the time here referred to.
And from [Sa1 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md), it appears that
"Abiathar" was the son of "Ahimelech." Some difficulty has been felt in
reconciling these accounts. The probable reason as to why Mark says it
was in the days of "Abiathar" is that Abiathar was better known than
Ahimelech. The son of the high priest was regarded as his successor, and
was often associated with him in the duties of his office. It was not
improper, therefore, to designate him as high priest even during the
life of his father, especially as that was the name by which he was
afterward known. "Abiathar," moreover, in the calamitous times when
David came to the throne, left the interest of Saul and fled to David,
bringing with him the ephod, one of the special garments of the high
priest. For a long time, during David's reign, he was high priest, and
it became natural, therefore, to associate "his" name with that of
David; to speak of David as king, and Abiathar the high priest of his
time. This will account for the fact that he was spoken of rather than
his father. At the same time this was strictly true, that this was done
in the days of "Abiathar," who was afterward high priest, and was
familiarly spoken of as such; as we say that "General" Washington was
present at the defeat of Braddock and saved his army, though the title
of "General" did not belong to him until many years afterward. Compare
the notes at [Luk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md).

showbread - See the notes at [Mat
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004.md).

[Mar 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md)

The sabbath was made for man - For his rest from toil, his rest from the
cares and anxieties of the world, to give him an opportunity to call off
his attention from earthly concerns and to direct it to the affairs of
eternity. It was a kind provision for man that he might refresh his body
by relaxing his labors; that he might have undisturbed time to seek the
consolations of religion to cheer him in the anxieties and sorrows of a
troubled world; and that he might render to God that homage which is
most justly due to him as the Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, and
Redeemer of the world. And it is easily capable of proof that no
institution has been more signally blessed to man's welfare than the
Sabbath. To that we owe, more than to anything else, the peace and order
of a civilized community. Where there is no Sabbath there is ignorance,
vice, disorder, and crime. On that holy day the poor and the ignorant,
as well as the learned, have undisturbed time to learn the requirements
of religion, the nature of morals, the law of God, and the way of
salvation. On that day man may offer his praises to the Great Giver of
all good, and in the sanctuary seek the blessing of him whose favor is
life. Where that day is observed in any manner as it should be, order
prevails, morals are promoted, the poor are elevated in their condition,
vice flies away, and the community puts on the appearance of neatness,
industry, morality, and religion. The Sabbath was therefore
pre-eminently intended for man's welfare, and the best interests of
mankind demand that it should be sacredly regarded as an appointment of
merciful heaven intended for our best good, and, where improved aright,
infallibly resulting in our temporal and eternal peace.

Not man for the sabbath - Man was made "first," and then the Sabbath was
appointed for his welfare, [Gen 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001.md).
The Sabbath was not "first" made or contemplated, and then the man made
with reference to that. Since, therefore, the Sabbath was intended for
man's "good," the law respecting it must not be interpreted so as to
oppose his real welfare. It must be explained in consistency with a
proper attention to the duties of mercy to the poor and the sick, and to
those in peril. It must be, however, in accordance with man's "real good
on the whole," and with the law of God. The law of God contemplates
man's "real good on the whole;" and we have no right, under the plea
that the Sabbath was made for man, to do anything contrary to what the
law of God admits. It would not be for our "real good," but for our real
and eternal injury, to devote the Sabbath to vice, to labor, or to
amusement.

[Mar 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028.md)

Therefore the Son of man ... - See the notes at [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008.md).
