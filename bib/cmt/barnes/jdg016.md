### [Judges Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001)

[Judges 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 16:1</span></span>

Gaza - About 8 hours from Eleutheropolis, and one of the chief
strong-holds of the Philistines.

[Judges 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 16:3</span></span>

Instead of forcing the doors open, he tore the posts up, as it were, by
the roots, with the barred doors attached to them. The word rendered
"went away with them," means "to pluck up the tent-pins," and hence, "to
remove." The present town of Gaza (Ghuzzeh) is an open town, without
gates or walls, but the sites of the ancient gates still remain visible.
One of these, on the southeast, is shown as the gate carried off by
Samson.

A partially-isolated hill, about half-an-hour southeast of Gaza, and
standing out from the chain that runs up to Hebron, bears the name of
"Samson's Mount." But it may be doubted whether one of the hills
overlooking Hebron is not rather meant.

[Judges 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 16:4</span></span>

A village to the north of Eleutheropolis, called Caphar-Sotek, was still
existing in the time of Eusebius, near Zorah.

[Judges 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 16:5</span></span>

And the lords of the Philistines - See [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003) note.

His great strength lieth - Rather, "wherein his strength is great."

Eleven hundred pieces of silver - The greatness of the bribe offered to
Delilah, 5,500 shekels of silver, nearly two talents ([Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024), note), shows the importance
attached to Samson's capture.

[Judges 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 16:11</span></span>

Occupied - The margin, "wherewith work hath not been done," is better.

[Judges 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 16:14</span></span>

And she fastened it with the pin ... - The meaning of the verses seems
to be that the seven long plaits, in which Samson's hair was arranged,
were to be woven as a woof into the threads of a warp which stood
prepared on a loom in the chamber, which loom Delilah fastened down with
a pin, so as to keep it firm and immoveable. But Samson, when he awoke,
tore up the pin from its socket, and went away with the loom and the pin
fastened to his hair.

The beam - Rather, the "loom," or "frame." The beam is the wooden
revolving cylinder, on which the cloth is rolled as fast as it is woven,
the Hebrew word for which [Sa1 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007);
[Ch1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#023); [Ch1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005) is quite different from that here
used.

[Judges 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 16:20</span></span>

The possession of his extraordinary strength is ascribed (e. g. [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025)) to the presence of the Spirit
of the Lord. Now the Lord, or the Spirit of the Lord, had departed from
him, and so his strength had gone too. The practical lesson against the
presumption of self-dependence, and the all-importance of a hearty
dependence upon God's Holy Spirit, must not be overlooked.

[Judges 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 16:21</span></span>

Put out his eyes - Thus effectually, as they thought, preventing any
future mischief on his part, while they prolonged their own triumph and
revenge. (Compare [Num 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#014); [Kg2
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007); [Jer
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007).)

They applied to the two feet fetters of brass [Sa2
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#034); [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011), and made him "grind" - the
special task of slaves and captives [Exo
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005); [Isa
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002); [Lam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013).

[Judges 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 16:23</span></span>

Dagon was the national idol of the Philistines [Ch1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010), so called from Dag, a fish. The
description of Dagon, in his temple at Ashdod [Sa1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#004), exactly agrees with the
representations of a fish-god on the walls of Khorsabad, on slabs at
Kouyunjik, and on sundry antique cylinders and gems. In these the
figures vary. Some have a human form down to the waist, with that of a
fish below the waist; others have a human head, arms, and legs, growing,
as it were, out of a fish's body, and so arranged that the fish's head
forms a kind of mitre to the man's head, while the body and fins form a
kind of cloak, hanging down behind.

[Judges 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 16:24</span></span>

Our God ... - A portion of the Philistine triumphal song. Compare Judg.
5; Exo. 15.

[Judges 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 16:25</span></span>

That he may make us sport - Rather, "that he may play for us," i. e.
dance and make music. At an idolatrous feast, dancing was always
accompanied with vocal and instrumental music.

[Judges 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 16:26</span></span>

More literally, "let me rest, and let me feel the pillars, that I may
lean upon them." He feigned weariness with his dancing and singing, and
asked to recover himself by leaning against the pillars. The flat roof,
from the top of which, as well as under it, spectators could see what
was being done on the stage in front, was mainly supported by two
pillars. The lords and principal persons sat UNDER the roof, while the
people, to the number of 3,000, stood ON the flat roof. When the pillars
were removed, the weight of 3,000 people brought the roof down with a
fearful crash, and those above fell together with the stones and timbers
upon those below, and a great slaughter was the result, Samson himself
perishing under the ruins.

[Judges 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 16:28</span></span>

At once avenged - "i. e. with one final revenge." These words do not
breathe the spirit of the Gospel, but they express a sentiment, natural
to the age, knowledge, and character of Samson.

[Judges 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 16:31</span></span>

"All the house of his father," in connection with "his brethren," must
mean the whole tribe of Dan, aiding his nearer relations. The Danites,
taking advantage of the consternation of the Philistines, and of the
death of their lords and chief men, went down in force to Gaza, and
recovered the body of their great captain and judge, and buried him in
his father's sepulchre.
