### [Ezekiel Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 36:0</span></span>

[Eze 36:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md) is the contrast to the
preceding. Now, when the prophet speaks, Judaea is waste. The pagan
nations around, and Edom in particular, rejoice in scorn: but the land
of Israel is a holy land given by Yahweh to His people, and it shall be
theirs. The promises are those of temporal blessings; and although these
temporal blessings were typical of Messiah's reign, yet we may not doubt
that this prophecy had for its first object the return of prosperity to
the land and to the people, after their return from Babylon.

[Ezekiel 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 36:1</span></span>

The "mountains of Israel" are opposed to "Seir," the mount of Edom [Eze
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 36:3</span></span>

The residue of the pagan - Those of the surrounding nations which had
survived Jerusalem's fall, and may have profited by it.

[Ezekiel 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 36:6</span></span>

The shame of the pagan - The taunts which the pagan heaped upon them.

[Ezekiel 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 36:7</span></span>

I have lifted up mine hand - i. e., I have sworn. Compare marginal
reference.

Their shame - They shall find their taunts come home to themselves.

[Ezekiel 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 36:8</span></span>

They are at hand to come - i. e., under Zerubbabel.

[Ezekiel 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 36:13</span></span>

The judgments which God sent upon the land, had so destroyed the
inhabitants that men deemed it a fatal land, which brought destruction
to all that should occupy it (compare [Kg2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025).md).

[Ezekiel 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 36:14</span></span>

Bereave - Or, as in the margin: i. e., the land shall not prove the ruin
of its inhabitants by tempting them (as of old time) to the sin of
idolatry.

[Ezekiel 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 36:15</span></span>

Hear in thee the shame of the pagan - Hear the pagan putting thee to
shame by their contemptuous words.

The reproach of the people - "Thy people" (thy rightful possessors)
shall have no cause to reproach thee for want of fertility. Were the
blessings promised here merely temporal they could not be said to be
fulfilled. The land is still subject to pagan masters. The words must
point to blessings yet future, spiritual blessings.

In the following chapters to the end of Ezek. 39 the conflict between
the world mid God is described in its most general form, and the
absolute triumph of the kingdom of God fully depicted. The honor of God
is asserted in the gathering together, and the purification of, His
people. As the dispersion of the children of Israel was far wider and
more lasting than the sojourn in Chaldaea, so the reunion here predicted
is far more extensive and complete. The dispersion yet continues, the
reunion will be in those days when Israel shall be gathered into the
Church of God.

[Ezekiel 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 36:16</span></span>

The defilement of the people described in order to its removal.

[Eze 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md)

They profaned my holy name - Caused it to be dishonored by the pagan who
said in scorn, "This is the people of God." The pagan, seeing the
miserable state of the exiles, fancied that Yahweh was no more than a
national god, powerless to protect his subjects.

[Ezekiel 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 36:21</span></span>

I had pity for mine holy name - Render it: I "had" a pitiful regard to
"Mine Holy Name."

[Ezekiel 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 36:25</span></span>

Ezekiel the priest has in view the purifying rites prescribed by the
Law, the symbolic purport of which is exhibited in [Heb
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). As the Levites were consecrated
with sprinkling of water, so should the approved rite "sprinkling of
water" thus prescribed by the Law and explained by the prophets, give
occasion to the use of water at the admission of proselytes in later
days, and so to its adoption by John in his baptism unto repentance. It
was hallowed by our Lord when in His discourse with Nicodemus,
referring, no doubt, to such passages as these, He showed their
application to the Church of which He was about to be the Founder; and
when He appointed Baptism as the sacrament of admission into that
Church. In this sacrament the spiritual import of the legal ordinance is
displayed - the second birth by water and the Spirit. As Israel
throughout the prophecy of Ezekiel prefigures the visible Church of
Christ, needing from time to time trim or purification - so does the
renovated Israel represent Christ's mystical Church [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md). The spiritual character of the
renovation presumes a personal application of the prophet's words, which
is more thoroughly brought out under the new covenant (e. g., [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md). Thus the prophecy of Ezekiel
furnishes a medium through which we pass from the congregation to the
individual, from the letter to the spirit, from the Law to the Gospel,
from Moses to Christ.

[Ezekiel 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 36:28</span></span>

Ye shall be my people - (Compare [Co2
6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md). The writers of the New Testament
appropriated these and similar phrases of the Old Testament to the
Church of Christ. Between the restoration of the Jews (the first step)
there are many steps toward the end - the spread of Christ's Church
throughout the world, the conversion of the Gentiles, and the
acknowledgment of the true God - which justify men in looking forward to
a time when the Gospel shall be preached in all the world, and the earth
become the kingdom of God in a fuller sense than it has ever yet been.
But all these are "steps." Our prophecies look beyond all this to a new
heaven to a new earth, and to a new Jerusalem [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 36:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">eze 36:36</span></span>

The pagan that are left - Gathered out of pagandom into the community of
God - accepted and redeemed.

[Ezekiel 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 36:37</span></span>

Their sin had prevented God's hearing them. Now their purification opens
God's ears to their words.

[Ezekiel 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 36:38</span></span>

As the holy flock - A reference to the flocks and herds brought up to
Jerusalem to be consecrated and offered unto the Lord [Ch2
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md). Thus, the idea is brought out:

\(1\) of the multiplication of the people,

\(2\) of their dedication to the service of God.
