### [Ezra Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 1:1</span></span>

By the first year of Cyrus is to be understood the first year of his
sovereignty over the Jews, or 538 B.C.

[Ezra 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 1:2</span></span>

The Lord God of heaven - Or, "Yahweh, the God of heaven." In the
original Persian, the document probably ran - " Ormazd, the God of
heaven." The Hebrew transcript took "Yahweh" as the equivalent of
"Ormazd." The Persian notion of a single Supreme Being - Ahura-Mazda,
"the much-knowing, or much-bestowing Spirit" - did, in fact, approach
nearly to the Jewish conception of Yahweh.

Hath given me all the kingdoms ... - There is a similar formula at the
commencement of the great majority of Persian inscriptions.

He hath charged me to build him an house - It is a reasonable conjecture
that, on the capture of Babylon, Cyrus was brought into contact with
Daniel, who drew his attention to the prophecy of Isaiah [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); and that Cyrus accepted this
prophecy as a "charge" to rebuild the temple.

[Ezra 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 1:4</span></span>

Let the men of his place help him - i. e., "Let the pagan population
help him" (see [Ezr 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#006).md).

The freewill offering - Probably that made by Cyrus himself [Ezr
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md).

[Ezra 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 1:5</span></span>

Only a portion of the Israelites took advantage of the permission of
Cyrus. Many remained in Babylon, since they were disinclined to
relinquish their property. They who returned were persons whom God had
especially stirred up to make sacrifices for His glory.

[Ezra 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 1:7</span></span>

The house of his gods - Rather, "of his god" [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md), i. e., Merodach, "his lord" (see
[Ch2 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007) note.md).

[Ezra 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 1:8</span></span>

Mithredath - Or, "Mithridates." The occurrence of this name, which means
"given by Mithra" or "dedicated to Mithra," is an indication that the
sun-worship of the Persians was at least as old as the time of Cyrus.

Sheshbazzar - i. e., Zerubbabel. On his royal descent, see [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md) note.

[Ezra 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 1:9</span></span>

Chargers - The word in the original thus translated occurs only in this
passage. Its meaning is doubtful. Some derive it from a Hebrew root, "to
hollow out," and translate "cup" or "vessel."

Knives - This is another doubtful word, only used here. The etymology
points to some employment of basket-work.

[Ezra 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 1:11</span></span>

The sum of the numbers as they stand in the present Hebrew text is
2,499, instead of 5,400. In the Apocryphal Book of Esdras the sum given
is 5,469, and with this sum the items in that place exactly agree (1
Esdras 2:13, 14). Most commentators propose to correct Ezra by the
passage of Esdras; but the items of Esdras are improbable. Probably the
sum total in the present passage has suffered corruption.
