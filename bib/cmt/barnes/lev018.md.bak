### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 18:2</span></span>

I am, the Lord your God - The frequent repetition of this formula in
these parts of the Law may be intended to keep the Israelites in mind of
their covenant with Yahweh in connection with the common affairs of
life, in which they might be tempted to look at legal restrictions in a
mere secular light.

[Leviticus 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 18:3</span></span>

See the [Lev 18:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md) note.

[Leviticus 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 18:5</span></span>

If a man keeps the "statutes" (i. e. the ordinances of [Lev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#004).md) and "judgments" of the divine
law, he shall not be "cut off from his people" (compare [Lev
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029).md), he shall gain true life, the
life which connects him with Yahweh through his obedience. See the
margin reference and [Luk 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md); [Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md); [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md).

[Leviticus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 18:6</span></span>

Near of kin - See the margin. The term was evidently used to denote
those only who came within certain limits of consanguinity, together
with those who by affinity were regarded in the same relationship.

To uncover their nakedness - i. e. to have sexual intercourse. The
immediate object of this law was to forbid incest.

[Leviticus 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 18:7</span></span>

Or - It might be rendered "and", or rather, even; that is, which belongs
to both parents as being "one flesh" ([Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md); compare [Lev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md), [Lev
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014).md). These prohibitions are
addressed to men.

[Leviticus 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 18:8</span></span>

Compare the case of Reuben, [Gen
49:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md). See [Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md).

[Leviticus 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 18:9</span></span>

Thy sister - What was here spoken of was the distinguishing offence of
the Egyptians.

[Leviticus 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 18:12</span></span>

Thy father's sister - The instance of Amram and Jochebed [Exo
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md) seems to show that marriage with
an aunt was not considered wrong by the Israelites when they were in
Egypt.

[Leviticus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 18:16</span></span>

Thy brother's wife - That is, if she had children. See [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). The law here expressed was
broken by Antipas in his connection with Herodias [Mat
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003.md).

[Leviticus 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 18:18</span></span>

To vex her - literally, to "bind" or "pack together". The Jewish
commentators illustrate this by the example of Leah and Rachel [Gen
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#030.md).

[Leviticus 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 18:21</span></span>

Molech - See the note at [Lev 20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 18:24</span></span>

The land designed and consecrated for His people by Yahweh [Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023.md) is here impersonated, and
represented as vomiting forth its present inhabitants, in consequence of
their indulgence in the abominations that have been mentioned. The
iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See [Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md); compare [Isa
24:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md). The Israelites in this place,
and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the
ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His
people. Compare [Lev 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md). It is upon
this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile
themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here
pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their
iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand
this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or
outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate
forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people
in covenant with Yahweh. See [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md) note. The course which the Law
here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the
individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then Lev. 20
to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as
represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation.
