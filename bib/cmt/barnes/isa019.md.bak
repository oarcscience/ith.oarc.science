### [Isaiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 19:0</span></span>

This prophecy respecting Egypt extends only through this chapter. Its
general scope and design is plain. It is intended to describe the
calamities that would come upon Egypt, and the effect which they would
have in turning the people to God. The scene is laid in Egypt; and the
following things passed before the mind of the prophet in vision:

1\. He sees Yahweh coming in a cloud to Egypt [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md).

2\. The effect of this is to produce alarm among the idols of that
nation [Isa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md).

3\. A state of intrnal commotion and discord is described as existing in
Egypt; a state of calamity so great that they would seek relief from
their idols and necro-mancers [Isa
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md).

4\. The consequence of these dissensions and internal strifes would be,
that they would be subdued by a foreign and cruel prince [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md).

5\. To these political calamities there would be added "physical"
sufferings [Isa 19:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md) - the Nile
would be dried up, and all that grew on its banks would wither [Isa
19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md); those who had been accustomed
to fish in the Nile would be thrown out of employment [Isa
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md); and those that were engaged in
the manufacture of linen would, as a consequence, be driven from
employment [Isa 19:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#009.md).

6\. All counsel and wisdom would fail from the nation, and the kings and
priests be regarded as fools [Isa
19:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md).

7\. The land of Judah would become a terror to them [Isa
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017.md).

8\. This would be followed by the conversion of many of the Egyptians to
the true religion [Isa 19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md);
Yahweh would become their protector, and would repair the breaches that
had been made, and remove the evils which they had experienced [Isa
19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021.md), and a strong alliance would
be formed between the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Jews, which
should secure the divine blessing and favor [Isa
19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md).

This is the outline of the prophecy. In regard to the "time" when it was
delivered, we have no certain knowledge. Lowth supposes that it refers
to times succeeding the destruction of the army of Sennacherib. After
that event, he says, the affairs of Egypt were thrown into confusion;
intestine broils succeeded; these were followed by a tyranny of twelve
princes, who divided the country between them, until the distracted
affairs settled down under the dominion of Psammetichus, who held the
scepter for fifty-four years. Not long after this, the country was
invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar; and then by the Persians under
Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. Alexander the Great subsequently invaded and
took the country, and made Alexandria the capital of his empire. Many
Jews were invited there by Alexander, and under the favor of the
Ptolemies they flourished there; the true religion became prevalent in
the land, and multitudes of the Egyptians, it is supposed, were
converted to the Jewish faith.

Dr. Newton ("Diss. xii. on the Prophecies") supposes, that there was a
"general" reference here to the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, and a
"particular" reference to the conquest under Cambyses the son of Cyrus.
He supposes that the anarchy described in [Isa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md), refers to the civil wars which
arose between Apries and Amasis in the time of Nebuchadnezzars invasion,
and the civil wars between Tachos, Nectanebus, and the Mendesians, a
little before the country was subdued by Ochus. The cruel king mentioned
in [Isa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), into whose hands they
were delivered, he supposes was Nebuchadnezzar, or more probably
Cambyses and Ochus, one of whom put the yoke on the neck of the
Egyptians, and the other riveted it there. The Egyptians say that
Cambyses, after he killed Apis, a god worshipped in Egypt, was stricken
with madness; but his actions, says Prideaux, show that he was mad long
before. Ochus was the most cruel of the kings of Persia. The final
deliverance of the nation, and the conversion to the true God, and the
alliance between Egypt, Assyria and Israel [Isa
19:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md), he supposes, refers to the
deliverance that would be introduced by Alexander the Great, and the
protection that would be shown to the Jews in Egypt under the Ptolemies.

Vitringa, Gesenius, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and others, suppose that the
anarchy described in [Isa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md), refers
to the discord which arose in the time of the δωδεκαρχία dōdekarchia, or
the reign of the twelve kings, until Psammetichus prevailed over the
rest, and that he is intended by the 'cruel lord' and 'fierce king,'
described in [Isa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md). In other
respects, their interpretation of the prophecy coincides, in the main,
with that proposed by Dr. Newton.

A slight glance at some of the leading events in the history of Egypt,
may enable us more clearly to determine the application of the different
parts of the prophecy.

Egypt, a well-known country in Africa, is, for the most part, a great
valley through which the Nile pours its waters from south to north, and
is skirted on the east and west by ranges of mountains which approach or
recede more or less from the river in different parts. Where the valley
terminates toward the north, the Nile divides itself, about forty or
fifty miles from the Mediterranean, into several parts, enclosing the
territory called the Delta - so called because the various streams
flowing from the one river diverge as they flow toward the sea, and thus
form with the coast a triangle in the shape of the Greek letter Δ D. The
southern limit of Egypt proper is Syene [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md), or Essuan, the border of
Ethiopia. Here the Nile issues from the granite rocks of the cataracts
and enters Egypt proper. This is N. lat. 24 degrees.

Egypt was anciently divided into forty-two "nomes" or districts, which
were little provinces or counties. It was also divided into Upper and
Lower Egypt. Upper Egypt was called Thebais, from Thebes the capital,
and extended south to the frontier of Ethiopia. Lower Egypt contained
principally the Delta and the parts on the Mediterranean. The capital
was Cairo.

The most common division, however, was into three parts, Lower, Middle,
and Upper Egypt. In Lower Egypt, lying on the Mediterranean, were the
cities of Pithon, Raamses, Heliopolis, etc. In this division, also, was
the land of Goshen. In Middle Egypt was Moph, or Memphis, Hanes, etc. In
Upper Egypt was No-Ammon, or Thebes, and Syene, the southern limit of
Egypt.

The ancient history of Egypt is obscure. It is agreed on all hands,
however, that it was the early seat of civilization; and that this
civilization was introduced from the south, and especially from Meroe.
The country in the earliest times was possessed by several kings or
states, which were at length united into one great kingdom. Not long
after the death of Joseph, it came into the possession of the Hyksos or
Shepherd kings, probably an Arabian nomadic tribe. After they were
driven out, the whole country came again under one sovereign, and
enjoyed great prosperity. The first king of the 19th dynasty, as it is
called by Manetho, was the celebrated Sesostris, about 1500 years b.c.
His successors were all called by the general name of Pharaoh, that is,
kings. The first who is mentioned by his proper name is Shishak [Kg1
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md), supposed to be the
Sesonchosis of Manetho, who reigned about 970 years b.c. Geseuius says,
that in the time of the Jewish king Hezekiah, there reigned at the same
time in Egypt three dynasties; an Ethiopic (probably over Upper Egypt),
a Saitish, and a Tanitish dynasty - of which at last sprung the
dodekarchy, and whose dominion ultimately lost itself in the single
reign of Psammetichus. The Ethiopic continued forty years, and consisted
of three kings - Sabaco, Sevechus, and Tarakos, or Tearko - of which the
two last are mentioned in the Bible, Sevechus under the name of So, סוא
sô' probably סוא seve' Sevechus - as the ally of Hosea, king of Israel
[Kg2 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md), 722 b.c., and Tarakos the
same as Tirhakah, about the time of the 16th year of the reign of
Hezekiah (714 b.c.) Instead of this whole dynasty, Herodotus (ii. 137,
139), and Diodorus (i. 65), give us only one name, that of Sabaco.
Contemporary with these were the four, or according to Eusebius, five,
first kings of the dynasty of Saite, Stephinates, Nerepsus, Nichao I,
who was slain by an Ethiopian king, and Psammetichus, who made an end of
the dodekarchy, and reigned fifty-four years.

Of the Tanitish dynasty, Psammus and Zeth are mentioned (Introduction to
Isa. 19) Different accounts are given of the state of things by
Herodotus and by Dioaorus. The account by Diodorus, which is the most
probable, is, that a state of anarchy prevailed in Egypt for two whole
years; and that the troubles and commotions suggested to the older men
of the country the expediency of assuming the reins of government, and
restoring order to the state. With this view, twelve of the most
influential men were chosen to preside with regal power. Each had a
particular province allotted to him, in which his authority was
permanent; and though independent of one another, they bound themselves
with mutual oaths to concord and fidelity.

During fifteen years, their relations were maintained with entire
harmony: but during that time Psammetichus whose province extended to
the Mediterranean, had availed himself of his advantages, and had
maintained extensive commercial contact with the Phenicians and Greeks,
and had amassed considerable wealth. Of this his colleagues became
jealous, and supposing that he meant to secure the government of the
whole country, they resolved to deprive him of his province. They,
therefore, prepared to attack him, and he was thrown upon the necessity
of self defense. Apprised of their designs, he sent to Arabia, Caria,
and Ionia, for aid, and having secured a large body of troops, he put
himself at their head, and gave battle to his foes at Momemphis, and
completely defeated them, drove them from the kingdom, and took
possession of an undivided throne (Diod. i. 66). The account of
Herodotus may be seen in his history (ii. 154). Psammetichus turned his
attention to the internal administration of the country, and endeavored
to ingratiate himself with the priesthood and the people by erecting
splendid monuments, and beautifying the sacred edifices. There was a
strong jealousy, however, excited by the fact that he was inbebted for
his crown to foreign troops, and from the fact that foreigners were
preferred to office over the native citizens (Diod. i. 67). A large part
of his troops - to the number according to Diodorus, of 240,000 -
abandoned his service at one time, and moved off in a body to Ethiopia,
and entered the service of the monarch of that country. His reign
appears to have been a military despotism, and though liberal in its
policy toward foreign governments, yet the severity of his government at
home, and the injustice which the Egyptians supposed he showed to them
in relying on foreigners, and preferring them, justified the appellation
in [Isa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), that he was a 'cruel
lord.'

Egypt was afterward conquered by Cambyses, and became a province of the
Persian empire about 525 b.c. Thus it continued until it was conquered
by Alexander the Great, 350 b.c., after whose death it formed, together
with Syria, Palestine, Lybia, etc., the kingdom of the Ptolemies. After
the battle of Actium, 30 b.c. it became a Roman province. In 640 a.d.,
it was conquered by the Arabs, and since that time it has passed from
the bands of the Caliphs into the hands of the Turks, and since 1517
a.d. it has been regarded as a province of the Turkish empire. This is
an outline of the principal events of the Egyptian history. The events
predicted in this chapter will be stated in their order in the comments
on the particular verses. The two leading points which will guide our
interpretation will be, that Psammetichus is intended in [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), and that the effects of
Alexander's conquest of Egypt are denoted from [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md) to the end of the chapter.
Keeping these two points in view, the interpretation of the chapter will
be easy. On the history of Egypt, and the commotions and revolutions
there, the reader may consult Wilkinson's "Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Egyptians," vol. i., particularly pp. 143-180.

[Isaiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 19:1</span></span>

The burden of Egypt - This is the title to the prophecy. For the meaning
of the word "burden," see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md). The word 'Egypt' in the original
is מצרים mı̂tserayı̂m; and it was so called after Mizraim the second son
of Ham, and grandson of Noah. Sometimes it is called Mazor [Kg2
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024.md); [Isa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md); [Isa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025.md); [Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012.md); where, however, our English
version has rendered the word by "besieged place or fortress." The
ancient name of the country among the inhabitants themselves was "Chimi
or Chami" (Χημυ Chēmu). The Egyptian word signified "black," and the
name was probably given from the black deposit made by the slime of the
Nile. 'Mizraim, or Misrim, the name given to Egypt in the Scriptures, is
in the plural form, and is the Hebrew mede of expressing the "two
regions of Egypt" (so commonly met with in the hieroglyphics), or the
"two Misr," a name still used by the Arabs, who call all Egypt, as well
as Cairo, Musr or Misr.' (Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," vol. i. p.
2). The origin of the name 'Egypt' is unknown. Egyptus is said by some
to have been an ancient king of this country.

Behold, the Lord - This is a bold introduction. Yahweh is seen advancing
to Egypt for the purpose of confounding its idols, and inflicting
punishment. The leading idea which the prophet wishes probably to
present is, that national calamities - anarchy, commotion, revolution,
as well as physical sufferings - are under the government and direction
of Yahweh.

Rideth upon a swift cloud - Yahweh is often thus represented as riding
on a cloud, especially when he comes for purposes of vengeance or
punishment:

And he rode upon a cherub and did fly,

Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

[Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

Who maketh the clouds his chariot,

Who walketh upon the wings of the wind.

[Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md)

'I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of Man came
with the clouds of heaven' [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md).
So the Saviour is represented as coming to judgment in the clouds of
heaven [Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md). Compare the sublime
description in [Hab 3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md).

And the idols of Egypt - It is well known that Egypt was celebrated for
its idolatry. They worshipped chiefly the heavenly bodies; but they
worshipped also all kinds of animals, probably as living symbols of
their gods. "Shall be moved." That is, shall tremble, be agitated,
alarmed; or shall be removed from their place, and overthrown. The word
will bear either construction. Vitringa inclines to the latter.

And the heart of Egypt - The strength; the courage; the rigor. We use
the word "heart" in the same sense now, when we speak of a stout heart;
a courageous heart, etc.

Shall melt - The word used here denotes "to dissolve;" and is applied to
the heart when its courage fails - probably from the sensation of
weakness or fainting. The fact alluded to here was probably the
disheartening circumstances that attended the civil commotions in Egypt,
when the people felt themselves oppressed by cruel rulers. See the
Analysis of the chapter.

[Isaiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 19:2</span></span>

And I will set - (סכסכתי sı̂ksaketı̂y). This word (from סכך sākak) means
properly "to cover," to spread over, to hide, conceal, to protect.
Another signification of the verb is, to weave, to intermingle. It may
mean here, 'I will arm the Egyptians against each other' (Gesenius); or,
as in our version, 'I will mingle, confound, or throw them into discord
and strife.' The Septuagint renders it, Ἐπεγερθήσονται Epegerthēsontai -
'They shall be excited,' or, 'raised up.' Symmachus, Συμβαλῶ Sumbalō.
Syriac and Chaldee, 'I will excite.' The sense is, that there would be
discord and civil war, and this is traced to the agency or overruling
providence of God - meaning that he would "permit and overrule" it.
Compare the notes at [Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md) : 'I
make peace, and I create evil; I, Yahweh, do all these things;' [Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006.md) : 'Shall there be evil in a city
and Jehovah hath not done it?' The civil war here referred to was
probably that which arose between the twelve kings in the time of the
dodekarchy (see the Analysis to the chapter), and which resulted in the
single dominion of Psammetichus. Dr. Newton ("On the Prophecies," xii.)
supposes, however, that the prophet refers to the civil wars between
Apries and Amasis at the time of the invasion by Nebuchadnezzar. But it
agrees much better with the former discord than with this. The
description which follows is that of anarchy or civil strife, where
"many" parties are formed, and would naturally lead to the supposition
that there were more than two engaged.

And kingdom against kingdom - Septuagint, Νόμος έπὶ νόμων Nomos epi
nomōn - 'Nome against nomes.' Egypt was formerly divided into forty-two
"nomes" or districts. The version by the Septuagint was made in Egypt,
and the translators would naturally employ the terms which were in
common use. Still the event referred to was probably not that of one
"nome" contending against another, but a civil war in which one dynasty
would be excited against another (Gesenius), or when there would be
anarchy and strife among the different members of the dodekarchy. See
the Analysis of the chapter.

[Isaiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 19:3</span></span>

And the spirit of Egypt - (see [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001).md). They shall be exhausted with
their long internal contentions and strifes; and seeing no prospect of
deliverance, and anxious that the turmoils should end, they shall seek
counsel and refuge in their gods and necromancers, but in vain.

Shall fail - (נבקה nâbeqâh). Margin, 'Be emptied.' The word means,
literally, "to pour out, empty, depopulate." Here it means that they
would become disheartened and discouraged.

And I will destroy - Margin, as the Hebrew, 'I will swallow up.' So the
word is used in [Psa 107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027.md), 'All
their wisdom is destroyed' (Hebrew, 'swallowed up. ')

And they shall seek to the idols - According to Herodotus (ii. 152),
Psammetichus had consulted the oracle of Latona at Butos, and received
for answer that the sea should avenge his cause by producing brazen men.
Some time after, a body of Ionians and Carians were compelled by stress
of weather to touch at Egypt, and landed there, clad in brass armor.
Some Egyptians, alarmed at their appearance, came to Psammetichus, and
described them as brazen men who had risen from the sea, and were
plundering the country. He instantly supposed that this was the
accomplishment of the oracle, and entered into an alliance with the
strangers, and by their aid was enabled to obtain the victory over his
foes. Compare the different accounts of Diodorus in the Analysis of this
chapter. The whole history of Egypt shows how much they were accustomed
to consult their idols (see Herodot. ii. 54ff, 82, 83, 139, 152).
Herodotus says (ii. 83), that the art of divination in Egypt was
confined to certain of their deities. There were in that country the
oracles of Hercules, of Apollo, of Mars, of Diana, and of Jupiter; but
the oracle of Latona in Butos was held in greater veneration than any of
the rest.

And to the charmers - (אטים 'ı̂ṭı̂ym). This word occurs nowhere else. The
root אטט 'âṭaṭ, in Arabic, means "to mutter, to make a gentle noise;"
and this word probably denotes conjurors, diviners (see the note at [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md). The Septuagint renders it,
'Their idols.'

And to them that have familiar spirits - (see the note at [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md). The Septuagint renders this,
'Those who speak from the ground.'

And to the wizards - Septuagint - Ἐγγαστριμύθους Engastrimuthous -
'Ventriloquists.' The Hebrew word means a wise man, a soothsayer, a
magician (ידענים yı̂dı̂‛onı̂ym from ידע yâda‛ "to know;" see [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md); [Lev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md); [Deu
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011).md). This fake science abounded in
Egypt, and in most Oriental countries.

[Isaiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 19:4</span></span>

And the Egyptians - The Egyptian nation; the entire people, though
divided into factions and contending with each other.

Will I give over - Margin, 'Shut up.' The Hebrew word (סכר sākar)
usually has the sense of shutting up, or closing. Here it means that
these contentions would be "closed" or concluded by their being
delivered to of a single master. The Septuagint renders it, Παραδώσω
Paradōsō - 'I will surrender.'

Into the hands of a cruel lord - Hebrew, 'Lords of cruelty, or
severity.' The word rendered 'lord,' meaning master, is in the Hebrew in
the plural number (אדנים 'ădônı̂y). It is, however, generally supposed
that it is pluralis excellentiae - denoting majesty and dignity, and
applicable to a "single" monarch. The connection requires this, for the
state here described would be different from that where "many" rule, and
it seems to suppose that "one" should succeed to the many who had been
contending. In the parallel member, also, a name in the singular number
is used - 'a fierce king;' and as this evidently denotes the same, it
follows that the word here is used to denote a single monarch. The
plural form is often thus used in the Hebrew (see [Psa
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md); [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md). God here claims jurisdiction
over the nation, and says that "he" will do it - a most striking
illustration of the power which he asserts over contending people to
deliver them to whomsoever he will.

Dr. Newton supposes that this was Nebuchadnezzar, or more properly
Cambyses, by whom Egypt was made subject to the authority of Persia, and
who was eminently a cruel man, a madman. But the more probable
interpretation is that which refers it to Psammetichus. twelve kings
were in contention, of whom he was one. He called in the aid of the
Arabians, the pirates of Caria and Iona (Herodot. ii. 152; see the
Analysis of the chapter; Diod. i. 66). This was in the twentieth year of
the reign of Manasseh. Psammetichus reigned fifty-four years and was
succeeded by Nechus his son, called in Scripture Pharaoh-Necho, and
often mentioned under that name. Psammetichus, during a considerable
part of his reign, was engaged in wars with Assyria and Palestine. He is
here called a 'cruel lord;' that is, an oppressive monarch, probably
because he secured the kingdom by bringing in to his aid foreign
mercenaries - robbers and pirates, and because his wars made his
government oppressive and burdensome.

A fierce king - Hebrew, 'A king of strength' - a description
particularly applicable to one who, like Psammetichus, had subdued
eleven rivals, and who had obtained the kingdom by conquest.

[Isaiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 19:5</span></span>

And the waters shall fail - Here commences a description of the
"physical" calamities that would come upon the land, which continues to
[Isa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md). The previous verses
contained an account of the national calamities by civil wars. It may be
observed that discord, anarchy, and civil wars, are often connected with
physical calamities; as famine, drought, pestilence. God has the
elements, as well as the hearts of people, under his control; and when
he chastises a nation, he often mingles anarchy, famine, discord, and
the pestilence together. Often, too, civil wars have a "tendency" to
produce these calamities. They annihilate industry, arrest enterprise,
break up plans of commerce, and divert the attention of people from the
cultivation of the soil. This might have been in part the case in Egypt;
but it would seem also that God, by direct agency, intended to afflict
them by drying up their streams in a remarkable manner.

From the sea - The parallelism here, as well as the whole scope of the
passage, requires us to understand this of the Nile. The word ים yâm is
sometimes used to denote a large river (see the notes at [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002).md). The Nile is often called a sea.
Thus Pliny ("Nat. Hist." ii. 35) says, 'The water of the Nile resembles
the sea.' Thus, Seneca ("Quaest. Nat." v. 2) says, 'By continued
accessions of water, it stagnates (stagnat) into the appearance of a
broad and turbid sea.' Compare Herodot. ii. 97; Diod. i. 12, 96; 'To
this day in Egypt, the Nile is el-Bahr, "the sea," as its most common
appellation.' 'Our Egyptian servant,' says Dr. Robinson, 'who spoke
English, always called it "the sea."' ("Bib. Rescarches," vol. i. 542).

And the river - The Nile.

Shall be wasted - This does not mean "entirely," but its waters would
fail so as to injure the country. It would not "overflow" in its
accustomed manner, and the consequence would be, that the land would be
desolate. It is well known that Egypt derives its great fertility
entirely from the overflowing of the Nile. So important is this, that a
public record is made at Cairo of the daily rise of the water. When the
Nile rises to a less height than twelve cubits, a famine is the
inevitable consequence, for then the water does not overflow the land.
When it rises to a greater height than sixteen cubits, a famine is
almost as certain - for then the superabundant waters are not drained
off soon enough to allow them to sow the seed. The height of the
inundation, therefore, that is necessary in order to insure a harvest,
is from twelve to sixteen cubits. The annual overflow is in the month of
August. The prophet here means that the Nile would not rise to the
height that was desirable - or the waters should "fail" - and that the
consequence would be a famine.

[Isaiah 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 19:6</span></span>

And they shall turn the rivers far away - (האזיּחוּ he'ezenı̂ychû),
probably from זנח zânach, "to have an offensive smell; to be rancid, or
putrid." The word in this form occurs nowhere else. It is in the Hiphil
conjugation, and is probably a form made from a mixture with the
Chaldee. The sense is not doubtful. It means 'the rivers shall become
putrid - or have an offensive smell;' that is, shall become stagnant,
and send forth unwholesome "miasmata" producing sickness, as stagnant
waters often do. The Vulgate renders it, 'And the rivers shall fail.'
The Septuagint, 'And the Egyptians shall drink the waters from the sea,
but the river shall fail, and be dried up, and the rivers shall fail,
and the streams (διὼρυχες diōruches) of the river, and all the
assembling (συναγωγή sunagōgē) waters shall be dried up.'

And the brooks of defense - Hebrew, 'The rivers of מצור mâtsôr. The word
מצור mâtsôr often means "straitness, affliction;" then a siege, a wall,
a bulwark, a fortification. But, probably, it here means "Egypt," or the
same as מצרים mı̂tserayı̂m (compare [Isa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025.md); [Kg2
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#024.md); [Mar
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#012).md). Perhaps the Hebrews may have
thought of Egypt as a strongly fortified place, and thus have given the
name to it; or possibly this may have been a modification of the name
"Mitsraim."

The reeds and flags - Which grew on the banks of the Nile - the papyrus,
etc. (see the note at [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002).md)

[Isaiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 19:7</span></span>

The paper reeds - (ערות ‛ârôt). This is not the word which occurs in
[Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md), and which, it is supposed,
means there the papyrus (see the note on that place). Interpreters have
been divided in regard to the meaning of the word here. Gesenius derives
it from ערה ‛ârâh, "to be naked, open, bare;" and supposes that it means
an open place, a place naked of wood, and that it here denotes the
pastures on the banks of the Nile. So Rosenmuller interprets it of the
green pastures on the banks of the Nile; and the Hebrew commentators
generally so understand it. The Vulgate renders it, 'And the bed
(alveus) of the river shall be dried up from the fountain.' So the
Chaldee, 'And their streams shall be desolate.' It probably denotes, not
paper reeds, but the green pastures that were beside the brooks, or
along the banks of the Nile.

By the brooks - Hebrew, 'Rivers' (יארי ye'orēy). By the 'brooks' here,
in the plural number, the prophet probably means the artificial canals
which were cut in every direction from the Nile for the purpose of
conveying the waters to various parts of the land.

By the mouth of the brooks - At the mouth of the canals, or where they
emptied into the Nile. Such meadows, being "near" the Nile, and most
sure of a supply of water, would be more valuable than those which were
remote, and are, therefore, particularly specified.

Shall wither ... - That is, there shall be utter and entire desolation.
If the Nile ceased to overflow; if the streams, reservoirs, and canals,
could not be filled, this would follow as a matter of course. Everything
would dry up.

[Isaiah 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 19:8</span></span>

The fishers also - In this verse, and the two following, the prophet
describes the calamities that would come upon various classes of the
inhabitants, as the consequence of the failing of the waters of the
Nile. The first class which he mentions are the fishermen. Egypt is
mentioned [Num 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005.md), as producing
great quantities of fish. 'We remember the fish which we did eat in Eypt
freely.' 'The Nile,' says Diodorus (i.), 'abounds with incredible
numbers of all sorts of fish.' The same was true of the artificial
canals, and lakes, and reservoirs of water [Isa
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010). Herodotus (ii. 93.md) says that
large quantities of fish were produced in the Nile: 'At the season of
spawning,' says he, 'they move in vast multitudes toward the sea. As
soon as that season is over they leave the sea, return up the river, and
endeavor to regain their accustomed haunts.' As a specimen of his
"credulity," however, and also of the attention which he bestowed on
natural history, the reader may consult the passage here referred to in
regard to the mode of their propagation.

He also says that it is observed of the fish that are taken in their
passage to the sea, that they have 'the left part of their heads
depressed.' Of those that are taken on their return, the "right" side of
the head is found to be depressed. This he accounts for by observing,
that 'the cause of this is obvious: as they pass to the sea they rub
themselves on the banks on the left side; as they return they keep
closely to the same bank, and, in both instances, press against it, that
they may not be obliged to deviate from their course by the current of
the stream.' Speaking of the Lake Moeris, Herodotus says, that 'for six
months the lake empties itself into the Nile, and the remaining six, the
Nile supplies the lake. During the six months in which the waters ebb,
the fishing which is here carried on furnishes the royal treasury with a
talent of silver (about 180) every day' (ii. 149). 'The silver which the
fishery of this lake produced, was appropriated to find the queen with
clothes and perfumes.' (Diod. i. 52.) The Lake Moeris is now farmed for
30 purses (about 193) annually.

Michaud says that the Lake Menzaleh now yields an annual revenue of 800
purses,' about 5364. 'The great abundance of fish produced in the Nile
was an invaluable provision of nature, in a country which had neither
extended pasture grounds, nor large herds of cattle, and where grain was
the principal production. When the Nile inundated the country, and
filled the lakes and canals with its overflowing waters, these precious
gifts were extended to the most remote villages in the interior of the
valley, and the plentiful supply of fish which they obtained was an
additional benefit conferred upon them at this season of the year.'
(Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii. pp. 62, 63.) Hence, the
greatness of the calamity here referred to by the prophet when the lakes
and canals should be dried up. The whole country would feel it.

And all they that cast angle - Two kinds of fishermen are mentioned -
those who used a hook, and those who used the net. The former would fish
mainly in the "brooks" or canals that were cut from the Nile to water
their lands. For the various methods of fishing, illustrated by
drawings, the reader may consult Wilklnson's "Ancient Egyptians," vol.
ii. p. 21; vol. iii. p. 53ff.

[Isaiah 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 19:9</span></span>

Moreover - In addition to the calamities that will come upon the
fishermen, the drying up of the river will affect all who are supported
by that which the overflowing of its waters produced.

They that work in short flax - Egypt was celebrated anciently for
producing flax in large quantities, and of a superior quality (see [Exo
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031.md); [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028).md). The fine linen of Egypt which
was manufactured from this is celebrated in Scripture [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md); [Eze
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007.md). The Egyptians had early carried
the art of manufacturing linen to a great degree of perfection. As early
as the exode of the Hebrews, we find that the art was known by which
stuffs made of linen or other materials were curiously worked and
embroidered. 'And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent,
of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen, made with
needlework' ([Exo 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md); compare [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016.md); [Exo
36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037).md). So [Eze
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007.md) : 'Fine linen, with broidered
work from Egypt.' So also Martial refers to embroidery with the needle
in Egypt:

Haec tibi Memphitis tellus dat munera; victa est

Pectine Niliaco jam Babylonis acus.

Martial, xiv. Ep. 50.

In regard to the "fineness" of the linen which was produced and made in
Egypt, we may introduce a statement made by Pliny when speaking of the
"nets" which were made there. 'So delicate,' says he, 'were some of
them, that they would pass through a man's ring, and a single person
could carry a sufficient number of them to surround a whole wood. Julius
Lupus, who died while governor of Egypt, had some of those nets, each
string of which consisted of 150 threads; a fact perfectly surprising to
those who are not aware that the Rhodians preserve to this day, in the
temple of Minerva, the remains of a linen corslet, presented to them by
Amasis, king of Egypt, whose threads are composed each of 365 fibres.'
(Pliny, xix. 1.) Herodotus also mentions this corslet (iii. 47), and
also another presented by Amasis to the Lacedemonians, which had been
carried off by the Samians: 'It was of linen, ornamented with numerous
figures of animals, worked in gold and cotton.

Each thread of the corslet was worthy of admiration. For though very
fine, every one was composed of 360 other threads, all distinct; the
quality being similar to that dedicated to Minerva at Lindus, by the
same monarch.' Pliny (xix. 1) mentions four kinds of linen that were
particularly celebrated in Egypt - the Tanitic, the Pelusiac, the
Butine, and the tentyritic. He also says that the quantity of flax
cultivated in Egypt was accounted for, by their exporting linen to
Arabia and India. It is now known, also, that the cloth used for
enveloping the dead, and which is now found in abundance on the mummies,
was "linen." This fact was long doubted, and it was until recently
supposed by many that the cloth was made of cotton. This fact that it is
linen was settled beyond dispute by some accurate experiments made by
Dr. Ure, Mr. Bauer, and Mr. Thompson, with the aid of powerful
microscopes.

It was found that linen fibres uniformly present a cylindrical form,
transparent, and articulated, or jointed like a cane, while the fibres
of cotton have the appearance of a flat ribbon, with a hem or border at
the edge. In the mummy cloths, it was found, without exception, that the
fibres were linen. Vast quantities of linen must, therefore, have been
used. The linen of the mummy cloths is generally coarse. The warp
usually contains about 90 threads in the inch; the woof about 44.
Occasionally, however, very fine linen cloth is found, showing the skill
with which the manufacture was executed. Sir John G. Wilkinson observes,
that a piece of linen in his possession from Egypt had 540 (or 270
double) threads in one inch in the warp. Some of the cambric which is
now manufactured has but 160 threads in the inch in the warp, and 140 in
the woof. It is to be remembered, also, that the linen in Egypt was spun
by hand, and without the aid of machinery (see, on this whole subject,
Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii. pp. 113-142. Ed. Lond. 1837).
The word rendered 'fine' here denotes, according to Gesenius, "combed or
hatchelled." The word 'fine,' however, expresses the idea with
sufficient accuracy. Fine linen was used for clothing; but was so
expensive that it was worn chiefly by the rich and by princes [Luk
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

They that weave networks - Margin, 'White-works.' According to Gesenius
the word הורי hôrây means "white linen" - that which is fully bleached.
The word הוד hôd means "a hole or cavern," but is not applied to cloth.
The parallelism seems rather to require that the word should mean
'white,' or that which would correspond to 'fine,' or valuable; and it
is not known that the Egyptians had the art of working lace from linen.
Saadias supposes that "nets" are meant, as being made with holes or
meshes; but it is evident that a finer work is intended than that.

Shall be confounded - Hebrew, 'Shall be ashamed.' That is, they shall be
thrown out of employment, and not know what to do.

[Isaiah 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 19:10</span></span>

And they shall be broken - There has been a great variety of opinion in
regard to the interpretation of this verse, and much difficulty in the
construction of the Hebrew words. The Vulgate renders it, 'And its wet
places shall fail; all who make ponds to take fish.' The Septuagint,
'And all who make beer (ζύθον zuthon) shall lament, and shall afflict
their souls.' This ζύθον zuthon was a sort of malt liquor made of fruits
by fermentation, and was used in Egypt in the place of wine, since the
grape did not flourish there. Jerome on this place says, that this was
much used also in Dalmatia and Pannonia, and was commonly called
"Sabaium." The Chaldee renders this, 'And the place where they weave
cloth shall be trodden down, and the place where they make fish ponds,
and where they collect waters, each one for his own life.' This variety
of reading arises chiefly from the different modes of "pointing" the
Hebrew words.

The word rendered 'broken' (מדכאים medâkâ'iym) means "trodden down,"
from דכא dâkâ' "to tread, or trample down," and agrees in the Hebrew
with the word rendered 'purposes - the proposes shall be trodden down.'
The word 'purposes' (שׁתתיה shâtoteyhâ) is found only in the plural, and
is translated in [Psa 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md),
'foundations,' from שׁית shiyth, "foundation or pillar." According to
this, it would mean that all "the pillars or foundations, that is,
probably all the "nobles" of Egypt, would be trodden down. But this does
not well suit the connection. Others derive it from שׁתה shâtâh, "to
drink;" and suppose that it means that which is prepared for drink shall
be trodden down or destroyed. Others suppose that it is derived from
שׁתה shâtâh, "to weave," and that it refers to the places where they
wove the cloth, that is, their looms; or to the places where they made
their nets. And others suppose that it is not the "places" where they
wove which are intended, but the "weavers themselves." Forerius supposes
it to be derived from שׁתת shâthath, "to place, lay," and that it refers
to the "banks or dykes" that were made to retain the waters in the
canals, and that these would be trodden down. This, it seems to me, is
the most probable interpretation, as it suits the connection, and agrees
with the derivation of the word. But the meaning cannot be certainly
ascertained.

All that make sluices - There has been quite as great a variety in the
intepretation of this passage as in the former. The word rendered
'sluices' (שׂכר s'eker), our translators understand in the sense of
places where the water would be retained for fish ponds - made by
artificial banks confining the waters that overflow from the Nile. This
sense they have given to the word, as if it were derived from סכר sâkar,
"to shut up, to enclose." The Septuagint reads it as if it meant the
Hebrew שׁכר shêkār, or strong drink; and so also the Syriac renders it -
as if from שׁכר shēkâr, "to drink." There is no doubt that by a
difference of pointing it may have this signification. But the most
probable interpretation, perhaps, is that which derives it from שׂכר
s'âkar, "to hire," and means that they made those places for reward, or
for gain. They thus tolled for hire; and the prophet says, that they who
thus made enclosures for fish in order to make a livelihood, would be
trodden down - that is, they would fail of their purposes.

Ponds for fish - The word rendered 'fish' (נפשׁ nephesh), denotes
properly any living thing ("see the margin"), but if the usual
interpretation is given of this verse, it is evident that fish are
intended. The description, therefore, in this entire passage, from verse
fifth to verse tenth, is designed to denote the calamities which would
come upon Egypt from the failure of the waters of the Nile; and the
slightest knowledge of the importance of the Nile to that country will
show that all these calamities would follow from such a failure.

[Isaiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 19:11</span></span>

Surely the princes - The following verses, to [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md), are designed to describe
further the calamities that were coming upon Egypt by a want of wisdom
in their rulers. They would be unable to devise means to meet the
impending calamities, and would actually increase the national misery by
their unwise counsels. The word 'princes' here is taken evidently for
the rulers or counselors of state.

Of Zoan - The Vulgate, Septuagint, and Chaldee, render this 'Tanis.'
Zoan was doubtless the Tans of the Greeks (Herod. ii. 166), and was a
city of Lower Egypt, built, according to Moses [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md), seven years after Hebron. It is
mentioned in [Psa 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md); [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md), [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md); [Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004.md); [Eze
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014.md). It was at the entrance of the
Tanitic mouth of the Nile, and gave name to it. Its ruins still exist,
and there are seen there at present numerous blocks of granite, seven
obelisks of granite, and a statue of Isis. It was the capital of the
dynasty of the Tanitish kings until the time of Psammetichus; it was at
this place principally that the miracles done by Moses were performed.
'Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of
Egypt; in the field of Zoan' [Psa
78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md). Its ruins are still called
"San," a slight change of the word Zoan. The Ostium Taniticum is now the
"Omm Faredje."

Are fools - They are unable to meet by their counsels the impending
calamities. Perhaps their folly was evinced by their flattering their
sovereign, and by exciting him to plans that tended to the ruin, rather
than the welfare of the kingdom.

The wise counselors of Pharaoh - Pharaoh was the common name of the
kings of Egypt in the same way as "Caesar" became afterward the common
name of the Roman emperors - and the king who is here intended by
Pharaoh is probably Psammetichus (see the note at [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004).md).

How say ye ... - Why do you "flatter" the monarch? Why remind him of his
ancestry? Why attempt to inflate him with the conception of his own
wisdom? This was, and is, the common practice of courtiers; and in this
way kings are often led to measures most ruinous to their subjects.

[Isaiah 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 19:12</span></span>

Where are they? - This whole verse is an appeal by the prophet to the
king of Egypt respecting the counselors and soothsayers of his kingdom.
The sense is, 'a time of distress and danger is evidently coming upon
Egypt. They pretend to be wise; and there is now occasion for all their
wisdom, and opportunity to evince it. Let them show it. Let them declare
what is coming upon the nation, and take proper measures to meet and
remove it; and they will then demonstrate that it would be proper for
Pharaoh to repose confidence in them.' But if they could not do this,
then he should not suffer himself to be deluded, and his kingdom ruined,
by their counsels.

[Isaiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 19:13</span></span>

The princes of Zoan - (the note at [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011).md). This "repetition" is intensive
and emphatic, and shows the deep conviction of the prophet of their
folly. The design is to show that "all" the counselors on which the
Egyptians depended were fools.

The princes of Noph - The Vulgate, the Septuagint, and the Chaldee,
render this 'Memphis,' and there is no doubt that this is the city
intended. The name Memphis may have easily arisen from Noph. It was
written also "Moph," and hence, Memphis. It is called "Menouf" by the
Copts and Arabians. According to Plutarch, the name Memphis means "the
port of the good." The situation of Memphis has been a subject of
considerable dispute, and has afforded matter for long and laborious
investigation. Sicard and Shaw fix its site at Djezeh or Ghizeh,
opposite to old Cairo. Pococke, D'Anville, Niebuhr, and other writers
and travelers, place Memphis more in the direction of Mitraheny, about
fifteen miles further south, on the banks of the Nile, at the entrance
of the plain of the mummies, at the north of which the pyramids are
placed. It was the residence of the ancient kings of Egypt until the
time of the Ptolemies, who commonly resided at Alexandria. Memphis
retained its splendor until it was conquered by the Arabians, about 641
a.d. At the supposed site of Memphis south of Ghizeh, there are large
mounds of rubbish, a colossal statue sunk in the ground, and a few
fragments of granite, which remain to test the existence of this
renowned capital. In Strabo's time, although partly in ruins, it was yet
a populous city, second only to Alexandria. The total disappearance of
the ancient edifices of Memphis is easily accounted for by the
circumstance, that the materials were employed for the building of
adjacent cities. Fostal rose out of the ruins, and when that city was
again deserted, these ruins migrated again to the more modern Cairo (see
Robinson's "Bib. Researches," vol. i. p. 40).

They have also seduced Egypt - That is, they have by their counsels
caused it to err, and have led it into its present embarrassment.

The stay ... - Hebrew, פנה pinnâh - the "corner; that is, those who
should have been the support. So the word is used to denote the head or
leader of a people in [Jdg 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002.md), [Jdg
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#014.md); [Sa1
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#038.md); [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 19:14</span></span>

The Lord hath mingled - The word מסך mâsak, "to mingle," is used
commonly to denote the act of mixing spices with wine to make it more
intoxicating [Pro 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md); [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md). Here it means that Yahweh has
poured out into the midst of them a spirit of giddiness; that is, has
produced consternation among them. National commotions and calamities
are often thus traced to the overruling providence of God (see the note
at [Isa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md); compare [Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

A perverse spirit - Hebrew, 'A spirit of perverseness.' The word
rendered 'perverse' is derived from עוה ‛âvâh, "to be crooked or
perverted." Here it means, that their counsels were unwise, land such as
tended to error and ruin.

To err as a drunken man ... - This is a very striking figure. The whole
nation was reeling to and fro, and unsettled in their counsels, as a man
is who is so intoxicated as to reel and to vomit. Nothing could more
strikingly express, first, the "fact" of their perverted counsels and
plans, and secondly, God's deep abhorrence of the course which they were
pursuing.

[Isaiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 19:15</span></span>

Neither shall there be any work - The sense is, that there shall be such
discord that no man, whether a prince, a politician, or a priest, shall
be able to give any advice, or form any plan for the national safety and
security, which shall be successful.

Which the head or tail - High or low; strong or weak: those in office
and those out of office; all shall be dispirited and confounded.
Rosenmuller understands by the head here, the "political" orders of the
nation, and by the tail the "sacerdotal" ranks. But the meaning more
probably is, the highest and the lowest ranks - all the politicians, and
priests, and princes, on the one hand, as the prophet had just stated
[Isa 19:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md); and all the artificers,
fishermen, etc., on the other, as he had stated [Isa
19:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md). This verse, therefore, is a
"summing up" of all he had said about the calamities that were coming
upon them.

Branch or rush - See these words explained in the note at [Isa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md).

[Isaiah 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 19:16</span></span>

In that day shall Egypt be like unto women - Timid; fearful; alarmed.
The Hebrews often, by this comparison, express great fear and
consternation [Jer 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md); [Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013.md).

Because of the shaking of the hand - The shaking of the hand is an
indication of threatening or punishment (note, [Isa
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md); [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 19:17</span></span>

And the land of Judah - The fear and consternation of Egypt shall be
increased when they learn what events are occurring there, and what
Yahweh has purposed in regard to it.

Shall be a terror - This cannot be understood to mean that they were in
danger from an invasion by the Jews, for at that time they were not at
war, and Judah had no power to overrun Egypt. Jarchi and Kimchi suppose
that the passage means that the Egyptians would hear what had occurred
to the army of Sennacherib on its overthrow, and that they would be
alarmed as if a similar fate was about to come upon them. But the more
probable interpretation is that which refers it to the "invasion" of
Judah by Sennacherib. The Egyptians would know of that. Indeed, the
leading design of Sennacherib was to invade Egypt, and Judah and
Jerusalem were to be destroyed only "in the way" to Egypt. And when the
Egyptians heard of the great preparations of Sennacherib, and of his
advance upon Judah (see [Isa
10:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028).md), and knew that his design
was to invade them, 'the land of Judah' would be 'a terror,' because
they apprehended that he would make a rapid descent upon them. Vitringa,
however, supposes that the sense is, that the Egyptians in their
calamities would remember the prophecies of Jeremiah and others, of
which they had heard, respecting their punishment; that they would
remember that the prophecies respecting Judah had been fulfilled, and
that thus Judah would be a terror to them "because" those predictions
had come out of Judah. This is plausible, and it may be the correct
explanation.

Which he hath determined against it - Either against Judah, or Egypt.
The Hebrew will bear either. It may mean that they were alarmed at the
counsel which had been formed by Yahweh against Judah, and which was
apparently about to be executed by the invasion of Sennacherib, and that
thus they feared an invasion themselves, or that they learned that a
purpose of destruction was formed by Yahweh against themselves, and that
Judah became thus an object of terror, because the prophecies which were
spoken there were certain of being fulfilled. The latter is the
interpretation given by Vitringa, and perhaps is the moss probable.

[Isaiah 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 19:18</span></span>

In that day - The word 'day' is used in Scripture in a large
signification, "as including the whole period under consideration," or
the whole time that is embraced in the scope of a prophecy. In this
chapter it is used in this sense; and evidently means that the event
here foretold would take place "somewhere" in the period that is
embraced in the design of the prophecy. That is, the event recorded in
this verse would occur in the series of events that the prophet saw
respecting Egypt (see [Isa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001).md). The
sense is, that somewhere in the general time here designated [Isa
19:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), the event here described
would take place. There would be an extensive fear of Yahweh, and an
extensive embracing of the true religion, in the land of Egypt.

Shall five cities - The number 'five' here is evidently used to denote
an "indefinite" number, in the same way as 'seven' is often used in the
Scriptures (see [Lev 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008).md). It means,
that several cities in Egypt would use that language, one of which only
is specified.

The language of Canaan - Margin, 'Lip of Canaan.' So the Hebrew; but the
word often means 'language.' The language of Canaan evidently means the
"Hebrew" language; and it is called 'the language of Canaan' either
because it was spoken by the original inhabitants of the land of Canaan,
or more probably because it was used by the Hebrews who occupied Canaan
as the promised land; and then it will mean the language spoken in the
land of Canaan. The phrase used here is employed probably to denote that
they would be converted to the Jewish religion; or that the religion of
the Jews would flourish there. A similar expression, to denote
conversion to the true God, occurs in [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md) : 'For there I will turn to the
people a pure language, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, to
serve him with one consent.'

And swear to the Lord of hosts - That is, they shall "devote" themselves
to him; or they shall bind themselves to his service by solemn covenant;
compare [Deu 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md); [Isa
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md), where conversion to God, and a
purpose to serve him, is expressed in the same manner by "swearing" to
him, that is, by solemnly devoting themselves to his service.

One shall be called - The name of one of them shall be, etc. Why "one"
particularly is designated is not known.

The city of destruction - There has been a great variety of
interpretation in regard to this expression. Margin, 'Heres,' or, 'The
sun.' The Vulgate, 'The city of the sun;' evidently meaning Heliopolis.
The Septuagint Ασεδέκ Asedik - 'The city Asedek.' The Chaldee, 'The city
of the house of the sun (שׁמשׁ בית bēyith shemesh), which is to be
destroyed.' The Syriac, 'The city of Heres.' The common reading of the
Hebrew text is, ההרס עיר 'iyr haheres. This reading is found in most MS.
editions and versions. The word הרס heres commonly means "destruction,"
though it may also mean "deliverance;" and Gesenius supposes the name
was to be given to it because it was to be a "delivered" city; that is,
it would be the city to which 'the saviour' mentioned in [Isa
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md), would come, and which he would
make his capital. Ikenius contends that the word 'Heres' is taken from
the Arabic, and that the name is the same as Leontopolis - 'The city of
the lion,' a city in Egypt. But besides other objections which may be
made to this interpretation, the signification of "lion" is not given to
the word in the Hebrew language.

The common reading is that which occurs in the text - the city of
"Heres." But another reading (החרס hacheres) is found in sixteen
manuscripts, and has been copied in the Complutensian Polyglot. This
word ( חרס cheres) properly means the "sun," and the phrase means the
city of the sun; that is, Heliopolis. Onias, who was disappointed in
obtaining the high priesthood (149 b.c.) on the death of his uncle
Menelaus, fled into Egypt, and ingratiated himself into the favor of
Ptolemy Philometer and Cleopatra, and was advanced to the highest rank
in the army and the court, and made use of his influence to obtain
permission to build a temple in Egypt like that at Jerusalem, with a
grant that he and his descendants should always have a right to
officiate in it as high priests. In order to obtain this, he alleged
that it would be for the interest of Egypt, by inducing many Jews to
come and reside there, and that their going annually to Jerusalem to
attend the great feasts would expose them to alienation from the
Egyptians, to join the Syrian interest ("see" Prideaux's "Connection,"
under the year 149 b.c. Josephus expressly tells us ("Ant." xiii. 3.
1-3), that in order to obtain this layout, he urged that it had been
predicted by Isaiah six hundred years before, and that in consequence of
this, Ptolemy granted him permission to build the temple, and that it
was built at Leontopolis. It resembled that at Jerusalem, but was
smaller and less splendid. It was within the Nomos or prefecture of
Heliopolis, at the distance of twenty-four miles from Memphis. Onias
pretended that the very place was foretold by Isaiah; and this would
seem to suppose that the ancient reading was that of 'the city of the
sun.' He urged this prediction in order to reconcile the Jews to the
idea of another temple besides that at Jerusalem, because a temple
erected in Egypt would be an object of disapprobation to the Jews in
Palestine. Perhaps for the same reason the translation of Isaiah in the
Septuagint renders this, Ἀσεδέκ Asedek - 'The city of Asedek,' as if the
original were צדקה tsedâqâh - 'The city of righteousness' - that is, a
city where righteousness dwells; or a city which was approved by God.
But this is manifestly a corruption of the Hebrew text.

It may be proper to remark that the change in the Hebrew between the
word rendered 'destruction' (הרס heres), and the word 'sun' (חרס
cheres), is a change of a single letter where one might be easily
mistaken for the other - the change of the Hebrew letter ה (h) into the
Hebrew letter ח (ch). This might have occurred by the error of a
transcriber, though the circumstances would lead us to think it not
improbable that it "may" have been made designedly, but by whom is
unknown. It "may" have been originally as Onias pretended and have been
subsequently altered by the Jews to counteract the authority which he
urged for building a temple in Egypt; but there is no certain evidence
of it. The evidence from MSS. is greatly in favor of the reading as in
our translation (הרס heres), and this may be rendered either
'destruction,' or more probably, according to Gesenius, 'deliverance,'
so called from the "deliverance" that would be brought to it by the
promised saviour [Isa 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md).

It may be added, that there is no evidence that Isaiah meant to
designate the city where Onias built the temple, but merely to predict
that many cities in Egypt would be converted, one of which would be the
one here designated. Onias took "advantage" of this, and made an artful
use of it, but it was manifestly not the design of Isaiah. Which is the
true reading of the passage it is impossible now to determine; nor is it
important. I think the most probable interpretation is that which
supposes that Isaiah meant to refer to a city saved from destruction, as
mentioned in [Isa 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md), and that he
did not design to designate any particular city by name. The city of
Heliopolis was situated on the Pelusian branch of the Nile, about five
miles below the point of the ancient Delta. It was deserted in the time
of Strabo; and this geographer mentions its mounds of ruin, but the
houses were shown in which Eudoxus and Plato had studied.

The place was celebrated for its learning, and its temple dedicated to
the sun. There are now no ruins of ancient buildings, unless the mounds
can be regarded as such; the walls, however, can still be traced, and
there is an entire obelisk still standing. This obelisk is of red
granite, about seventy feet high, and from its great antiquity has
excited much attention among the learned. In the neighboring villages
there are many fragments which have been evidently transferred from this
city. Dr. Robinson who visited it, says, that 'the site about two hours
N. N. E. from Cairo. The way thither passes along the edge of the
desert, which is continually making encroachments, so soon as then
ceases to be a supply of water for the surface of the ground. The site
of Heliopolis is marked by low mounds, enclosing a space about three
quarters of a mile in length, by half a mile in breadth, which was once
occupied by houses, and partly by the celebrated temple of the sun. This
area is now a plowed field, a garden of herbs; and the solitary obelisk
which rises in the midst is the sole remnant of the splendor of the
place. Near by it is a very old sycamore, its trunk straggling and
gnarled, under which legendary tradition relates that the holy family
once. rested.' ("Bib. Researches," vol. i. pp. 36, 37.) The illustration
in the book, from the Pictorial Bible, will give an idea of the present
appearance of Heliopolis.

[Isaiah 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 19:19</span></span>

In that day shall there be an altar - An "altar" is properly a place on
which sacrifices are offered. According to the Mosaic law, but one great
altar was to be erected for sacrifices. But the word 'altar' is often
used in another sense to denote a place of "memorial;" or a place of
worship in general ([Jos 22:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022.md). It
is clear that Isaiah did not intend that this should be taken
"literally," or that there should be a rival temple and altar erected in
Egypt, but his description is evidently taken in part from the account
of the religion of the patriarchs who erected altars and pillars and
monuments to mark the places of the worship of the true God. The
parallelism here, where 'pillars' are mentioned, shows in what sense the
word 'altar' is used. It means that the worship of the true God would be
established in Egypt, and that certain "places" should be set apart to
his service. "altars" were among the first places reared as connected
with the worship of God (see [Gen
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md); [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md); [Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015).md).

To the Lord - To Yahweh - the true God.

And a pillar - That is, a memorial to God. Thus Jacob set up the stone
on which he had lain 'for a pillar,' and poured oil on it [Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md). Again [Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014.md), he set up a pillar to mark the
place where God met him and talked with him (compare [Gen
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013.md); [Lev
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md); [Deu
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#022).md). The word 'pillar,' when thus
used, denotes a stone, or column of wood, erected as a monument or
memorial; and especially a memorial of some manifestation of God or of
his favor. Before temples were known, such pillars would naturally be
erected; and the description here means simply that Yahweh would be
worshipped in Egypt.

At the border thereof - Not in one place merely, but in all parts of
Egypt. It is not improbable that the "name" of Yahweh, or some rude
designation of the nature of his worship, would be inscribed on such
pillars. It is known that the Egyptians were accustomed to rear pillars,
monuments, obelisks, etc., to commemorate great events, and that the
names and deeds of illustrious persons were engraven on them; and the
prophet here says, that such monuments should be reared to Yahweh. In
regard to the fulfillment of this prophecy, there can be no question.
After the time of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews were
settled in Egypt. They were favored by the Ptolemies, and they became so
numerous that it was deemed necessary that their Scriptures should be
translated into Greek for their use, and accordingly the translation
called the Septuagint was made. See Introduction, Section 8, 1, (1).

[Isaiah 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 19:20</span></span>

And it shall be for a sign - The altar, and the pillar. This shows that
the altar was not to be for sacrifice, but was a "memorial," or designed
to designate a place of worship.

They shall cry to the Lord because of the oppressors - That is,
oppressed and borne down under the exactions of their rulers, they shall
seek deliverance from the true God - one instance among many of the
effect of affliction and oppression in leading people to embrace the
true religion.

And he shall send them a saviour - Who this "saviour" would be, has been
a subject on which there has been a great difference of opinion. Grotius
supposes that it would be "the angel" by which the army of Sennacherib
would be destroyed. Gesenius thinks it was Psammetichus, who would
deliver them from the tyranny of the eleven kings who were contending
with each other, or that, since in [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md), he is called a 'severe lord,' it
is probable that the promise here is to be understood of a delivering or
protecting angel. But it is evident that some person is here denoted who
would be sent "subsequently" to the national judgments which are here
designated. Dr. Gill supposes that by the saviour here is meant the
Messiah; but this interpretation does not suit the connection, for it is
evident that the event here predicted, was to take place before the
coming of Christ. Vitringa and Dr. Newton suppose with more probability
that Alexander the Great is here referred to, who took possession of
Egypt after his conquest in the East, and who might be called "a
saviour," inasmuch as he delivered them from the reign of the oppressive
kings who had tyrannized there, and inasmuch as his reign and the reigns
of those who succeeded him in Egypt, would be much more mild than that
of the former kings of that country.

That Alexander the Great was regarded by the Egyptians as a saviour or
deliverer, is apparent from history. Upon his coming to Egypt, the
people submitted to him cheerfully, out of hatred to the Persians, so
that he became master of the country without any opposition (Diod. Sic.
xvii. 49; Arrian, iii. 3, 1; Q. Curtius, iv. 7, 8, as quoted by Newton).
He treated them with much kindness; built the city of Alexandria,
calling it after his own name, designing to make it the capital of his
empire; and under him and the Ptolemies who succeeded him, trade
revived, commerce flourished, learning was patronized, and peace and
plenty blessed the land. Among other things, Alexander transplanted many
Jews into Alexandria, and granted them many privileges, equal to the
Macedonians themselves (Jos. "Bell. Jud." ii. 18. 7; "Contra Ap." ii.
4). 'The arrival of Alexander,' says Wilkinson ("Ancient Egyptians,"
vol. i. pp. 213, 214), 'was greeted with universal satisfaction.

Their hatred of the Persians, and their frequent alliances with the
Greeks, who had fought under the same banners against a common enemy,
naturally taught the Egyptians to welcome the Macedonian army with the
strongest demonstrations of friendship, and to consider their coming as
a direct interposition of the gods; and so wise and considerate was the
conduct of the early Ptolemies, that they almost ceased to regret the
period when they were governed by their native princes.' Under the
Ptolemies, large numbers of the Jews settled in Egypt. For their use, as
has been remarked, the Old Testament was translated into Greek, and a
temple was built by Onias, under the sixth Ptolemy. Philo represents the
number of the Jews in Egypt in his time at not less than one million.
They were settled in nearly all parts oF Egypt; but particularly in
Heliopolis or the city of the sun, in Migdol, in Tahpanes, in Noph or
Memphis, in Pathros or Thebais [Jer
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md) - perhaps the five cities
referred to in [Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md).

And a great one - (ורב vârâb). A mighty one; a powerful saviour. The
name 'great' has been commonly assigned to Alexander. The Septuagint
renders this, 'Judging (κρίνων krinōn), he shall save them;' evidently
regarding רב râb as derived from ריב riyb "to manage a cause, or to
judge." Lowth renders it, 'A vindicator.' The word means "great,
mighty;" and is repeatedly applied to a prince, chief, or captain [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md); [Est
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#008.md); [Dan
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md); [Dan
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048.md); [Dan
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 19:21</span></span>

And the Lord shall be known to Egypt - Shall be worshipped and honored
by the Jews who shall dwell there, and by those who shall be proselyted
to their religion.

And the Egyptians shall know the Lord - That many of the Egyptians would
be converted to the Jewish religion there can be no doubt. This was the
result in all countries where the Jews had a residence (compare the
notes at [Act 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).md).

And shall do sacrifice - Shall offer sacrifices to Yahweh. They would
naturally go to Jerusalem as often as practicable, and unite with the
Jews there, in the customary rites of their religion.

And oblations - The word מנחה minichāh 'oblation,' denotes any offering
that is not a "bloody" sacrifice - a thank-offering; an offering of
incense, flour, grain, etc. (see the notes at [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013).md) The sense is, that they should
be true worshippers of God.

They shall vow a vow ... - They shall be sincere and true worshippers of
God. The large numbers of the Jews that dwelt there; the fact that many
of them doubtless were sincere; the circumstances recorded [Act
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md), that Jews were in Jerusalem on
the day of Pentecost; and the fact that the true religion was carried to
Egypt, and the Christian religion established there, all show how fully
this prediction was fulfilled.

[Isaiah 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 19:22</span></span>

And the Lord shall smite Egypt - That is, in the manner described in the
previous part of this prophecy [Isa
19:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md).

And heal it - Or restore it to more than its former splendor and
prosperity, as described in the previous verses [Isa
19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md). He shall send it a saviour;
he shall open new sources of prosperity; and he shall cause the true
religion to flourish there. These advantages would be more than a
compensation for all the calamities that he would bring upon it.

And they shall return ... - These calamities shall be the means of their
conversion to Yahweh.

[Isaiah 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 19:23</span></span>

There shall be a highway - A communication; that is, there shall be an
alliance between Egypt and Assyria, as constituting parts of one empire,
and as united in the service of the true God. The same figure of a
"highway" is found in [Isa 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016.md) (see
the note on that place). The truth was, that Alexander, by his
conquests, subjected Assyria and Egypt, and they constituted parts of
his empire, and were united under him. It was true, also, that there
were large numbers of Jews in both these countries, and that they were
united in the service of the true God. They worshipped him in those
countries; and they met at Jerusalem at the great feasts, and thus
Judah, Assyria, and Egypt, were united in his worship.

And the Assyrian shall come into Egypt - There shall be free and
uninterrupted contact between the two nations, as parts of the same
empire.

And the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians - In the same armies;
under the same leader. This was the case under Alexander the Great. Or
the word 'serve' may mean that they would serve God unitedly. So Lowth
and Noyes render it.

[Isaiah 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 19:24</span></span>

In that day shall Israel be the third - That is, the three shall be
united as one people. Instead of being rival, hostile, and contending
kingdoms, they shall be united and friendly; and instead of having
different and jarring religions, they shall all worship the same God.
The prophecy rather refers to the spread of the true religion, and the
worship of the true God, than to a political or civil alliance.

Even a blessing - It shall be a source of blessing, because from Judea
the true religion would extend into the other lands.

In the midst of the land - That is, "the united land" - composed of the
three nations now joined in alliance. Judea was situated in the "midst"
of this united land, or occupied a central position between the two. It
was also true that it occupied a central position in regard to the whole
earth, and that from it, as a radiating point, the true religion was
disseminated throughout all nations.

[Isaiah 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 19:25</span></span>

whom the Lord of hosts shall bless - That is, which united country he
shall acknowledge as truly worshipping him, and on which he shall bestow
his favors as his favored people.

Assyria the work of my hands - This is synonymous with the expression
'my people.' It means that the arrangements by which the true religion
would be established among them, were the work of God. Conversion to God
is everywhere in the Scriptures spoken of as his work, or creation; see
[Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md) : 'For we are his
workmanship; created in Christ Jesus unto good works' (compare [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003).md).

Israel mine inheritance - The land and people which is especially my own
- a name not unfrequently given to Israel. For a learned examination of
the various hypotheses in regard to the fulfillment of this prophecy,
see Vitringa. He himself applies it to the times succeeding Alexander
the Great. Alexander he regards as the 'saviour' mentioned in [Isa
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md); and the establishment of the
true religion referred to by the prophet as that which would take place
under the Ptolemies. Vitringa has proved - what indeed is known to all
who have the slightest knowledge of history that there were large
numbers of Jews under the Ptolemies in Egypt, and that multitudes became
proselytes to the Jewish faith.
