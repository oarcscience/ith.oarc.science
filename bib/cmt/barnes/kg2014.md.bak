### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 14:1</span></span>

The history of Judah is resumed 2 Kings 14:1-22, followed by a brief
account of the contemporary history of Israel under Jeroboam II [Kg2
14:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md). The earlier narrative runs
parallel with 2 Chr. 25.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 14:2</span></span>

Joash of Judah reigned forty years [Kg2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md), and Joash of Israel ascended the
throne in his namesake's thirty-seventh year [Kg2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md); hence, we should have expected
to hear that Amaziah succeeded his father in the fourth rather than in
the second year of Joash (of Israel). The usual explanation of the
discrepancy is to suppose a double accession of the Israelite Joash - as
co-partner with his father in the thirty-seventh year of his namesake,
as sole king two years afterward.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 14:3</span></span>

He did ... as Joash - There is a curious parity between the lives of
Joash and Amaziah. Both were zealous for Yahweh in the earlier portion
of their reigns, but in the latter part fell away; both disregarded the
rebukes of prophets; and both, having forsaken God, were in the end
conspired against and slain (compare [Ch2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025.md); [Ch2
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#027).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 14:5</span></span>

The phrase, "confirmed in his hand" [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md), usually expresses the
authorisation of a new reign by an imperial superior (see [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019) note.md); but here it describes the
result when the troubles consequent upon the murder of Joash had passed
away. The new king's authority was generally recognized by his subjects.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 14:6</span></span>

The children of the murderers he slew not - This seems to be noted as a
rare instance of clemency (compare [Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026) note.md). It is strange at first
sight, that, when the Law contained so very plain a prohibition
(marginal references), the contrary practice should have established
itself. But we must remember, first, that the custom was that of the
East generally (see [Dan 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#024).md); and
secondly, that it had the sanction of one who might be thought to have
known thoroughly the mind of the legislator, namely, Joshua (see [Jos
7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 14:7</span></span>

Amaziah's Idumaean war is treated at length by the writer of Chronicles
(marginal reference).

The "Valley of Salt" is usually identified with the broad open plain
called the Sabkah, at the southern end of the Dead Sea - the
continuation of the Ghor or Jordan gorge. At the north-western corner of
this plain stands a mountain of rock-salt, and the tract between this
mountain and the sea is a salt-marsh. Salt springs also abound in the
plain itself, so that the name would be fully accounted for. It is
doubted, however, whether the original of the word "valley," commonly
used of clefts and ravines, can be applied to such a sunk plain as the
Sabkah; and it is certainly most unlikely that 10,000 prisoners would
have been conveyed upward of eighty miles (the distance of the Sabkah
from Petra), through a rough and difficult country, only in order to be
massacred. On the whole, it is perhaps most probable that the "Valley of
Salt" yet remains to be discovered, and that its true position was near
Selah or Petra (see [Jdg 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#036) note.md).
Amaziah gave to Petra the name Joktheel, "subdued by God," in a
religious spirit as an acknowledgment of the divine aid by which his
victory was gained. The name failed to take permanent hold on the place,
because the Edomites, on not long afterward recovering their city,
restored the old appellation ([Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md); compare [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), and [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md).

Unto this day - The writer of Kings evidently gives the exact words of
his document, composed not later than the reign of Ahaz, before whose
death the Edomites had recovered Petra.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 14:8</span></span>

Amaziah's success against Edom had so elated him that he thought himself
more than a match for his northern neighbor. The grounds of the quarrel
between them were furnished by the conduct of the hired, but dismissed,
Israelite soldiers (see the marginal reference).

Let us look one another in the face - i. e. "let us meet face to face in
arms, and try each other's strength" [Kg2
14:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 14:9</span></span>

The Oriental use of apologues on the most solemn and serious occasions
is well known to all, and scarcely needs illustration (compare marginal
reference). It is a common feature of such apologues that they are not
exact parallels to the case whereto they are applied, but only general
or partial resemblances. Hence, there is need of caution in applying the
several points of the illustration.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 14:10</span></span>

Glory of this ... - literally, "Be honored;" i. e. "Enjoy thy honor ...
be content with it." "Why wilt thou meddle with misfortune?"

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 14:11</span></span>

Jehoash did not wait to be attacked. Invading Judaea from the west, and
so ascending out of the low coast tract, he met the army of Amaziah at
Beth-shemesh (see [Jos 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021) note.md),
about 15 miles from Jerusalem.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 14:12</span></span>

The author of Chronicles notes that Amaziah's obstinacy, and his
consequent defeat and captivity, were judgments upon him for an idolatry
into which he had fallen after his conquest of Edom [Ch2
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md), [Ch2
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 14:13</span></span>

The object of breaking down the wall was to leave Jerusalem at the mercy
of her rival; and it must have been among the conditions of the peace
that the breach thus made should not be repaired.

Gates in Oriental cities are named from the places to which they lead.
The gate of Ephraim must therefore have been a north gate: perhaps also
known, later on, by the name of the "gate of Benjamin" [Jer
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md); [Zac
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md). The corner gate was probably a
gate at the northwest angle of the city, where the north wall approached
the Valley of Hinnom. The entire breach was thus in the north wall, on
the side where Jerusalem was naturally the weakest. Josephus says that
Joash drove his chariot through the breach into the town, a practice not
unusual with conquerors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 14:14</span></span>

This is the only distinct mention of "hostages" in the Old Testament. It
would seem that the Oriental conquerors generally regarded the terror of
their arms as sufficient to secure the performance of the engagements
contracted toward them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 14:15</span></span>

These two verses (repeated from [Kg2
13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012).md) are out of place here, where
they interrupt the history of Amaziah's reign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 14:20</span></span>

They brought him on horses - i. e. they conveyed his body back to
Jerusalem in the royal chariot. The combination of relentless animosity
against the living prince with the deepest respect for his dead remains
is very characteristic of an Oriental people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 14:21</span></span>

All the people of Judah - The words imply that the conspiracy was one in
which the general mass of the people did not participate. There was no
confusion and trouble as on the occasion of the murder of Joash. Azariah
("the strength of Yahweh"), and Uzziah ("whom Yahweh assists"), were
mere variants of one name.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 14:22</span></span>

Elath, or Eloth (marginal reference [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).md), was near Ezion-Geber, in the
Gulf of Akabah. It had been lost to the Jews on the revolt of Edom from
Joram [Kg2 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022.md). Uzziah's
re-establishment of the place, rendered possible by his father's
successes [Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md), was one of his
first acts, and seems to imply a desire to renew the commercial projects
which Solomon had successfully carried out, and which Jehoshaphat had
vainly attempted [Kg1 22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 14:23</span></span>

Jeroboam - This is the only instance, in the history of either kingdom,
of a recurrent royal appellation. We can scarcely doubt that Jeroboam II
was named after the great founder of the Israelite kingdom by a father
who trusted that he might prove a sort of second founder. Perhaps the
prophecy of Jonah (see [Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md) had
been already given, and it was known that a great deliverance was
approaching.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 14:25</span></span>

He restored the coast of Israel - Jeroboam, in the course of his long
reign, recovered the old boundaries of the holy land to the north, the
east, and the southeast. The "entering in of Hamath" is spoken of as the
northern boundary; the "sea of the plain," or the Dead Sea, is the
southern boundary (see the marginal references): here Israel adjoined on
Moab. The entire tract east of Jordan had been lost to Israel in the
reign of Jehu and that of Jehoahaz [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md). All this was now recovered: and
not only so, but Moab was reduced [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014.md), and the Syrians were in their
turn forced to submit to the Jews [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md). The northern conquests were
perhaps little less important than the eastern [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md).

The word of the Lord ... which he spake - Some have found the prophecy
of Jonah here alluded to, or a portion of it, in [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md) (see [Kg2
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#013).md); but without sufficient
grounds.

This passage tends to fix Jonah's date to some period not very late in
the reign of Jeroboam II, i. e. (according to the ordinary chronology)
from 823 B.C. to 782 B.C. On Gath-hepher, see the marginal reference and
note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 14:26</span></span>

The affliction of Israel - That which the Israelites had suffered for
two reigns at the hands of the Syrians [Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md),[Kg2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022.md).

There was not any shut up, nor any left - A phrase implying complete
depopulation (see the marginal reference note; [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010).md), but here meaning no more than
extreme depression and weakness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 14:27</span></span>

And the Lord said not - Though the Israelites were brought thus low, yet
the fiat did not as yet go forth for their destruction. God did not send
a prophet to say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under
heaven; but on the contrary sent two to announce that they should be
delivered from their present enemies, and obtain triumphs over them (see
[Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md); [Kg2
13:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017).md).

That he would blot out ... - This is a Mosaic phrase, found only here
and in Deuteronomy [Kg2 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md); 29:20.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 14:28</span></span>

He recovered Damascus - Jeroboam probably gained certain advantages over
Benhadad, which induced the latter to make his submission and consent to
such terms as those extorted by Ahab [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md).

Hamath was probably among the actual conquests of Jeroboam. It was
brought so low in his reign, as to have become almost a by-word for
calamity (compare [Amo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002).md).

Which belonged to Judah, for Israel - i. e. these cities were recovered
to Judah, i. e. to the people of God generally, through or by means of
being added to Israel, i. e. to the northern kingdom.

A few further facts in the history of Jeroboam II are recorded by the
prophet Amos (compare [Amo 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md),
etc.).
