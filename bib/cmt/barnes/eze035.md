### [Ezekiel Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 35:1</span></span>

In Ezek. 35-36 we see the devastation of Edom, and the restoration of
Israel. Edom was included among the nations against which Ezekiel
prophesied [Eze 25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012). But its
fuller doom was reserved for this place, because Edom was one of the
surrounding nations that profited at first by Judah's fall, and because
it helps by way of contrast to bring out in a marked way the better
future designed for Israel. Edom is the God-hating, God-opposing power,
ever distinguished for its bitter hatred against Israel; and so the ruin
of Edom is the triumph of Israel in the power of God.

[Ezekiel 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005)

Shed blood - Omit "blood:" better as in the margin, i. e., and hast
given up the children of Israel to the sword; thou hast scattered the
children of Israel in confusion like stones poured down a mountain-side
[Mic 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006).

That their iniquity had an end - Or, "of the iniquity of the end," i.
e., the time when by the capture of the city the iniquity of Israel came
to an end [Eze 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029).

[Ezekiel 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 35:9</span></span>

Return - Or, "be inhabited."

[Ezekiel 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 35:10</span></span>
