Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001)

[Proverbs 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 15:2</span></span>

Useth knowledge aright - Rather, makes knowledge goodly. The power of
well-considered speech to commend true wisdom, is contrasted with the
pouring (literally as in the margin) forth of folly.

[Proverbs 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 15:3</span></span>

The teaching which began with the fear of the Lord [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007) would not be complete without this
assertion of His omni-present knowledge.

[Proverbs 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 15:4</span></span>

A wholesome tongue - literally, as in the margin, the same word as
"sound" in [Pro 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030) (see the note).
A more literal rendering would be soundness of speech.

Tree of life - Compare [Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018) note.

Breach in the spirit - With the sense of vexation (compare [Isa
65:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#014)).

[Proverbs 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 15:7</span></span>

Not so - The word translated "so" is taken by some in its etymological
force as "strong," "firm," and the passage is rendered "the heart of the
fool disperseth (supplied from the first clause) what is weak and
unsteady," i. e., "falsehood and unwisdom." The Septuagint takes it as
an adjective, "the heart of the fool is unstedfast." The phrase as it
stands in the King James Version is, however, of frequent occurrence
[Gen 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#018); [Exo
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#011); [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007).

[Proverbs 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 15:10</span></span>

Better, There is a grievous correction, i. e., nothing less than death,
to him that forsaketh the way.

[Proverbs 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 15:13</span></span>

Some prefer to render the last clause, "In sorrow of heart the breath is
oppressed."

[Proverbs 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 15:15</span></span>

Afflicted - The affliction meant here is less that of outward
circumstances than of a troubled and downcast spirit. Life to the
cheerful is as one perpetual banquet, whether he be poor or rich. That
which disturbs the feast is anxiety, the taking (anxious) thought" of
[Mat 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034).

[Proverbs 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 15:16</span></span>

This proverb has its completion in the teaching of [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).

[Proverbs 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 15:17</span></span>

A dinner of herbs - The meals of the poor and the abstemious. The
"stalled ox," like the "fatted calf" of [Luk
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023), would indicate a stately
magnificence.

[Proverbs 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 15:19</span></span>

The slothful goes on his journey, and for him the path is thick set with
thorns, briars, fences, through which he cannot force his way. For the
"righteous" (better, upright), the same path is as the broad raised
causeway of the king's highway. Compare [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).

[Proverbs 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 15:20</span></span>

To "despise" a mother is to cause her the deepest grief, and is
therefore not unfitly contrasted with "making a glad father."

[Proverbs 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 15:21</span></span>

i\. e., The empty-hearted, rejoicing in folly, goes the wrong way; the
man of understanding, rejoicing in wisdom, goes the right way.

[Proverbs 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 15:22</span></span>

Counsellors - The Hebrew word, used almost as an official title [Ch1
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032); [Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026); [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011), brings before us the picture of
the council-chamber of Eastern countries, arranged for a solemn
conference of the wise.

[Proverbs 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 15:23</span></span>

Probably, a special reference to debates in council [Pro
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#022). They bring before us the
special characteristic of the East, the delight in ready, improvised
answers, solving difficulties, turning aside anger. Compare the effect
on the scribe [Mar 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028).

[Proverbs 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 15:24</span></span>

Above ... beneath - The one path is all along upward, leading to the
highest life. It rescues the "wise" from the other, which is all along
downward, ending in the gloom of Sheol.

[Proverbs 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 15:25</span></span>

The widow - Here, as elsewhere [Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018); [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005), the widow, as the most extreme
type of desolation, stands as the representative of a class safer in
their poverty under the protection of the Lord, than the proud in the
haughtiness of their strength.

[Proverbs 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 15:26</span></span>

Some prefer the margin, and render, words of pleasantness are pure.
Gracious words are to God as a pure acceptable offering, the similitude
being taken from the Levitical ritual, and the word "pure" in half
ceremonial sense (compare [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)).

[Proverbs 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 15:27</span></span>

Gifts - There is a special application to the office of the judge. The
Aramaic Targum paraphrases the first words of this passage as: "he who
gathers the mammon of unrighteousness," using the words with special
reference to wealth obtained by unjust judgments. May we infer that
Christ's adoption of that phrase [Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009) had a point of contact with this
proverb, through the version then popularly used in the synagogues of
Palestine?

[Proverbs 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 15:28</span></span>

Contrast the "studying" of the wise before he answers and the hasty
babbling of the foolish. The teaching of our Lord [Mat
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019) presents us with a different and
higher precept, resting upon different conditions.

[Proverbs 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 15:29</span></span>

Compare [Joh 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031).

[Proverbs 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 15:30</span></span>

The light of the eyes - The brightness which shines in the eyes of one
whose heart and face are alike full of joy. Such a look acts with a
healing and quickening power. Compare [Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015).

A good report - i. e., Good news.

[Proverbs 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 15:31</span></span>

The reproof of life - i. e., The reproof that leads to, or gives life,
rather than that which comes from life and its experience.

[Proverbs 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 15:33</span></span>

The instruction of wisdom - i. e., The discipline that leads to wisdom.
