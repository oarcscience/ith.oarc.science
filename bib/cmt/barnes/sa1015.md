Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 15:1</span></span>

The absence of all chronology or note of time is remarkable.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 15:2</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. It appears [Sa1
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048.md) that this expedition against
Amalek was not made without fresh provocation. Probably some incursion
similar to that described in 1 Sam. 30 was made by them upon the south
country at a time when they thought the Israelites were weakened by
their contests with the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 15:3</span></span>

Utterly destroy - Rather, "devote to destruction" ([Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028) note.md). When a city or people
were thus made cherem, everything living was to be destroyed, and no
part of the spoil fall to the conquerors (compare [Sa1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021).md). The valuables were put into
the sacred treasury.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 15:4</span></span>

Telaim - Probably the same as "Telem" [Jos
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md), one of the uttermost cities of
Judah, toward the coast of Edom. The name means "lambs," and was
probably so called from the numerous flocks.

Two hundred thousand ... - A wonderful contrast with the six hundred men
who composed his whole army before [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md), and a proof how completely for
a time the Philistines had been driven back. The separate mention of the
men of Judah shows how little union there was between Juduh and Ephraim
even at this time; a circumstance which throws light upon the whole
after history.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 15:7</span></span>

The district here described would stretch from Havilah on the extreme
east to Shur, either near Suez, or further north on the coast road from
Gaza to Egypt.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 15:8</span></span>

The saving Agag alive was in direct violation of the devotion to
destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 15:9</span></span>

The fatlings - The present Hebrew text cannot be so rendered. It can
only mean "the second best" (compare the margin), i. e., sheep of the
age to cut or shed the two teeth, sheep in their prime. But it is
probable that the reading is corrupt, and that "fat or dainty bits" is
the true reading.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 15:11</span></span>

It grieved Samuel - "Samuel was angry, or displeased," as Jonah was [Jon
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md), and for a similar reason. Samuel
was displeased that the king whom he had anointed should be set aside.
It seemed a slur on his prophetic office.

He cried unto the Lord - With the wild scream or shriek of supplication.
(See [Sa1 7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008.md); [Sa1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#018)..md) The phrase and the action mark
Samuel's fervent, earnest character.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 15:12</span></span>

A place - Rather, "a monument." The Hebrew word יד yâd means a "hand,"
but is used in the sense of "monument," or "trophy," in [Sa2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md), where we are told that the
marble pillar which Absalom set up in his lifetime, was called "Yad
Absalom."

Carmel - (see the marginal reference) would be on Saul's line of march
on his return from the country of the Amalekites, more especially if he
came from the neighborhood of Akaba.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 15:13</span></span>

Gilgal being within 15 miles of Ramah, Samuel might easily have come
from Ramah that morning. Self-will and rashness had hitherto been Saul's
chief faults. He now seems to add falsehood and hypocrisy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 15:15</span></span>

There is something thoroughly mean in his attempt to shift the
responsibility of what was done from his own kingly shoulders to those
of the people. Every word uttered by Saul seems to indicate the breaking
down of his moral character.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 15:16</span></span>

Samuel now acquiesces in the wisdom and justice of the sentence which
[Sa1 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md) he had so strenuously
resisted at first. What before was known only to the Searcher of hearts,
had now been displayed to Samuel by Saul himself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 15:18</span></span>

The sinners - As though God would justify His commission to destroy
them. (Compare [Gen 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 15:21</span></span>

The Lord thy God - There is an implied censure of Samuel in this phrase.
Saul says that Samuel blames him for what was done in honor of Samuel's
God; as if be had more zeal for the glory of God than was felt by
Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 15:22</span></span>

Hath the Lord ... - A grand example of the moral and spiritual teaching
of the prophets (see the marginal references). The tension of Samuel's
spirit, as he is about to pronounce the sentence of rejection, produces
a lyrical turn of thought and language.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 15:23</span></span>

The meaning is "Rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and
stubbornness is as bad as worshipping false gods (iniquity), and
teraphim (idolatry)."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 15:24</span></span>

I have sinned - Compare [Sa1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025.md),
[Sa1 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030.md). How was it that these
repeated confessions were unavailing to obtain forgiveness, when David's
was? (See the marginal reference.) Because Saul only shrank from the
punishment of his sin. David shrank in abhorrence from the sin itself
[Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 15:29</span></span>

The strength of Israel - A phrase which occurs only here. The word
means, perpetuity, truth, glory, victory, and trust, or confidence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 15:30</span></span>

The pertinacity with which Saul clings to Samuel for support is a
striking testimony to Samuel's integrity. With all his
worldly-mindedness Saul could perceive and appreciate the purity of
Samuel's character as a man of God.

The Lord thy God - As above, [Sa1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 15:32</span></span>

Delicately - This phrase is very obscure. The meaning of the word so
rendered is "dainties, delights" [Gen
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md); [Pro
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#017.md); [Lam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005.md), which hardly gives a tolerable
sense here. Some understand it "fawningly, flatteringly," with a view of
appeasing Samuel. (Others alter the reading, and translate "in bonds.")

Surely the bitterness ... - Agag hopes that his life will be spared, and
so expresses his confident belief that the bitterness of death is over.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 15:33</span></span>

Hewed in pieces - Only found in this passage. Samuel thus executed the
חרם chērem [Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md) which Saul had
violated, and so both saved the nation from the guilt of a broken oath,
and gave a final example to Saul, but apparently in vain, of
uncompromising obedience to the commandments of God. There is something
awful in the majesty of the prophet rising above and eclipsing that of
the king (compare [Kg1 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md); [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md) ff; [Dan
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046.md); [Dan
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 15:35</span></span>

Samuel came no more ... - In the sense of visiting or conversing on
public affairs.
