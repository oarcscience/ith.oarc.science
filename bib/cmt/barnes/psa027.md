### [Psalms Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 27:0</span></span>

This purports to be "A Psalm of David," and there is no reason to think
that the inscription is not correct. But the occasion on which it was
composed is wholly unknown. There is no intimation of this in the title,
and there are no historical marks in the psalm which would enable us to
determine this. There were not a few occasions in the life of David when
all that is expressed in the psalm might have been said by him - as
there are many occasions, in the lives of all, to which the sentiments
of the psalm would be appropriate. The Septuagint version has the title,
"A Psalm of David before his anointing,"...πρὀ τοῦ χρισθῆναι pro tou
christhēnai. Grotius supposes the occasion to have been the anointing in
Hebron, when he was first inaugurated as king, [Sa2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md). Rosenmuller refers it to the last
anointing, [Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md). Many of the
Jewish expositors refer the psalm to the last days of David, when he was
delivered from death by the intervention of Abishai, [Sa2
21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md). But there is no internal
evidence that the psalm was composed on either of these occasions, and
it is now impossible to ascertain the time or the circumstances of its
composition.

The general object of the psalm is to excite in others confidence in God
from the experience which the psalmist had of His merciful interposition
in times of trouble and danger, [Psa
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md). The author of the psalm had had
some marked evidence of the divine favor and protection in seasons of
peril and sorrow [Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md); and he
makes use of this as an argument running through the psalm to lead
others to repose on God in similar circumstances. It may have been that
at the time of composing the psalm he was still surrounded by enemies,
and exposed to danger; but if so, he expresses the utmost confidence in
God, and gratefully refers to His past interposition in similar
circumstances as full proof that all his interests would be secure.

The contents of the psalm are:

I. An expression of confidence in God as derived from his own experience
of His merciful interposition in times of danger, [Psa
27:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md). He had been in peril at some
time which is not specified, and had been rescued; and from this
gracious interposition he argues that it would be safe always to trust
in God.

II\. The expression of a desire to dwell always where God is; to see his
beauty there; to inquire further after him; to offer sacrifices; and to
praise him, [Psa 27:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md). The psalmist
had seen so much of God that he desired to see yet more; he had had such
experience of his favor that he wished always to be with Him; he had
found so much happiness in God that he believed that all his happiness
was to be found in His presence, and in His service.

III\. An earnest prayer that God would hear him; that he would grant his
requests; that he would save him from all his enemies; that he would
lead him in a plain path, [Psa
27:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md). This is founded partly on his
own past experience, that when God had commanded him to seek His face he
had obeyed [Psa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md), and it is
connected with the fullest assurance that God would protect him, even if
he would be forsaken by his father and mother [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md).

IV\. The conclusion - the exhortation to wait on the Lord, [Psa
27:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md). This exhortation is derived
from his own experience. He says that he himself would have fainted if
he had not confided in God and hoped in His mercy, when there was no
other hope [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md); and, in view of
that experience, he encourages all others to put their trust in Him [Psa
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 27:1</span></span>

The Lord is my light - He is to me the source of light. That is, He
guides and leads me. Darkness is the emblem of distress, trouble,
perplexity, and sorrow; light is the emblem of the opposite of these.
God furnished him such light that these troubles disappeared, and his
way was bright and happy.

And my salvation - That is, He saves or delivers me.

Whom shall I fear? - Compare [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md). If God is on our side, or is for
us, we can have no apprehension of danger. He is abundantly able to
protect us, and we may confidently trust in Him. No one needs any better
security against the objects of fear or dread than the conviction that
God is his friend.

The Lord is the strength of my life - The support of my life. Or, in
other words, He keeps me alive. In itself life is feeble, and is easily
crushed out by trouble and sorrow; but as long as God is its strength,
there is nothing to fear.

Of whom shall I be afraid? - No one has power to take life away while He
defends me. God is to those who put their trust in Him a stronghold or
fortress, and they are safe.

[Psalms 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 27:2</span></span>

When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me - This
refers, doubtless, to some particular period of his past life when he
was in very great danger, and when God interposed to save him. The
margin here is, "approached against me." The literal rendering would be,
"in the drawing near against me of the wicked to eat up my flesh." The
reference is to some period when they purposed an attack upon him, and
when he was in imminent danger from such a threatened attack.

To eat up my flesh - As if they would eat me up. That is, they came upon
me like ravening wolves, or hungry lions. We are not to suppose that
they literally purposed to eat up his flesh, or that they were
cannibals; but the comparison is one that is drawn from the fierceness
of wild beasts rushing on their prey. Compare [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md).

They stumbled and fell - They were overthrown. They failed in their
purpose. Either they were thrown into a panic by a false fear, or they
were overthrown in battle. The language would be rather applicable to
the former, as if by some alarm they were thrown into consternation.
Either they differed among themselves and became confused, or God threw
obstacles in their way and they were driven back. The general idea is,
that God had interposed in some way to prevent the execution of their
purposes.

[Psalms 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 27:3</span></span>

Though an host - Though an "army;" that is, any army, or any number of
men in battle array. The past interposition of God in similar times of
trouble and danger was to him a sufficient security that he had nothing
to fear.

Should encamp against me - In battle array, or prepared for battle.

My heart shall not fear - He would not tremble; he would not feel that
there was anything of which to be afraid. God had shown Himself superior
to the power of hostile armies, and the psalmist felt assured that he
might confide in Him.

Though war should rise against me - Though it should be proclaimed, and
though all preparation should be made for it, I will not be afraid.

In this will I be confident - In such a case, in such an extremity or
emergency, I would calmly trust in God. He would apprehend no danger,
for he had seen that the Lord could deliver him.

[Psalms 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 27:4</span></span>

One thing have I desired of the Lord - One main object; one thing that I
have especially desired; one thing which has been the object of my
constant wish. This ruling desire of his heart the psalmist has more
than once adverted to in the previous psalms (compare [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md); [Psa
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008).md); and he frequently refers to it
in the subsequent psalms.

That will I seek after - As the leading object of my life; as the thing
which I most earnestly desire.

That I may dwell in the house of the Lord - See the notes at [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md).

All the days of my life - Constantly; to the end. Though engaged in
other things, and though there were other objects of interest in the
world, yet he felt that it would be supreme felicity on earth to dwell
always in the temple of God, and to be employed in its sacred services,
preparatory to an eternal residence in the temple above. To him the
service of God upon earth was not burdensome, nor did he anticipate that
he would ever become weary of praising his Maker. How can a man be
prepared for an eternal heaven who finds the worship of God on earth
irksome and tedious?

To behold the beauty of the Lord - Margin, "the delight." The word
rendered "beauty" here - נעם nô‛am - means properly "pleasantness;"
then, "beauty, splendor;" then, "grace, favor." The reference here is to
the beauty or loveliness of the divine character as it was particularly
manifested in the public worship of God, or by those symbols which in
the ancient worship were designed to make that character known. In the
tabernacle and in the temple there was a manifestation of the character
of God not seen elsewhere. The whole worship was adapted to set forth
his greatness, his glory, and his grace. Great truths were brought
before the mind, fitted to elevate, to comfort, and to sanctify the
soul; and it was in the contemplation of those truths that the psalmist
sought to elevate and purify his own mind, and to sustain himself in the
troubles and perplexities of life. Compare [Psa
73:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md).

And to inquire in his temple - Or tabernacle. The word used here would
be applicable to either, considered as the "palace" or the residence of
Yahweh. As the temple was not, however, built at this time, the word
must here be understood to refer to the tabernacle. See the notes at
[Psa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md). The meaning of the passage
is, that he would wish to seek instruction, or to obtain light on the
great questions pertaining to God, and that he looked for this light in
the place where God was worshipped, and by means of the views which that
worship was adapted to convey to the mind. In a manner still more direct
and full may we now hope to obtain just views of God by attendance on
his worship. The Christian sanctuary - the place of public worship - is
the place where, if anywhere on earth, we may hope to have our minds
enlightened; our perplexities removed; our hearts comforted and
sanctifed, by right views of God.

[Psalms 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 27:5</span></span>

For in the time of trouble - When I am surrounded by dangers, or when
affliction comes upon me.

He shall hide me - The word used here means to hide; to secrete; and
then, to defend or protect. It would properly be applied to one who had
fled from oppression, or from any impending evil, and who should be
"secreted" in a house or cavern, and thus rendered safe from pursuers,
or from the threatening evil.

In his pavilion - The word "pavilion" means "tent" or "tabernacle." The
Hebrew word - סכה sukâh - means properly a booth, hut, or cot formed of
green branches interwoven: [Jon 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005.md);
[Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018.md); see the notes at [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md). Then it is applied to tents made
of skins: [Lev 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043.md); [Sa2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011.md). It thus is used to denote the
tabernacle, considered as the dwelling-place of God on earth, and the
meaning here is, that God would hide him as it were in His own dwelling;
He would admit him near to Himself; He would take care that he should be
protected as if he were one of His own family; as a man protects those
whom he admits to his own abode.

In the secret of his tabernacle - In the most retired and private part
of His dwelling. He would not merely admit him to His premises; not only
to the vestibule of His house; not only to the open court, or to the
parts of His house frequented by the rest of His family; but he would
admit him to the private apartments - the place to which He Himself
withdrew to be alone, and where no stranger, and not even one of the
family, would venture to intrude. Nothing could more certainly denote
friendship; nothing could more certainly make protection sure, than thus
to be taken into the private apartment where the master of a family was
accustomed himself to withdraw, that he might be alone; and nothing,
therefore, can more beautifully describe the protection which God will
give to His friends than the idea of thus admitting them to the secret
apartments of His own dwelling-place.

He shall set me up upon a rock - A place where I shall be secure; a
place inaccessible to my enemies. Compare [Psa
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md); [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014) (margin.md); [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md); [Psa
71:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003.md). The meaning is, that he would be
safe from all his enemies.

[Psalms 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 27:6</span></span>

And now shall mine head - Now shall I be exalted. So we say that in
affliction a person bows down his head; in prosperity he lifts it up.
This verse expresses the confident expectation that he would be enabled
to triumph over all his foes, and a firm purpose on his part, as the
result of this, to offer sacrifices of praise to his great Deliverer.

Above mine enemies round about me - All my enemies, though they seem
even to encompass me on every side.

Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle - In His tent, His
dwelling-place: referring here, undoubtedly, to "the tabernacle" as a
place where God was worshipped.

Sacrifices of joy - Margin, as in the Hebrew, of "shouting." That is, he
would offer sacrifices accompanied with loud sounds of praise and
thanksgiving. There is nothing wrong in shouting for joy when a person
is delivered from imminent danger, nothing wrong in doing so when he
feels that he is rescued from the peril of eternal ruin.

I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord - This language is
that which comes from a full heart. He is not contented with saying
merely that he would "sing." He repeats the idea; he dwells upon it.
With a heart overflowing with gratitude he would go and give utterance
to his joy. He would repeat, and dwell upon, the language of
thanksgiving.

[Psalms 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 27:7</span></span>

Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice - This earnest prayer seems to
have been prompted by a returning sense of danger. He had had assurance
of the divine favor. He had found God ready to help him. He did not
doubt but that He would aid him; yet all this did not prevent his
calling upon Him for the aid which he needed, but rather stimulated him
to do it. With all the deep-felt conviction of his heart that God was
ready and willing to assist him, he still felt that he had no reason to
hope for His aid unless he called upon Him. The phrase "when I cry with
my voice" refers to the fact that he prayed audibly or aloud. It was not
mental prayer, but that which found expression in the language of
earnest entreaty.

[Psalms 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 27:8</span></span>

When thou saidst, Seek ye my face ... - Margin, "My heart said unto
thee, Let my face seek thy face." The literal translation would be: "To
Thee hath said my heart, Seek ye my face; thy face, O Lord, will I
seek." DeWette thus expresses the idea, "Of thee my heart thinks (in
regard to the command to seek thy face), thy face, Lord, I will seek."
Our translators have given the correct meaning, though the original is
quite obscure. The passage is designed to denote the state of the mind,
or the disposition, in regard to the commands of God. The command or
precept was to seek God. The prompt purpose of the mind or heart of the
psalmist was, that he would do it. He "immediately" complied with that
command, as it was a principle of his life - one of the steady
promptings of his heart - that he would do this. The heart asked no
excuse; pleaded for no delay; desired no reason for not complying with
the command, but at once assented to the propriety of the law, and
resolved to obey. This related undoubtedly at first to prayer, but the
"principle" is applicable to all the commands of God. It is the
prompting of a pious heart immediately and always to obey the voice of
God, no matter what his command is, and no matter what sacrifice may be
required in obeying it.

[Psalms 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 27:9</span></span>

Hide not thy face far from me - Compare the notes at [Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md). To "hide the face" is to turn it
away with displeasure, as if we would not look on one who has offended
us. The favor of God is often expressed by "lifting the light of his
countenance" upon anyone - looking complacently or "pleasedly" upon him.
The reverse of this is expressed by hiding the face, or by turning it
away. The word "far" introduced by the translators does not aid the
sense of the passage.

Put not thy servant away in anger - Do not turn me off, or put me away
in displeasure. We turn one away, or do not admit him into our presence,
with whom we are displeased. The psalmist prayed that he might have free
access to God as a Friend.

Thou hast been my help - In days that are past. This he urges as a
reason why God should still befriend him. The fact that He had shown
mercy to him, that He had treated him as a friend, is urged as a reason
why He should now hear his prayers, and show him mercy.

Leave me not - Do not abandon me. This is still a proper ground of
pleading with God. We may refer to all His former mercies toward us; we
may make mention of those mercies as a reason why He should now
interpose and save us. We may, so to speak, "remind" him of His former
favors and friendship, and may plead with Him that He will complete what
He has begun, and that, having once admitted us to His favor, He will
never leave or forsake us.

[Psalms 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 27:10</span></span>

When my father and my mother forsake me - If they should do it. The
psalmist supposes it possible that this might occur. It does occur,
though very rarely; but the psalmist means to say that the love of God
is stronger and more certain than even that of a father or mother, since
he will never forsake his people. Though every other tie that binds
heart to heart should dissolve, this will remain; though a case might
occur in which we could not be sure of the love that naturally springs
out of the most tender earthly relationships, yet we can always confide
in His love. See the notes at [Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md).

Then the Lord will take me up - Margin, "will gather me." The margin
expresses the usual meaning of the word. It is sometimes used as
referring to the hospitable reception of strangers or wanderers into
one's house: [Jdg 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015.md), [Jdg
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018.md); [Jos
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004.md). The meaning here is, that if he
should be forsaken by his nearest earthly friends, and be an outcast and
a wanderer, so that no one on earth would take him in, the Lord would
then receive him.

[Psalms 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 27:11</span></span>

Teach me thy way, O Lord - See the notes at [Psa
25:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md).

And lead me in a plain path - Margin, "a way of plainness." That is, a
straight or smooth path. In other words, he prayed that he might be
enabled to act wisely and right; he desired that God would teach him
what he should do.

Because of mine enemies - Margin, "those which observe me." The
translation in the text expresses the true sense. The word which is used
is derived from a verb that signifies "to twist; to twist together;" and
then, to oppress; to treat as an enemy. Here it refers to those who
would treat him harshly or cruelly; and he prays that God would show him
how to act in view of the fact that he was surrounded by such foes. They
were harsh and cruel; they sought to overcome him; they laid snares for
him. He knew not how to act so as to escape from them, and he,
therefore, pleads that God would instruct and guide him.

[Psalms 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 27:12</span></span>

Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies - Let them not
accomplish their desires in regard to me; let them not be able to carry
out their purposes. The word here rendered "will" means properly "soul,"
but it is used here evidently to denote "wish" or "desire." Compare [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md).

For false witnesses are risen up against me - People who would lay false
charges against him, or who would wrongfully accuse him. They charged
him with crimes which he never committed, and they persecuted him as if
he were guilty of what they alleged against him.

And such as breathe out cruelty - That is, they meditate violence or
cruel treatment. They are intent on this; they pant for it. Saul of
Tarsus thus "breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord." See the notes at [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 27:13</span></span>

I had fainted, unless I had believed - The words "I had fainted" are
supplied by the translators, but they undoubtedly express the true sense
of the passage. The psalmist refers to the state of mind produced by the
efforts of his enemies to destroy him, as mentioned in [Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md). So numerous, mighty, and
formidable were they, that he says his only support was his faith in
God; his belief that he would yet be permitted to see the goodness of
God upon the earth. In this time of perplexity and trial he had
confidence in God, and believed that He would uphold him, and would
permit him to see the evidences of His goodness and mercy while yet on
the earth. What was the ground of this confidence he does not say, but
he had the fullest belief that this would be so. He may have had some
special assurance of it, or he may have had a deep internal conviction
of it, sufficient to calm his mind; but whatever was the source of this
confidence it was that which sustained him. A similar state of feeling
is indicated in the remarkable passage in Job, [Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md). See the notes at that
passage.

To see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living - That is,
that I should "live," and yet see and enjoy the tokens of the divine
favor here upon the earth.

[Psalms 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 27:14</span></span>

Wait on the Lord - This is the sum of all the instruction in the psalm;
the main lesson which the psalm is designed to convey. The object is to
induce others, from the experience of the psalmist, to trust in the
Lord; to rely upon Him; to come to Him in trouble and danger; to wait
for His interposition when all other resources fail. Compare [Psa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003.md).

Be of good courage - The Hebrew word here means, "be strong." That is,
do not faint. Do not be dismayed. Still hope and trust in the Lord.

He shall strengthen thine heart - He will strengthen "thee." He will
enable you to perform your duties, and to triumph over your enemies. See
the notes at [Isa 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md).

Wait, I say, on the Lord - Repeating an idea with which the heart was
full; a lesson resulting from his own rich experience. He dwells upon it
as a lesson which he would fix deeply in the mind, that in all times of
danger and difficulty, instead of despondency, instead of sinking down
in despair, instead of giving up all effort, we should go forward in the
discharge of duty, putting our trust solely in the Lord.
