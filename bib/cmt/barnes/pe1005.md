### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe1 5:0</span></span>

This chapter embraces the following subjects:

I. An exhortation to the elders of the churches to be faithful to the
flocks committed to their charge, [Pe1
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md).

II\. An exhortation to the younger members of the church to evince all
proper submission to those who were older; to occupy the station in
which they were placed with a becoming spirit, casting all their care on
God, [Pe1 5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md).

III\. An exhortation to be sober and vigilant, in view of the dangers
which beset them, and the arts and power of their great adversary, the
devil, and especially to bear with patience the trials to which they
were subjected, in common with their Christian brethren elsewhere, [Pe1
5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md).

IV\. Salutations, [Pe1 5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md).

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

The elders which are among you I exhort - The word "elder" means,
properly, "one who is old;" but it is frequently used in the New
Testament as applicable to the officers of the church; probably because
aged persons were at first commonly appointed to these offices. See [Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md), note; [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md), note; [Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md), note. There is evidently an
allusion here to the fact that such persons were selected on account of
their age, because in the following verses ([Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).md) the apostle addresses
particularly the younger. It is worthy of remark, that he here refers
only to one class of ministers. He does not speak of three "orders," of
"bishops, priests, and deacons;" and the evidence from the passage here
is quite strong that there were no such orders in the churches of Asia
Minor, to which this Epistle was directed. It is also worthy of remark,
that the word "exhort" is here used. The language which Peter uses is
not that of stern and arbitrary command; it is that of kind and mild
Christian exhortation. Compare the notes at [Plm
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md).

Who am also an elder - Greek: "a fellow-presbyter," (συμπρεσβύτερος
sumpresbuteros.) This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It
means that he was a co-presbyter with them; and he makes this one of the
grounds of his exhortation to them. He does not put it on the ground of
his apostolical authority; or urge it because he was the vicegerent of
Christ; or because he was the head of the church; or because he had any
pre-eminence over others in any way. Would he have used this language if
he had been the "head of the church" on earth? Would he if he supposed
that the distinction between apostles and other ministers was to be
perpetuated? Would he if he believed that there were to be distinct
orders of clergy? The whole drift of this passage is adverse to such a
supposition.

And a witness of the sufferings of Christ - Peter was indeed a witness
of the sufferings of Christ when on his trial, and doubtless also when
he was scourged and mocked, and when he was crucified. After his denial
of his Lord, he wept bitterly, and evidently then followed him to the
place where he was crucified, and, in company with others, observed with
painful solicitude the last agonies of his Saviour. It is not, so far as
I know, expressly said in the Gospels that Peter was pre sent at the
crucifixion of the Saviour; but it is said [Luk
23:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#049.md) that "all his acquaintance, and
the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding
these things," and nothing is more probable than that Peter was among
them. His warm attachment to his Master, and his recent bitter
repentance for having denied him, would lead him to follow him to the
place of his death; for after the painful act of denying him he would
not be likely to expose himself to the charge of neglect, or of any want
of love again. His own solemn declaration here makes it certain that he
was present. He alludes to it now, evidently because it qualified him to
exhort those whom he addressed. It would be natural to regard with
special respect one who had actually seen the Saviour in his last agony,
and nothing would be more impressive than an exhortation falling from
the lips of such a man. A son would be likely to listen with great
respect to any suggestions which should be made by one who had seen his
father or mother die. The impression which Peter had of that scene he
would desire to have transferred to those whom he addressed, that by a
lively view of the sufferings of their Saviour they might be excited to
fidelity in his cause.

And a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed - Another reason to
make his exhortation impressive and solemn. He felt that he was an heir
of life. He was about to partake of the glories of heaven. Looking
forward, as they did also, to the blessed world before him and them, he
had a right to exhort them to the faithful performance of duty. Anyone,
who is himself an heir of salvation, may appropriately exhort his
fellow-Christians to fidelity in the service of their common Lord.

[1 Peter 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 5:2</span></span>

Feed the flock of God - Discharge the duties of a shepherd toward the
flock. On the word "feed," see the notes at [Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md). It is a word which Peter would
be likely to remember, from the solemn manner in which the injunction to
perform the duty was laid on him by the Saviour. The direction means to
take such an oversight of the church as a shepherd is accustomed to take
of his flock. See the notes at John 10:1-16.

Which is among you - Margin, as much as in you is. The translation in
the text is the more correct. It means the churches which were among
them, or over which they were called to preside.

Taking the oversight thereof - ἐπισκοποῦντες episkopountes. The fair
translation of this word is, "discharging the episcopal office"; and the
word implies all that is always implied by the word "bishop" in the New
Testament. This idea should have been expressed in the translation. The
meaning is not merely to take the oversight - for that might be done in
a subordinate sense by anyone in office; but it is to take such an
oversight as is implied in the episcopate, or by the word "bishop." The
words "episcopate," "episcopal," and "episcopacy," are merely the Greek
word used here and its correlatives transferred to our language. The
sense is that of overseeing; taking the oversight of; looking after, as
of a flock; and the word has originally no reference to what is now
spoken of as especially the episcopal office. It is a word strictly
applicable to any minister of religion, or officer of a church. In the
passage before us this duty was to be performed by those who, in [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md), are called presbyters, or elders;
and this is one of the numerous passages in the New Testament which
prove that all that is properly implied in the performance of the
episcopal functions pertained to those who were called presbyters, or
elders. If so, there was no higher grade of ministers to which the
special duties of the episcopate were to be entrusted; that is, there
was no class of officers corresponding to those who are now called
"bishops." Compare the notes at [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md).

Not by constraint, but willingly - Not as if you felt that a heavy yoke
was imposed on you, or a burden from which you would gladly be
discharged. Go cheerfully to your duty as a work which you love, and act
like a freeman in it, and not as a slave. Arduous as are the labors of
the ministry, yet there is no work on earth in which a man can and
should labor more cheerfully.

Not for filthy lucre - Shameful or dishonorable gain. See the notes at
[Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md).

But of a ready mind - Cheerfully, promptly. We are to labor in this
work, not under the influence of the desire of gain, but from the
promptings of love. There is all the difference conceivable between one
who does a thing because he is paid for it, and one who does it from
love - between, for example, the manner in which one attends on us when
we are sick who loves us, and one who is merely hired to do it. Such a
difference is there in the spirit with which one who is actuated by
mercenary motives, and one whose heart is in the work, will engage in
the ministry.

[1 Peter 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 5:3</span></span>

Neither as being lords - Margin, "overruling." The word here used
(κατακυριεύω katakurieuō) is rendered "exercise dominion over," in [Mat
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#025.md); exercise lordship over, in [Mar
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042.md); and overcame, in [Act
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016.md). It does not elsewhere occur in
the New Testament. It refers properly to that kind of jurisdiction which
civil rulers or magistrates exercise. This is an exercise of authority,
as contradistinguished from the influence of reason, persuasion, and
example. The latter pertains to the ministers of religion; the former is
forbidden to them. Their dominion is not to be that of temporal
lordship; it is to be that of love and truth. This command would
prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion,
and all conferring of titles of nobility on those who are preachers of
the gospel. It needs scarcely to be said that it has been very little
regarded in the church.

Over God's heritage - των κλήρων tōn klērōn. Vulgate: "in cleris" - over
the clergy. The Greek word here (κλῆρος klēros) is that from which the
word "clergy" has been derived; and some have interpreted it here as
referring to the clergy, that is, to priests and deacons who are under
the authority of a bishop. Such an interpretation, I however, would
hardly be adopted now. The word means properly:

\(a\) a lot, die, anything used in determining chances;

\(b\) a part or portion, such as is assigned by lot; hence,

\(c\) an office to which one is designated or appointed, by lot or
otherwise; and,

\(d\) in general any possession or heritage, [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md); [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md).

The meaning here is, "not lording it over the possessions or the
heritage of God." The reference is, undoubtedly, to the church, as that
which is especially his property; his own in the world. Whitby and
others suppose that it refers to the possessions or property of the
church; Doddridge explains it - "not assuming dominion over those who
fall to your lot," supposing it to mean that they were not to domineer
over the particular congregations committed by Providence to their care.
But the other interpretation is most in accordance with the usual
meaning of the word.

But being ensamples to the flock - Examples. See the notes at [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md). Peter has drawn here with great
beauty, the appropriate character of the ministers of the gospel, and
described the spirit with which they should be actuated in the discharge
of the duties of their office. But how different it is from the
character of many who have claimed to be ministers of religion; and
especially how different from that corrupt communion which professes in
a special manner to recognize Peter as the head, and the vicegerent of
Christ. It is well remarked by Benson on this passage, that "the church
of Rome could not well have acted more directly contrary to this
injunction of Peter's if she had studied to disobey it, and to form
herself upon a rule that should be the reverse of this."

[1 Peter 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 5:4</span></span>

And when the chief Shepherd shall appear - The prince of the pastors -
the Lord Jesus Christ. "Peter, in the passage above, ranks himself with
the elders; here he ranks Christ himself with the pastors" - Benson. See
the notes at [Pe1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025.md). Compare [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md).

Ye shall receive a crown of glory - A glorious crown or diadem. Compare
the notes at [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

That fadeth not away - This is essentially the same word, though
somewhat different in form, which occurs in [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). See the notes at that verse. The
word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Compare the notes at [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md).

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

Likewise, ye younger - All younger persons of either sex.

Submit yourselves unto the elder - That is, with the respect due to
their age, and to the offices which they sustain. There is here,
probably, a particular reference to those who sustained the office of
elders or teachers, as the same word is used here which occurs in [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md). As there was an allusion in that
verse, by the use of the word, to age, so there is in this verse to the
fact that they sustained an office in the church. The general duty,
however, is here implied, as it is everywhere in the Bible, that all
suitable respect is to be shown to the aged. Compare [Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md); [Ti1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md); [Act
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004.md); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009.md).

Yea, all of you be subject one to another - In your proper ranks and
relations. You are not to attempt to lord it over one another, but are
to treat each other with deference and respect. See the [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md) note; [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md) note.

And be clothed with humility - The word here rendered "be clothed"
(ἐγκομβώμαι egkombōmai) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is
derived from κόμβος kombos - a strip, string, or loop to fasten a
garment; and then the word refers to a garment that was fastened with
strings. The word ἐγκόμβωμα engkombōma refers particularly to a long
white apron, or outer garment, that was commonly worn by slaves. See
Robinson, Lexicon; Passow, Lexicon. There is, therefore, special force
in the use of this word here, as denoting an humble mind. They were to
be willing to take any place, and to perform any office, however humble,
in order to serve and benefit others. They were not to assume a style
and dignity of state and authority, as if they would lord it over
others, or as if they were better than others; but they were to be
willing to occupy any station, however humble, by which they might honor
God. It is known that not a few of the early Christians actually sold
themselves as slaves, in order that they might preach the gospel to
those who were in bondage. The sense here is, they were to put on
humility as a garment bound fast to them, as a servant bound fast to him
the apron that was significant of his station. Compare [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md). It is not unusual in the
Scriptures, as well as in other writings, to compare the virtues with
articles of apparel; as that with which we are clothed, or in which we
are seen by others. Compare [Isa 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005.md);
[Isa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md).

For God resisteth the proud ... - This passage is quoted from the Greek
translation in [Pro 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md). See it
explained in the notes at [Jam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md),
where it is also quoted.

[1 Peter 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 5:6</span></span>

Humble yourselves therefore - Be willing to take a low place - a place
such as becomes you. Do not arrogate to yourselves what does not belong
to you; do not evince pride and haughtiness in your manner; do not exalt
yourselves above others. See the notes at [Luk
14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md). Compare [Pro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033.md); [Pro
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012.md); [Pro
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004.md); [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md); [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md).

Under the mighty hand of God - This refers probably to the calamities
which he had brought upon them, or was about to bring upon them;
represented here, as often elsewhere, as the infliction of his hand -
the hand being that by which we accomplish anything. When that hand was
upon them they were not to be lifted up with pride and with a spirit of
rebellion, but were to take a lowly place before him, and submit to him
wish a calm mind, believing that he would exalt them in due time. There
is no situation in which one will be more likely to feel humility than
in scenes of affliction.

That he may exalt you in due time - When he shall see it to be a proper
time:

\(1\) They might be assured that this would be done at some time. He
would not always leave them in this low and depressed condition. He
would take off his heavy hand, and raise them up from their state of
sadness and suffering.

\(2\) this would be in due time; that is, in the proper time, in the
best time:

\(a\) It might be in the present life.

\(b\) It would certainly be in the world to come. There they would be
exalted to honors which will be more than an equivalent for all the
persecution, poverty, and contempt which are suffered in this world. He
may well afford to be humble here who is to be exalted to a throne in
heaven.

[1 Peter 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 5:7</span></span>

Casting all your care upon him - Compare [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md), from whence this passage was
probably taken. "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain
thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." Compare, for a
similar sentiment, [Mat 6:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md). The
meaning is, that we are to commit our whole cause to him. If we suffer
heavy trials; if we lose our friends, health, or property; if we have
arduous and responsible duties to perform; if we feel that we have no
strength, and are in danger of being crushed by what is laid upon us, we
may go and cast all upon the Lord; that is, we may look to him for grace
and strength, and feel assured that he will enable us to sustain all
that is laid upon us. The relief in the case will be as real, and as
full of consolation, as if he took the burden and bore it himself. He
will enable us to bear with ease what we supposed we could never have
done; and the burden which he lays upon us will be light, [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md). Compare the notes at [Phi
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md).

For he careth for you - See the notes at [Mat
10:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md). He is not like the gods
worshipped by many of the pagan, who were supposed to be so exalted, and
so distant, that they did not interest themselves in human affairs; but
He condescends to regard the needs of the meanest of his creatures. It
is one of the glorious attributes of the true God, that he can and will
thus notice the needs of the mean as well as the mighty; and one of the
richest of all consolations when we are afflicted, and are despised by
the world, is the thought that we are not forgotten by our heavenly
Father. He who remembers the falling sparrow, and who hears the young
ravens when they cry, will not be unmindful of us. "Yet the Lord
thinketh on me," was the consolation of David, when he felt that he was
"poor and needy," [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md). "When my
father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up," [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md).

Compare [Isa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md). What more can one
wish than to be permitted to feel that the great and merciful Yahweh
thinks on him? What are we - what have we done, that should be worthy of
such condescension? Remember, poor, despised, afflicted child of God,
that you will never be forgotten. Friends on earth, the great, the
frivilous, the noble, the rich, may forget you; God never will. Remember
that you will never be entirely neglected. Father, mother, neighbor,
friend, those whom you have loved, and those to whom you have done good,
may neglect you, but God never will. You may become poor, and they may
pass by you; you may lose your office, and flatterers may no longer
throng your path; your beauty may fade, and your admirers may leave you;
you may grow old, and be infirm, and appear to be useless in the world,
and no one may seem to care for you; but it is not thus with the God
whom you serve. When he loves, he always loves; if he regarded you with
favor when you were rich, he will not forget you when you are poor; he
who watched over you with a parent's care in the bloom of youth, will
not cast you off when you are "old and grey-headed," [Psa
71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md). If we are what we should be, we
shall never be without a friend as long as there is a God.

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

Be sober - While you cast your cares Upon God, and have no anxiety on
that score, let your solicitude be directed to another point. Do not
doubt that he is able and willing to support and befriend you, but be
watchful against your foes. See the word used here fully explained in
the notes at [Th1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md).

Be vigilant - This word (γρηγορέω grēgoreō) is everywhere else in the
New Testament rendered "watch." See [Mat
24:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042.md); [Mat
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013.md); [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md), [Mat
26:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040.md). It means that we should
exercise careful circumspection, as one does when he is in danger. In
reference to the matter here referred to, it means that we are to be on
our guard against the wiles and the power of the evil one.

Your adversary the devil - Your enemy; he who is opposed to you. Satan
opposes man in his best interests. He resists his efforts to do good;
his purposes to return to God; his attempts to secure his own salvation.
There is no more appropriate appellation that can be given to him than
to say that he resists all our efforts to obey God and to secure the
salvation of our own souls.

As a roaring lion - Compare [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md). Sometimes Satan is represented
as transforming himself into an angel of light, (see the notes at [Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014).md); and sometimes, as here, as a
roaring lion: denoting the efforts which he makes to alarm and overpower
us. The lion here is not the crouching lion - the lion stealthfully
creeping toward his foe - but it is the raging monarch of the woods, who
by his terrible roar would intimidate all so that they might become an
easy prey. The particular thing referred to here, doubtless, is
persecution, resembling in its terrors a roaring lion. When error comes
in; when seductive arts abound; when the world allures and charms the
representation of the character of the foe is not of the roaring lion,
but of the silent influence of an enemy that has clothed himself in the
garb of an angel of light, [Co2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014.md).

Walketh about, seeking whom he may devour - "Naturalists have observed
that a lion roars when he is roused with hunger, for then he is most
fierce, and most eagerly seeks his prey. See [Jdg
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md); [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013.md); [Jer
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015.md); [Eze
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025.md); [Hos
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md); [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); [Zac
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#003.md)" - Benson.

[1 Peter 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 5:9</span></span>

Whom resist - See the notes at [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md). You are in no instance to yield
to him, but are in all forms to stand up and oppose him. Feeble in
yourselves, you are to confide in the arm of God. No matter in what form
of terror he approaches, you are to fight manfully the fight of faith.
Compare the notes at [Eph 6:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md).

Steadfast in the faith - Confiding in God. You are to rely on him alone,
and the means of successful resistance are to be found in the resources
of faith. See the notes at [Eph 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md).

Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that
are in the world - Compare for a similar sentiment, [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md). The meaning is, that you should
be encouraged to endure your trials by the fact that your
fellow-Christians suffer the same things. This consideration might
furnish consolation to them in their trials in the following ways:

\(1\) They would feel that they were suffering only the common lot of
Christians. There was no evidence that God was especially angry with
them, or that he had in a special manner forsaken them.

\(2\) the fact that others were enabled to bear their trials should be
an argument to prove to them that they would also be able. If they
looked abroad, and saw that others were sustained, and were brought off
triumphant, they might be assured that this would be the case with them.

\(3\) there would be the support derived from the fact that they were
not alone in suffering. We can bear pain more easily if we feel that we
are not alone - that it is the common lot - that we are in circumstances
where we may have sympathy from others. This remark may be of great
practical value to us in view of persecutions, trials, and death. The
consideration suggested here by Peter to sustain those whom he
addressed, in the trials of persecution, may be applied now to sustain
and comfort us in every form of apprehended or real calamity. We are all
liable to suffering. We are exposed to sickness, bereavement, death. We
often feet as if we could not bear up under the sufferings that may be
before us, and especially do we dread the great trial - death. It may
furnish us some support and consolation to remember:

\(1\) that this is the common lot of people. There is nothing special in
our case. It proves nothing as to the question whether we are accepted
of God, and are beloved by him, that we suffer; for those whom he has
loved most have been often among the greatest sufferers. We often think
that our sufferings are unique; that there have been none like them.
Yet, if we knew all, we should find that thousands - and among them the
most wise, and pure, and good - have endured sufferings of the same kind
as ours, and perhaps far more intense in degree.

\(2\) others have been conveyed triumphantly through their trials. We
have reason to hope and to believe that we shall also, for:

\(a\) our trials have been no greater than theirs have been; and,

\(b\) their natural strength was no greater than ours. Many of them were
timid, and shrinking, and trembling, and felt that they had no strength,
and that they should fail under the trial.

\(3\) the grace which sustained them can sustain us. The hand of God is
not shortened that it cannot save; his ear is not heavy that it cannot
hear. His power is as great, and his grace is as fresh, as it was when
the first sufferer was supported by him; and that divine strength which
supported David and Job in their afflictions, and the apostles and
martyrs in theirs, is just as powerful as it was when they applied to
God to be upheld in their sorrows.

\(4\) we are especially fearful of death - fearful that our faith will
fail, and that we shall be left to die without support or consolation.
Yet let us remember that death is the common lot of man. Let us remember
who have died - tender females; children; the timid and the fearful;
those, in immense multitudes, who had no more strength by nature than we
have. Let us think of our own kindred who have died. A wife has died,
and shall a husband be afraid to die? A child, and shall a father? A
sister, and shall a brother? It does much to take away the dread of
death, to remember that a mother has gone through the dark valley; that
that gloomy vale has been trod by delicate, and timid, and beloved
sisters. Shall I be afraid to go where they have gone? Shall I apprehend
that I shall find no grace that is able to sustain me where they have
found it? Must the valley of the shadow of death be dark and gloomy to
me, when they found it to be illuminated with the opening light of
heaven? Above all, it takes away the fear of death when I remember that
my Saviour has experienced all the horrors which can ever be in death;
that he has slept in the tomb, and made it a hallowed resting-place.

But the God of all grace - The God who imparts all needful grace. It was
proper in their anticipated trials to direct them to God, and to breathe
forth in their behalf an earnest and affectionate prayer that they might
be supported. A prayer of this kind by an apostle would also be to them
a sort of pledge or assurance that the needed grace would be granted
them.

Who hath called us unto his eternal glory - And who means, therefore,
that we shall be saved. As he has called us to his glory, we need not
apprehend that he will leave or forsake us. On the meaning of the word
called, see the notes at [Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md).

After that ye have suffered a while - After you have suffered as long as
he shall appoint. The Greek is, "having suffered a little," and may
refer either to time or degree. In both respects the declaration
concerning afflictions is true. They are short, compared with eternity;
they are light, compared with the exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
See the notes at [Co2 4:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md).

Make you perfect - By means of your trials. The tendency of affliction
is to make us perfect.

Stablish - The Greek word means "to set fast; to fix firmly; to render
immovable," [Luk 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#026.md); [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md); [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md); [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md), [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md), et al.

Strengthen - Give you strength to bear all this.

Settle you - Literally, found you, or establish you on a firm foundation
- θεμελιώσες themeliōses. The allusion is to a house which is so firmly
fixed on a foundation that it will not be moved by winds or floods.

By Silvanus - Or Silas. See the [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md) note; [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md), note. He was the intimate friend
and companion of Paul, and had labored much with him in the regions
where the churches were situated to which this Epistle was addressed. In
what manner he became acquainted with Peter, or why he was now with him
in Babylon is unknown.

A faithful brother unto you, as I suppose - The expression "as I
suppose" - ὡς λογίζομαι hōs logizomai - does not imply that there was
any doubt on the mind of the apostle, but indicates rather a firm
persuasion that what he said was true. Thus, [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md), "For I reckon (λογίζομαι
logizomai) that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared," etc. That is, I am fully persuaded of it; I have no doubt of
it. Peter evidently had no doubt on this point, but he probably could
not speak from any personal knowledge. He had not been with them when
Silas was, and perhaps not at all; for they may have been" strangers "to
him personally - for the word "strangers," in [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md), may imply that he had no personal
acquaintance with them. Silas, however, had been much with them,
(compare [Act 15:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017),.md) and Peter had
no doubt that he had shown himself to be "a faithful brother" to them.
An epistle conveyed by his hands could not but be welcome. It should be
observed, however, that the expression "I suppose" has been differently
interpreted by some. Wetstein understands it as meaning, "Not that he
supposed Silvanus to be a faithful brother, for who, says he, could
doubt that? but that he had written as he understood matters, having
carefully considered the subject, and as he regarded things to be true;"
and refers for illustration to [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md); [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md); [Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md). Grotius understands it as
meaning, "If I remember right;" and supposes that the idea is, that he
shows his affection for them by saying that this was not the first time
that he had written to them, but that he had written before briefly, and
sent the letter, as well as he could remember, by Silvanus. But there is
no evidence that he had written to them before, and the common
interpretation is undoubtedly to be preferred.

Exhorting - No small part of the Epistle is taken up with exhortations.

And testifying - Bearing witness. The main design of the office of the
apostles was to bear witness to the truth, (See the notes at [Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001);.md) and Peter in this Epistle
discharged that part of the functions of his office toward the scattered
Christians of Asia Minor.

That this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand - That the religion
in which you stand, or which you now hold, is that which is identified
with the grace or favor of God. Christianity, not Judaism, or Paganism,
was the true religion. To show this, and bear continual witness to it,
was the leading design of the apostolic office.

[1 Peter 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 5:13</span></span>

The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you - It will be
seen at once that much of this is supplied by our translators; the words
"church that is" not being in the original. The Greek is, ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι
συνεκλεκτὴ hē en Babulōni suneklektē; and might refer to a church, or to
a female. Wall, Mill, and some others, suppose that the reference is to
a Christian woman, perhaps the wife of Peter himself. Compare [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md). But the Arabic, Syriac, and
Vulgate, as well as the English versions, supply the word "church." This
interpretation seems to be confirmed by the word rendered "elected
together with" - συνεκλεκτὴ suneklektē. This word would be properly used
in reference to one individual if writing to another individual, but
would hardly be appropriate as applied to an individual addressing a
church. It could not readily be supposed, moreover, that any one female
in Babylon could have such a prominence, or be so well known, that
nothing more would be necessary to designate her than merely to say,
"the elect female." On the word Babylon here, and the place denoted by
it, see the introduction, section 2.

And so doth Marcus my son - Probably John Mark. See the notes at [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md); [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md). Why he was now with Peter is
unknown. If this was the Mark referred to, then the word son is a title
of affection, and is used by Peter with reference to his own superior
age. It is possible, however, that some other Mark may be referred to,
in whose conversion Peter had been instrumental.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 5:14</span></span>

Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity - A kiss of love; a common
method of affectionate salutation in the times of the apostles. See the
notes at [Rom 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md).

Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus - That are true
Christians. See the [Eph 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023.md) note;
[Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md) note.
