### [Joshua Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 23:1</span></span>

This and the next chapter contain the last addresses of Joshua. These
addresses were no doubt among the closing acts of Joshua's life, but
were evidently given on different occasions, and are of different
character and scope. In the former Joshua briefly reminds the princes of
the recent benefits of God toward them and their people, declares that
God had fulfilled all His promises, and exhorts to faithfulness on their
side to God that so His mercies may not be withdrawn: in the latter he
takes a wider range, rehearses the gracious dealings of God with the
nation from its very origin, and upon these as his grounds, he claims
for God their sincere and entire service. But he grants them the option
of withdrawing from the covenant if they so choose; and when they elect
still to abide by it, it is solemnly renewed by the free consent of the
whole people. Joshua's reproofs and warnings are in sum and substance
identical with those with which Moses closed his career (Deut. 31,
etc.). Compare throughout the marginal references.

[Joshua 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 23:2</span></span>

All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the
Hebrew. The meaning is that Joshua summoned to him all Israel as
represented by its elders, etc. [Deu
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015.md). This gathering probably took
place at the tabernacle at Shiloh.
