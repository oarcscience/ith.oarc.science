### [2 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 21:1</span></span>

Jehoram's sole reign now began. (See [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016) note.md). His eight years [Ch2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#005.md) must be counted from the time of
his association, in his father's 23rd year.

[2 Chronicles 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 21:3</span></span>

Jehoshaphat departed from Rehoboam's policy ([Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023) note.md), actually making over to
his sons the "fenced cities" in which they dwelt. This, it is probable,
provoked the jealousy of Jehoram, and induced him to put them to death
[Ch2 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md).

Because he was the firstborn - Compare [Deu
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md). Exceptions to this rule in
the northern and southern kingdoms are Solomon, where divine appointment
superseded the natural order, Abijah [Ch2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022) note.md), and Jehoahaz ([Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 21:4</span></span>

The execution of several "princes of Israel" (i. e. of Judah; see [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034) note.md) implies that Jehoram's
brothers found supporters among the chief men of the country, and that
Jehoram's sole sovereignty was not established without a struggle.

[2 Chronicles 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 21:11</span></span>

See [Kg2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md). The writer of Kings
only tells us in general terms that Jehoram "did evil in the sight of
the Lord," and "walked in the way of the house of Ahab." Here, in [Ch2
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md), [Ch2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#013.md), we have particulars of his
idolatry. Jehoram, it seems, seduced by the evil influence of his wife -
Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab - permitted the introduction of
Baal-worship, idolatrous altars in various high places, groves
(Asherahs), images, and pillars; the people were not only allowed, but
compelled to take part in the new rites. "To commit fornication" is a
common metaphor, signifying idolatry or spiritual unfaithfulness
(compare the [Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 21:12</span></span>

This is the only notice which we have of Elijah in Chronicles. As a
prophet of the northern kingdom, he engaged but slightly the attention
of the historian of the southern one. The notice shows that Elijah did
not confine his attention to the affairs of his own state, but strove to
check the progress of idolatry in Judah. And it proves that he was alive
after the death of Jehoshaphat [Ch2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#013.md); a fact bearing

\(1\) upon the chronological order of [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001) (see the note.md), and

\(2\) showing that Elisha, who prophesied in the time of Jehoshaphat.
[Kg2 3:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#011.md) commenced his public
ministry before his master's translation.

[2 Chronicles 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 21:14</span></span>

The fulfillment of the threat is given in [Ch2
21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 21:16</span></span>

The Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians - Probably Joktanian Arabs
from the neighborhood of the Cushites. Southern Arabia was originally
occupied by Cushites, or Ethiopians [Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md), whose descendants still exist in
a remnant of the Himyaritic Arabs.

[2 Chronicles 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 21:17</span></span>

Jehoahaz - The writer of Chronicles calls him indifferently Jeboahaz and
Abaziah, which are equivalent names ([Kg2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 21:20</span></span>

Not in the sepulchres of the kings - Compare the similar treatment of
Joash [Ch2 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025.md) and Ahaz [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md).
