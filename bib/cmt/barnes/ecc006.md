### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 6:0</span></span>

The Preacher in this chapter contemplates the case of people to whom God
gives wealth, honor, success, children, and long life, yet withholds
from them the capacity of enjoyment, rest, permanence or contentment
[Ecc 6:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001). What then is good for man
to do, whose lot in life is so thoroughly subject to vanity? [Ecc
6:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010).

[Ecclesiastes 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 6:1</span></span>

Common among - Rather, great (heavy) upon people.

[Ecclesiastes 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 6:3</span></span>

No burial - For a corpse to lie unburied was a circumstance in itself of
special ignominy and dishonor (compare the marginal references).

[Ecclesiastes 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 6:4</span></span>

He ... his - Rather, it ... its. The untimely birth is spoken of.

[Ecclesiastes 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 6:5</span></span>

Rather, it hath not seen nor known the sun: this (the untimely birth)
hath rest rather than the other.

[Ecclesiastes 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 6:6</span></span>

He live - Rather, he hath lived. "He" refers to the man [Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003). His want of satisfaction in life,
and the dishonor done to his corpse, are regarded as such great evils
that they counterbalance his numerous children, and length of days, and
render his lot viewed as a whole no better than the common lot of all.

[Ecclesiastes 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 6:7</span></span>

Connect these verses with [Ecc 6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002) :
"All labor is undertaken with a view to some profit, but as a rule the
people who labor are never satisfied. What advantage then has he who
labors if (being rich) he is wise, or if being poor he knows how to
conduct himself properly; what advantage have such laborers above a
fool? (None, so far as they are without contentment, for) a thing
present before the eyes is preferable to a future which exists only in
the desire."

[Ecc 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008)

What - literally, what profit (as in [Ecc
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003)).

Knoweth ... living - i. e., "Knows how to conduct himself rightly among
his contemporaries."

[Ecclesiastes 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 6:10</span></span>

Or, "That which has been named - i. e., events past or current, either
[Ecc 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009) as they present themselves to
man, or [Ecc 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015) as they are ordered
by God - was long ago (i. e., was decreed, its nature and place were
defined by the Almighty), and was known that it is man;" i. e., the
course of events shapes the conduct and character of man, so that what
he does and suffers is said to be or constitute the man. God from the
beginning definitely ordained the course of events external to man, and
constituted man in such a way that events materially affect his conduct
and his destiny. Hence, God, by withholding from certain people the gift
of contentment, and thus subjecting them to vanity, is acting according
to the predetermined course of His Providence which man cannot alter
(compare [Rom 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020)). Others translate,
"What there is, its name is named long ago and known, that it is man;"
i. e., "What hath been and is, not only came into existence long ago
[Ecc 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009); [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015), but also has been known and
named, and is acknowledged that it, besides other things, is specially
man; that man always remains the same, and cannot go beyond his
appointed bounds."

Him that is mightier - i. e., God; compare [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001); [Co1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022), and marginal references.

[Ecclesiastes 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 6:11</span></span>

Things - Namely, the various circumstances detailed in the foregoing
chapters, from the Preacher's personal experience, and his observation
of other people, ending with the comprehensive declaration in [Ecc
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010) to the effect that vanity is an
essential part of the constitution of creation as it now exists, and was
foreknown.

What is man the better? - Rather, what is profitable to man?

[Ecclesiastes 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 6:12</span></span>

After him - i. e., On earth, in his own present sphere of action, after
his departure hence (compare [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019); [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022)).
