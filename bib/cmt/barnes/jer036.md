### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 36:0</span></span>

Historical events connected with the collection of Jeremiah's prophecies
into a volume, and with his personal history immediately before and
after the siege of Jerusalem Jer. 36-44.

Jer. 36. Attached to the prophecies relating to Israel and Judah is an
account of the circumstances under which very many of them, and also the
prophecies concerning the Gentiles, were first formed into one volume.
See the introduction of Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 36:1</span></span>

In the fourth year of Jehoiakim - See [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md) note. The present chapter belongs
to the very end of that year. The capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar
took place early in Jehoiakim's fourth year, long before the writing of
Jehoiakim's scroll. The humiliation seems to have sunk deeply into the
heart of Jehoiakim, and when Jeremiah prophesied extended dominion to
the Chaldaeans [Jer 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md), his anger
knew no bounds. It was the fact that judgment had begun which made it
expedient to gather Jeremiah's predictions into one volume, with the
object:

\(1\) of inducing the people to repent, and

\(2\) of persuading the king to be a true subject of the Chaldaean
empire.

[Jeremiah 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 36:2</span></span>

A roll of a book - A parchment-scroll, consisting of several skins sewn
together, and cut of an even breadth, with a piece of wood at one end
(or, in case of larger volumes, at both ends) on which to roll them up.

Write therein all the words ... - The phrase means that the roll was to
contain "all the counsel of God" [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md) upon the special point mentioned
in [Jer 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md); and that the prophet was
not to keep anything back.

[Jeremiah 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 36:3</span></span>

Compare [Jer 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#003.md). In point of date
Jer. 26: is immediately prior to the present.

[Jeremiah 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 36:5</span></span>

Shut up - Hindered from going; perhaps through fear of Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 36:6</span></span>

The fasting day - A fasting day. Baruch was to wait for a proper
opportunity [Jer 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md).

[Jeremiah 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 36:7</span></span>

They will present their supplication - i. e., humbly. See the margin.
The phrase also contained the idea of the prayer being accepted.

[Jeremiah 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 36:8</span></span>

Reading - To read.

[Jeremiah 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 36:9</span></span>

The ninth month answers to our December, and the fast was probably in
commemoration of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans in the
previous year.

[Jeremiah 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 36:10</span></span>

Gemariah seems to have inherited his father's office of public scribe or
secretary of state (see [Kg2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).md). As
brother of Ahikam, he would be favorable to Jeremiah.

The higher court - The inner court; into which it was not lawful for the
people to enter, but the chamber probably itself formed one of its
sides, and could be approached from the outer court.

[Jeremiah 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 36:11</span></span>

Probably as his father had lent Jeremiah the hall, Michaiah had been
commanded to bring Gemariah [Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012.md)
tidings, as soon as the reading was over, of the nature of the prophet's
words, and the effect produced by them upon the people.

[Jeremiah 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 36:12</span></span>

The scribe's chamber - The chancery in which the king's business was
conducted. Probably Elishama was one of the "principal scribes of the
host" [Jer 52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025.md), i. e., the secretary
of state for war. The business which had brought together "all the
princes" would have reference to the Chaldaean war.

[Jeremiah 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 36:14</span></span>

Jehudi signifies a Jew and Cushi an Ethiopian, but it seems reasonable
to conclude that they are genuine, proper names.

[Jeremiah 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 36:16</span></span>

They were afraid both one and other - literally, "they trembled each to
his neighbor," i. e., they showed their alarm by their looks and
gestures one to another. They felt that what he had so consistently
prophesied for a period of 23 years would in all probability be
fulfilled.

We will surely tell - Rather, We must tell the king. It was their
official duty.

[Jeremiah 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 36:17</span></span>

The scroll might have been drawn up by Baruch from memoranda of his own
without the prophet's direct authority. The princes therefore did not
ask from curiosity, but to obtain necessary information.

[Jeremiah 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 36:18</span></span>

He pronounced - He used to say aloud, he dictated. Baruch's office was
merely mechanical. He contributed nothing but hand, pen, and ink.

[Jeremiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 36:20</span></span>

The court - i. e., The inner quadrangle of the palace, in which was the
royal residence.

They laid up the roll - They left the scroll in charge, i. e., in the
care of someone.

[Jeremiah 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 36:22</span></span>

The winterhouse - A separate portion of the palace was used for
residence according to the season (marginal reference).

And there was a fire on the hearth ... - And the fire-pan burning before
them. On the middle of the floor was a brazier containing burning
charcoal.

[Jeremiah 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 36:23</span></span>

Leaves - Columns: literally folding-doors; the word exactly describes
the shape of the columns of writing upon the scroll.

Penknife - "Scribe's knife;" used to shape the reed for writing, and to
make erasures in the parchment.

On the hearth - Or, in the fire-pan. The conduct of the king shows how
violent was his temper.

[Jeremiah 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 36:25</span></span>

It is remarkable to find Elnathan interceding for Jeremiah after the
office he had discharged toward Urijah [Jer
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022.md).

[Jeremiah 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 36:26</span></span>

Hammelech - Either a proper name or a prince of the blood royal (see the
margin; [Jer 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md); [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 36:29</span></span>

The king of Babylon ... - These words do not prove that Nebuchadnezzar
had not already come, and compelled Jehoiakim to become his vassal. The
force lies in the last words, which predict such a coming as would make
the land utterly desolate: and this would be the result of the king
throwing off the Chaldaean yoke.

[Jeremiah 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 36:30</span></span>

He shall have none to sit ... - The 3 months' reign of Jehoiakim was too
destitute of real power to be a contradiction to this prediction.

[Jeremiah 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 36:32</span></span>

Many like words - The second scroll was thus a more complete record of
the main lessons taught by Jeremiah during the long course of his
inspired ministry.
