### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 31:3</span></span>

He was sore wounded - Better, "he was sore afraid" (compare [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025)). Saul's fear is explained in
[Sa1 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 31:6</span></span>

All his men - This and similar expressions must not be taken too
literally (compare [Ch1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006)). We know
that Abner, and Ish-bosheth, and manymore survived the day of Gilboa.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 31:7</span></span>

The men on the other side of the valley - This must mean to the north of
the plain of Jezreel, and would comprise the tribe of Naphtali, and
Zabulon, and probably Issachar. But the text of [Ch1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#007) has "that were in the valley,"
limiting the statement to the inhabitants of the plain of Jezreel.

On the other side Jordan - This phrase most commonly means on the east
of Jordan, the speaker being supposed to be on the west side. But it is
also used of the west of Jordan, as here, if the text be sound.

The Philistines ... dwelt in them - One of the principal cities,
Beth-shan, fell into their power at once [Sa1
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 31:10</span></span>

In the house of Ashtaroth - This was doubtless the famous temple of
Venus in Askelon mentioned by Herodotus as the most ancient of all her
temples. Hence, the special mention of Askelon [Sa2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020). The placing Saul's armour as a
trophy in the temple of Ashtaroth was a counterpart to the placing
Goliath's sword in the tabernacle [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009). In [Ch1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010) it is added that they "fastened
Saul's head in the temple of Dagon," probably either in Gaza [Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021), or in Ashdod [Sa1
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001). This was, perhaps, in
retaliation for the similar treatment of Goliath's head [Sa1
17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054). The variations seem to imply
that both this narrative and that in [Ch1
10:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001) are compiled from a common and
a fuller document.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 31:11</span></span>

When the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard ... - See [Sa1
11:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001). This is a touching and rare
example of national gratitude.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 31:12</span></span>

burnt them - Burning was not the usual mode of sepulture among the
Hebrews. But in this case from a pious desire to disguise the mutilation
of the headless corpses, and exempt them from any possible future
insult, the men of Jabesh burned the bodies, yet so as to preserve the
bones [Sa1 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013); [Sa2
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#012).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 31:13</span></span>

Under a tree - Rather, "Under the tamarisk," a well-known tree at Jabesh
which was standing when this narrative was written.

They fasted seven days - In imitation of the mourning for Jacob
(marginal reference). They would give full honor to Saul though he was
fallen.
