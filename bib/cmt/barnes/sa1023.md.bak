### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 23:1</span></span>

David's growing importance, fugitive as he was, is marked by this appeal
to him for deliverance from the Philistines. The "threshing floors" were
the natural objects of plunder [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md). Keilah was in the Shephelah
(marginal reference), probably close to the Philistine border, but its
site is uncertain.

[Jos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011.md) Samuel [Jos
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md) PP1

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 23:2</span></span>

If Gad was with David at the forest of Hareth [Sa1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005.md), and there inquired for him of
the Lord [Sa1 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002.md),[Sa1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#004.md), but did not accompany him to
Keilah, and if Abiathar's flight occurred at the time of David's being
at Keilah, we have an additional striking instance of God's watchful
providential care of David in thus sending Abiathar to supply the place
of Gad at so critical a moment.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 23:12</span></span>

The conduct of the men of Keilah would be like that of the men of Judah
to Samson their deliverer [Jdg
15:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#010.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 23:14</span></span>

Ziph is placed between Hebron and En-gedi (marginal references). (The
"wood" [Sa1 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#015.md) is by Conder taken
as a proper name, "Cheresh," and identified with Khoreisa.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 23:16</span></span>

A touching example of mutual fidelity between friends. The humility and
unselfish love of Jonathan is apparent in [Sa1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 23:19</span></span>

(Hachilah is thought by Conder to be the long ridge called El Kolah).
For Jeshimon, see the margin and [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 23:24</span></span>

The plain - The Arabah, the desert tract which extends along the valley
of the Jordan from the Dead Sea to the Lake of Gennesareth, now called
El-Ghor. The word is now given by the Arabs to the valley between the
Dead Sea and the Gulf of Akaba.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 23:28</span></span>

Sela-hammahlekoth - See the margin. (Identified by Conder with a narrow
and impassable gorge between El Kolah and Maon, called Malaky).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 23:29</span></span>

En-gedi (the fountain of the kid), anciently called Hazezon-Tamar [Gen
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007.md) from the palm-trees which used to
grow there, still preserves its name in Ain-Djedy. It is about 200 yards
from the Dead Sea, about the center of its western shore. It is marked
by great luxuriance of vegetation, though the approach to it is through
most dangerous and precipitous passes. The country is full of caverns,
which serve as lurking places for outlaws at the present day. One of
these, a spacious one called Bir-el-Mauquouchieh, with a well in it
suitable for watering sheep, close to the Wady Hasasa, may have been the
identical cavern in which David cut off Saul's skirt.
