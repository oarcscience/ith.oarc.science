### [Joshua Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 15:1</span></span>

The inheritance of the tribe of Judah is described first by its general
boundaries on all four sides [Jos
15:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md); then reference is again made,
for the sake of completeness, to the special inheritance of Caleb which
lay within these boundaries [Jos
15:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md); and lastly a list of the
towns is given Josh. 15:21-63. Consult the marginal references.

[Joshua 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 15:6</span></span>

The stone of Bohan - This stone perhaps commemorated some deed of valor
belonging to the wars of Joshua (compare [Sa1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012).md). The stone was erected on the
slope of a hill (see the marginal reference), no doubt one of the range
which hounds the Jordan valley on the west. But its exact site is wholly
uncertain.

[Joshua 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 15:7</span></span>

The going up to Adummim - Rather, "the ascent or pass of Adummim"
(compare [Jos 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003), margin.md), on the
road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Its name signifies "red" and is
explained by Jerome as given because of the frequent bloodshed there by
robbers. This road is the scene of the parable of the Good Samaritan.
Possibly the name may be due to some aboriginal tribe of "red men," who
held their ground in these fastnesses after the invaders had driven them
from the face of the country elsewhere.

En-shemesh - i. e. "fountain of the sun;" no doubt that now called "the
Fountain of the Apostles," about two miles from Jerusalem, and the only
well on the road to Jericho.

En-rogel - i. e. "fountain of the fullers" near the walls of Jerusalem.
It was here that Jonathan and Ahimaaz concealed themselves after the
rebellion of Absalom, in order to procure tidings for David, and here
Adonijah gave a feast to his adherents preparatory to making an attempt
on the crown (compare the marginal references). It is probably the
modern "Fountain of the Virgin," the only real spring near Jerusalem,
from which the Pool of Siloam is supplied. Others identify it, less
probably, with the "Well of Job," situated where the valleys of Kedron
and Hinnom unite.

[Joshua 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 15:8</span></span>

The valley of the son of Hinnom - This valley begins on the west of
Jerusalem at the road to Joppa, and turning southeastward round the foot
of Mount Zion joins the deeper valley of Kedron on the south of the
city. It was in this ravine, more particularly at Tophet in the more
wild and precipitous part of it toward the east, that the later kings of
Judah offered the sacrifices of children to Moloch ([Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md); [Ch2
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006), etc..md). After these places had
been defiled by Josiah, Tophet and the whole valley of Hinnom were held
in abomination by the Jews, and the name of the latter was used to
denote the place of eternal torment [Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md). The Greek term Gehenna (γεέννα
geenna) is in fact formed from the Hebrew הנם גיא gay' hı̂nnôm, "valley
of Hinnom." Hinnom is regarded either as the name of some ancient hero,
or as an appellative ( "groaning" or "moaning"), bestowed on the spot
because of the cries of the victims here offered to Moloch, and of the
drums with which those cries were drowned.

The valley of the giants - Rather "the plain of Rephaim." This plain,
named after an ancient and gigantic tribe of the land [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md), lies southwestward of Jerusalem,
and is terminated by a slight rocky ridge forming the brow of the valley
of Hinnom. The valley is fertile [Isa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005.md) and broad, and has been on more
than one occasion the camping ground for armies operating against
Jerusalem [Sa2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018.md), [Sa2
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md); [Sa2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013.md).

[Joshua 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 15:9</span></span>

Nephtoab is probably the modern "Ain Lifta", two miles and a half
northwestward of Jerusalem: and Mount Ephron is conjecturally connected
with the city Ephrain [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md) or
Ophrah [Jos 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023.md).

[Joshua 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 15:10</span></span>

Mount Seir is not the well-known range of Edom. The name ( "shaggy
mountain") is applicable to any rugged or well-wooded hill. Here it
probably denotes the range which runs southwestward from Kirjath-jearim
to the Wady Surar. Mount Jearim, i. e. "woody mountain," is through its
other name, Chesalon, identified with the modern "Kesla".

Beth-shemesh - i. e. "house of the sun," called "Ir-shemesh" or "city of
the sun" ([Jos 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041.md); Compare [Kg1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009).md), a place assigned to Dan, and one
of the cities which fell by lot to the Levites [Jos
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016.md). Beth-shemesh was the first
place at which the ark rested after its return from the hands of the
Philistines [Sa1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#012.md). It was the
residence of one of Solomon's purveyors [Kg1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#009.md), and was the spot where at a later
date Amaziah was defeated and slain by Jehoash ([Kg2
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011) ff.md). It is no doubt the modern
"Ain Shems".

Timnah, called also Timnath, and Timnathah, belonged likewise to Dan,
and is to be distinguished from other places of like name [Gen
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012.md); [Jos
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#030). Timnah ( "portion".md) was
evidently, like Gilgal, Ramah, Kirjath, and several other towns, of
frequent use in Canaanite topography.

[Joshua 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 15:11</span></span>

Jabneel - The modern "Yebna", about three miles from the coast and
twelve miles south of Joppa. It is called Jabneh in [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md), where Uzziah is recorded to have
taken it from the Philistines and destroyed its fortifications. The town
is repeatedly mentioned with its haven in the wars of the Maccabees (1
Macc. 4:15; 2 Macc. 12:8), and by Josephus under the name of Jamnia. It
is described by Philo as a very populous town; and after the destruction
of Jerusalem was, for a long time, the seat of the Sanhedrin, and was a
famous school of Jewish learning. Its ruins, which are still
considerable, stand on the brink of the "Wady Rubin".

[Joshua 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 15:14</span></span>

See the marginal references.

[Joshua 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 15:15</span></span>

The name Debir belonged to two other places; namely,, that named in [Jos
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007.md), between Jerusalem and Jericho,
and the Gadite town mentioned in [Jos
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md). The Debir here meant appears
(and its site has been conjecturally placed at Dhaheriyeh (Conder)) to
have been situated in the mountain district south of Hebron. It was one
of the towns afterward assigned to the Levites. Its other name [Jos
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#049.md), "Kirjath-sannah", i. e.
perhaps, "city of palm branches," or "city of law, or sacred learning,"
no less than the two given in the text, would indicate that Debir was an
ancient seat of Canaanite learning, for Debir probably is equivalent to
"oracle," and Kirjath-sepher means "city of books." This plurality of
names marks the importance of the town, as the inducement held out in
[Jos 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016.md), by Caleb, to secure its
capture (compare [Sa1 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md); [Sa1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#017).md), points to its strength.

[Joshua 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 15:17</span></span>

Othniel was probably Caleb's younger brother; the expression "son of
Kenaz" being only an equivalent for the "Kenezite" [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md).

[Joshua 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 15:18</span></span>

Afield - In [Jdg 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#014.md), "the field," i.
e. the well-known field asked by Achsah and given by Caleb as a
"blessing," i. e. as a token of goodwill, which when the Book of Judges
was written had become historical. The "field" in question was doubtless
in the neighborhood of Debir, and was especially valuable because of its
copious springs. Achsah's dismounting was a sign of reverence.

[Joshua 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 15:19</span></span>

A south land - This term ("negeb") which is often equivalent to a proper
name [Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md), importing the
well-defined district which formed the south of the promised land ([Num
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017) note.md), seems here used in its
more general sense [Psa 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md), for a
dry or barren land. The rendering of this passage adopted by Septuagint,
several versions, and Commentators, etc., "thou hast given me into a
south land," i. e. "hast given me in marriage into a south land" is
forced; the construction of the verb "to give," with two accusatives, is
natural and common to many languages.

Springs of water - The Hebrew words מים גלה gûllâh mayı̂m are found only
here and in the parallel passage, [Jdg
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#015.md). Hence, some take it as a proper
name, "Gulloth-maim," which like Beth-horon [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md), [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md), was applied to two distinct but
adjoining places - distinguished as "the upper" and "the lower." The
tract in question was no doubt a mountain slope which had springs both
on its higher and lower ground; possibly the modern "Kurmul".

[Joshua 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 15:21</span></span>

List of the towns of the tribe of Judah. These are arranged in four
divisions, according to the natural features of the district; namely,,
those of the Negeb or south country [Jos
15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md); of "the valley," or "the
plain" ("Shephelah", [Jos 15:33-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md);
of "the mountains" [Jos 15:48-60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md); and
of "the wilderness" [Jos 15:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md).
Many of the identifications are still conjectural only.

[Jos 15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md). The Negeb was for the
most part rocky and arid, and cannot have been at any time very thickly
populated.

[Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md)

Kabzeel was the native place of Benaiah [Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md), who was famous as a slayer of
lions. The Negeb was a principal haunt of these beasts.

[Jos 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#024.md)

Telem may be the Telaim of [Sa1 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004.md),
where Saul mustered his army for the expedition against the Amalekites.
It is possibly to be looked for at "El-Kuseir", a spot where the various
routes toward different parts of the Negeb converge, and which is
occupied by the Arab tribe the "Dhullam", a word identical with Telem in
its consonants. Bealoth is probably the "Baalath-beer - Ramath of the
south" [Jos 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md), and was one of the
towns afterward assigned to the Simeonites. It is identified with the
modern Kurnub.

[Jos 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025.md)

And Hezron which is Hazor - In this verse are the names of two towns
only, not of four. Two places bearing the common topographical
appellation, Hazor ("enclosure") are here mentioned and distinguished as
"Hazor Hadattah" and "Kerioth-Hezron," otherwise termed Hazor, simply:
the former has been identified by some with "El-Hudhera"; the latter is
probably the modern "El-Kuryetein". Kerioth, prefixed to a name,
bespeaks military occupation, as Hazor points to pastoral pursuits. The
place would therefore seem to be an ancient pastoral settlement which
had been fortified by the Anakims, and called accordingly Kerioth; to
which name the men of Judah, after they had captured it, added that of
Hezron, in honor of one of their leading ancestors (compare [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md); [Rut
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018).md). Kerioth was the home of Judas
the traitor, if the ordinary derivation of Iscariot (= קריות אישׁ 'ı̂ysh
qerı̂yôth), i. e. man of Kerioth) be accepted: [Mat
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md).

[Jos 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#026.md)

Moladah is probably the modern "El-Milh", and like Hazar-shual
("Berrishail" near Gaza) ( "enclosure of foxes") occurs [Jos
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md); [Ch1
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#028.md), as a town belonging to Simeon,
and [Neh 11:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#026.md) as a place occupied
by Jews after the captivity.

[Jos 15:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#029.md)

Baalah [Jos 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#003.md) is found in the
modern "Deir-el-Belah", near Gaza. Iim, i. e. "ruinous heaps" or
"conical hills" ([Num 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#011) note.md) is
by some connected with Azem; and the compound name, "Ije Azem", is
traced in El-Aujeh, in the country of the Azazimeh Arabs, in whose name
the ancient Azem may perhaps be traced. Eltolad is connected with
"Wady-el-Thoula", in the extreme south of the Negeb. Chesil appears to
be the town called Bethul [Jos 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md),
and probably the Bethel [Sa1 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027.md)
situated not far from Ziklag. The name Chesil ( "fool") was most likely
bestowed by way of opprobrium (compare the change of Bethel, house of
God, into Bethaven, house of vanity, [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md). As Chesil signifies the group
of stars known as Orion (compare [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md); [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008).md), probably it was the worship of
the heavenly bodies in particular that was carried on here. Bethel may
have been the ancient name, and the spot was perhaps the very one near
Beer-sheba where Abraham planted a tamarisk tree [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

The place is probably "El Khulasah", the Elusa of ecclesiastical
writers, situated some fifteen miles southwest of Beer-sheba. Jerome
testifies to the fact, that the worship of Venus as the morning star was
practiced there, and Sozomen appears to be speaking of this place, when
he mentions a Bethel Βηθελια Bēthelia in the territory of Gaza, populous
and famous for an ancient and splendid temple. The site of Ziklag is
uncertain. Madmannah and Sansannah correspond to Beth-marcaboth ( "house
of chariots") and Hazar-susah ("horse enclosure") in [Jos
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005.md) [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md). The latter names point to two
stations of passage on or near the high road between Egypt and
Palestine, and are represented by the modern "Minyay" and
"Wady-es-Suny", on the caravan route south of Gaza. Shilhim or Sharuhen,
[Jos 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md), and Shaaraim [Ch1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md) is traced in "Khirbet-es-Seram",
near El Aujeh. Ain and Rimmon were possibly originally two towns, but in
process of time became so connected as to be treated as one name [Neh
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#029.md). The place is probably the
present "Um-er-Rummamim," i. e. "mother of pomegranates," a place about
ten miles north of Beer-sheba.

[Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032.md)

Twenty and nine - The King James Version gives 34 names. The difference
is due either to the confusion by an early copyist of letters similar in
form which were used as numerals; or to the separation in the King James
Version of names which in the original were one (e. g. [Jos
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025).md).

[Jos 15:33-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md)

"The valley" or the Shephelah, is bounded on the south by the Negeb, on
the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the plain of Sharon, on
the east by "the mountains" [Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md). It is a well-defined district,
of an undulating surface and highly fertile character, thickly dotted,
even at the present time, with villages, which are for the most part
situated on the different hills. The towns in this district, like those
in the Negeb, are classed in four groups.

[Jos 15:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md)

First group of fourteen towns: these belong to the northeastern portion
of the Shephelah. Eshtaol and Zoreah were afterward assigned to the
tribe of Dan, and inhabited by Danites [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md); [Jdg
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md), [Jdg
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#008.md),[Jdg
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011.md). The latter place was the home
of Samson [Jdg 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md). It was one of the
cities fortified by Rehoboam [Ch2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#010.md), and was re-occupied by the Jews
after the captivity [Neh 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#029.md). It is
probably the modern Surah. (Eshtaol has been identified with Eshua
(Conder)). Both places were in later times partly populated by Judahites
from Kirjath-jearim; perhaps after the departure of the colony of
Danites for Dan-Laish. Zanoah is the present "Zanna", not far from
Surah. Socoh is the modern "Shuweikah". Sharaim is perhaps to be sought
in the modern "Zakariya". Gederah ("wall" or "fortress") was a name
borne with various terminations by several places.

[Jos 15:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#037.md)

Second group of towns, containing those in the middle portion of the
Shephelah, and of which some only [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md), [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md) can be identified.

[Jos 15:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md)

Third group; towns in the south of the Shephelah. For Libnah see [Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md). Mareshah is believed to be near
Beit-jibrin, the ancient "Eleutheropolis."

[Jos 15:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045.md)

Fourth group: the towns of the Philistine seacoast: see [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md).

[Jos 15:48-60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md)

This highland district extends from the Negeb on the south to Jerusalem,
and is bounded by the Shephelah on the west, and the "wilderness" [Jos
15:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md) on the east. The mountains,
which are of limestone, rise to a height of near 3,000 feet. At present,
the highlands of Judah present a somewhat dreary and monotonous aspect.
The peaks are for the most part barren, though crowned almost everywhere
with the ruins of ancient towns, and bearing on their sides marks of
former cultivation. Many of the valleys, especially toward the south,
are, however, still very productive. The towns here enumerated are given
in six groups.

[Jos 15:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md)

First group: towns on the southwest. Dannah (is identified with "Idnah"
(Conder)). Jattir ("Attir"), and Eshtemoh ("Semua") were priestly cities
[Jos 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#014.md); [Ch1
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057.md), and the place to which David,
after routing the Amalekites, sent presents [Sa1
30:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027.md). Socoh is "Suweikeh."

[Jos 15:52-54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#052.md)

Second group of nine towns, situated somewhat to the north of the last
mentioned. Of these Dumah is perhaps the ruined village "Ed Daumeh," in
the neighborhood of Hebron; and Beth-tappuah, i. e. "house of apples,"
"Teffuh," a place which has still a good number of inhabitants, is
conspicuous for its olive groves and vineyards, and bears on every side
the traces of industry and thrift.

[Jos 15:55-57](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055.md)

Third group; lying eastward of the towns named in the last two, and next
to "the wilderness."

[Jos 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055.md)

The four towns retain their ancient names with but little change. Maon
[Sa1 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024.md); [Sa1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md), the home of Nabal, is to be
looked for in the conical hill, "Main," the top of which is covered with
ruins. It lies eight or nine miles southeast of Hebron Carmel [Sa1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md), the modern "Kurmul," is a little
to the north of "Main." The name belongs to more than one place [Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022.md). Ziph gave its name to "the
wilderness" into which David fled from Saul [Sa1
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md).

[Jos 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), [Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md)

Fourth group. Towns north of the last mentioned, of which Beth-zur and
Gedor are represented by "Beit-sur" and "Jedur."

After [Jos 15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md) follows in the Greek
version a fifth group of eleven towns, which appears to have dropped in
very ancient times out of the Hebrew text, probably because some
transcriber passed unawares from the word "villages" at the end of [Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059.md), to the same word at the end of
the missing passage. The omitted group contains the towns of an
important, well-known, and populous district lying immediately south of
Jerusalem, and containing such towns as Tekoah [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md); [Neh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#005.md), [Neh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md); [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); Bethlehem, the native town of
David and of Christ [Gen 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); and
Aetan, a Grecised form of Etam [Ch2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md).

[Jos 15:61](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md), [Jos
15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md)

This district, including the towns in "the wilderness," the scene of
David's wanderings ([Sa1 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024.md); [Psa
63:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001) title.md), and of the preaching
of the Baptist [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md), and perhaps
of our Lord's temptation Matt. 4, extended from the northern limit of
Judah along the Dead Sea to the Negeb; it was bounded on the west by
that part of "the mountains" or highlands of Judah, which adjoined
Bethlehem and Maon. It abounds in limestone rocks, perforated by
numerous caverns, and often of fantastic shapes. It is badly supplied
with water, and hence, is for the most part barren, though affording in
many parts, now quite desolate, clear tokens of former cultivation. It
contained only a thin population in the days of Joshua.

[Jos 15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md)

"The city of Salt" is not mentioned elsewhere, but was no doubt
connected with "the valley of salt" [Sa2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013.md). The name itself, and the mention
of En-gedi ([Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007) note.md) suggest
that its site must be looked for near the Dead Sea.
