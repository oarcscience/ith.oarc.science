Heritage

### [Nehemiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 6:1</span></span>

Upon the gates - Rather, "in the gates." This work would naturally be
delayed until the last phase.

[Nehemiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 6:2</span></span>

The choice made of Ono, on the skirts of Benjamin, 25 or 30 miles from
Jerusalem, as the meeting-place, was, no doubt, in order to draw
Nehemiah to a distance from his supporters, that so an attack might be
made on him with a better chance of success.

[Nehemiah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 6:5</span></span>

The letter was "open," in order that the contents might be generally
known, and that the Jews, alarmed at the threats contained in it, might
refuse to continue the work.

[Nehemiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 6:10</span></span>

Who was shut up - On account, probably, of some legal uncleaness.
Compare [Jer 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005).

[Nehemiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 6:11</span></span>

Would go into the temple to save his life - Rather "could go into the
temple and live." For a layman to enter the sanctuary was a capital
offence (see [Num 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007)).

[Nehemiah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 6:12</span></span>

The existence of a party among the Jews who sided with Sanballat and
lent themselves to his schemes, is here for the first time indicated.
Compare [Neh 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014), [Neh
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#017); [Neh
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004), [Neh
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028).

[Nehemiah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 6:14</span></span>

Noadiah is not elsewhere mentioned. The examples of Miriam, Deborah,
Huldah, and Anna, show that the prophetical gift was occasionally
bestowed upon women ([Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014) note).

[Nehemiah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 6:15</span></span>

Elul - The sixth month, corresponding to the latter part of August and
the beginning of September.

In fifty and two days - Josephus states that the repairs of the wall
occupied two years and four months. But Nehemiah's narrative is
thoroughly consistent with itself, and contains in it nothing that is
improbable. The walls everywhere existed at the time that he commenced
his task, and only needed repairs. The work was partitioned among at
least 37 working parties, who labored simultaneously, with material
ready at hand; and, notwithstanding all menaces, uninterruptedly.

[Nehemiah 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 6:18</span></span>

Though Tobiah is called "the servant" or "slave" [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010), [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019), and was perhaps a bought slave
of Sanballat's, yet he was in such a position that Jewish nobles readily
contracted affinity with him. This is quite in harmony with the practice
of the East, where slaves often fill high positions and make great
marriages.
