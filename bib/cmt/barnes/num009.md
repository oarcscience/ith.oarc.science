### [Numbers Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001)

[Numbers 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 9:1</span></span>

Passover at Sinai. This, as being kept in the first month, was prior in
time to the numbering of [Num 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001) ff,
and to the other events narrated in this book. It is, however, recorded
here as introductory to the ordinance of [Num
9:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006) in this chapter respecting the
supplementary Passover; the observance of which was one of the last
occurrences during the halt at Sinai.

[Num 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#005)

In some details, the present Passover differed both from that kept at
the Exodus itself and from all subsequent Passovers. For example, the
direction of [Exo 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022) could not be
carried out in the letter while the people were dwelling in tents; and
may be regarded as superseded by [Lev
17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003) (compare [Deu
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#005) ff).

In other points, such as how many lambs would be wanted, how the blood
of the Paschal victims could be sprinkled upon the altar in the time
specified, etc., the administrators of the Law of Moses would here, as
elsewhere, have, from the nature of the case, power to order what might
be requisite to carry the law into effect.

[Numbers 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 9:6</span></span>

Certain men - Probably Mishael and Elizaphan, who buried their cousins,
Nadab and Abihu, within a week of this Passover [Lev
10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004).

[Numbers 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 9:11</span></span>

The later Jews speak of this as the "little Passover." Coming, as it
did, a month after the proper Passover, it afforded ample time for a man
to purify himself from legal defilement, as also to return from any but
a very distant journey. Compare Hezekiah's act [Ch2
30:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001).

[Numbers 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 9:12</span></span>

According to all the ordinances - i. e. those relating to the Passover
lamb, not those concerning the feast, for the Little Passover lasted,
according to the Jews, only one day; nor was it held to be needful that
at it leaven should be put away out of the houses.

[Numbers 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 9:15</span></span>

The cloud ... - The phenomenon first appeared at the Exodus itself, [Exo
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021). The cloud did not cover the
whole structure, but the "tent of the testimony," i. e. the enclosure
which contained the "ark of the testimony" [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016), [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022), and the holy place. The
phenomenon is now again described in connection with the journeyings
which are to be narrated in the sequel of the book.

[Numbers 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 9:22</span></span>

A year - literally, "days," idiomatically a year [Lev
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029), an expression equivalent to "a
full period," though not necessarily the period of a year.
