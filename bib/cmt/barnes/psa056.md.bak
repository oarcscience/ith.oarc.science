### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 56:0</span></span>

This purports to be a psalm of David, and there is no sufficient reason
for doubting the correctness of its being thus attributed to him.
DeWette indeed thinks that the contents of the psalm do not well agree
with the circumstances of David's life, and especially with that period
of his life referred to in the title, and supposes that it was composed
by some Hebrew in exile in the time of the captivity. But this is
evidently mere conjecture. There "were" times in the life of David to
which all that is said in this psalm would be applicable; and it is not
difficult to explain all the allusions in it with reference to the
circumstances specified in the title.

On the words "To the chief Musician," see Introduction to [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md). In the expression in the title
"upon Jonath-elem-rechokim," the first word - "Jonath" - means a "dove,"
a favorite emblem of suffering innocence; and the second - אלם 'êlem -
means "silence," dumbness, sometimes put for uncomplaining submission;
and the third - רחוקים râchôqiym - means "distant" or "remote," agreeing
here with places or persons, probably the latter, in which sense it is
applicable to the Philistines, as aliens in blood and religion from the
Hebrews. Thus understood, the whole title is an enigmatical description
of David as an innocent and uncomplaining sufferer among strangers. See
Prof. Alexander. DeWette, however, renders it, "The dove of the far-off
terebinth trees." The Septuagint and the Vulgate render it, "for the
people who are made remote from their sanctuary." The common rendering
of the phrase is, "Upon, or respecting the dove of silence, in remote
plaaes," or "far-off from its nest," or "in distant groves."

Gesenius (Lexicon) renders it, "the silent dove among strangers," and
applies it to the people of Israel in the time of the exile, as an
uncomplaining, unmurmuring people. This explanation of the "words," "the
silent dove among strangers," is probably the true one; but it is
applicable here, not to the people of Israel, as Gesenius, the
Septuagint, and the Vulgate, render it, but to David, as an exile and a
wanderer - one who was driven away from country and home, as a dove
wandering from its nest. Whether it was the title of a "tune" or a piece
of music already known, or whether it was music that was composed for
this occasion, and with reference to this very psalm, it is not
practicable now to determine. It is very "possible" that there was
already a piece of music in existence, and in common use, to which this
beautiful title of "A silent dove among strangers," or "A patient dove
driven from her nest into remote p aces," was given - plaintive, tender,
pensive music, and therefore especially appropriate for a psalm composed
to describe the feelings of David when driven from home, and compelled
to seek a place of safety in a remote region, like a dove driven from
its nest.

On the meaning of the word "Michtam," see the notes at the introduction
to [Psa 16:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md). The portion of the
title "When the Philistines took him in Gath," evidently refers to the
event recorded in [Sa1 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md) ff when
David, fleeing from Saul, took refuge in the country of Achish, king of
Gath, and when the "servants" of the king of Gath made him known to
Achish, whose fears they so aroused as to lead him to drive the stranger
away. The words "took him in Gath," refer not to their "apprehending"
him, or "seizing" him, but to their following him, or overtaking him, to
wit, by their calumnies and reproaches, so that he found no safety
there. He was persecuted by Saul; he was also persecuted by the
Philistines, among whom he sought refuge and safety.

The psalm embraces the following points:

I. An earnest prayer for the divine interposition in behalf of the
author of the psalm, [Psa 56:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md).

II\. An expression of his trust in God in times of danger, [Psa
56:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003.md).

III\. A description of his enemies: of their wresting his words; of
their evil thoughts against him; of their gathering together; of their
watching his steps; of their lying in wait for his life, [Psa
56:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md).

IV\. His confident belief that they would not escape by their iniquity;
that God knew all his wanderings; that God remembered his tears, as if
He put them in His bottle; and that his enemies would know that God was
with him, [Psa 56:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md).

V. His entire trust in God, and his firm assurance that he would yet be
kept from falling, and would walk before God in the light of the living.
[Psa 56:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md).

The general "subject" of the psalm, therefore, is "confidence or trust
in God in the time of danger."

[Psalms 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 56:1</span></span>

Be merciful unto me, O God - See the notes at [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md).

For man would swallow me up - The word used here means properly to
breathe hard; to pant; to blow hard; and then, to pant after, to yawn
after with open mouth. The idea is, that people came upon him everywhere
with open mouth, as if they would swallow him down whole. He found no
friend in man - in any man. Everywhere his life was sought. There was no
"man," wherever he might go, on whom he could rely, or whom he could
trust; and his only refuge, therefore, was in God.

He fighting daily - Constantly; without intermission. That is, all
people seemed to be at war with him, and to pursue him always.

Oppresseth me - Presses hard upon me; so presses on me as always to
endanger my life, and so that I feel no security anywhere.

[Psalms 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 56:2</span></span>

Mine enemies - Margin, "mine observers." The Hebrew word here used means
properly to twist, to twist totogether; then, to be firm, hard, tough;
then, "to press together," as a rope that is twisted - and hence, the
idea of oppressing, or pressing hard on one, as an enemy. See [Psa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011.md); [Psa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005.md). In the former verse the psalmist
spoke of an enemy, or of "one" that would swallow him up (in the
singular number), or of "man" as an enemy to him anywhere. Here he uses
the plural number, implying that there were "many" who were enlisted
against him. He was surrounded by enemies. He met them wherever he went.
He had an enemy in Saul; he had enemies in the followers of Saul; he had
enemies among the Philistines, and now when he had fled to Achish, king
of Gath, and had hoped to find a refuge and a friend there, he found
only bitter foes.

Would daily swallow me up - Constantly; their efforts to do it are
unceasing. A new day brings no relief to me, but every day I am called
to meet some new form of opposition.

For they be many that fight against me - His own followers and friends
were few; his foes were many. Saul had numerous followers, and David
encountered foes wherever he went. "O thou Most High." The word used
here - מרום mârôm - means properly height, altitude, elevation; then, a
high place, especially heaven, [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md); [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md), [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md); then it is applied to anything
high or inaccessible, as a fortress, [Isa
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md). It is supposed by Gesenius
(Lexicon), and some others, to mean here "elation of mind, pride," -
implying that his enemies fought against him with elated minds, or
proudly. So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Luther render it; and so
DeWette understands it. Yet it seems most probable that our translators
have given the correct rendering, and that the passage is a solemn
appeal to God as more exalted than his foes, and as one, therefore, in
whom he could put entire confidence. Compare [Psa
92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008.md); [Psa
93:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004.md),; [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 56:3</span></span>

What time I am afraid - literally, "the day I am afraid." David did not
hesitate to admit that there were times when he was afraid. He saw
himself to be in danger, and he had apprehensions as to the result.
There is a natural fear of danger and of death; a fear implanted in us:

\(a\) to make us cautious, and

\(b\) to induce us to put our trust in God as a Preserver and Friend.

Our very nature - our physical constitution - is full of arrangements
most skillfully adjusted, and most wisely planted there, to lead us to
God as our Protector. Fear is one of these things, designed to make us
feel that we "need" a God, and to lead us to him when we realize that we
have no power to save ourselves from impending dangers.

I will trust in thee - As one that is able to save, and one that will
order all things as they should be ordered. It is only this that can
make the mind calm in the midst of danger:

\(a\) the feeling that God can protect us and save us from danger, and
that he "will" protect us if he sees fit;

\(b\) the feeling that whatever may be the result, whether life or
death, it will be such as God sees to be best - if "life," that we may
be useful, and glorify his name yet upon the earth; if "death," that it
will occur not because he had not "power" to interpose and save, but
because there were good and sufficient reasons why he should "not" put
forth his power on that occasion and rescue us.

Of this we may be, however, assured, that God has "power" to deliver us
always, and that if not delivered from calamity it is not because he is
inattentive, or has not power. And of this higher truth also we may be
assured always, that he has power to save us from that which we have
most occasion to fear - a dreadful hell. It is a good maxim with which
to go into a world of danger; a good maxim to go to sea with; a good
maxim in a storm; a good maxim when in danger on the land; a good maxim
when we are sick; a good maxim when we think of death and the judgment -
"What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee."

[Psalms 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 56:4</span></span>

In God I will praise his word - The meaning of this seems to be, "In
reference to God - or, in my trust on God - I will especially have
respect to his "word" - his gracious promise; I will make that the
special object of my praise. In dwelling in my own mind on the divine
perfections; in finding there materials for praise, I will have special
respect to his revealed truth - to what he has "spoken" as an
encouragement to me. I will be thankful that he "has" spoken, and that
he has given me assurances on which I may rely in the times of danger."
The idea is, that he would "always" find in God that which was the
ground or foundation for praise; and that that which called for special
praise in meditating on the divine character, was the word or promise
which God had made to his people.

I will not fear what flesh can do unto me - What man can do to me.
Compare the notes at [Mat 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md)
(notes); [Rom 8:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031) (notes.md); [Heb
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006) (notes.md).

[Psalms 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 56:5</span></span>

Every day they wrest my words - The word here rendered "wrest," means
literally to give pain, to grieve, to afflict; and it is used here in
the sense of "wresting," as if force were applied to words; that is,
they are "tortured," twisted, perverted. We have the same use of the
word "torture" in our language. This they did by affixing a meaning to
his words which he never intended, so as to injure him.

All their thoughts are against me for evil - All their plans, devices,
purposes. They never seek my good, but always seek to do me harm.

[Psalms 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 56:6</span></span>

They gather themselves together - That is, they do not attack me singly,
but they unite their forces; they combine against me.

They hide themselves - They lurk in ambush. They do not come upon me
openly, but they conceal themselves in places where they cannot be seen,
that they may spring upon me suddenly.

They mark my steps - They watch me whatever I do. They keep a spy upon
me, so that I can never be sure that I am not observed.

When they wait for my soul - As they watch for my life; or, as they
watch for opportunities to take away my life. I am never secure; I know
not at what time, or in what manner, they may spring upon me. This would
apply to David when he fled to Achish, king of Gath; when he was driven
away by him; and when he was watched and pursued by Saul and his
followers as he fled into the wilderness. [Sa1
21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md); 22.

[Psalms 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 56:7</span></span>

Shall they escape by iniquity? - This expression in the original is very
obscure. There is in the Hebrew no mark of interrogation; and a literal
rendering would be, "By iniquity (there is) escape to them;" and,
according to this, the sense would be, that they contrived to escape
from just punishment by their sins; by the boldness of their crimes; by
their wicked arts. The Septuagint renders it, "As I have suffered this
for my life, thou wilt on no account save them." Luther, "What they have
done evil, that is already forgiven." DeWette reads it, as in our
translation, as a question: "Shall their deliverance be in wickedness?"
Probably this is the true idea. The psalmist asks with earnestness and
amazement whether, under the divine administration, people "can" find
safety in mere wickedness; whether great crimes constitute an evidence
of security; whether his enemies owed their apparent safety to the fact
that they were so eminently wicked. He prays, therefore, that God would
interfere, and show that this was not, and could not be so.

In thine anger cast down the people, O God - That is, show by thine own
interposition - by the infliction of justice - by preventing the success
of their plans - by discomfiting them - that under the divine
administration wickedness does not constitute security; in other words,
that thou art a just God, and that wickedness is not a passport to thy
favor.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

Thou tellest my wanderings - Thou dost "number" or "recount" them; that
is, in thy own mind. Thou dost keep an account of them; thou dost notice
me as I am driven from one place to another to find safety. "My
wanderings," to Gath, [Sa1 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md); to
the cave of Adullam, [Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md); to
Mizpeh, in Moab, [Sa1 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md); to the
forest of Hareth, [Sa1 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005.md); to
Keilah, [Sa1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#005.md); to the wilderness
of Ziph, [Sa1 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md); to the wilderness
of Maon, [Sa1 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025.md); to En-gedi, [Sa1
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001.md).

Put thou my tears into thy bottle - The tears which I shed in my
wanderings. Let them not fall to the ground and be forgotten. Let them
be remembered by thee as if they were gathered up and placed in a bottle
- "a lachrymatory" - that they may be brought to remembrance hereafter.
The word here rendered "bottle" means properly a bottle made of skin,
such as was used in the East; but it may be employed to denote a bottle
of any kind. It is possible, and, indeed, it seems probable, that there
is an allusion here to the custom of collecting tears shed in a time of
calamity and sorrow, and preserving them in a small bottle or
"lachrymatory," as a memorial of the grief. The Romans had a custom,
that in a time of mourning - on a funeral occasion - a friend went to
one in sorrow, and wiped away the tears from the eyes with a piece of
cloth, and squeezed the tears into a small bottle of glass or earth,
which was carefully preserved as a memorial of friendship and sorrow.

Many of these lachrymatories have been found in the ancient Roman tombs.
I myself saw a large quantity of them in the "Columbaria" at Rome, and
in the Capitol, among the relics and curiosities of the place. The above
engraving will illustrate the form of these lachrymatories. The annexed
remarks of Dr. Thomson ("land and the Book," vol. i. p. 147), will show
that the same custom prevailed in the East, and will describe the forms
of the "tear-bottles" that were used there. "These lachrymatories are
still found in great numbers on opening ancient tombs. A sepulchre
lately discovered in one of the gardens of our city had scores of them
in it. They are made of thin glass, or more generally of simple pottery,
often not even baked or glazed, with a slender body, a broad bottom, and
a funnel-shaped top. They have nothing in them but "dust" at present. If
the friends were expected to contribute their share of tears for these
bottles, they would very much need cunning women to cause their eyelids
to gush out with water. These forms of ostentatious sorrow have ever
been offensive to sensible people. Thus Tacitus says, 'At my funeral let
no tokens of sorrow be seen, no pompous mockery of woe. Crown me with
chaplets, strew flowers on my grave, and let my friends erect no vain
memorial to tell where my remains are lodged. '"

Are they not in thy book? - In thy book of remembrance; are they not
numbered and recorded so that they will not be forgotten? This expresses
strong confidence that his tears "would" be remembered; that they would
not be forgotten. All the tears that we shed "are" remembered by God. If
"properly" shed - shed in sorrow, without murmuring or complaining, they
will be remembered for our good; if "improperly shed" - if with the
spirit of complaining, and with a want of submission to the divine will,
they will be remembered against us. But it is not wrong to weep. David
wept; the Saviour wept; nature prompts us to weep; and it cannot be
wrong to weep if "our" eye "poureth out" its tears "unto God" [Job
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020.md); that is, if in our sorrow we
look to God with submission and with earnest supplication.

[Psalms 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 56:9</span></span>

When I cry unto thee - This expresses strong confidence in prayer. The
psalmist felt that he had only to cry unto God, to secure the overthrow
of his enemies. God had all power, and his power would be put forth in
answer to prayer.

Then shall mine enemies turn back - Then shall they cease to pursue and
persecute me. He did not doubt that this would be the ultimate result -
that this blessing would be conferred, though it might be delayed, and
though his faith and patience might be greatly tried.

For God is for me - He is on my side; and he is with me in my
wanderings. Compare the notes at [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md).

[Psalms 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 56:10</span></span>

In God will I praise his word - Luther renders this, "I will praise the
word of God." The phrase "in God" means probably "in respect to God;"
or, "in what pertains to God." That which he would "particularly" praise
or celebrate in respect to God - that which called for the most decided
expressions of praise and gratitude, was his "word," his promise, his
revealed truth. So in [Psa 138:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#002.md),
"Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name;" that is, above all
the other manifestations of thyself. The allusion in the passage here is
to what God had "spoken" to David, or the "promise" which he had made -
the declaration of his gracious purposes in regard to him. Amidst all
the perfections of Deity, and all which God had done for him, this now
seemed to him to have special pre-eminence in his praises. The "word" of
God was to him that which impressed his mind most deeply - that which
most tenderly affected his heart. There are times when we feel this, and
properly feel it; times when, in the contemplation of the divine
perfections and dealings, our minds so rest on his word, on his truth,
on what he has revealed, on his gracious promises, on the disclosures of
a plan of redemption, on the assurance of a heaven hereafter, on the
instructions which he has given us about himself and his plans - about
ourselves, our duty, and our prospects, that this absorbs all our
thoughts, and we feel that this is "the" great blessing for which we are
to be thankful; this, "the" great mercy for which we are to praise him.
What would the life of man be without the Bible! What a dark, gloomy,
sad course would ours be on earth if we had nothing to guide us to a
better world!

In the Lord will I praise his word - In "Yahweh." That is, whether I
contemplate God in the usual name by which he is known - אלהים 'Elohiym
- or by that more sacred name which he has assumed - יהוה Yahweh - that
which seems now to me to lay the foundation of loftiest praise and most
hearty thanksgiving, is that he has spoken to people, and made known his
will in his revealed truth.

[Psalms 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 56:11</span></span>

In God have I put my trust - The sentiment in this verse is the same as
in [Psa 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006.md), except that the word
"man" is used here instead of "flesh." The meaning, however, is the
same. The idea is, that he would not be afraid of what "any man" - any
human being - could do to him, if God was his friend.

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

Thy vows are upon me, O God - The word "vow" means something promised;
some obligation under which we have voluntarily brought ourselves. It
differs from duty, or obligation in general, since that is the result of
the divine command, while this is an obligation arising from the fact
that we have "voluntarily" taken it upon ourselves. The extent of this
obligation, therefore, is measured by the nature of the promise or vow
which we have made; and God will hold us responsible for carrying out
our vows. Such voluntary obligations or vows were allowable, as an
expression of thanksgiving, or as a means of exciting to a more strict
religious service, under the Mosaic dispensation [Gen
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md); [Num
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002.md); [Num
30:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md); [Deu
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021.md); [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md); and they cannot be wrong under
any dispensation. They are not of the nature of "merit," or works of
supererogation, but they are

\(a\) a "means" of bringing the obligations of religion to bear upon us
more decidedly, and

\(b\) a proper expression of gratitude.

Such vows are those which all persons take upon themselves when they
make a profession of religion; and when such a profession of religion is
made, it should be a constant reflection on our part, that "the vows of
God are upon us," or that we have voluntarily consecrated all that we
have to God. David had made such a vow

\(a\) in his general purpose to lead a religious life;

\(b\) very probably in some specific act or promise that he would devote
himself to God if he would deliver him, or as an expression of his
gratitude for deliverance. Compare the notes at [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md); notes at [Act
21:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md).

I will render praises unto thee - literally, "I will recompense praises
unto thee;" that is, I will "pay" what I have vowed, or I will
faithfully perform my vows.

[Psalms 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 56:13</span></span>

For thou hast delivered my soul from death - That is, my "life." Thou
hast kept "me" from death. He was surrounded by enemies. He was pursued
by them from place to place. He had been, however, graciously delivered
from these dangers, and had been kept alive. Now he gratefully remembers
this mercy, and confidently appeals to God to interpose still further,
and keep him from stumbling.

Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling - This might be rendered,
"Hast thou not delivered;" thus carrying forward the thought just before
expressed. So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and Luther and DeWette render
it. The Hebrew, however, will admit of the translation in our common
version, and such a petition would be an appropriate close of the psalm.
Thus understood, it would be the recognition of dependence on God; the
expression of gratitude for his former mercies; the utterance of a
desire to honor him always; the acknowledgment of the fact that God only
could keep him; and the manifestation of a wish that he might be enabled
to live and act as in His presence. The word here rendered "falling"
means usually a "thrusting" or "casting down," as by violence. The
prayer is, that he might be kept amid the dangers of his way; or that
God would uphold him so that he might still honor Him.

That I may walk before God - As in his presence; enjoying his friendship
and favor.

In the light of the living - See the notes at [Job
33:30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#030.md). The grave is represented
everywhere in the Scriptures as a region of darkness (see the notes at
[Job 10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); compare [Psa
