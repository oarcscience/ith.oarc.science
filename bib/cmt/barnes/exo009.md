### [Exodus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 9:3</span></span>

A very grievous murrain - Or "pestilence;" but the word "murrain," i. e.
"a great mortality," exactly expresses the meaning. This terrible
visitation struck far more severely than the preceding, which had caused
distress and suffering; it attacked the resources of the nation.

The camels - These animals are only twice mentioned, here and [Gen
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md), in connection with Egypt.
Though camels are never represented on the monuments, they were known to
the Egyptians, and were probably used on the frontier.

[Exodus 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 9:6</span></span>

All the cattle - i. e. which were left in the field; compare [Exo
9:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 9:7</span></span>

Was hardened - See [Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md). Pharaoh
probably attributed the exemption of the Israelites to natural causes.
They were a pastoral race, well acquainted with all that pertained to
the care of cattle; and dwelling in a healthy district probably far more
than the rest of Lower Egypt.

[Exodus 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 9:8</span></span>

This marks a distinct advance and change in the character of the
visitations. Hitherto, the Egyptians had not been attacked directly in
their persons. It is the second plague which was not preceded by a
demand and warning, probably on account of the special hardness shown by
Pharaoh in reference to the murrain.

Ashes of the furnace - The act was evidently symbolic: the ashes were to
be sprinkled toward heaven, challenging, so to speak, the Egyptian
deities. There may possibly be a reference to an Egyptian custom of
scattering to the winds ashes of victims offered to Typhon.

[Exodus 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 9:9</span></span>

A boil - Means probably a burning tumor or carbuncle breaking out in
pustulous ulcers. The miracle consisting in the severity of the plague
and its direct connection with the act of Moses.

[Exodus 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 9:11</span></span>

This verse seems to imply that the magicians now formally gave way and
confessed their defeat.

[Exodus 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 9:13</span></span>

With the plague of hail begins the last series of plagues, which differ
from the former both in their severity and their effects. Each produced
a temporary, but real, change in Pharaoh's feelings.

[Exo 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#014.md)

All my plagues - This applies to all the plagues which follow; the
effect of each was foreseen and foretold. The words "at this time" point
to a rapid and continuous succession of blows. The plagues which precede
appear to have been spread over a considerable time; the first message
of Moses was delivered after the early harvest of the year before, when
the Israelites could gather stubble, i. e. in May and April: the second
mission, when the plagues began, was probably toward the end of June,
and they went on at intervals until the winter; this plague was in
February; see [Exo 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031.md).

[Exo 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#015.md)

For now ... - Better, For now indeed, had I stretched forth my hand and
smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence, then hadst thou been
cut off from the earth. [Exo 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md)
gives the reason why God had not thus inflicted a summary punishment
once for all.

[Exo 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md)

Have I raised thee up - See the margin. God kept Pharaoh "standing", i.
e. permitted him to live and hold out until His own purpose was
accomplished.

[Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018.md)

A very grievous hail - The miracle consisted in the magnitude of the
infliction and in its immediate connection with the act of Moses.

[Exo 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#019.md)

In Egypt the cattle are sent to pasture in the open country from January
to April, when the grass is abundant. They are kept in stalls for the
rest of the year.

[Exo 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#020.md)

The word of the Lord - This gives the first indication that the warnings
had a salutary effect upon the Egyptians.

[Exo 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md)

The Lord - Thus, for the first time, Pharaoh explicitly recognizes
Yahweh as God (compare [Exo 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002).md).

[Exo 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029.md)

The earth is the Lord's - This declaration has a direct reference to
Egyptian superstition. Each god was held to have special power within a
given district; Pharaoh had learned that Yahweh was a god, he was now to
admit that His power extended over the whole earth. The unity and
universality of the divine power, though occasionally recognized in
ancient Egyptian documents, were overlaid at a very early period by
systems alternating between Polytheism and Pantheism.

[Exo 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031.md)

The flax was bolled - i. e. in blossom. This marks the time. In the
north of Egypt the barley ripens and flax blossoms about the middle of
February, or at the latest early in March, and both are gathered in
before April, when the wheat harvest begins. The cultivation of flax
must have been of great importance; linen was preferred to any material,
and exclusively used by the priests. It is frequently mentioned on
Egyptian monuments.

[Exo 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#032.md)

Rie - Rather, "spelt," the common food of the ancient Egyptians, now
called "doora" by the natives, and the only grain represented on the
sculptures: the name, however, occurs on the monuments very frequently
in combination with other species.

[Exodus 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 9:35</span></span>

Hardened - Different words in the Hebrew. In [Exo
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034.md) the word means "made heavy," i.
e. obtuse, incapable of forming a right judgment; in [Exo
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#035.md) it is stronger, and implies a
stubborn resolution.
