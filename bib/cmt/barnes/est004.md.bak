### [Esther Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001.md)

[Esther 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 4:2</span></span>

None might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth - This law
is not elsewhere mentioned; but its principle - that nothing of evil
omen is to be obtruded on the monarch - has been recognized throughout
the East in all ages.

[Esther 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 4:4</span></span>

Esther's maids ... told it her - Esther's nationality and her
relationship to Mordecai were probably by this time known to her
attendants, though still concealed from the king. See [Est
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004.md).

[Esther 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 4:11</span></span>

The golden scepter - In all the numerous representations of Persian
kings at Persepolis the monarch holds a long tapering staff (probably
the scepter of Esther) in his right hand. It was death to intrude on the
privacy of the Persian king uninvited.

[Esther 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 4:14</span></span>

From another place - i. e. "from some other quarter." Mordecai probably
concluded from the prophetic Scriptures that God would NOT allow His
people to be destroyed before His purposes with respect to them were
accomplished, and was therefore satisfied that deliverance would arise
from one quarter or another.

Thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed - i. e. "a divine
vengeance will overtake thee and thine, if thou neglectest thy plain
duty." Though the name of God is not contained in the Book of Esther,
there is in this verse a distinct, tacit allusion to God's promises, and
to the direction of human events by Divine Providence.

[Esther 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 4:16</span></span>

Again the religious element shows itself. Esther's fast could have no
object but to obtain God's favor and protection in the dangerous course
on which she was about to enter.
