Heritage

### [Lamentations Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

This poem Lam. 1 divides itself into two equal parts; [Lam
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001) describe the misery which has
befallen the Jews; in [Lam 1:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012),
Jerusalem laments over her sufferings.

[Lamentations 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 1:1</span></span>

In these two verses is the same sad image as appears in the well-known
medal of Titus, struck to celebrate his triumph over Jerusalem. A woman
sits weeping beneath a palm-tree, and below is the legend "Judaea
capta."

Translate [Lam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001) :

How sitteth solitary the city that was full of people:

She is become as a widow that was great among the nations:

A princess among provinces she is become a vassal.

Tributary - In the sense of personal labor [Jos
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#010).

[Lamentations 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 1:2</span></span>

Lovers ... friends - i. e. the states in alliance with Judaea, and all
human helpers.

[Lamentations 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 1:3</span></span>

Because of ... - i. e. the people, not of Jerusalem only, but of the
whole land, "is gone into exile to escape from the affliction and
laborious servitude," to which they are subject in their own land.

Persecutors ... between the straits - Rather, "pursuers ... in the midst
of her straits." The Jews flee like deer to escape from the invading
Chaldaeans, but are driven by them into places from where there is no
escape.

[Lamentations 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 1:4</span></span>

Zion, as the holy city, is the symbol of the religious life of the
people, just as Judah in the previous verse represents their national
life. The "virgins" took a prominent part in all religious festivals
[Jer 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013); [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).

[Lamentations 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 1:5</span></span>

Are the chief ... prosper - Or, "are become the head"... are at rest.
Judaea is so entirely crushed that her enemies did not need to take
precautions against resistance on her part.

Children - i. e. "young children," who are driven before the enemy
(literally the adversary), not as a flock of lambs which follow the
shepherd, but for sale as slaves.

[Lamentations 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 1:6</span></span>

Her princes ... - Jeremiah had before his mind the sad flight of
Zedekiah and his men of war, and their capture within a few miles of
Jerusalem [Jer 39:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004).

[Lamentations 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 1:7</span></span>

Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction,

And of her homelessness,

All her pleasant things which have been from the days of old:

Now that her people fall by the hand of the adversary,

And she hath no helper;

Her adversaries have seen her,

They have mocked at her sabbath-keepings.

The word rendered "homelessless" means wanderings, and describes the
state of the Jews, cast forth from their homes and about to be dragged
into exile.

Sabbaths - Or, sabbath-keepings, and the cessation from labor every
seventh day struck foreigners as something strange, and provoked their
ridicule.

[Lamentations 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 1:8</span></span>

Grievously sinned - literally, "Jerusalem hath sinned a sin," giving the
idea of a persistent continuance in wickedness.

Removed - Or, become an abomination. Sin has made Jerusalem an object of
horror, and therefore she is cast away.

Yea, she sigheth ... - Jerusalem groans over the infamy of her deeds
thus brought to open shame, and turns her back upon the spectators in
order to hide herself.

[Lamentations 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 1:9</span></span>

Her filthiness is in her skirts - Her personal defilement is no longer
concealed beneath the raiment [Jer
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#022).

She came down wonderfully - Jerusalem once enthroned as a princess must
sit on the ground as a slave.

[Lamentations 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 1:10</span></span>

Her pleasant things - Chiefly, the sacred vessels of the temple [Ch2
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010).

Sanctuary ... congregation - Even a Jew might not enter the innermost
sanctuary, which was for the priests only; but now the tramp of pagan
soldiery has been heard within its sacred precincts.

[Lamentations 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 1:11</span></span>

Sigh ... seek - Are sighing ... are seeking. The words are present
participles, describing the condition of the people. After a siege
lasting a year and a half the whole country, far and near, would be
exhausted.

To relieve the soul - See the margin, i. e. to bring back life to them.
They bring out their jewels and precious articles to obtain with them at
least a meal.

[Lamentations 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 1:12</span></span>

The lamentation of the city, personified as a woman in grief over her
fate.

[Lam 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013)

It prevaileth - Or, hath subdued.

He hath turned me back - Judaea, like a hunted animal, endeavors to
escape, but finds every outlet blocked by nets, and recoils from them
with terror and a sense of utter hopelessness.

[Lam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014)

Bound by his hand - As the plowman binds the yoke upon the neck of oxen,
so God compels Judah to bear the punishment of her sins.

They are wreathed, and ... - Or, they are knotted together, "they come
up" etc. Judah's sins are like the cords by which the pieces of the yoke
are fastened together [Jer 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002); they
are knotted and twined like a bunch upon the neck, and bind the yoke
around it so securely that it is impossible for her to shake it off.

He hath made ... - Or, it hath made "my strength" to stumble. The yoke
of punishment thus imposed and securely fastened, bows down her strength
by its weight, and makes her totter beneath it.

The Lord - The third distich of the verse begins here, and with it a new
turn of the lamentation. The title Adonai (properly, my Lord) is in the
Lamentations used by itself in fourteen places, while the name Yahweh is
less prominent; as if in their punishment the people felt the lordship
of the Deity more, and His covenant-love to them less.

[Lam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015)

The Lord hath trodden under foot - Or, אדני 'ădonāy has made
contemptible (i. e. put into the balance, made to go up as the lighter
weight, and so made despicable) "my war-horses" (put metaphorically for
heroes).

In the midst of me - They had not fallen gloriously in the battlefield,
but remained ignominiously in the city.

Assembly - Or, "a solemn feast;" the word especially used of the great
festivals [Lev 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002). אדני 'ădonāy has
proclaimed a festival, not for me, but against me.

The Lord hath trodden ... - Or, "אדני 'ădonāy hath trodden the winepress
for the virgin daughter of Judah." See [Jer
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014) note. By slaying Judah's young
men in battle, God is trampling for her the winepress of His
indignation.

[Lamentations 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 1:17</span></span>

Spreadeth forth her hands - In prayer [Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029), [Exo
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#033), but Zion entreats in vain. There
is no one to comfort her - not God, for He is chastising her, nor man,
for all the neighboring nations have become her enemies. See [Lam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002).

That his adversaries ... - Rather, that those round about him should be
his adversaries; all the neighboring states should regard him with
aversion.

Jerusalem is ... - i. e. is become an abomination. The words are
virtually the same as in [Lam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008).

[Lamentations 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 1:18</span></span>

People - peoples, pagan nations.

[Lamentations 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 1:19</span></span>

I called for ... - Rather, to "my lovers."

While they sought their meat - literally, "for they sought food for
themselves to revive their souls." Complete the sense by adding, "and
found none."

[Lamentations 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 1:20</span></span>

Troubled - Or, inflamed with sorrow.

Turned within me - Agitated violently.

At home there is as death - i. e. "in the house" there are pale pining
forms, wasting with hunger, and presenting the appearance of death.

[Lamentations 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 1:21</span></span>

They have heard ... - Or, "They heard that I sigh," that I have "no
comforter."

Thou wilt bring the day ... - literally, thou hast brought "the day thou
hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me." The day of Judah's
punishment was the proof that the nations now triumphing over
Jerusalem's fall would certainly be visited.
