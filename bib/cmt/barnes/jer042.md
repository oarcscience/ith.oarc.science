### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 42:1</span></span>

Among those delivered by Johanan from Ishmael had been Jeremiah and
Baruch [Jer 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006); and to them now all,
without exception, come for counsel.

Jezaniah - He is called Azariah in [Jer
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002). The Septuagint, in both places,
call him Azariah. Since there is little reason for identifying him with
Jezaniah the Maachathite [Jer 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008), it
is probable that the Septuagint is right in calling him in both places
Azariah, and that the reading Jezaniah arose from some scribe assuming
that his name must be found in the earlier list.

[Jeremiah 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 42:5</span></span>

Between us - Against us, as in [Jer
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019) (margin.)

According to all things - literally, "according to the whole word as to
which Yahweh thy God shall send thee to us."

[Jeremiah 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 42:6</span></span>

We - The form used here occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, but is
the regular form of the pronoun in the Talmud. It is one out of many
instances of Jeremiah using the popular instead of the literary language
of his times.

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

After ten days - On previous occasions Jeremiah when consulted answered
at once [Jer 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#003). The present delay
(compare [Jer 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012)) was probably
granted by God in order to free the minds of the people from the panic
caused by the murder of Gedaliah and their fear of Chaldaean vengeance.
Jeremiah could have had no doubt that the flight into Egypt was contrary
to the tenor of his former prophecies.

[Jeremiah 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 42:10</span></span>

I repent me - As punishment had been inflicted, the divine justice was
satisfied.

[Jeremiah 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 42:12</span></span>

Or, I will give you compassion before (i. e., obtain pity from) the king
of Babylon, and "he shall have mercy upon you, and let you dwell upon
your own soil."

[Jeremiah 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 42:14</span></span>

Egypt had lost the battle of Carchemish, but it had not been the scene
itself of military operations; while Judaea, from the date of the battle
of Megiddo, had perpetually been exposed to the actual horrors of war.

[Jeremiah 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 42:16</span></span>

Translate it: "Then shall the sword of which ye are afraid reach you
there in the land of Egypt, and the famine whereof ye pine shall cleave
close unto you in Egypt, and there shall ye die; and all the men who
have set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there shall die ... by
the pestilence, nor shall they have anyone that is left or escaped from
the evil which I will bring upon them."

[Jeremiah 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 42:18</span></span>

A curse - contempt, or ignominy.

[Jeremiah 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 42:19</span></span>

The request made in [Jer 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003) has been
fulfilled: Yahweh has spoken. The prophet now adds these four verses as
a sort of epilogue, in which he urges upon them the several points of
the divine message. In the ten days which had intervened between the
request and the answer Jeremiah had become aware that neither princes
nor people were prepared to obey unless the answer was in accordance
with their own wishes. He does therefore his best to convince them, but
as usual it was his lot to speak the truth to willful men, and gain no
hearing.

[Jeremiah 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 42:20</span></span>

Ye dissembled in your hearts - Or, "ye have led yourselves astray," i.
e., your sending me to ask counsel of God was an act of self-delusion.
You felt so sure that God would direct you to go into Egypt, that now
that He has spoken to the contrary, you are unable to reconcile
yourselves to it.
