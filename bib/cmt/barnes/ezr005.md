### [Ezra Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)

[Ezra 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 5:1</span></span>

Haggai and Zechariah stirred up Zerubbabel and Joshua [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002); [Hag
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014), and warned the people against
neglecting the building of the temple, in order to give themselves to
the beautifying of their own houses (see [Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004), [Hag
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009)). Zechariah was the son of
Berechiah, and grandson of Iddo (see the marginal reference; [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035)). Compare a similar application
of "son" in the case of Jehu (see the [Kg2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020) note).

In the name of the God of Israel, even unto them - Rather, "in the name
of the God of Israel, which was upon them." The two prophets addressed
the Jews, in respect of their being God's people, or, in Hebrew phrase
(see the [Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016) margin), "having
God's name called upon them."

[Ezra 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 5:2</span></span>

Began to build - i. e., "made a second beginning" - recommenced the
uncompleted work.

Helping them - By infusing zeal into the people (see [Hag
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012)).

[Ezra 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 5:3</span></span>

Governor on this side the river - Compare [Ezr
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010) note. Tatnai was apparently
satrap of Syria, which included the whole tract west of the Euphrates
from Cilicia to the borders of Egypt. Zerubbabel must have been, to some
extent, under his authority.

Who hath commanded you to build? - There was no doubt a formal
illegality in the conduct of Zerubbabel and Jeshua: since all edicts of
Persian kings continued in force unless revoked by their successors. But
they felt justified in disobeying the decree of the Pseudo-Smerdis (see
the [Ezr 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007) note), because the
opposition between his religious views and those of his successor was
matter of notoriety.

[Ezra 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 5:4</span></span>

Then said we - The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions have "Then
said they," which brings this verse into exact accordance with [Ezr
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#010).

[Ezra 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 5:6</span></span>

Apharsachites, like Apharsites, and Apharsathchites [Ezr
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009), are thought by some to be forms
of the word "Persians," which is applied here generally to the foreign
settlers in Samaria. (Others identify the first and the third names with
the "Paretaceni," a people on the Medo-Persian border.)

[Ezra 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 5:8</span></span>

Great stones - literally, as in the margin; i. e., stones so large that
they were rolled along, not carried. Others translate "polished stones."

[Ezra 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ezr 5:16</span></span>

Since that time even until now - Sixteen years - from 536 B.C. to 520
B.C. The adversaries of the Jews here overstep the truth; since, in
point of fact, the work had been suspended for a while [Ezr
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024).

[Ezra 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 5:17</span></span>

Let there be search made ... at Babylon - They perhaps doubted whether
proof of the decree of Cyrus remained in the archives. The
Pseudo-Smerdis had had the records in his power for seven months; and,
when he reversed the policy of his predecessors, might have been
expected to destroy their edicts. The decree was not found at Babylon,
the most natural place for it, but in the provincial capital of
Ecbatana, which Tatnai and his friends had not asked Darius to have
searched (see [Ezr 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002)).
