### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 8:2</span></span>

Punctuate as follows:

[Ezr 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002.md). ... of the sons of David,
Hattush of the sons of Shechaniah.

[Ezr 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#003.md). Of the sons of Pharosh,
Zechariah ....

Hattush, the descendant of David, was the grandson of Shechaniah (see
marginal reference).

Most of these names [Ezr 8:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#002.md) occur
also as those of heads of families in the list of the Jews who returned
with Zerubbabel [Ezr 2:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#003.md). The
Septuagint and Syriac versions supply omissions in [Ezr
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#005.md), [Ezr
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#010.md).

[Ezra 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 8:15</span></span>

Ahava was both a town and a river [Ezr
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md). The modern name of the place is
Hit. It is famous for its bitumen springs, and is situated on the
Euphrates, at a distance of about 80 miles from Babylon, toward the
northwest.

None of the sons of Levi - The Levites appear to have been disinclined
to return to Jerusalem (see [Ezr 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md)
note).

[Ezra 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 8:17</span></span>

Casiphia - Its situation is wholly unknown; but it cannot have been far
from Ahava.

[Ezra 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 8:18</span></span>

And Sherebiah - Either a name has fallen out before the words "a man of
understanding," or the "and" here has crept into the text by accident.
Sherebiah appears among the most earnest of the Levites under Nehemiah
(see the marginal references).

[Ezra 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 8:22</span></span>

What "enemy" menaced Ezra, and on what account, is wholly uncertain
(compare [Ezr 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031).md). Perhaps
robber-tribes, Arab or Syrian, were his opponents.

[Ezra 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 8:27</span></span>

Twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams - Not of a thousand drams (i.
e., darics) each, but worth altogether a thousand darics. As the value
of the daric was about 22 shillings of British money, each basin, or
saucer, would have been worth (apart from the fashioning) 55 British
pounds.

Of fine copper - The word translated "fine," which occurs here only, is
thought to mean either "yellow" or "glittering" (see the margin).
Probably the vessels were of orichalcum, an amalgam which was either
brass or something nearly approaching to brass, but which was very
rarely produced in the ancient world, and, when produced, was regarded
as highly valuable.

[Ezra 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ezr 8:31</span></span>

The Jews with Ezra left Babylon on the first day of the first month [Ezr
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009.md). They reached Ahava in nine days,
and, having remained there three [Ezr
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md), quitted it, and resumed their
journey on the twelfth. They reached Jerusalem on the first day of the
fifth month [Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009.md), four months
after the departure from Babylon.

[Ezra 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ezr 8:35</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. The idea of offerings for all Israel
pervades in this case the entire sacrifice, with the exception of the
lambs, whose number (77) is unique, and has not been accounted for.

[Ezra 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ezr 8:36</span></span>

The kings commissions - i. e., the orders issued to all governors of
provinces near Judaea by Artaxerxes, given in [Ezr
7:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021.md).

The kings lieutenants - literally, "the king's satraps." The word is
used in its strict sense, referring to the chief rulers of Persian
provinces, from which the "governors" or rulers of smaller districts are
distinguished.
