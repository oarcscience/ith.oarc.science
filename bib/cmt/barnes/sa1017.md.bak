### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 17:1</span></span>

The narrative reverts to the Philistine wars [Sa1
14:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052.md); the other introductory details
concerning Saul's rejection, and David's introduction upon the stage of
the history, having been disposed of in the intermediate chapters.

Shochoh which belongeth to Judah - See the marginal reference which
places Shochoh and Azekah in the "Shephelah" or maritime plain, and [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md), "Shochoh" now "Shuweikeh,"
"nine miles from Eleutheropolis," Jerome.

Ephes-dammim - Called "Happas-dammim" (Pas-dammim, [Ch1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013).md), "the end of bloodshed," now
"Damun," about 4 miles northeast of Shuweikeh.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 17:2</span></span>

The valley of Elah - i. e., of the terebinth, now called Wady es Sunt,
from the acacias which are scattered in it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 17:3</span></span>

(In the middle of the broad open valley [Sa1
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002.md) is a deep trench [Sa1
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#003.md) with vertical sides, a valley
within a valley: the sides and bed of the trench are strewn with
water-worn pebbles. (Conder.))

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 17:4</span></span>

A champion - literally, "a man between the two camps:" i. e., one who
did not fight in the ranks like an ordinary soldier, but came forth into
the space between the hostile camps to challenge the mightiest man of
his enemies to come and fight him.

Goliath of Gath - One of the places mentioned in [Jos
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022.md) as still retaining a remnant of
the sons of Anak; Gaza and Ashdod being the others. The race of giants
(the Rephaim, from רפא râphâ' ) is mentioned again in the account of
David's Philistine wars [Sa2 21:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#015.md);
[Ch1 20:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004.md). It appears from these
passages that Goliath had a brother Lahmi. Four are named as being "born
to the giant in Gath." See [Deu
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), [Deu
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md); [Deu
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md).

Six cubits ... - If the cubit, the length from the elbow to the tip of
the middle finger, is about 1 12 feet; and the span, the distance from
the thumb to the middle or little finger, when stretched apart to the
full length, be half a cubit, six cubits and a span would equal about
nine feet nine inches. The bed of Og king of Bashan was nine cubits long
[Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 17:5</span></span>

Coat of mail - Or "breastplate of scales." A kind of metal shirt,
protecting the back as well as the breast, and made of scales like those
of a fish; as was the corselet of Rameses III, now in the British
Museum. The terms, helmet, coat, and clothed (armed the King James
Version) are the same as those used in [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md).

Five thousand shekels - Probably about 157 pounds avoirdupois (see [Exo
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#012).md). It is very probable that
Goliath's brass coat may have been long preserved as a trophy, as we
know his sword was, and so the weight of it ascertained.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 17:6</span></span>

A target ... - Rather, "a javelin." as in [Sa1
17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md), and placed between the
shoulders, as the quiver was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 17:7</span></span>

Spear's-head - literally, "the flame of his spear," the metal part which
flashed like a flame.

Six hundred shekels - i. e., between seventeen and eighteen pounds
avoirdupois.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 17:12</span></span>

This and the following verses down to the end of [Sa1
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#031.md) are omitted in the Vatican copy
of the Septuagint, as are [Sa1
17:55-58](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055.md). The object of the omission
was doubtless to avoid the apparent inconsistency with regard to Saul's
acquaintance with David (see [Sa1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#021) note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 17:15</span></span>

David went ... - "Was gone," referring to [Sa1
16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#019.md). Had he been Saul's
armour-bearer at this time it is highly improbable that he would have
left him to feed sheep.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 17:18</span></span>

Take their pledge - i. e., bring back what they have to say in return.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 17:20</span></span>

The trench - Rather, "the wagons," which were all put together in the
camp so as to form a kind of bulwark or fortification (see [Sa1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md), [Sa1
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007).md). Here David left his "carriage"
[Sa1 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022.md), i. e., the things which he
had carried, "his things" as we should say, or baggage (translated stuff
in [Sa1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022.md); [Sa1
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#013.md); [Sa1
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024).md). There seems to have been an
officer ("the keeper," [Sa1 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022).md) in
the Hebrew army whose charge it was to guard the baggage.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 17:25</span></span>

Free in Israel - In all the other passages (fifteen) where this word
occurs, it means free, as opposed to being a slave ([Deu
15:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md), [Deu
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#018), etc..md) Here it may imply a
freedom from all such services and burdens as are spoken of in [Sa1
8:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 17:26</span></span>

The living God - This fine expression occurs first in Deuteronomy
(marginal reference), and next in [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md), and [Kg2
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004.md). We find it twice in the Psalms
of David [Psa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md); [Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md), four times in the prophets, and
frequently in the New Testament. It is generally in contrast to false
gods ([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009), etc..md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 17:28</span></span>

Why camest thou down? - From the heights of Bethlehem to the valley of
Elah.

Thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart - See the similar
expression, Jer. 49. Compare the envy of Jacob's sons toward Joseph, and
of the slanders heaped upon the Son of David in the days of His flesh.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 17:29</span></span>

Is there not a cause? - i. e., is not Saul's promise, and the insolence
of Goliath, a sufficent cause for what I am about to do?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa1 17:34</span></span>

The narrative does not make it certain whether the lion and the bear
came on one and the same, or on two different occasions. If it was on
one occasion, the probability would be that the bear, having seized a
lamb and carrying it off, a lion appeared to dispute the prize with the
bear, or with David after he had taken it from the bear, and that David
killed first one and then the other.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 17:35</span></span>

His beard - Put here for his throat, or under jaw; neither lion nor bear
has a beard properly speaking.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">sa1 17:45</span></span>

A shield - "A javelin," see [Sa1 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md)
note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 17:47</span></span>

The Lord saveth not with sword ... - Observe the consistent teaching of
such passages as [Sa1 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md); [Exo
14:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md); [Jdg
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002.md), [Jdg
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004.md),[Jdg
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007.md); [Psa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#006.md), etc., and their practical use to
the Church as lessons of trust in God, and distrust of ourselves.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">sa1 17:51</span></span>

Champion - Quite a different word from that so rendered in [Sa1
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md), [Sa1
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#023.md); better "warrior."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">sa1 17:52</span></span>

The men of Israel and Judah - See [Sa1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004.md) note.

Shaaraim - A town of Judah in the Shephelah (see the marginal
reference), at this time probably in the possession of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">sa1 17:54</span></span>

Jerusalem - See [Jdg 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md) note.

His tent - Perhaps the tabernacle. David had neither tent nor house of
his own. It would be quite in accordance with David's piety that he
should immediately dedicate to God the arms taken from the Philistine,
in acknowledgment that the victory was not his own but the Lord's
(compare [Sa1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009).md). His tabernacle,
meaning the tabernacle which he had pitched ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md); compare [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:55](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">sa1 17:55</span></span>

Whose son ... - See the marginal reference note.
