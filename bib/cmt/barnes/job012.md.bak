### [Job Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#001.md)

[Job 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 12:2</span></span>

No doubt but ye are the people - That is, the only wise people. You have
engrossed all the wisdom of the world, and all else are to be regarded
as fools. This is evidently the language of severe sarcasm; and it shows
a spirit fretted and chafed by their reproaches. Job felt contempt for
their reasoning. and meant to intimate that their maxims, on which they
placed so much reliance, were common-place, and such as every one was
familar with.

And wisdom shall die with you - This is ironical, but it is language
such as is common perhaps every where. "The people of the East," says
Roberts, "take great pleasure in irony, and some of their satirical
sayings are very cutting. When a sage intimates that he has superior
wisdom or when he is disposed to rally another for his meagrc
attainments, he says, 'Yes, yes, you are the man! ' 'Your wisdom is like
the sea.' 'When you die, whither will wisdom go?'" In a serious sense,
language like this is used by the Classical writers to describe the
death of eminently great or good men. They speak of wisdom, bravery,
piety, or music, as dying with them. Thus, Moschus, Idyll. iii. 12.

Ὅττι βίων τέθνηκεν ὁ βώκολος, ἔττι σὺν αὐτῷ

Καὶ τὸ μέλος τέθνακε, καὶ ὤλετο Δωρίς ἀειδός.

Hotti biōn tethnēken ho bōkolos, esti sun autō

Kai to melos tethnake, kai ōleto Dōris aeidos.

"Bion the swain is dead, and with him song

Has died, and the Doric muse has perished."

Expressions like these are common. Thus, in the "Pleasures of Hope" it
is said:

And Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell.

[Job 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 12:3</span></span>

But I have understanding as well as you - Margin, as in the Hebrew "an
heart." The word "heart" in the Scriptures is often used to denote the
understanding or mind. It seems to have been regarded as the source of
that which was called life or soul. Indeed, I do not recollect a single
instance in the Scriptures in which the word "head" is used, as with us,
as the seat of the intellect, or where the distinction is adverted to
that is so common with us, between the head and the heart. With us, the
heart is the seat of the affections and emotions; with the Hebrews, it
was the seat of understanding, and the σπλάγχνα splangchna - the
viscera, the bowels, were the seat of the emotions; see the notes at
[Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md). A more correct physiology
has taught us that the brain is the organ of the intellect, and we now
speak of "the heart" as the seat of the affections. The Romans regarded
the "breast" as the seat of the soul. Thus, Virgil, speaking of the
death of Lucagus by the hand of Aeneas, says:

Tum latebras animae pectus mucrone recludit

Aeneid x. 601.

I am not inferior to you - Margin, "fall not lower than." This is the
literal translation: "I do not fall beneath you." Job claims to be equal
to them in the power of quoting the sayings. of the ancients; and in
order to show this, he proceeds to adduce a number of proverbial
sayings, occupying the remainder of this chapter, to show that he was
familiar with that mode of reasoning, and that in this respect he was
fully their equal. This may be regarded as a trial of skill, and was
quite common in the East. Wisdom consisted in storing up a large amount
of proverbs and maxims, and in applying them readily and pertinently on
all public occasions; and in this controversy, Job was by no means
disposed to yield to them.

Yea, who knoweth not such things as these? - Margin, "With whom" are
"not such as these?" The meaning is, that instead of being original, the
sentiments which they advanced were the most commonplace imaginable. Job
not only said that he knew them, but that it would be strange if every
body did not know them.

[Job 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 12:4</span></span>

I am as one mocked of his neighbour - There has been considerable
variety in the interpretation of this verse. The general sense is, that
Job felt himself to be a mere laughing-stock for his neighbors. They
treated him as if he were not worth regarding. They had no sympathy for
him in his sorrows, and they showed no respect for his opinions. Dr.
Good understands this and the following verses as a part of the
controversy in which Job proposes to show his skill in debate, and to
adduce proverbs after the manner of his friends. But it is more probably
an allusion to himself, and is designed to state that he felt that he
was not treated with the respect which was due to him. Much difficulty
has been felt in understanding the connection. Reiske contends that [Job
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002.md) has no connection with [Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md), and that [Job
12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md), should be interposed between
them. The connection seems to me to be this: Job complains that he was
not treated with due deference. They had showed no respect for his
understanding and rank. They had urged the most common-place topics;
advanced stale and trite apothegms, as if he had never heard them; dwelt
on maxims familiar even to the meanest persons; and had treated him in
this manner as if he were a mere child in knowledge. Thus, to be
approached with vague common-places, and with remarks such as would be
used in addressing children, he regarded as insult and mockery.

Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him - This phrase has given
occasion to great variety in the interpretation. Umbreit renders it, "I,
who once called upon God, and he answered me;" that is, I, who once was
a happy man, and blessed of God. Schultens renders it, "I, who call upon
God," that is, for trial, "and am ready to answer him.' Rosenmuller
supposes that Job has reference to the assurances of his friends, that
if he would call upon God, he would answer him, and that in view of that
suggestion he exclaims, "Shall a man who is a laughing-stock to his
neighbor call upon God, and will he answer him!' The probable meaning
is, that he had been a man who had had constant communion with God. He
had been a favorite of the Almighty, for he had lent a listening ear to
his supplications. It was now a thing of which he might reasonably
complain, that a man who had enjoyed such manifest tokens of the divine
favor, was treated with reproach and scorn.

[Job 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 12:5</span></span>

He that is ready to slip with his feet - The man whose feet waver or
totter; that is, the man in adversity; see [Pro
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#019.md). A man in prosperity is
represented as standing firm; one in adversity as wavering, or falling;
see [Psa 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md).

But as for me, my feet were almost gone;

My steps had well nigh slipped.

There is much difficulty in this passage, and it has by no means been
removed by the labor of critics. The reader may consult Rosenmuller,
Good, and Schultens, on the verse, for a more full attempt to illustrate
its meaning. Dr. Good, after Reiske and Parkhurst, has offered an
explanation by rendering the whole passage thus:

The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock to the proud,

A derision amidst the sunshine of the prosperous,

While ready to slip with his foot.

It does not appear to me, however, that this translation can be fairly
educed from the Hebrew text, and I am disposed to acquiesce in the more
common and obvious interpretation. According to that, the idea is, that
a man in adversity, when failing from a high condition of honor, is
regarded as an almost extinguished lamp, that is now held in contempt,
and is cast away. When the torch was blazing, it was regarded as of
value; when nearly extinguished, it would be regarded as worthless, and
would be cast away. So when a man was in prosperity, he would be looked
up to as a guide and example. In adversity, his counsels would be
rejected, and he would be looked upon with contempt. Nothing can be more
certain or more common than the fact here adverted to. The rich and the
great are looked up to with respect and veneration. Their words and
actions have an influence which those of no other men have. When they
begin to fall, others are willing to hasten their fall. Long cherished
but secret envy begins to show itself; those who wish to rise rejoice in
their ruin, and they are looked upon with contempt in proportion to
their former honor, rank, and power. They are regarded as an
extinguished torch - of no value, and are cast away.

In the thought - In the mind, or the view.

Of him that is at ease - In a state of comfort and prosperity. He finds
no sympathy from them. Job doubtless meant to apply this to his friends.
They were then at ease, and were prosperous. Not suffering pain, and not
overwhelmed with poverty, they now looked with the utmost composure on
him - as they would on a torch which was burned out, and which there
would be no hope of rekindling.

[Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 12:6</span></span>

The tabernacles of robbers prosper - The tents or dwellings of robbers
are safe and secure. This is Job's original proposition, to which he all
along adheres. It is, that God does not deal with people in this life
according to their character; and in support of this he now appeals to
the fact that the tents or dwellings of robbers are safe. Arabia would
furnish many illustrations of this, which could not be unknown to the
friends of Job. The Arabs dwelt in tents, and they were then, as now,
wandering, predatory tribes. They lived, to a great extent, by plunder,
and doubtless Job could appeal to the observation of his friends for the
proof of this. He affirms that so far from dealing with people according
to their character, God often seemed to protect the public robber, and
the blasphemer of his name.

Prosper - They are secure, tranquil, at rest - for so the Hebrew word
means. They are not disturbed and broken in upon.

And they that provoke God - Or rather, "the tents are secure to those
who provoke God." Dr. Good renders it, "and are fortresses to those who
provoke God;" but the true idea is, that the tents of those who provoke
God by their conduct are safe. God does not seem to notice them, or to
come out in judgment against them.

Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly - Dr. Noyes renders this, "who
carry their God in their hand;" but with much less accuracy, as it seems
to me, than commonly characterizes his version. Eichhorn renders it in a
sense somewhat similar:

Die ihre Faust fur ihre Gottheit achten -

"Who regard their fist as their God."

And so Stuhlman renders it:

Und wem die Faust fur Gottheit gilt -

"And to whom the fist avails for their God;"

That is, says he, Job means that this is the course of the world. Dr.
Good renders it, "of him who hath created all these things with his
hand" - still less accurately. In order to this, he is obliged to
suppose an error in the text, but without the slightest authority.
Jerome renders it as in our version. The Septuagint, "who provoke the
Lord as if there would be no trial to them - ἔτασις αὐτῶν etasis autōn -
here-after;" which certainly makes sense, but it was never obtained from
the Hebrew. Rosenmuller renders it, "who have their own hand, that is,
power for God;" a description, says he, of a wicked and violent man who
thinks it right for him to do as he pleases. It seems to me, however,
that the common interpretation, which is the most simple, is most in
accordance with the Hebrew, and with the drift of the passage. According
to this it means, that there is security to the man who lives to provoke
that God who is constantly bringing to him in abundance the tokens of
kindness. This is the fact on which Job is insisting - that God does not
treat people in this world according to their real character, but that
the wicked are prospered and the righteous are afflicted.

[Job 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 12:7</span></span>

But ask now the beasts - Rosenmuller supposes that this appeal to the
inferior creation should be regarded as connected with [Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md), and that the intermediate verses
are parenthetical. Zophar had spoken with considerable parade of the
wisdom of God. He had said ([Job 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md)
ff) that the knowledge of God was higher than the heavens, and had
professed [Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md) to have himself
exalted views of the Most High. In reply to this, Job says that the
views which Zophar had expressed, were the most commonplace imaginable.
He need not pretend to be acquainted with the more exalted works of God,
or appeal to them as if his knowledge corresponded with them. Even the
lower creation - the brutes - the earth - the fishes - could teach him
knowledge which he had not now. Even from their nature, properties, and
modes of life, higher views might he obtained than Zophar had. Others
suppose, that the meaning is, that in the distribution of happiness, God
is so far from observing moral relations, that even among the lower
animals, the rapacious and the violent are prospered, and the gentle and
the innocent are the victims.

Lions, wolves, and panthers are prospered - the lamb, the kid, the
gazelle, are the victims. Either of these views may suit the connection,
though the latter seems to me to be the more probable interpretation.
The object of Job is to show that rewards and punishments are not
distributed according to character. This was so plain in his view as
scarcely to admit of argument. It was seen all over the world not only
among people, but even in the brute creation. Every where the strong
prey upon the weak; the fierce upon the tame; the violent upon the
timid. Yet God does not come forth to destroy the lion and the hyaena,
or to deliver the lamb and the gazelle from their grasp. Like robbers
[Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md), - lions, panthers, and
wolves prowl upon the earth; and the eagle and the vulture from the air
pounce upon the defenseless, and the great robbers of the deep prey upon
the feeble, and still are prospered. What a striking illustration of the
course of events among people, and of the relative condition of the
righteous and the wicked. Nothing could be more pertinent to the design
of Job than this appeal, and nothing was more in accordance with the
whole structure of the argument in the poem, where wisdom is seen mainly
to consist in the result of careful observation.

And they shall teach thee - Shall teach thee that God does not treat all
according to their character. He does not give security to the gentle,
the tame, and the innocent, and punish the ferocious, the blood-thirsty,
and the cruel.

And the fowls - They shall give thee information of the point under
discussion. Those that prey upon others - as the eagle and the vulture -
are not exposed at once to the divine displeasure, and the tender and
harmless are not protected. The general principle is illustrated in
them, that the dealings of God are not always in exact accordance with
character.

[Job 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 12:8</span></span>

Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee - Perhaps this appeal to
the earth may mean, as Stuhlman supposes, that the same thing is shown
in the productions of the earth, as in the case of fierce animals.
Noxious weeds and useless plants are more thrifty than the plants which
are useful and the growth of poisonous or annoying things on the earth
illustrates the same thing as the dealings of God with people - that his
dealings are not in accordance with the real nature of objects.

And the fishes of the sea - The same thing is manifested in the sea,
where the mighty prey upon the feeble, and the fierce and the ferocious
overcome the defenseless. The sentiment is that it is a great principle
which pervades all things that the ferocious the strong, the wicked, are
often prospered, while the weak, the defenseless, the innocent, the
pious, are subject to calamities, and that God does not apportion his
dealings to the exact character of his creatures. Undoubtedly Job was
right in this. and this general principle might be seen then as now, to
pervade the world.

[Job 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 12:9</span></span>

Who knoweth not in all these - Who cannot see in all these the proofs of
the same divine and sovereign agency? Who cannot see the hand of the
same God and the same great principles of administration? The meaning of
Job is, that the position which he defends is so plain, that it may be
learned from the very earth and the lowest orders of animals which God
has made.

That the hand of the Lord hath wrought this - In this place the original
word is יהוה yehovâh. On the meaning of the word see the notes at [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md). The Chaldee also renders it here
יה yâhh. It is remarkable that this is the only place where the name
yahweh occurs in poetical parts of the book of Job, in the printed
editions. In [Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md), yahweh is
found in some manuscripts, though the word "Adonai" is in the printed
copies. Eichhorn, Einleit. section 644, Note. In [Job
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#009.md), the word yahweh, though found in
the printed editions, is missing in nine ancient manuscripts. Dr. John
P. Wilson on the "Hope of Immortality," p. 57. The word yahweh
constantly occurs in the historical parts of the book. On the argument
derived from this, in regard to the antiquity of the Book of Job, see
the introduction, Section 4.

[Job 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 12:10</span></span>

In whose hand is the soul of every living thing - Margin, "Life." The
margin is the more correct rendering. The idea is, that all are under
the control of God. He gives life, and health, and happiness when he
pleases, and when he chooses he takes them away. His sovereignty is
manifested, says Job, in the inferior creation, or among the beasts of
the field, the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of heaven.

And the breath of all mankind - Margin, "Flesh of man." The margin is in
accordance with the Hebrew. The meaning is, that man is subjected to the
same laws as the rest of the creation. God is a sovereign, and the same
great principles of administration may be seen in all his works.

[Job 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 12:11</span></span>

Doth not the ear try words? - The literal meaning of this, which is
evidently a proverbial expression, is plain; but about its bearing here
there is more difficulty. The literal sense is, that it is the office of
the ear to mark the distinction of sounds, and to convey the sense to
the soul. But in regard to the exact bearing of this proverb on the case
in hand, commentators have not been agreed. Probably the sense is, that
there ought to be a diligent attention to the signification of words,
and to the meaning of a speaker, as one carefully tastes his food; and
Job, perhaps, may be disposed to complain that his friends had not given
that attention which they ought to have done to the true design and
signification of his remarks. Or it may mean that man is endowed with
the faculty of attending to the nature and qualities of objects, and
that he ought to exercise that faculty in judging of the lessons which
are taught respecting God or his works.

And the mouth - Margin, as in the Hebrew חך chêk - "palate." The word
means not merely the palate, but the lower part of the mouth (Gesenius),
and is especially used to designate the organ or the seat of taste; [Psa
119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103.md); [Job
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030.md).

His meat - Its food - the word "meat" being used in Old English to
denote all kinds of food. The sense is, man is endowed with the faculty
of distinguishing what is wholesome from what is unwholesome, and he
should, in like manner, exercise the faculty which God has given him of
distinguishing the true from the false on moral subjects. He should not
suppose that all that had been said, or that could be said, must
necessarily be true. He should not suppose that merely to string
together proverbs, and to utter common-place suggestions, was a mark of
true wisdom. He should separate the valuable from the worthless, the
true from the false, and the wholesome from the injurious. Job complains
that his friends had not done this. They had shown no power of
discrimination or selection. They had uttered common place apothegms,
and they gathered adages of former times, without any discrimination,
and had urged them in their arguments against him, whether pertinent or
not. It was by this kind of irrelevant and miscellaneous remark that he
felt that he had been mocked by his friends, [Job
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004.md).

[Job 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 12:12</span></span>

With the ancient is wisdom - With the aged. The word ישׁישׁ yâshı̂ysh
used here, means an old man, one gray-headed. It is used chiefly in
poetry, and is commonly employed in the sense of one who is decrepit by
age. It is rendered "very aged" in [Job
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010.md); "him that stooped for age."
[Ch2 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md); "very old," [Job
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006.md); and "the aged," [Job
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008.md) The Septuagint renders it, Ἐν
πολλῷ χρόνῳ En pollō chronō "in much time." The sense is, that wisdom
might be expected to be found with the man who had had a long
opportunity to observe the course of events; who had conversed with a
former generation, and who had had time for personal reflection. This
was in accordance with the ancient Oriental views, where knowledge was
imparted mainly by tradition, and where wisdom depended much on the
opportunity of personal observation; compare [Job
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007.md).

[Job 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 12:13</span></span>

With him is wisdom - Margin, correctly, "God." However much wisdom there
may seem to be with aged men, yes the true wisdom - that which was
supreme and worthy of the name - was to be found in God alone. The
object of Job was to lead the thoughts up to God, and to bring his
friends to a contemplation of the wisdom which he manifests in his
works. Accordingly he goes on in the remainder of this chapter to state
some of the illustrations of wisdom and power which God had exhibited,
and particularly to show that he was a sovereign, and did his pleasure
every where. He made all things; he sustains all things; he reverses the
condition of people at his pleasure; he sets up whom he pleases, and
when he chooses he casts them down. His works are contrary in many
respects to what we should anticipate; and the sense of all is, that God
was a holy and a righteous sovereign, and that such were the reverses
under his administration that we could not argue that he treated all
according to their character on earth.

[Job 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 12:14</span></span>

Behold, he breaketh down - None can repair what he pulls down. Cities
and towns he can devote to ruin by fire, or earthquake, or the
pestilence, and so completely destroy them that they can never be
rebuilt. We may now refer to such illustrations as Sodom, Babylon,
Petra, Tyre, Herculaneum, and Pompeii, as full proof of what is here
affirmed.

He shutteth up a man - He can shut up a man in such difficulties and
straits that he cannot extricate himself; see [Job
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010.md). The Chaldee renders this, "he
shuts up a man in the grave (בקבורתא) and it cannot be opened." But the
more correct idea is, that God has complete control over a man, and that
he can so hedge up his way that he cannot help himself.

[Job 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 12:15</span></span>

He withholdeth the waters - From the clouds and springs. He has control
over the rains and the fountains; and when these are withheld, rivers
and lakes become dry. The Syriac renders this, - "if he rebuke the
waters," supposing that there might perhaps be an allusion to the drying
up of the Red Sea, or the formation of a passage for the Israelites. But
it is remarkable that in the argument here there is no allusion to any
historical fact, not to the flood, or to the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah, or to the passage through the Red Sea, though these
occurrences would have furnished so appropriate illustrations of the
points under discussion. Is it to be inferred that Job had never heard
of any of those events? Or may it have been that the lessons which they
were adapted to teach had been actually embodied in the proverbs which
he was using, and furnished well-known illustrations or the basis of
such apothegms?

He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth - Such inundations may
have occurred in the swollen torrents of Arabia, and indeed are so
common everywhere as to furnish a striking illustration of the power and
sovereign agency of God.

[Job 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 12:16</span></span>

The deceived and the deceiver are his - This is designed to teach that
all classes of people are under his control. All are dependent on him,
and all are subject to him. He has power to keep them, and he can
destroy them when he pleases. Dr. Good supposes that Job refers here to
himself and his friends who had beguiled him into expressions of
impatience and complaint. But it is more probably a general declaration
that all classes of people were under the control of God.

[Job 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 12:17</span></span>

He leadeth counsellors away spoiled - Plundered or captive. That is, the
counsels of wise and great men do not avail against God. Statesmen who
promised themselves victory as the result of their plans he disappoints,
and leads away into captivity. The object of this is to show that God is
superior over all, and also that people are not dealt with in exact
accordance with their character and rank. God is a sovereign, and he
shows his sovereignty when defeating the counsels and purposes of the
wisest of men, and overturning the plans of the mighty.

And maketh the judges fools - He leaves them to distracted and foolish
plans. He leaves them to the adoption of measures which result in their
own ruin. He is a sovereign, having control over the minds of the great,
and power to defeat all their counsels, and to render them infatuated.
Nothing can be clearer than this. Nothing has been more frequently
illustrated in the history of nations. In accordance with this belief is
the well-known expression:

Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.

"Whom God purposes to destroy, he first infatuates."

[Job 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 12:18</span></span>

He looseth the bond of kings - The bond of kings (מוּסר mûsâr) here
means that by which they bind others. Their power over others he loosens
or takes away.

And girdeth their loins with a girdle - That is, he girds them with a
rope or cord, and leads them away as prisoners. The whole series of
remarks here refers to the reverses and changes in the conditions of
life. The meaning here is, that the bonds of authority which they
imposed on others are unbound, and that their own loins are bound with a
girdle, not a girdle of royal dignity and ornament, but such a one as
they are bound with who are servants, or who travel. "Pict. Bib."

[Job 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 12:19</span></span>

He leadeth princes away spoiled - That is, plundered. The word here
rendered "princes" כהנים kôhênı̂ym means properly priests, and it is
usually so rendered in the Scriptures. The ancient Hebrew interpreters
suppose that the word sometimes also means prince. The Chaldee
paraphrasist has not unfrequently so rendered it, using the word רבא to
express it; [Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md); [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). In this place, the Vulgate
renders it, "sacerdotes;" and the Septuagint, ἱερεῖς hiereis, "priests."
So Luther renders it, "Priester." So Castellio. It can be applied to
princes or statesmen only because priests were frequently engaged in
performing the functions of civil officers, and were in fact to a
certain extent officers of the government. But it seems to me that it is
to be taken in its usual signification, and that it means that even the
ministers of religion were at the control of God, and were subject to
the same reverses as other people of distinction and power.

And overthroweth - The word used here (סלף sâlaph) has the notion of
slipping, or gliding. So in Arabic, the word means to slip by, and to
besmear; see [Pro 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#006.md) : "Wickedness
overthroweth תסלף tesâlaph, causes to slip) the sinner;" compare [Pro
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012.md); [Pro
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012.md). Here it means to overthrow, to
prostrate. The most mighty chieftains cannot stand firm before him, but
they glide away and fall.

[Job 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 12:20</span></span>

He removeth away the speech of the trusty - Margin, "lip of the
faithful." "He takes away the lip," that is, he takes away the power of
giving safe counsel or good advice. The "trusty" or "faithful" here
refer to those of age and experience, and on whose counsel men are
accustomed to rely. The meaning here is, that their most sagacious
anticipations are disappointed, their wisest schemes are foiled. They
fail-in their calculations of the coarse of events, and the arrangements
of Providence are such that they could not anticipate what was to occur.

The understanding of the aged - To whom the young were accustomed to
look up with deference and respect. The meaning here is, that they who
were accustomed to give wise and sound advice, if left by God, give vain
and foolish counsels.

[Job 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 12:21</span></span>

He poureth contempt upon princes - He has power to hurl them from their
thrones, and to overwhelm them with disgrace.

And weakeneth the strength of the mighty - Margin, as in Hebrew "looseth
the girdle of the strong." The Orientals wore loose flowing robes, which
were secured by a girdle around the loins. When they labored, ran, or
traveled, their robes were girded up. But this is common everywhere.
Wrestlers, leapers, and runners, put a girdle around them, and are able
thus to accomplish much more than they otherwise could. To loosen that,
is to weaken them. So Job says that God had power to loosen the strength
of the mighty. He here seems to labor for expressions, and varies the
form of the image in every way to show the absolute control which God
has over people, and the fact that his power is seen in the reverses of
mankind. Lucretius has a passage strongly resembling this in the general
sentiment:

Usque adeo res humanas vis abdita quaedam

Obterit; et pulchros fasces, saevasque secures,

Proculcare, atque ludibrio sibi habere, videtur.

Lib. v. 1232.

So from his awful shades, some Power unseen

O'erthrows all human greatness! Treads to dust

Rods, ensigns, crowns - the proudest pomps of state;

And laughs at all the mockery of mad!

Good.

[Job 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 12:22</span></span>

He discovereth deep thirsts out of darkness - That is, God discloses
truths which are wholly beyond the power of man to discover - truths
that seem to be hidden in profound night. This may refer either to the
revelation which God was believed to have furnished, or to his power of
bringing out the most secret thoughts and purposes, or to his power of
predicting future events by bringing them out of darkness to the clear
light of day, or to his power of detecting plots, intrigues, and
conspiracies.

And bringeth out to light the shadow of death - On the meaning of the
word rendered "shadow of death," see the notes at [Job
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md). It here denotes whatever is dark
or obscure. It is rather a favorite expression with the author of this
poem (see [Job 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022.md); [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md); [Job
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017.md); [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md); [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017).md), though it occurs elsewhere in
the Scriptures. The deepest darkness, the obscurest night, are
represented by it; and the idea is, that even from the most dark and
impenetrable regions God could bring out light and truth. All is naked
and open to the mind of God.

[Job 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 12:23</span></span>

He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them - He has entire control
over them. The sources of prosperity are in his hand, and at his
pleasure he can visit them with famine, pestilence, or war, and diminish
their numbers and arrest their prosperity. Dr. Good renders this very
improperly, "He letteth the nations grow licentious;" but the word שׂגא
śâgâ' never has this sense. It means, to make great; to multiply; to
increase.

And straiteneth them again - Margin, "leadeth in." So the word נחה
nâchâh means. The idea is, that he increases a nation so that it spreads
abroad beyond its usual limits, and then at his pleasure leads them back
again, or confines them within the limits from where they had emigrated.

[Job 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 12:24</span></span>

He taketh away the heart - The word heart here evidently means mind,
intelligence, wisdom; see the notes at [Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md).

Of the chief of the people - Hebrew "Heads of the people;" that is, of
the rulers of the earth. The meaning is, that he leaves them to
infatuated and distracted counsels. By withdrawing from them, he has
power to frustrate their plans, and to leave them to an entire lack of
wisdom; see the notes at [Job 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#017.md).

And causeth them to wander in a wilderness - They are like persons in a
vast waste of pathless sands without a waymark, a guide, or a path. The
perplexity and confusion of the great ones of the earth could not be
more strikingly represented than by the condition of such a lost
traveler.

[Job 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 12:25</span></span>

They grope in the dark - They are like persons who attempt to feel their
way along in the dark; compare the notes at [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md).

And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man - Margin, "wander."
Their unstable and perplexed counsels are like the reelings of a drunken
man; see [Isa 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014.md), note; [Isa
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020.md), note. This closes the chapter,
and with it the controversy in regard to the ability to adduce pertinent
and striking proverbial expressions; see the notes at [Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003.md). Job had showed them that he was
as familiar with proverbs respecting God as they were, and that he
entertained as exalted ideas of the control and government of the Most
High as they did. It may be added, that these are sublime and beautiful
expressions respecting God. They surpass all that can be found in the
writings of the pagan; and they show that somehow in the earliest ages
there prevailed views of God which the human mind for ages afterward,
and in the most favorable circumstances, was not capable of originating.
These proverbial sayings were doubtless fragments of revealed truth,
which had come down by tradition, and which were thus embodied in a form
convenient to be transmitted from age to age.
