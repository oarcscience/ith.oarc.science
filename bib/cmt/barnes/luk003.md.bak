### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

Now in the fifteenth year - This was the "thirteenth" year of his being
sole emperor. He was "two" years joint emperor with Augustus, and Luke
reckons from the time when he was admitted to share the empire with
Augustus Caesar. See Lardner's "Credibility," vol. i.

Tiberius Caesar - Tiberius succeeded Augustus in the empire, and began
his "sole" reign Aug. 19th, 14 a.d. He was a most infamous character - a
scourge to the Roman people. He reigned 23 years, and was succeeded by
"Caius Caligula," whom he appointed his successor on account of his
notorious wickedness, and that he might be, as he expressed it, a
"serpent" to the Romans.

Pontius Pilate - Herod the Great left his kingdom to three sons. See the
notes at [Mat 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md). To "Archelaus" he
left "Judea." Archelaus reigned "nine" years, when, on account of his
crimes, he was banished into Vienne, and Judea was made a Roman
province, and placed entirely under Roman governors or "procurators,"
and became completely tributary to Rome. "Pontius Pilate" was the
"fifth" governor that had been sent, and of course had been in Judea but
a short time. (See the chronological table.)

Herod being tetrarch of Galilee - This was "Herod Antipas" son of Herod
the Great, to whom Galilee had been left as his part of his father's
kingdom. The word "tetrarch" properly denotes one who presides over a
"fourth part" of a country or province; but it also came to be a general
title, denoting one who reigned over any part - a third, a half, etc. In
this case Herod had a "third" of the dominions of his father, but he was
called tetrarch. It, was this Herod who imprisoned John the Baptist, and
to whom our Saviour, when arraigned, was sent by Pilate.

And his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea - "Iturea" was so called from
"Jetur," one of the sons of Ishmael, [Gen
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015.md); [Ch1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#031.md). It was situated on the east side
of the Jordan, and was taken from the descendants of Jetur by the tribes
of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh, [Ch1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019.md).

Region of Trachonitis - This region was also on the east of the Jordan,
and extended northward to the district of Damascus and eastward to the
deserts of Arabia. It was bounded on the west by Gaulonitis and south by
the city of Bostra. Philip had obtained this region from the Romans on
condition that he would extirpate the robbers.

Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene - Abilene was so called from "Abila,"
its chief city. It was situated in Syria, northwest of Damascus and
southeast of Mount Lebanon, and was adjacent to Galilee.

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

Annas and Caiaphas being highpriests - There was, properly speaking, but
one high priest of the Jews; yet the name of high priest continued to be
given to those who had been in that office, and especially when they
still possessed some civil office after they had left the high
priesthood. In this case it appears that "Caiapas" was high priest, and
Annas "had been," but had been dismissed from the office. It is highly
probable that he still held an office under the Romans, and was perhaps
president of the Sanhedrin. He is mentioned before Caiaphas because he
was the father-in-law to Caiaphas, and probably was the eldest, and had
been longest in office. Instances similar to this may be found in
Josephus.

There is one remark to be made here about the manner in which the
gospels are written. They have every mark of openness and honesty. An
impostor does not mention names, and times, and places particularly. If
he did, it would be easy to ascertain that he was an impostor. But the
sacred writers describe objects and people as if they were perfectly
familiar with them. They never appear to be "guarding" themselves. They
speak of things most minutely. If, therefore, they had been impostors,
it would have been easy to detect them. If, for example, John did not
begin to preach in the 15th year of Tiberius - if Philip was "not"
tetrarch of Iturea - if Pontius Pilate was not governor of Judea, how
easy would it have been to detect them in falsehood! Yet it was never
done. Nay, we have evidence of that age, in Josephus, that these
descriptions are strictly true; and, consequently, the gospels must have
been written by people who were personally acquainted with what they
wrote, who were not impostors, and who were "honest" people. If they
were "honest," then the Christian religion is true.

[Luke 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 3:3</span></span>

On the baptism of John - see the notes at Matt. 3.

[Luke 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 3:10</span></span>

What shall we do, then? - John had told them to bring forth fruits
appropriate to repentance, or to lead a life which showed that their
repentance was genuine. They very properly, therefore, asked how it
should be done, or what "would be" such a life.

[Luke 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 3:11</span></span>

He that hath two coats ... - Or, in other words, aid the poor according
to your ability; be benevolent, and you will thus show that your
repentance is genuine. It is remarkable that one of the "first" demands
of religion is to do good, and it is in this way that it may be shown
that the repentance is not feigned. For.

1\. The "nature" of religion is to do good.

2\. This requires self-denial, and none will deny themselves who are not
attached to God. And,

3\. This is to imitate Jesus Christ, who, though he was rich, yet for
our sakes became poor.

Coats - See the notes at [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md).

Meat - Provision of any kind.

[Luke 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 3:12</span></span>

The publicans - See the notes at [Mat
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#047.md). There is reason to think that
the "publicans" or "tax-gatherers" were especially oppressive and hard
in their dealings with the people; and that, as they had every
opportunity of exacting more than they ought, so they often did it, and
thus enriched themselves. The evidence of repentance in them would be to
break off their sins in this respect, and to deal justly.

[Luke 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 3:13</span></span>

Exact - Demand, or take, no more.

Than that which is appointed - That is, by the government. John does not
condemn the office, or say that the employment should be forsaken.
Though it was hated by the people - though often abused and therefore
unpopular - yet "the office itself" was not dishonorable. If there is a
government, it must be supported; and of course there must be people
whose duty it is to collect taxes, as the means of the proper support of
the government; and as such a support of the government is necessary, so
the people should pay cheerfully the just apportionment of their rulers,
and regard favorably those who are authorized to collect it. See [Rom
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md).

[Luke 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 3:14</span></span>

The soldiers likewise - It seems that "they," also came to his baptism.
Whether these were Jews or Romans cannot be ascertained. It is not
improbable that, as Judea was a Roman province, they were Jews or Jewish
proselytes in the service of Herod Antipas or Philip, and so were really
in the Roman service.

Do violence ... - Do not take the property of any by unlawful force, or
do not use unjust force against the person or property of any
individual. it is probable that many of them were oppressive, or prone
to violence, rapine, or theft, and burdensome even in times of peace to
the inhabitants.

Neither accuse any falsely - It is probable that when they wished the
property of others and could not obtain it by violence, or when there
was no pretext for violence, they often attempted the same thing in
another way, and falsely accused the persons of crime. The word rendered
"falsely accused" is the one from which our word "sycophant" is derived.
The proper meaning of the word "sycophant" was this: There was a law in
Athens which prohibited the importation of "figs." The "sycophant"
(literally "the man who made figs to appear," or who showed them) was
one who made complaint to the magistrate of persons who had imported
figs contrary to law, or who was an "informer;" and then the word came
to be used in a general sense to denote "any" complainer - a calumniator
- an accuser - an informer. As such persons were usually cringing and
fawning, and looked for a reward, the word came to be used also to
denote a fawner or flatterer. It is always used in a bad sense. It is
correctly rendered here, "do not accuse any falsely."

Be content ... - Do not murmur or complain, or take unlawful means to
increase your wages.

Wages - This word means not only the "money" which was paid them, but
also their "rations" or daily allowance of food. By this they were to
show that their repentance was genuine; that it had a practical
influence; that it produced a real reformation of life; and it is clear
that "no other" repentance would be genuine. Every profession of
repentance which is not attended with a change of life is mere
hypocrisy. It may farther be remarked that John did not condemn their
profession, or say that it was unlawful to be a soldier, or that they
must abandon the business in order to be true penitents. It was possible
to be a good man and yet a soldier. What was required was that in their
profession they should show that they were really upright, and did not
commit the crimes which were often practiced in that calling. It is
lawful to defend oneself, one's family, or one's country, and hence, it
is lawful to be a soldier. Man everywhere, in all professions, should be
a Christian, and then he will do honor to his profession, and his
profession, if it is not a direct violation of the law of God, will be
honorable.

[Luke 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 3:15</span></span>

In expectation - Expecting the Messiah. Margin, "suspense." That is,
they were not certain whether John was not himself the Messiah. They
confidently "expected" his appearing, and there minds were in
"suspense," or they were in a state of doubt whether he had not already
come, and whether John was not the Messiah.

Mused in their hearts of John - Thought of his character, his preaching,
and his success, and anxiously inquired whether he did not do the things
which were expected of the Messiah.

[Luke 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 3:16</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

[Luke 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 3:19</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 14:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md). "Added
this above all." To all his former crimes he added this; not implying
that this was the "worst" of his acts, but that this was "one" of his
deeds, of like character as the others. The event here mentioned did not
take place until some time after this, but it is mentioned here to show
what was the end of John's preaching, or to "fill out" the account
concerning him.

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md). "Jesus
being baptized;" or, Jesus "having been" baptized. This took place after
the baptism, and not "during" its administration, [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md).

Praying - This circumstance is omitted by the other evangelists; and it
shows,

1\. That Jesus was in the habit of prayer.

2\. That it is proper to offer up special prayer at the administration
of the ordinances of religion.

3\. That it is possible to pray in the midst of a great multitude, yet
in secret. The prayer consisted, doubtless, in lifting up the heart
silently to God. So "we" may do it anywhere - about our daily toil - in
the midst of multitudes, and thus may pray "always."

[Luk 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md)

In a bodily shape - This was a real visible appearance, and was
doubtless seen by the people. The dove is an emblem of purity and
harmlessness, and the form of the dove was assumed on this occasion to
signify, probably, that the spirit with which Jesus would be endowed
would be one of purity and innocence. The "Holy Spirit," when he assumes
a visible form, assumes that which will be emblematic of the thing to be
represented. Thus he assumed the form of "tongues," to signify the
miraculous powers of language with which the apostles would be endowed;
the appearance of fire, to denote their power, etc., [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md).

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

Jesus began to be ... - This was the age at which the priests entered on
their office, [Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md), [Num
4:47](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#047.md); but it is not evident that Jesus
had any reference to that in delaying his work to his thirtieth year. He
was not subjected to the Levitical law in regard to the priesthood, and
it does not appear that prophets and teachers did not commence their
work before that age.

As was supposed - As was commonly thought, or perhaps being legally
reckoned as his son.

[Luke 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 3:24</span></span>

See, on this genealogy, the notes at Mat. 1:1-16.
