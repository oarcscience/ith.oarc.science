### [Ezekiel Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 22:1</span></span>

The fourth word of judgment Ezek. 22:1-16. The sins which have brought
ruin upon Jerusalem are the sins which disgraced the pagan inhabitants
of Canaan, whom the Israelites were to cast out (compare Lev. 18). The
commission of like sins would insure like judgment.

[Ezekiel 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 22:4</span></span>

Thy days, - i. e., of judgment; "thy years," i. e., of visitation
(compare [Eze 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025.md), [Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039).md).

A reproach ... a mocking - Judah shall be like the Ammonites [Eze
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md).

[Ezekiel 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 22:5</span></span>

i\. e., Countries near and afar oft shall mock thee, saying, "Ah!
defiled in name; Ah! full of turbulence!"

[Ezekiel 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 22:6</span></span>

Render it: Behold the princes of Israel, each according to his might
(literally "arm") have been in thee in order to shed blood. They looked
to might not right.

[Ezekiel 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 22:10</span></span>

Set apart for pollution - Or, "unclean by reason of impurity" [Lev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md).

[Ezekiel 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 22:16</span></span>

Thou shalt take ... - Better as in the margin. Thou shalt by thine own
fault forfeit the privileges of a holy nation.

[Ezekiel 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 22:17</span></span>

The fifth word of judgment. The furnace. In the besieged city the people
shall be tried and purged.

[Eze 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018.md)

Dross - A frequent metaphor which denotes not only the corruption of the
people, who have become like base metal, but also a future purification
whereby, the "dross" being burned away, the remnant of good may appear.

[Ezekiel 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 22:23</span></span>

The sixth word of judgment. The special sins of princes, priests, and
people.

[Eze 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026.md)

Violated - Better as in margin; to offer "violence" to the Law is to
misinterpret it. It was the special office of the priests to keep up the
distinction between "holy" and "unholy," "clean" and "unclean" [Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md).

[Eze 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028.md)

See the marginal reference note.

[Eze 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030.md)

The land might be said to perish for the lack of such interpositions as
saved their forefathers when Moses "stood in the gap." This was a proof
of the general corruption, that there was not in the city sufficient
righteousness to save it from utter destruction. Prince, prophet,
priest, all fail.
