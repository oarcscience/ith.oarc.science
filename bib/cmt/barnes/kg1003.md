### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

What Pharaoh is meant is uncertain. It must have been a predecessor of
Shishak (or Sheshonk), who invaded Judaea more than 40 years later [Kg1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025); and probabilities are in favor,
not of Psusennes II, the last king of Manetho's 21st dynasty, but of
Psinaces, the predecessor of Psusennes. This, the Tanite dynasty, had
become very weak, especially toward its close, from where we may
conceive how gladly it would ally itself with the powerful house of
David. The Jews were not forbidden to marry foreign wives, if they
became proselytes. As Solomon is not blamed for this marriage either
here or in 1 Kings 11, and as the idol temples which he allowed to be
built [Kg1 11:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005) were in no case
dedicated to Egyptian deities, it is to be presumed that his Egyptian
wife adopted her husband's religion.

The city of David - The city, situated on the eastern hill, or true
Zion, where the temple was afterward built, over against the city of the
Jehusites ([Kg1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024); compare [Ch2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 3:2</span></span>

The word "only" introduces a contrast. The writer means to say that
there was one exception to the flourishing condition of things which he
has been describing, namely, that "the people sacrificed in
high-places." (Compare the next verse.) The Law did not forbid
"high-places" directly, but only by implication. It required the utter
destruction of all the high-places which had been polluted by idolatrous
rites [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002); and the injunction to
offer sacrifices nowhere except at the door of the tabernacle [Lev
17:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003) was an indirect prohibition of
them, or, at least, of the use which the Israelites made of them; but
there was some real reason to question whether this was a command
intended to come into force until the "place" was chosen "where the Lord
would cause His name to dwell." (See [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011), [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014).) The result was that
high-places were used for the worship of Yahweh, from the time of the
Judges downward [Jdg 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025); [Jdg
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016); [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010); [Sa1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009); [Sa1
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#035); [Sa1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#005); [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026), with an entire unconsciousness
of guilt on the part of those who used them. And God so far overlooked
this ignorance that He accepted the worship thus offered Him, as appears
from the vision vouchsafed to Solomon on this occasion. There were two
reasons for the prohibition of high-places; first, the danger of the old
idolatry creeping back if the old localities were retained for worship;
and, secondly, the danger to the unity of the nation if there should be
more than one legitimate religious center. The existence of the worship
at high places did, in fact, facilitate the division of the kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 3:4</span></span>

Gibeon - The transfer to Gibeon of the "tabernacle of the congregation,"
and the brass "altar of burnt offerings" made by Moses, which were
removed there from Nob (compare [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006), with marginal references "i,"
"k"), had made it "the great high-place," more sacred, i. e., than any
other in the holy land, unless it were Mount Zion where the ark had been
conveyed by David. For the position of Gibeon, see [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003) note.

A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer - Solomon presented the
victims. The priests were the actual sacrificers [Kg1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#005). A sacrifice of a thousand victims
was an act of royal magnificence suited to the greatness of Solomon. So
Xerxes offered 1,000 oxen at Troy. If the offerings in this case were
"whole burnt offerings," and were all offered upon the altar of Moses,
the sacrifice must have lasted several days.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 3:5</span></span>

The Lord appeared unto Solomon in a dream - Compare the marginal
references and [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012); [Gen
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 3:6</span></span>

This great kindness - David himself had regarded this as God's crowning
mercy to him [Kg1 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#048).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 3:7</span></span>

See [Kg1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002) note, and on the
hyperbole contained in the phrase "little child," compare [Gen
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#008); [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).

How to go out or come in - This expression is proverbial for the active
conduct of affairs. (See the marginal reference.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 3:8</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. Solomon regards the promises as
fulfilled in the existing greatness and glory of the Jewish nation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 3:9</span></span>

One of the chief functions of the Oriental monarch is always to hear and
decide causes. Hence, supreme magistrates were naturally called
"judges." (See the introduction to the Book of Judges.) In the minds of
the Jews the "judge" and the "prince" were always closely associated,
the direct cognisance of causes being constantly taken by their chief
civil governors. (See [Exo 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014); [Exo
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016), [Exo
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022); [Sa1
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020); [Sa2
15:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002).)

Good and bad - i. e. "right and wrong," "justice and injustice."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 3:10</span></span>

Although Solomon's choice was made "in a dream" [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005), we must regard it as springing
from his will in some degree, and therefore as indicative of his moral
character.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 3:11</span></span>

Thine enemies - e. g. Hadad the Edomite [Kg1
11:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014) and Rezon the son of Eliadah
[Kg1 11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023), whom Solomon might well
have wished to remove.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 3:12</span></span>

A wise and an understanding heart - Solomon's wisdom seems to have been
both moral and intellectual (see [Kg1
4:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029)). But it was moral wisdom
alone which he requested, and which was promised him. The terms
translated "wise" and "understanding," both denote practical wisdom.
(See [Gen 41:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#033), [Gen
41:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#039); [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006); [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002), etc.)

Neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee - i. e. in the
knowledge of what was in man, and in the wisdom to direct men's goings,
he was to be the wisest of "all" mere men. In such wisdom the world
would know one only "greater than Solomon" [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042); [Luk
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 3:13</span></span>

A striking illustration of that law of the divine government to which
Christ referred (marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 3:14</span></span>

I will lengthen thy days - The promise here was only conditional. As the
condition was not observed [Kg1
11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001), the right to the promise was
forfeited, and it was not fulfilled. Solomon can scarcely have been more
than fifty-nine or sixty at his death.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 3:15</span></span>

Solomon determined to inaugurate his reign by a grand religious
ceremonial at each of the two holy places which at this time divided
between them the reverence of the Jews. Having completed the religious
service at Gibeon, where was the tabernacle of the congregation, he
proceeded to Jerusalem, and sacrificed before the ark of the covenant,
which was in Mount Zion [Sa2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012). A
great feast naturally followed on a large sacrifice of peace-offerings.
In these the sacrificer always partook of the flesh of the victim, and
he was commanded to call in to the feast the Levite, the stranger, the
fatherless, and the widow [Deu 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029).
Compare [Sa2 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019); [Ch1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#003).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 3:28</span></span>

The wisdom of God - i. e. "Divine wisdom," "a wisdom given by God" [Kg1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012). The ready tact and knowledge of
human nature exhibited in this pattern judgment, and its special fitness
to impress Orientals, have generally been admitted.
