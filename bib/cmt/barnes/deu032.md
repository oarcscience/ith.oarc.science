### [Deuteronomy Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 32:1</span></span>

Song of Moses

If [Deu 32:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001) be regarded as the
introduction, and [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043) as the
conclusion, the main contents of the song may be grouped under three
heads, namely,

\(1\) [Deu 32:4-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004), the faithfulness
of God, the faithlessness of Israel;

\(2\) [Deu 32:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019), the chastisement
and the need of its infliction by God;

\(3\) [Deu 32:34-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034), God's compassion
upon the low and humbled state of His people.

The Song differs signally in diction and idiom from the preceding
chapters; just as a lyrical passage is conceived in modes of thought
wholly unlike those which belong to narrative or exhortation, and is
uttered in different phraseology.

There are, however, in the Song numerous coincidences both in thoughts
and words with other parts of the Pentateuch, and especially with
Deuteronomy; while the resemblances between it and Ps. 90: "A Prayer of
Moses," have been rightly regarded as important.

The Song has reference to a state of things which did not ensue until
long after the days of Moses. In this it resembles other parts of
Deuteronomy and the Pentateuch which no less distinctly contemplate an
apostasy (e. g. [Deu 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015); [Lev
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014)), and describe it in general
terms. If once we admit the possibility that Moses might foresee the
future apostasy of Israel, it is scarcely possible to conceive how such
foresight could be turned to better account by him than by the writing
of this Song. Exhibiting as it does God's preventing mercies, His
people's faithlessness and ingratitude, God's consequent judgments, and
the final and complete triumph of the divine counsels of grace, it forms
the summary of all later Old Testament prophecies, and gives as it were
the framework upon which they are laid out. Here as elsewhere the
Pentateuch presents itself as the foundation of the religious life of
Israel in after times. The currency of the Song would be a standing
protest against apostasy; a protest which might well check waverers, and
warn the faithful that the revolt of others was neither unforeseen nor
unprovided for by Him in whom they trusted.

That this Ode must on every ground take the very first rank in Hebrew
poetry is universally allowed.

[Deu 32:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)

Introduction. Heaven and earth are here invoked, as elsewhere (see the
marginal references), in order to impress on the hearers the importance
of what is to follow.

[Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004)

He is the Rock, his work is perfect - Rather, the Rock, perfect is his
work. This epithet, repeated no less than five times in the Song [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018), [Deu
32:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030), represents those attributes
of God which Moses is seeking to enforce, immutability and impregnable
strength. Compare the expression "the stone of Israel" in [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024); and see [Sa1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#002); [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002); [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042). Zur, the original of "Rock,"
enters frequently into the composition of proper names of the Mosaic
time, e. g., [Num 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005), [Num
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#010); [Num
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#012); [Num
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#035), etc. Our translators have
elsewhere rendered it according to the sense "everlasting strength" [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004), "the Mighty One" [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029); in this chapter they have
rightly adhered to the letter throughout.

[Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005)

Render: "It" (i. e. "the perverse and crooked generation") "hath
corrupted itself before Him (compare [Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004)); they are not His children, but
their blemish:" i. e., the generation of evil-doers cannot be styled
God's children, but rather the shame and disgrace of God's children. The
other side of the picture is thus brought forward with a brevity and
abruptness which strikingly enforces the contrast.

[Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006)

Hath bought thee - Rather perhaps, "hath acquired thee for His own," or
"possessed thee:" compare the expression "a peculiar people," margin "a
purchased people," in [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

[Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008)

That is, while nations were being constituted under God's providence,
and the bounds of their habitation determined under His government
(compare [Act 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026)), He had even then
in view the interests of His elect, and reserved a fitting inheritance
"according to the number of the children of Israel;" i. e.,
proportionate to the wants of their population. Some texts of the Greek
version have "according to the number of the Angels of God;" following
apparently not a different reading, but the Jewish notion that the
nations of the earth are seventy in number (compare [Gen
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001) note), and that each has its own
guardian Angel (compare Ecclus. 17:17). This was possibly suggested by
an apprehension that the literal rendering might prove invidious to the
many Gentiles who would read the Greek version.

[Deu 32:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009)

These verses set forth in figurative language the helpless and hopeless
state of the nation when God took pity on it, and the love and care
which He bestowed on it.

[Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010)

In the waste howling wilderness - literally, "in a waste, the howling of
a wilderness," i. e., a wilderness in which wild beasts howl. The word
for "waste" is that used in [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002),
and there rendered "without form."

[Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011)

Compare [Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004). The "so," which the
King James Version supplies in the next verse, should he inserted before
"spreadeth," and omitted from [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012). The sense is, "so He spread out
His wings, took them up," etc.

[Deu 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012)

With him - i. e., with God. The Lord alone delivered Israel; Israel
therefore ought to have served none other but Him.

[Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013)

i\. e., God gave Israel possession of those commanding positions which
carry with them dominion over the whole land (compare [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029)), and enabled him to draw the
richest provision out of spots naturally unproductive.

[Deu 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014)

Breed of Bashan - Bashan was famous for its cattle. Compare [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012); [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018).

Fat of kidneys of wheat - i. e., the finest and most nutritious wheat.
The fat of the kidneys was regarded as being the finest and tenderest,
and was therefore specified as a part of the sacrificial animals which
was to be offered to the Lord: compare [Exo
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#013), etc.

The pure blood of the qrape - Render, the blood of the grape, even wine.
The Hebrew word seems (compare [Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002)) a poetical term for wine.

[Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015)

Jesbarun - This word, found again only in [Deu
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005), [Deu
33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026), and [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002), is not a diminutive but an
appellative (containing an allusion to the root, "to be righteous"); and
describes not the character which belonged to Israel in fact, but that
to which Israel was called. Compare [Num
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021). The prefixing of this epithet
to the description of Israel's apostasy contained in the words next
following is full of keen reproof.

[Deu 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016)

They provoked him to jealousy - The language is borrowed from the
matrimonial relationship, as in [Deu
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016).

[Deu 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017)

Devils - Render, destroyers. The application of the word to the false
gods points to the trait so deeply graven in all pagan worship, that of
regarding the deities as malignant, and needing to be propitiated by
human sufferings.

Not to God - Rather, "not God," i. e., which were not God; see the
margin and [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021). Compare [Deu
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#007); [Deu
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#025).

[Deu 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019)

The anger of God at the apostasy of His people is stated in general
terms in this verse; and the results of it are described, in words as of
God Himself, in the next and following verses. These results consisted
negatively in the withdrawal of God's favor [Deu
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020), and positively in the
infliction of a righteous retribution.

Daughters - The women had their full share in the sins of the people.
Compare [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016) ff; [Isa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009) ff; [Jer
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018); [Jer
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015) ff.

[Deu 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020)

I will see what their end shall be - Compare the similar expression in
[Gen 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020).

[Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)

God would mete out to them the same measure as they had done to Him.
Through chosen by the one God to be His own, they had preferred idols,
which were no gods. So therefore would He prefer to His people that
which was no people. As they had angered Him with their vanities, so
would He provoke them by adopting in their stead those whom they counted
as nothing. The terms, "not a people," and "a foolish nation," mean such
a people as, not being God's, would not be accounted a people at all
(compare [Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010)), and such a nation as is
destitute of that which alone can make a really "wise and understanding
people" [Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006), namely, the
knowledge of the revealed word and will of God (compare [Co1
1:18-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018)).

[Deu 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024)

Burning heat - i. e., the fear of a pestilential disease. On the "four
sore judgments," famine, plague, noisome beasts, the sword, compare [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022); [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002); [Eze
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017); [Eze
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021).

[Deu 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#026), [Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027)

Rather, I would utterly disperse them, etc., were it not that I
apprehended the provocation of the enemy, i. e., that I should be
provoked to wrath when the enemy ascribed the overthrow of Israel to his
own prowess and not to my judgments. Compare [Deu
9:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#028); [Eze
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009), [Eze
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014), [Eze
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022).

Behave themselves strangely - Rather, misunderstand it, i. e., mistake
the cause of Israel's ruin.

[Deu 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030)

The defeat of Israel would be due to the fact that God, their strength,
had abandoned them because of their apostasy.

[Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031)

Our enemies - i. e., the enemies of Moses and the faithful Israelites;
the pagan, more especially those with whom Israel was brought into
collision, whom Israel was commissioned to "chase," but to whom, as a
punishment for faithlessness, Israel was "sold," [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030). Moses leaves the decision,
whether "their rock" (i. e. the false gods of the pagan to which the
apostate Israelites had fallen away) or "our Rock" is superior, to be
determined by the unbelievers themselves. For example, see [Exo
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025); Num. 23; 24; [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009) ff; [Sa1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#008); [Sa1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#007) ff; [Kg1
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028). That the pagan should thus be
constrained to bear witness to the supremacy of Israel's God heightened
the folly of Israel's apostasy.

[Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)

Their vine - i. e., the nature and character of Israel: compare for
similar expressions [Psa 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008), [Psa
80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001).

Sodom ... Gomorrah - Here, as elsewhere, and often in the prophets,
emblems of utter depravity: compare [Isa
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010); [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014),

Gall - Compare [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018) note.

[Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035)

Rather: "Vengeance is mine and recompence, at the time when their foot
slideth.

[Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036)

Repent himself for - Rather, have compassion upon. The verse declares
that God's judgment of His people would issue at once in the punishment
of the wicked, and in the comfort of the righteous.

None shut up, or left - A proverbial phrase (compare [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010)) meaning perhaps "married and
single," or "guarded and forsaken," but signifying generally "all men of
all sorts."

[Deu 32:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040)

Render: For I lift up my hand to heaven and say, As I live forever, if I
whet, etc. On [Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040), in which God
is described as swearing by Himself, compare [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023); [Jer
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005); [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017). The lifting up of the hand was a
gesture used in making oath (compare [Gen
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022); [Rev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)).

[Deu 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042)

From the beginning of revenges upon the enemy - Render, (drunk with
blood) from the head (i. e. the chief) of the princes of the enemy.

[Deuteronomy 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">deu 32:43</span></span>

Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people - Some prefer the marginal
rendering.

In this profound passage, there is shadowed forth the purpose of God to
overrule:

\(1\) the unbelief of the Jews to the bringing in of the Gentiles; and

\(2\) the mercy shown to the Gentries to the eventual restoration of the
Jews (compare [Rom 11:25-36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)).

The Song closes as it began [Deu
32:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001), with an invitation to praise.
It has reached, through a long series of divine interpositions, its
grandest theme in this call to the Gentiles, now pagan no more, to
rejoice over God's restored people, the Jews.

[Deuteronomy 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 32:44</span></span>

These verses were, no doubt, added by the author of the supplement to
Deuteronomy. For the statements contained in them, consult the marginal
references.
