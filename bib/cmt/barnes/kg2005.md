### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 5:1</span></span>

By him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria - An Assyrian monarch
had pushed his conquests as far as Syria exactly at this period,
bringing into subjection all the kings of these parts. But Syria
revolted after a few years and once more made herself independent. It
was probably in this war of independence that Naaman had distinguished
himself.

But he was a leper - leprosy admitted of various kinds and degrees Lev.
13; 14 Some of the lighter forms would not incapacitate a man from
discharging the duties of a courtier and warrior.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 5:2</span></span>

No peace had been made on the failure of Ahab's expedition 1 Kings
22:1-36. The relations of the two countries therefore continued to be
hostile, and plundering inroads naturally took place on the one side and
on the other.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 5:4</span></span>

One went in - Rather, "he went in," i. e. Naaman went and told his lord,
the king of Syria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 5:5</span></span>

Six thousand pieces of gold - Rather, "six thousand shekels of gold."
Coined money did not exist as yet, and was not introduced into Judea
until the time of Cyrus. Gold was carried in bars, from which portions
were cut when need arose, and the value was ascertained by weighing. If
the gold shekel of the Jews corresponded, as some think, to the doric of
the Persians, the value of the 6,000 shekels would be about 6,837
British pounds If the weight was the same as that of the silver shekel
(see [Exo 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note), the value would
exceed 12,000 British pounds.

The ancient practice of including clothes among gifts of honor in the
East [Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042); [Est
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008); [Dan
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007) continues to the present day.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 5:6</span></span>

That thou mayest recover him - literally, "And thou shalt recover him."
The Syrian king presumes that, if there is a cure for leprosy to be had
in Israel, the mode of obtaining it will be well known to his royal
brother.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 5:7</span></span>

He rent his clothes - The action indicated alarm and terror quite as
much as sorrow [Sa2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019); [Ezr
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003); [Ch2
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#027); [Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022).

Consider, I pray you - Jehoram speaks to his chief officers, and bids
them mark the animus of the Syrian monarch. Compare the conduct of Ahab
[Kg1 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#007).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 5:8</span></span>

He shall know ... Israel - namely, "That which thou (the king of Israel)
appearest to have forgotten, that there is a prophet - a real Yahweh
prophet - in Israel."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 5:10</span></span>

Elisha was not deterred from personally meeting Naaman because he was a
leper. He sent a messenger because Naaman had over-estimated his own
importance [Kg2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011)), and needed
rebuke.

And wash in Jordan - Compare the marginal references. A command is given
which tests the faith of the recipient, and the miracle is not performed
until such faith is openly evidenced.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 5:11</span></span>

He will surely come out to me - In the East a code of unwritten laws
prescribes exactly how visits are to be paid, and how visitors are to be
received, according to the worldly rank of the parties (compare [Kg2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#021)). No doubt, according to such a
code, Elisha should have gone out to meet Naaman at the door of his
house.

And call on the name of the Lord his God - literally, "of Yahweh his
God." Naaman is aware that Yahweh is the God of Elisha. Compare the
occurrence of the name of Yahweh on the "Moabite Stone" ([Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004) note).

Strike - Better, as in the margin, "pass the fingers up and down the
place" at a short distance. It seems implied that the leprosy was
partial.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 5:12</span></span>

The Abana is the Barada, or true river of Damascus, which, rising in the
anti-Libanus, flows westward from its foot and forms the oasis within
which Damascus is placed. The Pharpar is usually identified with the
Awaaj.

Naaman thinks that, if washing is to cure him, his own rivers may serve
the purpose. Their water was brighter, clearer, and colder than that of
Jordan.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 5:14</span></span>

Seven times - Compare [Kg1 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#043). In
both cases a somewhat severe trial was made of the individual's faith.
Compare the seven compassings of Jericho, and the sudden fall of the
walls Josh. 6:3-20.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 5:15</span></span>

He returned - Naaman was grateful (compare [Luk
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#015)). From the Jordan to Samaria was
a distance of not less than 32 miles. Naaman further went to Damascus,
far out of his way, lengthening his necessary journey by at least three
days. His special object in returning seems to have been to relieve his
feelings of obligation by inducing the prophet to accept a "blessing,"
i. e. a gift.

There is no God ... - Compare the marginal references; but in none of
them are the expressions quite so strong as here. Naaman seems
absolutely to renounce all belief in any other God but Yahweh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 5:16</span></span>

I will receive none - The prophets were in the habit of receiving
presents from those who consulted them [Sa1
9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007); [Kg1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003), but Elisha refused. It was
important that Naaman should not suppose that the prophets of the true
God acted from motives of self-interest, much less imagine that "the
gift of God might be purchased with money" [Act
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 5:17</span></span>

Two mules' burden of earth - This earth, Naaman thought, spread over a
portion of Syrian ground, would hallow and render it suitable for the
worship of Yahweh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 5:18</span></span>

Rimmon is known to us as a god only by this passage. The name is
connected with a root "to be high." Hadad-rimmon [Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011), the name of a place near
Megiddo, points to the identity of Rimmon with Hadad, who is known to
have been the Sun, the chief object of worship to the Syrians.

When he leaneth on mine hand - The practice of a monarch's "leaning on
the hand" of an attendant was not common in the East (compare the
marginal reference). It probably implied age or infirmity.

The Lord pardon thy servant in this thing - Naaman was not prepared to
offend his master, either by refusing to enter with him into the temple
of Rimmon, or by remaining erect when the king bowed down and worshipped
the god. His conscience seems to have told him that such conduct was not
right; but he trusted that it might be pardoned, and he appealed to the
prophet in the hope of obtaining from him an assurance to this effect.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 5:19</span></span>

So he departed ... - This clause should not be separated from the
succeeding verse. The meaning is, "So he departed from him, and had gone
a little way, when Gehazi bethought himself of what he would do, and
followed after him."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 5:20</span></span>

This Syrian - The words are emphatic. Gehazi persuades himself that it
is right to spoil a Syrian - that is, a Gentile, and an enemy of Israel.

As the Lord liveth - These words are here a profane oath. Gehazi,
anxious to make himself believe that he is acting in a proper, and,
even, in a religions spirit, does not scruple to introduce one of the
most solemn of religious phrases.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 5:21</span></span>

He lighted down from the chariot - This was an act of quite uncalled-for
courtesy. It indicates eagerness to honor the master in the person of
his servant.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 5:22</span></span>

From mount Ephraim - Bethel and Gilgal [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001), at both of which there were
"schools of the prophets," were situated on Mount Ephraim.

A talent of silver - A large demand in respect of the pretended
occasion; but small compared with the amount which Naaman had pressed on
the prophet [Kg2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#004). Gehazi had to
balance between his own avarice, on the one hand, and the fear of
raising suspicion on the other.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 5:23</span></span>

Be content - i. e. "consent."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 5:24</span></span>

The tower - Rather, "the hill," the well-known hill by Elisha's house.
The hill interrupted the view in the direction taken by Naaman, and
Gehazi dismissed Naaman's servants at this point lest they should be
seen from his master's residence.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 5:25</span></span>

Lest his absence should be noticed, Gehazi hastened, without being
called, to appear before his master. In the East it is usual for
servants to remain most of the day in their lord's presence, only
quitting it when given some order to execute.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 5:26</span></span>

Went not mine heart with thee? - i. e. "Was I not with thee in spirit -
did I not see the whole transaction, as if I had been present at it?" He
uses the verb "went," because Gehazi has just denied his "going."

Is it a time ... - i. e. "Was this a proper occasion to indulge greed,
when a Gentile was to be favorably impressed, and made to feel that the
faith of the Israelites was the only true religion? Was it not, on the
contrary, an occasion for the exhibition of the greatest unselfishness,
that so a pagan might be won to the truth?"

And oliveyards and vineyards ... - Gehazi's thoughts had probably run on
to the disposition which he would make of his wealth, and the prophet
here follows them, enumerating his servant's intended purchases.
