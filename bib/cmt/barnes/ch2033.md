Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 33:1</span></span>

Compare references and notes. The author of Chronicles differs chiefly
from Kings in additions (see the [Kg2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#017) note.md). The central part of this
chapter ([Ch2 33:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md) is almost
entirely new matter.

[2 Chronicles 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 33:7</span></span>

The idol - i. e. the Asherah ([Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007) note.md), which receives here (and
in [Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md), [Eze
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005).md) the somewhat unusual name of
semel, which some regard as a proper name, and compare with the Greek
Σεμέλη Semelē.

[2 Chronicles 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 33:11</span></span>

The Assyrian monuments contain no record of this expedition; but there
can be little doubt that it fell into the reign of Esarhaddon ([Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037) note.md), who reigned at least
thirteen years. Esarhaddon mentions Manasseh among his tributaries; and
he was the only king of Assyria who, from time to time, held his court
at Babylon.

Among the thorns - Translate - " with rings;" and see [Kg2
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 33:14</span></span>

Rather, "he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west of
Gihon-in-the-valley." The wall intended seems to have been that toward
the northeast, which ran from the vicinity of the modern Damascus gate
across the valley of Gihon, to the "fish-gate" at the northeast corner
of the "city of David."

We may gather from this verse that, late in his reign, Manasseh revolted
from the Assyrians, and made preparations to resist them if they should
attack him. Assyria began to decline in power about 647 B.C., and from
that time her outlying provinces would naturally begin to fall off.
Manasseh reigned until 642 B.C.

[2 Chronicles 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 33:17</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#002.md), note; [Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md), note.

[2 Chronicles 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 33:18</span></span>

The "prayer of Manasseh," preserved to us in some manuscripts of the
Septuagint, has no claim to be considered the genuine utterance of the
Jewish king. It is the composition of a Hellenistic Jew, well acquainted
with the Septuagint, writing at a time probably not much anterior to the
Christian era.

The words of the seers that spake to him - See [Kg2
21:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#011.md).

In the book of the kings of Israel - The writer of Chronicles usually
speaks of "the book of the kings of, Judah and Israel" (or "Israel and
Judah"). Here be designates the same compilation by a more compendious
title, without (apparently) any special reason for the change. Compare
[Ch2 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md).

[2 Chronicles 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 33:19</span></span>

The seers - Most moderns adopt the translation given in the margin of
the Authorized Version, making Hosai (or rather, Chozai) a proper name.
The point is a doubtful one.
