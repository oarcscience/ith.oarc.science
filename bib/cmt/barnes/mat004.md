### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit - Led up by the Spirit. Luke says
[Luk 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001.md) that Jesus was "full of the
Holy Spirit;" and it was by his influence, therefore, that he went into
the desert to be tempted. It was not done by presumption on the part of
Jesus, nor was it for a mere display of his power in resisting
temptation; but it was evidently that it might be seen that his holiness
was such that he could not be seduced from allegiance to God. When the
first Adam was created he was subjected to the temptation of the devil,
and he fell and involved the race in ruin: it was not improper that the
second Adam - the Redeemer of the race - should be subjected to
temptation, in order that it might be seen that there was no power that
could alienate him from God; that there was a kind and a degree of
holiness which no art or power could estrange from allegiance. Mark [Mar
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md) says that this occurred
"immediately" after his baptism; that is, in his case, as not
unfrequently happens, the great temptation followed immediately the
remarkable manifestation of the divine approbation and favor. In the
clearest manifestations of the divine favor to us we may not be far from
most powerful temptations, and then may be the time when it is necessary
to be most carefully on our guard.

Into the wilderness - See the notes at [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md).

To be tempted - The word "tempt," in the original, means to try, to
endeavor, to attempt to do a thing; then, to try the nature of a thing,
as metals by fire; then, to test moral qualities by trying them, to see
how they will endure; then, to endeavor to draw people away from virtue
by suggesting motives to evil. This is the meaning here, and this is now
the established sense of the word in the English language.

The devil - This word originally means an adversary, or an accuser;
then, any one opposed to us; then, an enemy of any kind. It is given in
the Scriptures, by way of eminence, to the leader of evil angels - a
being characterized as full of subtlety, envy, art, and hatred of
mankind. He is known, also, by the name Satan, [Job
1:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md); [Mat
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026.md); Beelzebub, [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md); the old Serpent, [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md); and the Prince of the power of
the air, [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md). The name is once
given to women [Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md); "Even so
must their wives be grave, not slanderers;" in the original, devils.

[Matthew 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 4:2</span></span>

Had fasted - Abstained from food.

Forty days and forty nights - It has been questioned by some whether
Christ abstained wholly from food, or only from the food to which he was
accustomed. Luke says [Luk 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#002.md) that he
ate nothing. This settles the question. Mark says [Mar
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#013.md) that angels came and ministered
unto him. At first view this would seem to imply that he did eat during
that time. But Mark does not mention the time when the angels performed
this office of kindness, and we are at liberty to suppose that he means
to say that it was done at the close of the 40 days; and the rather as
Matthew, after giving an account of the temptation, says the same thing
[Mat 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md). There are other instances of
persons fasting 40 days recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, Moses fasted
40 days, [Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md). Elijah also
fasted the same length of time, [Kg1
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md). In these cases they were no
doubt miraculously supported.

[Matthew 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 4:3</span></span>

The tempter - The devil, or Satan. See [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md).

If thou be the Son of God - If thou art God's own Son, then thou hast
power to work a miracle, and here is a suitable opportunity to try thy
power, and show that thou art sent from God.

Command that these stones ... - The stones that were lying around him in
the wilderness. No temptation could have been more plausible, or more
likely to succeed, than this. He had just been declared to be the Son of
God [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md), and here was an
opportunity to show that he was really so. The circumstances were such
as to make it appear plausible and proper to work this miracle. "Here
you are," was the language of Satan, "hungry, cast out, alone, needy,
poor, and yet the Son of God! If you have this power, how easy could you
satisfy your wants! How foolish is it, then, for the Son of God, having
all power, to be starving in this manner, when by a word he could show
his power and relieve his wants, and when in the thing itself there
could be nothing wrong!"

[Matthew 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 4:4</span></span>

But he answered and said ... - In reply to this artful temptation Christ
answered by a quotation from the Old Testament. The passage is found in
[Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md). In that place the discourse
is respecting manna. Moses says that the Lord humbled the people, and
fed them with manna, an unusual kind of food, that they might learn that
man did not live by bread only, but that there were other things to
support life, and that everything which God had commanded was proper for
this. The term "word," used in this place, means very often, in Hebrew,
thing, and clearly in this place has that meaning. Neither Moses nor our
Saviour had any reference to spiritual food, or to the doctrines
necessary to support the faith of believers; but they simply meant that
God could support life by other things than bread; that man was to live,
not by that only, but by every other thing which proceeded out of his
mouth; that is, which he chose to command people to eat. The substance
of his answer, then, is: "It is not so imperiously necessary that I
should have bread as to make a miracle proper to procure it. Life
depends on the will of God. He can support it in other ways as well as
by bread. He has created other things to be eaten, and man may live by
everything that his Maker has commanded." And from this temptation we
may learn:

1\. That Satan often takes advantage of our circumstances and wants to
tempt us. The poor, the hungry, and the naked he often tempts to repine
and complain, and to be dishonest in order to supply their necessities.

2\. Satan's temptations are often the strongest immediately after we
have been remarkably favored. Jesus had just been called the Son of God,
and Satan took this opportunity to try him. He often attempts to fill us
with pride and vain self-conceit when we have been favored with any
peace of mind, or any new view of God, and endeavors to urge us to do
something which may bring us low and lead us to sin.

3\. His temptations are plausible. They often seem to be only urging us
to do what is good and proper. They seem even to urge us to promote the
glory of God, and to honor him. We are not to think, therefore, that
because a thing may seem to be good in itself, that therefore it is to
be done. Some of the most powerful temptations of Satan occur when he
seems to be urging us to do what shall be for the glory of God.

4\. We are to meet the temptations of Satan, as the Saviour did, with
the plain and positive declarations of Scripture. We are to inquire
whether the thing is commanded, and whether, therefore, it is right to
do it, and not trust to our own feelings, or even our wishes, in the
matter.

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 4:5</span></span>

Then the devil taketh him up - This does not mean that he bore him
through the air; or that he compelled him to go against his will, or
that he performed a miracle in any way to place him there. There is no
evidence that Satan had power to do any of these things, and the word
translated taketh him Up does not imply any such thing. It means to
conduct one; to lead one; to attend or accompany one; or to induce one
to go. It is used in the following places in the same sense: [Num
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014); "And he (Balak.md) brought him
(Balaam) into the field of Zophim," etc. That is, he led him, or induced
him to go there. [Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md); "and after
six days Jesus taketh Peter, James," etc.; that is, led or conducted
them - not by any means implying that he bore them by force. [Mat
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md); "Jesus, going to Jerusalem,
took the twelve disciples apart," etc. See also [Mat
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md); [Mat
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md); [Mar
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040.md). From these passages, and many
more, it appears that all that is meant here is, that Satan conducted
Jesus, or accompanied him; but not that this was done against the will
of Jesus.

The holy city - Jerusalem, called holy because the temple was there, and
because it was the place of religious solemnities.

Setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple - It is not perfectly certain to
what part of the temple the sacred writer here refers. It has been
supposed by some that he means the roof. But Josephus says that the roof
was covered by spikes of gold, to prevent its being polluted by birds;
and such a place would have been very inconvenient to stand upon. Others
suppose that it was the top of the porch or entrance to the temple. But
it is more than probable that the porch leading to the temple was not as
high as the main building. It is more probable that he refers to that
part of the sacred edifice which was called Solomon's Porch. The temple
was built on the top of Mount Moriah. The temple itself, together with
the courts and porches, occupied a large space of ground. See the notes
at [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md). To secure a level spot
sufficiently large, it was necessary to put up a high wall on the east.
The temple was surrounded with porches or piazzas 50 feet broad and 75
feet high. The porch on the south side was, however, 67 feet broad and
150 high. From the top of this to the bottom of the valley below was
more than 700 feet, and Josephus says that one could scarcely look down
without dizziness. The word "pinnacle" does not quite express the force
of the original. It is a word given usually to birds, and denotes wings,
or anything in the form of wings, and was given to the roof of this
porch because it resembled a bird dropping its wings. It was on this
place, doubtless, that Christ was placed.

[Matthew 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 4:6</span></span>

And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down - The
temptation here was, that he should at once avail himself of the
protection of a promise of safety made to him, and thus demonstrate that
he was the Messiah. If he was the true Messiah he had a certain
assurance of protection, a promise that no harm could befall him; and
thus, by so surprising a miracle, and such a clear proof of the divine
interposition, he could at once establish his claim to the Messiahship.
How much more easy would this be than to engage in a slow work of years
to establish that claim; to encounter fatigue, and want, and poverty,
and persecution, before that claim would be admitted! And where could be
a more suitable place for thus at once demonstrating that he was the Son
of God, than on this pinnacle of the temple, in the very midst of
Jerusalem, and perhaps in the presence of thousands who would see the
wonderful performance? The temptation, therefore, in this case was, that
by thus establishing his claim he would avoid all the obloquy,
persecution, and suffering which he must otherwise endure if he
attempted to prove that he was the Son of God by a life of toil and
privation.

It is written - That is, there is a passage of Scripture which promises
special protection in such a case, and on which you may rely. The
argument was not, perhaps, that this applied exclusively to the Messiah,
but that, if applicable in any case, it would be in this; if any one
could plead this promise, assuredly he could who claimed to be the Son
of God.

He shall give his angels charge concerning thee ... - That is, they
shall protect thee.

And in their hands they shall bear thee up - They shall sustain thee, or
hold thee up, so that thou shalt not be endangered by the fall.

Lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone - This would be
especially appropriate in such a case. The promise, as Satan applied it,
was that he should not be injured by the stones lying at the bottom of
the wall or in the valley below. The case, therefore, seemed to be one
that was especially contemplated by the promise.

[Matthew 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 4:7</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, It is written again - Again the Saviour replied to
Satan by a text of Scripture - a passage which expressly forbade an act
like this.

Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God - This is quoted literally from
[Deu 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md). The meaning is, thou shalt
not try him; or, thou shalt not, by throwing thyself into voluntary and
uncommanded dangers, appeal to God for protection, or trifle with the
promises made to those who are thrown into danger by his providence. It
is true, indeed, that God aids those of his people who are placed by him
in trial or danger; but it is not true that the promise was meant to
extend to those who wantonly provoke him and trifle with the promised
help. Thus, Satan, artfully using and perverting Scripture, was met and
repelled by Scripture rightly applied.

[Matthew 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 4:8</span></span>

An exceeding high mountain - It is not known what mountain this was. It
was probably some elevated place in the vicinity of Jerusalem, from the
top of which could be seen no small part of the land of Palestine. The
Abbe Mariti speaks of a mountain on which he was, which answers to the
description here. "This part of the mountain," says he, "overlooks the
mountains of Arabia, the country of Gilead, the country of the Amorites,
the plains of Moab, the plains of Jericho, the River Jordan, and the
whole extent of the Dead Sea." So Moses, before he died, went up into
Mount Nebo, and from it God showed him "all the land of Gilead unto Dan,
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land
of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the
valley of Jericho, and the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar," [Deu
34:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md). This shows that there were
mountains from which no small part of the land of Canaan could be seen;
and we need not suppose that there was any miracle when they were shown
to the Saviour.

All the kingdoms of the world - It is not probable that anything more is
intended here than the kingdoms of Palestine, or of the land of Canaan,
and those in the immediate vicinity. Judea was divided into three parts,
and those parts were called kingdoms; and the sons of Herod, who
presided over them, were called kings. The term "world" is often used in
this limited sense to denote a part or a large part of the world,
particularly the land of Canaan. See [Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md), where it means the land of
Judah; also [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md), and the note on
the place.

The glory of them - The riches, splendor, towns, cities, mountains,
etc., of this beautiful land,

[Matthew 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 4:9</span></span>

All these things ... - All these kingdoms. All these dominions Satan
claimed a right to bestow on whom he pleased, and with considerable
justice. They were excessively wicked; and with no small degree of
propriety, therefore, he asserted his claim to give them away. This
temptation had much plausibility. Satan regarded Jesus as the king of
the Jews. As the Messiah he supposed he had come to take possession of
all that country. He was poor, and unarmed, and without followers or
armies. Satan proposed to put him in possession of it at once, without
any difficulty, if he would acknowledge him as the proper lord and
disposer of that country; if he would trust to him rather than to God.

Worship me - See the notes at [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md). The word here seems to mean, to
acknowledge Satan as having a right to give these kingdoms to him; to
acknowledge his dependence on him rather than God; that is, really to
render religious homage. We may be surprised at his boldness. But he had
been twice foiled. He supposed it was an object dear to the heart of the
Messiah to obtain these kingdoms. He claimed a right over them; and he
seemed not to be asking too much, if he gave them to Jesus, that Jesus
should be willing to acknowledge the gift and express gratitude for it.
So plausible are Satan's temptations, even when they are blasphemous;
and so artfully does he present his allurements to the mind.

[Matthew 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 4:10</span></span>

Get thee hence - These temptations, and this one especially, the Saviour
met with a decided rebuke. This was a bolder attack than any which had
been made before. The other temptations had been founded on an appeal to
his necessities, and an offer of the protection of God in great danger;
in both cases plausible, and in neither a direct violation of the law of
God. Here was a higher attempt, a more decided and deadly thrust at the
piety of the Saviour. It was a proposition that the Son of God should
worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven
and earth; that he should bow down before the Prince of wickedness and
give him homage.

It is written - In [Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md). Satan
asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus
therefore drove him from his presence.

[Matthew 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 4:11</span></span>

Then the devil leaveth him - He left him for a time, [Luk
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013.md). He intended to return again to
the temptation, and, if possible, to seduce him yet from God. Compare
[Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md); [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md). See the notes at [Heb
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md).

The angels came and ministered - See the notes at [Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md). They came and supplied his wants
and comforted him. From this narrative we may learn:

\(a\) That no one is so holy as to be free from temptation, for even the
Son of God was sorely tempted.

\(b\) That when God permits a temptation or trial to come upon us, he
will, if we look to him, give us grace to resist and overcome it, [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md).

\(c\) We see the art of the tempter. His temptations are adapted to
times and circumstances. They are plausible. What could have been mere
plausible than his suggestions to Christ? They were applicable to his
circumstances. They had the appearance of much piety. They were backed
by passages of Scripture misapplied, but still most artfully presented.
Satan never comes boldly and tempts people to sin, telling them that
they are committing sin. Such a mode would defeat his design. It would
put people on their guard. He commences, therefore, artfully and
plausibly, and the real purpose does not appear until he has prepared
the mind for it. This is the way with all temptation. No wicked person
would at once tempt another to be profane, to be drunk, to be an
infidel, or to commit adultery. The principles are first corrupted. The
confidence is secured. The affections are won. And then the allurement
is little by little presented, until the victim falls. How everyone
should be on his guard at the very first appearance of evil, at the
first suggestion that may possibly lead to sin!

\(d\) One of the best ways of meeting temptation is by applying
Scripture. So our Saviour did, and they will always best succeed who
best wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md).

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

John was cast into prison - For an account of the imprisonment of John
see [Mat 14:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md).

He departed into Galilee - See [Mat
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md). The reasons why Jesus then went
into Galilee were probably:

1\. Because the attention of the people had been much excited by John's
preaching, and things seemed to be favorable for success in his own
ministry.

2\. It appeared desirable to have some one to second John in the work of
reformation.

3\. It was less dangerous for him to commence his labors there than near
Jerusalem. Judea was under the dominion of the scribes, and Pharisees,
and priests. They would naturally look with envy on any one who set
himself up for a public teacher, and who should attract much attention
there. It was important, therefore, that the work of Jesus should begin
in Galilee, and become somewhat established and known before he went to
Jerusalem.

[Matthew 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 4:13</span></span>

Leaving Nazareth - Because his townsmen cast him out, and rejected him.
See Luke 4:14-30.

Came and dwelt in Capernaum - This was a city on the northwest corner of
the Sea of Tiberias. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but is
repeatedly referred to in the Gospels. Though it was once a city of
renown, and the metropolis of all Galilee, the site it occupied is now
uncertain. When Mr. Fisk, an American missionary, traveled in Syria in
1823, he found 20 or 30 uninhabited Arab huts occupying what are
supposed to be the ruins of the once-celebrated city of Capernaum.

The exact site of this ancient city has been a question of much
interest, and is not supposed to be as yet fully settled; perhaps it is
not possible that it should be. Dr. Robinson (Biblical Researches, iii.
pp. 283, 284, 288-295) supposes that the site of the ancient city is a
place now called Khan Minyeh. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol.
ii. pp. 542-547) supposes that it was at a place now called Tell Hum.
This place is a short distance north of Khan Minyeh, or the site
supposed by Dr. Robinson to be Capernaum. It is at the northwest corner
of the Sea of Tiberias.

In this place and its neighborhood Jesus spent no small part of the
three years of his public ministry. It is hence called his own city,
[Mat 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md). Here he healed the
nobleman's son [Joh 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047.md); Peter's
wife's mother [Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md); the
centurion's servant [Mat 8:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005.md); and
the ruler's daughter [Mat 9:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md).

Upon the sea coast - The Sea of Tiberias.

In the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim - These were two tribes of the
children of Israel which were located in this part of the land of
Canaan, and constituted in the time of Christ a part of Galilee. Compare
[Gen 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md); [Jos
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md), [Jos
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032.md). The word "borders" here means
boundaries. Jesus came and lived in the boundaries or regions of Zabulon
and Naphthali.

[Matthew 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 4:14</span></span>

That it might be fulfilled ... - This place is recorded in [Isa
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md). Matthew has given the sense,
but not the very words of the prophet. For the meaning of the passage as
employed by Isaiah, see the notes at [Isa
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md).

By the way of the sea - Which is near to the sea, or in the vicinity of
the sea.

Beyond Jordan - This does not mean to the east of Jordan, as the phrase
sometimes denotes, but rather in the vicinity of the Jordan, or perhaps
in the vicinity of the sources of the Jordan. See [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md); [Deu
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049.md).

Galilee of the Gentiles - Galilee was divided into upper and lower
Galilee. Upper Galilee was called Galilee of the Gentiles, because it
was occupied chiefly by Gentiles. It was in the neighborhood of Tyre,
Sidon, etc. The word "Gentiles" includes in the Scriptures all who are
not Jews. It means the same as nations, or, as we should say, the pagan
nations.

[Mat 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md)

The people which sat in darkness - This is an expression denoting great
ignorance.

As in darkness or night we can see nothing, and know not where to go, so
those who are ignorant of God and their duty are said to be in darkness.
The instruction which removes this ignorance is called light. See [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md); [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md). As ignorance is often connected
with crime and vice, so darkness is sometimes used to denote sin, [Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005.md); [Eph

22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md).

Saw great light - That is, as the passage is employed by Matthew, the
light under the Messiah would spring up among them. In that region he
grew up, and in that region he preached a great part of his discourses
and performed a great part of his miracles.

The region and shadow of death - This is a forcible and beautiful image,
designed also to denote ignorance and sin. It is often used in the
Bible, and is very expressive. A "shadow" is caused by an object coming
between us and the sun. So the Hebrews imaged death as standing between
us and the sun, and casting a long, dark, and baleful shadow abroad on
the face of the nations, denoting their great ignorance, sin, and woe..
It denotes a dismal, gloomy, and dreadful shade, where death and sin
reign, like the chills, damps, and horrors of the dwelling-place of the
dead. See [Job 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); [Job
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md); [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md); [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md). See also the notes at [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md). These expressions denote that the
country of Galilee was especially dark. We know that the people were
proverbially ignorant and stupid. They were distinguished for a coarse,
outlandish manner of speech [Mar
14:70](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070.md), and are represented as having
been also distinguished by a general profligacy of morals and manners.
It shows the great compassion of the Saviour, that he went to preach to
such poor and despised sinners. Instead of seeking the rich and the
learned, he chose to minister to the needy, the ignorant, and the
contemned. His office is to enlighten the ignorant; his delight to guide
the wandering, and to raise up those that are in the shadow of death. In
doing this, Jesus set an example for all his followers. It is their duty
to seek out those who are sitting in the shadow of death, and to send
the gospel to them. No small part of the world is still lying in
wickedness - as wicked and wretched as was the land of Zabulon and
Naphthali in the time of Jesus. The Lord Jesus is able to enlighten them
also, and every Christian should regard it a privilege, as well as a
duty, to imitate his Saviour in this, and to be permitted to send to
them the light of life. See [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md).

Sea of Galilee - This was also called the Sea of Tiberias and the Lake
of Gennesareth, and also the Sea of Chinnereth, [Num
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md); [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md); [Jos
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md). Its form is an irregular oval,
with the large end to the north. It is about 14 miles in length, and
from 6 miles to 9 miles in width. It is about 600 feet lower than the
Mediterranean, and this great depression accounts for some of its
special phenomena. There is no part of Palestine, it is said, which can
be compared in beauty with the environs of this lake. Many populous
cities once stood on its shores, such as Tiberias, Bethsaida, Capernaum,
Chorazin, Hippo, etc. The shores are described by Josephus as a perfect
paradise, producing every luxury under heaven at all seasons of the
year, and its remarkable beauty is still noticed by the traveler. "Seen
from any point of the surrounding heights, it is a fine sheet of water a
burnished mirror set in a framework of surrounding hills and rugged
mountains, which rise and roll backward and upward to where hoary Hermon
hangs the picture on the blue vault of heaven." The lake is fed mainly
by the Jordan; but besides this there are several great fountains and
streams emptying into it during the rainy seasons, which pour an immense
amount of water into it, raising its level several feet above the
ordinary mark. See The Land and the Book (Thomson), vol. ii. p. 77.
Lieutenant Lynch reports its greatest ascertained depth at 165 feet. The
waters of the lake are sweet and pleasant to the taste, and clear. The
lake still abounds with fish, and gives employment, as it did in the
time of our Saviour, to those who live on its shores. It is, however,
stormy, probably due to the high hills by which it is surrounded.

Simon called Peter - The name "Peter" means a rock, and is the same as
"Cephas." See the [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md) note;

Straightway - Immediately - as all should do when the Lord Jesus calls
them.

Left their nets - Their nets were the means of their living, perhaps all
their property. By leaving them immediately, and following him, they
gave every evidence of sincerity. They showed, what we should, that they
were willing to forsake all for the sake of Jesus, and to follow him
wherever he should lead them. They went forth to persecution and death
for his sake; but also to the honor of saving souls from death, and
establishing a church that shall continue to the end of time. Little did
they know what awaited them when they left their unmended nets to rot on
the beach, and followed the unknown and unhonored Jesus of Nazareth. So
we know not what awaits us when we become his followers; but we should
cheerfully go when our Saviour calls, willing to commit all into his
hands - come honor or dishonor, sickness or health, riches or poverty,
life or death. Be it ours to do our duty at once, and to commit the
result to the great Redeemer who has called us. Compare [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033.md); [Mat
8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021.md); [Joh
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#021.md).

Follow him - This is an expression denoting that they became his
disciples, [Kg2 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#019.md).

And going on from thence - From the place where he had found Peter and
Andrew, [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

Saw two other brothers - They were men engaged in the same employment,
as it is probable that there were many such in the neighborhood of the
lake.

In a ship - A small vessel. In fact, it was little more, probably, than
a sail-boat.

Mending their nets - A very common employment when they were not
actually engaged in fishing.

[Matthew 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 4:22</span></span>

Left their father - This showed how willing they were to follow Jesus.
They showed us what we ought to do. If necessary, we should leave
father, and mother, and every friend, [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md). If they will go with us, and be
Christians, it is well; if not, yet they should not hinder us. We should
be the followers of Jesus. And, while in doing it we should treat our
friends kindly and tenderly, yet we ought at all hazards to obey God,
and do our duty to him. We may add that many, very many children, since
Sunday schools have commenced, have been the means of their parents'
conversion. Many children have spoken to their parents, or read the
Bible to them, or other books, and prayed for them, and God has blessed
them and converted them. Every child in a Sunday school ought to be a
Christian; and then should strive and pray that God would convert his
parents, and make them Christians too. We see here, too, what humble
instruments God makes use of to convert people. He chose fishermen to
convert the world. He chooses the foolish to confound the wise. And it
shows that religion is true, and is the power of God, when he makes use
of such instruments to change the hearts of people and save their souls.

All Galilee - See the notes at [Mat
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md).

Synagogues - Places of worship, or places where the people assembled
together to worship God. The origin of synagogues is involved in much
obscurity. The sacrifices of the Jews were appointed to be held in one
place, at Jerusalem. But there was nothing to forbid the other services
of religion to be performed at any other place. Accordingly, the praises
of God were sung in the schools of the prophets; and those who chose
were assembled by the prophets and seers on the Sabbath, and the new
moons, for religious worship, [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md); [Sa1
10:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md). The people would soon see the
necessity of providing convenient places for their services, to shelter
them from storms and from the heat, and this was probably the origin of
synagogues. At what time they were commenced is unknown. They are
mentioned by Josephus a considerable time before the coming of Christ;
and in his time they were multiplied, not only in Judea, but wherever
there were Jews. There were no less than 480 in Jerusalem alone before
it was taken by the Romans.

Synagogues were built in any place where ten men were found who were
willing to associate for the purpose, and were the regular customary
places of worship. In them the law, i. e. the Old Testament, divided
into suitable portions, was read, prayers were offered, and the
Scriptures were expounded. The law was so divided that the five books of
Moses, and portions of the prophets, could be read through each year.
The Scriptures. after being read, were expounded. This was done, either
by the officers of the synagogue, or by any person who might be invited
by the officiating minister. Our Saviour and the apostles were in the
habit of attending at those places continually, and of speaking to the
people, [Luk 4:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015.md); [Act
13:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014.md).

The synagogues were built in imitation of the temple, with a center
building, supported by pillars, and a court surrounding it. See the
notes at [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md). In the center
building, or chapel, was a place prepared for the reading of the law.
The law was kept in a chest, or ark, near to the pulpit. The uppermost
seats [Mat 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md) were those nearest to
the pulpit. The people sat around, facing the pulpit. When the law was
read, the officiating person rose; when it was expounded, he was seated.
Our Saviour imitated their example, and was commonly seated in
addressing the people, [Mat 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md); [Mat
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md).

Teaching - Instructing the people, or explaining the gospel.

The gospel of the kingdom - The good news respecting the kingdom he was
about to set up; or the good news respecting the coming of the Messiah
and the nature of his kingdom.

Preaching - See the notes at [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md).

All manner of sickness - All kinds of sickness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 4:24</span></span>

And his fame went throughout all Syria - It is not easy to fix the exact
bounds of Syria in the time of our Saviour. It was, perhaps, the general
name for the country lying between the Euphrates on the east, and the
Mediterranean on the west; and between Mount Taurus on the north, and
Arabia on the south. Through all this region his celebrity was spread by
his power of working miracles; and, as might be expected, the sick from
every quarter were brought to him, in the hope that he would give
relief.

Those possessed with devils - Much difficulty exists, and much has been
written respecting those in the New Testament said to be possessed with
the devil. It has been maintained by many that the sacred writers only
meant by this expression to denote those who were melancholy or
epileptic, or afflicted with some other grievous disease. This opinion
has been supported by arguments too long to be repeated here. On the
other hand, it has been supposed that the persons so described were
under the influence of evil spirits, who had complete possession of the
faculties, and who produced many symptoms of disease not unlike
melancholy, madness, and epilepsy. That such was the fact will appear
from the following considerations:

1\. Christ and the apostles spoke to them and of them as such; they
addressed them, and managed them, precisely as if they were so
possessed, leaving their hearers to infer beyond a doubt that such was
their real opinion.

2\. Those who were thus possessed spake, conversed, asked questions,
gave answers, and expressed their knowledge of Christ, and their fear of
him things that certainly could not be said of diseases, [Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md); [Luk
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md).

3\. The devils, or evil spirits, are represented as going out of the
persons possessed, and entering the bodies of others, [Mat
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032.md).

4\. Jesus spake to them, and asked their name, and they answered him. He
threatened them, commanded them to be silent, to depart, and not to
return, [Mar 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025.md); [Mar
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#008.md); [Mar
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025.md).

5\. Those possessed are said "to know Christ; to be acquainted with the
Son of God," [Luk 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034.md); [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md). This could not be said of
diseases.

6\. The early fathers of the Church interpreted these passages in the
same way. They derived their opinions probably from the apostles
themselves, and their opinions are a fair interpretation of the
apostles' sentiments.

7\. If it is denied that Christ believed in such possessions, it does
not appear why any other clearly-expressed sentiment of his may not in
the same way be disputed. There is, perhaps, no subject on which he
expressed himself more clearly, or acted more uniformly, or which he
left more clearly impressed on the minds of his disciples.

Nor is there any absurdity in the opinion that those persons were really
under the influence of devils. For:

1\. It is no more absurd to suppose that an angel, or many angels,
should have fallen and become wicked than that so many people should.

2\. It is no more absurd that Satan should have possession of the human
faculties, or inflict diseases, than that people should do it a thing
which is done every day. What is more common than for a wicked man to
corrupt the morals of others, or, by inducing them to become
intemperate, to produce a state of body and mind quite as bad as to be
possessed with the devil?

3\. We still see a multitude of cases that no man can prove not to be
produced by the presence of an evil spirit. Who would attempt to say
that some evil being may not have much to do in the case of madmen?

4\. It afforded an opportunity for Christ to show his power over the
enemies of himself and of man, and thus to evince himself qualified to
meet every enemy of the race, and triumphantly to redeem his people. He
came to destroy the power of Satan, [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md); [Rom
16:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

Those which were lunatic - This name is given to the disease from the
Latin name of the moon (Luna). It has the same origin in Greek. It was
given because it was formerly imagined that the patient was affected by
the increase or the decrease of the moon. The name is still retained,
although it is certain that the moon has no effect on the disease. The
disease is mentioned only in this place, and in [Mat
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#015.md). It was probably the
falling-sickness or epilepsy, the same as the disease mentioned [Mar
9:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018.md); [Luk
9:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039.md).

And those that had the palsy - Many infirmities were included under the
general name of palsy in the New Testament.

1\. The paralytic shock, affecting the whole body.

2\. The hemiplegy, affecting only one side of the body; the most
frequent form of the disease.

3\. The paraplegy, affecting all the system below the neck.

4\. The catalepsy. This is caused by a contraction of the muscles in the
whole or a part of the body, and is very dangerous. The effects are very
violent and fatal. For instance, if, when a person is struck, he happens
to have his hand extended, he is unable to draw it back; if not
extended, he is unable to stretch it out. It gradually becomes
diminished in size, and dried up in appearance. Hence, it was called the
withered hand, [Mat 12:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010.md).

5\. The cramp. This, in Eastern countries, is a fearful malady, and by
no means unfrequent. It originates from chills in the night. The limbs,
when seized by it, remain unmovable, and the person afflicted with it
resembles one undergoing a torture. This was probably the disease of the
servant of the centurion, [Mat 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006.md);
[Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md). Death follows from this
disease in a few days.

And he healed them - This was done evidently by miraculous power. A
miracle is an effect produced by divine power above, or opposed to, what
are regular effects of the laws of nature. It is not a violation of the
laws of nature, but is a suspension of their usual operation, for some
important purpose. For instance, the regular effect of death is that the
body returns to corruption. The ordinary laws of chemistry had been
suspended by the operation of life - a power superior to those laws, and
producing new combinations of matter in the animal or vegetable
organization. When life is extinct those laws act in their proper power,
and the body is decomposed; that is, the materials of which it is
composed, under chemical laws, return to their natural forms of gases
and earths. When one who claims to be from God suspends that regular
effect, and gives life to a dead body for some important purpose, it is
a miracle. Such an effect is clearly the result of divine power. No
other being but God can do it. When, therefore, Christ and the apostles
exercised this power, it was clear evidence that God approved of their
doctrines; that he had commissioned them; and that they were authorized
to declare his will. He would not give this attestation to a false
doctrine. Most or all of these diseases were incurable. When Christ
cured them by a word, it was the clearest of all proofs that he was sent
from heaven. This is one of the strong arguments for Christianity.

From Decapolis - Decapolis was the name of a region of country in the
bounds of the half-tribe of Manasseh, mainly on the east of Jordan. It
was so called because it included 10 cities - the meaning of the word
Decapolis in Greek. Geographers generally agree that Scythopolis was the
chief of these cities, and was the only one of them west of the Jordan;
that Hippo (Hippos), Gadara, Dion (or Dios), Pelea (or Pella), Gerasa
(or Gergesa), Philadelphia, and Raphana (or Raphanae), were seven of the
remaining nine, and the other two were either Kanatha and Capitolias, or
Damascus and Otopos. These cities were inhabited chiefly by foreigners
(Greeks) in the days of our Saviour, and not by Jews. Hence, the keeping
of swine by the Gergesenes [Mat
8:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030.md), which was forbidden by the
Jewish law.
