### [Isaiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 15:0</span></span>

Analysis of [Isa 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md) and [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md)

Section I - The Time of the Prophecy

This and the following chapter make one entire prophecy, and should not
have been divided. At what time it was delivered is unknown. The only
period which is designated is, that it was to be fulfilled in three
years from the time when it was uttered [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md). Lowth supposes that it was
delivered soon after the former, in the first years of the reign of
Hezekiah, and that it was fulfilled in the fourth year of his reign,
when Shalmanezer invaded the kingdom of Israel. He supposes that he
might have marched through Moab, and secured its strong places on his
way to Judea. Gesenius supposes that it was uttered by some contemporary
of Isaiah, or by some earlier prophet, without the epilogue [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md), as a general denunciation
against Moab; and that it was adopted by Isaiah and applied to the
Moabites during his own time. This he argues because of the repetition
of geographical names; the play upon those names; the roughness and
harshness of the expressions; and many favorite phrases which, he, says,
are foreign to 'the genuine Isaiah.' He supposes that it had its origin
in the national animosity which subsisted between the Jews and the
Moabites; and that it might have been composed on account of the tribute
which had been witcheld, 896 b.c.; or on account of the corruption of
the Moabites, 949 b.c.; or on the taking possession of the territory by
Reuben and Gad. But this is evidently conjectural.

It is fair to presume that it is a production of Isaiah himself, unless
it can be proved that he did not write it; and the argument from the
style, to prove that it was written by some other person than Isaiah,
does not seem to be sufficient. It may have been written by Isaiah at an
early period of his life, and subsequently incorporated into his
prophecies, and adapted by himself to a state of things existing in an
advanced period of his prophetic life (see the note at [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014).md). Compare, however, the
arguments of Gesenius in his Commentary, and in the "Bib. Rep.," vol.
vii. pp. 120, 121. It is certain that it was composed when the tribute
was witcheld from Judah which was due from the Moabites (see [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md).

Section II - History of Moab

The land of Moab, so called from Moab the son of Lot, by his oldest
daughter [Gen 19:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031.md), was situated
on the east side of the river Jordan, and adjacent to the Dead Sea, and
on both sides of the river Arnon, although, strictly and properly
speaking, the river Arnon was regarded as its northern boundary. Its
capital city was on the river Arnon. The first residence of Lot, after
fleeing from Sodom, was "Zoar" [Gen
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030.md), on the southeast of the Dead
Sea; from thence he removed into the mountainous region where his two
sons were born [Gen 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030.md). The country
was originally occupied by race of giants called "Emim" [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), whom the Moabites conquered and
expelled. A considerable part of this country was subsequently conquered
by Sihon, king of the Amorites, who made the Arnon the boundary of the
land of Moab, and Heshbon his capital ([Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md); compare [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md); [Jdg
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#018).md).

The Israelites passed by theft land in journeying to Canaan, without
distressing or embarrassing them; because God had said that he had given
'Ar to the children of Lot for a possession' [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md). But the adjacent region in the
possession of the Amorites, the Israelites took, after a signal victory,
and gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad [Num
21:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#031.md). Thus the territory of the
Jews, being bounded by the river Arnon, was adjacent to that of Moab. It
is evident, however, though the Arnon was the proper boundary of Moab,
yet that a considerable portion of country on the north of that river
was usually regarded as lying in the land of Moab, though strictly
within the limits of the territory formerly of the Amorites, and
subsequently of the tribes of Reuben and Gad. Thus mount Nebo is said to
be in the land of Moab [Deu 32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md);
[Deu 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md), though it was properly
within the limits of the Amorites. And thus many of the places in the
prophecy before us were on the north of that river, though specified as
in the country of Moab. It is probable that the boundary was never
regarded as permanently fixed, though the river Arnon was its natural
and usual limit.

There was always a great antipathy between the Jews and the Moabites,
and they were the natural and constant enemies of the Jewish nation. The
foundation of the enmity was laid far back in their history. Balaam
seduced the Israelites to sin by means of the daughters of Moab [Num
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md); and God ordered that this
people should not enter into the congregation of his people, or be
capable of office, to the tenth generation, because they had the
inhumanity to refuse the children of Israel a passage through their land
in their journey to Canaan [Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md).

Eglon, king of the Moabites, was the first who oppressed Israel after
the death of Joshua. Ehud killed him and subdued the Moabites [Jdg
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#021.md). Toward the end of this period,
however, peace and friendship were restored, mutual honors were
reciprocated, as the history of Ruth shows, and Moab appears to have
been a place of refuge for outcasts and emigrant Hebrews [Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md); [Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md); [Jer
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011.md); [Isa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003.md). David subdued Moab and Ammon,
and made them tributary [Sa2 8:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md);
[Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md). The right to levy this
tribute seems to have been transferred to Israel after the division of
the kingdom, for after the death of Ahab, they refused to pay the
customary tribute of 100,000 lambs and as many rams [Kg2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md); [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md); [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md). Soon after the death of Ahab
they began to revolt [Kg2 3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md). They
were subsequently engaged in wars with the Jews. Amos ([Amo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013) ff.md) denounced great calamities on
them, which they probably suffered under Uzziah and Jotham, kings of
Judah [Ch2 26:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md); [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005.md). Calmet supposes that they were
carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar beyond the Euphrates, as the prophets
had threatened [Jer 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md); [Jer
12:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#014.md); [Jer
25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md); [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md), [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md), [Jer
49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039.md); [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md); and that they were restored by
Cyrus to their land, as many other captive nations were. It is probable
that, in the latter times, they were subject to the Asmonean kings, and
finally to Herod the Great. (Robinson; Calmet.) It is remarkable that
Jeremiah has introduced much of this chapter into his prophecy in his
48th chapter.

Section III - Comparison of Isaiah With Jeremiah

In order to see the resemblance between the two prophecies, I insert
here a comparison of the corresponding parts, following the order of
Isaiah.

[Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md); [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037.md). "every head bald ..."

[Isa 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003.md); [Jer
48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038.md). "everyone shall howl ..."

[Isa 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md); [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md). "Heshbon shall cry ..."

[Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md); [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md); [Jer
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003.md), [Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md). "from Zoar to Horonaim ..."

[Isa 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md). "Nimrim shall be desolate."

[Isa 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md); [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md). "the riches ... is perished."

([Isa 15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md); [Isa
16:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001), are missing in Jeremiah..md)

[Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md). "the pride of Moab ..."

[Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md); [Jer
48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md). "shall howl ... and mourn ..."

[Isa 16:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md); [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md). "the weeping of Sibnah ..."

[Isa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010.md); [Jer
48:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033.md). "gladness is taken away ..."

[Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md); [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md). "my bowels shall sound ..."

Section IV - Moab After the Exile

After the exile, intimate connections took place between the Jews and
the Moabites by marriages ([Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)
ff; [Neh 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001).md). These marriages,
however, were dissolved by Ezra as being, in his view, contrary to the
law of Moses. In the time of the Maccabees little mention is made of
them (compare [Dan 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041).md); but
Josephus mentions them in the history of Alexander Jannaeus. Heshbon and
Nadaba, Lemba and Oronas, Gelithon and Zara, cities of Moab, are there
mentioned as being at that time in the possession of the Jews (Jos.
"Ant." xiii. 15. 4). After that, their name is lost under that of the
Arabians, as was also the case with Edom and Ammon. At the time of
Abulfeda, Moab proper, south of the river Arnon, bore the name of
Karrak, from the city of that name (compare the note at [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md); the territory north of the
Arnon, the name of Belka, which includes also the country of the
Amorites. Since that time the accounts of the country are exceedingly
meagre, and it is only until quite recently that the state of Moab has
attracted the attention of travelers.

It has been ranged and ravaged by the predatory tribes of Arabs, and,
through fear of them, few travelers have ventured to visit it. In
February and March, 1806, however, Mr. Seetsen, not without danger of
losing his life, undertook a tour from Damascus down to the south of the
Jordan and the Dead Sea, and thence to Jerusalem; and, in his journey,
threw much unexpected light on the prophecy before us, especially in
regard to the places mentioned here. He found a multitude of places, or
the ruins of places, still bearing the old names, and thus has set
bounds to the perfectly arbitrary designations of the old maps. In
September 1812, that distinguished German traveler, I. L. Burckhardt,
made the same tour from Damascus down to Karrak, from where he pursued
his journey over Wady Mousa, or Petra, and thence to Cairo in Egypt. In
1818, a company of intelligent English travelers (Bankes, Irby, Mangles,
and Legh), made a journey from Karrak to the land of the Edomites,
particularly to Petra, and thence back, on the other side of the Jordan,
to Tiberius. In some respects they confirmed, and, in others, extended
the accounts of Seetsen (see Gesenius' "Commentary"). In the notes at
these chapters, I have endeavored to embody the principal information
found in these writers on the topography of Moab.

Section V - Analysis of This Prophecy

'The prophecy,' says Prof. Stuart ("Bib. Rep." vii. 110), 'is a piece
replete with vivid description, with animated and impassioned thought,
with poetic diction, and with scenes which are adapted to make a deep
impression on the mind of the reader.' The prophecy in the two chapters
contains the following parts:

I. The capitals of Moab are destroyed suddenly in one night [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md).

II\. In the midst of the consternation, the people hasten to the high
places, and to the altars and temples of the gods, to implore
protection. They are seen in the streets with sackcloth, and on the tops
of the houses, crying out with loud lamentations, and every expression
of sorrow and despair [Isa 15:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md).

III\. Some of the fugitives flee to Zoar for protection, and others to
Luhith and Horonaim, hastening to countries beyond their own borders,
because everything in their own land was withered and dried up [Isa
15:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md).

IV\. Consternation and desolation are spread throughout the land, and
even the streams are full of blood, and wild beasts are seen coming up
upon the land [Isa 15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md).

V. The prophet pities them, weeps with them [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md); [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md) :11, and advises them to seek the
favor of Judah by sending to them the customary tribute which was due,
and which had been for a long time witcheld [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md).

VI\. Some of the fugitives are seen at the fords of Arnon endeavoring to
escape to Judea, and making supplication for reception, and imploring
blessings on the land [Isa 16:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002.md). But
see the notes at [Isa 16:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002.md), for
another view of the design of this passage. The view here given is that
suggested by Gesenius and Prof, Stuart.

VII\. They are repulsed, and the answer to their supplication is given
in such a tone as to show the deep sense of the injury received from
Moab which the Jewish people entertained [Isa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md).

VIII\. The prophet then proceeds in his description of the utter wasting
of the country of Moab - desolation which excited the deepest feelings
in his heart, and so great as to move his most tender compassion [Isa
16:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md).

IX\. Then follows a limitation of the time when all this would take
place. Within three years all this would be fulfilled [Isa
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#013.md).

[Isaiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 15:1</span></span>

The burden of Moab - (see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md). This is the title of the
prophecy. The Chaldee renders this, 'The burden of the cup of
malediction which is to come upon Moab.'

Because in the night - The fact that this was to be done in the night
denotes the suddenness with which the calamity would come upon them.
Thus the expression is used in Job to denote the suddenness and surprise
with which calamities come:

Terrors take hold on him as waters,

A tempest stealeth him away in the night.

[Job 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020.md)

So a thief is represented as coming in the night - in a sudden and
unexpected manner [Job 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014.md) :

The murderer in the night is as a thief.

See also [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md); [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md).

Ar of Moab - This was the capital of Moab. it was situated on the south
of the river Arnon. It was sometimes called "Rabbath Moab." Isaiah [Isa
16:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007.md) calls it the city 'with walls
of burnt brick.' Under the name of Areopolis it occurs in Eusebius and
Stephen of Byzantium, and in the acts of many Synods of the fifth and
sixth centuries, when it was the seat of a bishop (Reland's "Palestine,"
pp. 577, 578). Abulfeda says that in his time it was a small town.
Jerome says that the city was destroyed by an earthquake when he was
young, probably about 315 a.d. Burckhardt found a place called Rabba
about twenty miles south of the river Arnon, which he supposed to be the
ancient Ar. Seetsen found there ruins of considerable compass;
especially the ruins of an old palace or temple, of which portions of
the wall and some pillars are still standing. Legh says, 'There are no
traces of fortifications to be seen; but, upon an eminence, were a
dilapidated Roman temple and some tanks.'

Is laid waste - That is, is about to be laid waste. This passed before
the mind of Isaiah in a vision, and he represents it as it appeared to
him, as already a scene of desolation.

And brought to silence - Margin, 'Cut off.' The word may mean either.
The sense is, that the city was to be destroyed, for so the word דמה
dâmâh often means [Hos 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md); [Hos
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md); [Jer
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002.md); [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md); [Zep
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#011.md).

Kir of Moab - Probably this city was the modern Kerek or Karak. The
Chaldee renders it by the name כרכא kerakā', or 'fortress,' hence, the
name Kerek or Karak. According to Burckhardt, it lies about three hours,
and according to Abulfeda twelve Arabic miles, south of Ar Moab, upon a
very high and steep rocky hill, from which the prospect extends even to
Jerusalem, and which, formed by nature for a fortress, overlooks the
whole surrounding country. In the wars of the Maccabees (2 Macc. 12:17)
it is mentioned under the name of Κάρακα Karaka, and it is now known by
the name of "Kerek" or "Karak." In the time of the crusades, a pagan
prince built there under king Fulco (in the year 1131) a very important
castle, which was very serviceable to the Franks, and in 1183 it held
out successfully against a formidable siege of a month by Saladin.
Abulfeda speaks of it as so strong a fortress that one must abandon even
the wish to take it. It has been visited in modern times by Seetsen,
Burckhardt, and the company of English travelers referred to above. The
place has still a castle, into which the whole surrounding country
brings its grain for safe keeping. The small and poor town is built upon
the remains of once important edifices, and is inhabited by Moslems and
Christians. It is the seat of a bishop, though the bishop resides at
Jerusalem (see Gesenius, "Commentary in loc.")

[Isaiah 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 15:2</span></span>

He is gone up - That is, the inhabitants of Moab in consternation have
fled from their ruined cities, and have gone up to other places to weep.

To Bajith, and to Dibon - Lowth supposes that these two words should be
joined together, and that one place is denoted. The Chaldee renders it,
'Ascend into the houses of Dibon.' Kimchi supposes that the word (בית
bayith) denotes a temple. It usually means "house," and hence, may mean
a temple of the gods; that is, the principal "house" in the land. This
interpretation is adopted by Gesenius and Noyes. Vitringa supposes it to
mean Beth-Meon [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md), or
Beth-Baal-Meon [Jos 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md), north of
the Arnon, now "Macin." I have adopted the translation proposed by
Kimchi as better expressing the sense in my view than that which makes
it a proper name. Dibon, perhaps the same place as Dimon in [Isa
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009.md), was a city given by Moses to
Gad, and afterward yielded to Reuben [Num
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md), [Num
32:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md); [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md). It was again occupied by the
Moabites [Jer 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md), [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md). Eusebius says it was a large
town on the north of the river Arnon. Seetsen found there ruins under
the name of Diban in a magnificent plain. Hence, "Dibon" is here
appropriately described as "going up" from a plain to weep; and the
passage may be rendered, 'Dibon is weeping upon the high places.'

To weep - Over the sudden desolation which has come upon the principal
cities.

Moab shall howl over Nebo - Nebo was one of the mountains on the east of
the Jordan. It was so high that from it an extended view could be taken
of the land of Canaan opposite. It was distinguished as being the place
where Moses died [Deu 32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md); [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md). The meaning of this is, that on
mount Nebo, Moab should lift up the voice of wailing. Jerome says that
the idol Chamos, the principal idol of Moab, was on mount Nebo, and that
this was the place of its worship. This mountain was near the northern
extremity of the Dead Sea. Mount Nebo was completely barren when
Burckhardt passed over it, and the site of the ancient city had not been
ascertained ("Travels in Syria," p. 370.) On its summit, says
Burckhardt, was a heap of stones overshadowed by a very large wild
pistacia tree. At a short distance below, to the southwest, is the
ruined place called Kereyat.

And over Medeba - This was a city east of the Jordan in the southern
part of the territory allotted to Reuben. It was taken from the
Reubenites by the Moabites. Burckhardt describes the ruins of this town,
which still bears the same name. He says of it, it is 'built upon a
round hill; but there is no river near it. It is at least half an hour
in circumference. I observed many remains of private houses, constructed
with blocks of silex; but not a single edifice is standing. There is a
large birket, tank, or cistern, which, as there is no spring at Medeba,
might be still of use to the Bedouins, were the surrounding ground
cleared of the rubbish to allow the water to flow into it; but such an
undertaking is far beyond the views of the wandering Arabic On the west
side of the town are the foundations of a temple built with large
stones, and apparently of great antiquity. A part of its eastern wall
remains, constructed in the same style as the castle wall at Ammon. At
the entrance to one of the courts stand two columns of the Doric order.
In the center of one of the courts is a large well.' ("Travels in
Syria," pp. 366, 367.)

On all their heads shall be baldness ... - To cut off the hair of the
head and the beard was expressive of great grief. It is well known that
the Orientals regard the beard with great sacredness and veneration, and
that they usually dress it with great care, Great grief was usually
expressed by striking external acts. Hence, they lifted up the voice in
wailing; they hired persons to howl over the dead; they rent their
garments; and for the same reason, in times of great calamity or grief,
they cut off the hair, and even the beard. Herodotus (ii. 36) speaks of
it as a custom among all nations, except the Egyptians, to cut off the
hair as a token of mourning. So also Homer says, that on the death of
Patroclus they cut off the hair as expressive of grief (Iliad, xxiii.
46, 47):

Next these a melancholy band appear,

Amidst lay dead Patroclus on a bier;

O'er all the course their scattered locks they threw.

Pope

See also "Odyss." iv. 197. This was also the custom with the Romans
(Ovid. "Amor." 3, 5, 12); the Egyptians (Diod. i. 84); the Scythians
(Herod. iv. 71); and the modern Cretans. The principle on which this is
done is, that thereby they are deprived of what is esteemed the most
beautiful ornament of the body; an idea which lies at the foundation of
mourning in all countries and ages. The loss of the beard, also, was the
highest calamity, and would be expressive of the deepest grief. 'It is,'
says D'Arvieux, who has devoted a chapter to the exposition of the
sentiments of the Arabs in regard to the beard, 'a greater mark of
infamy in Arabia to cut a man's beard off, than it is with us to whip a
fellow at the cart's tail, or to burn him in the hand. Many people in
that country would far rather die than incur that punishment. I saw an
Arab who had received a musket shot in the jaw, and who was determined
rather to perish than to allow the surgeon to cut his beard off to dress
his wound. His resolution was at length overcome; but not until the
wound was beginning to gangrene. he never allowed himself to be seen
while his beard was off; and when at last he got abroad, he went always
with his face covered with a black veil, that he might not be seen
without a beard; and this he did until his beard had grown again to a
considerable length.' ("Pic. Bib.," vol. ii. p. 100.) Burckhardt also
remarks, that the Arabs who have, from any cause, had the misfortune to
lose their beards invariably conceal themselves from view until their
beards are grown again (compare [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md); [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md); [Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005.md); [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016).md). The idea is, that the Moabites
would be greatly afflicted. Jeremiah has stated the same thing of Moab
[Jer 48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037.md) :

For every head shall be bald, and every beard be clipt;

And upon all hands shall be cuttings,

And upon the loins sackcloth.

[Isaiah 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 15:3</span></span>

In their streets - Publicly. Everywhere there shall be lamentation and
grief. Some shall go into the streets, and some on the tops of the
houses.

They shall gird themselves with sackcloth - The common token of
mourning; and also worn usually in times of humiliation and fasting. It
was one of the outward acts by which they expressed deep sorrow ([Gen
37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034.md); [Sa2
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md); [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md); [Kg2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001.md); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015.md); the note at [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024).md).

On the tops of the houses - The roofs of the houses in the East were,
and still are, made flat, and were places of resort for prayer, for
promenade, etc. The prophet here says, that all the usual places of
resort would be filled with weeping and mourning. In the streets, and on
the roofs of the houses, they would utter the voice of lamentation.

Shall howl - It is known that, in times of calamity in the East, it is
common to raise an unnatural and forced howl, or long-continued shriek.
Persons are often hired for this purpose [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md).

Weeping abundantly - Hebrew, 'Descending into weeping;' "that is,"
going, as we would say, "deep into it," or weeping much; immersed as it
were in tears (compare [Jer 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md);
[Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 15:4</span></span>

And Heshbon shall cry - This was a celebrated city of the Amorites,
twenty miles east of the Jordan [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md). It was formerly conquered from
the Moabiltes by Sihon, and became his capital, and was taken by the
Israelites a little before the death of Moses [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md). After the carrying away of the
ten tribes it was recovered by the Moabites. Jeremiah [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md) calls it 'the pride of Moab.' The
town still subsists under the same name, and is described by Burckhardt.
He says, it is situated on a hill, southwest from El Aal (Elealeh).
'Here are the ruins of an ancient town, together with the remains of
some edifices built with small stones; a few broken shafts of columns
are still standing, a number of deep wells cut in the rock, and a large
reservoir of water for the summer supply the inhabitants.' ("Travels in
Syria," p. 365.)

And Elealeh - This was a town of Reuben about a mile from Heshbon [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md). Burckhardt visited this place.
Its present name is El Aal. 'It stands on the summit of a hill, and
takes its name from its situation - Aal, meaning "the high." It commands
the whole plain, and the view from the top of the hill is very
extensive, comprehending the whole of the southern Belka. El Aal was
surrounded by a well built wall, of which some parts yet remain. Among
the ruins are a number of large cisterns, fragments of walls, and the
foundations of houses, but nothing worthy of notice. The plain around it
is alternately chalk and flint.' ("Travels in Syria," p. 365.)

Even unto Jahaz - This was a city east of Jordan, near to which Moses
defeated Sihon. It was given to Reuben [Deu
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#032.md), and was situated a short
distance north of Ar, the capital of Moab.

The armed soldiers of Moab - The consternation shall reach the very
army. They shall lose their courage, and instead of defending the
nation, they shall join in the general weeping and lamentation.

His life shall be grievous - As we say of a person who is overwhelmed
with calamities, that his life is wearisome, so, says the prophet, shall
it be with the whole nation of Moab.

[Isaiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 15:5</span></span>

My heart shall cry out for Moab - This is expressive of deep compassion;
and is proof that, in the view of the prophet, the calamities which were
coming upon it were exceedingly heavy. The same sentiment is expressed
more fully in [Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md); see also
[Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md) : 'My heart shall sound for
Moab like pipes.' The phrase denotes great inward pain and anguish in
view of the calamities of others; and is an expression of the fact that
we feel ourselves oppressed and borne down by sympathy on account of
their sufferings (see the note at [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003).md). It is worthy of remark, that
the Septuagint reads this as if it were '"his" heart' - referring to the
Moabites, 'the heart of Moab shall cry out.' So the Chaldee; and so
Lowth, Michaelis, and others read it. But there is no authority for this
change in the Hebrew text; nor is it needful. In the parallel place in
[Jer 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md), there is no doubt that the
heart of the prophet is intended; and here, the phrase is designed to
denote the deep compassion which a holy man of God would have, even when
predicting the ills that should come upon others. How much compassion,
how much deep and tender feeling should ministers of the gospel have
when they are describing the final ruin - the unutterable woes of
impenitent sinners under the awful wrath of God in the world of woe!

His fugitives - Margin, 'Or to the borders thereof, even as an heifer'
(בריחיה berı̂ychehā). Jerome and the Vulgate render this 'her "bars,"'
and it has been explained as meaning that the voice of the prophet,
lamenting the calamity of Moab, could be heard as far as the "bars," or
gates, of Zoar; or that the word "bars" means "princes, that is,"
protectors, a figure similar to "shields of the land" Ps. 47:10; [Hos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md). The Septuagint renders it, Ἐν
αὐτὴ en autē - 'The voice of Moab in her is heard to Zoar.' But the more
correct rendering is, undoubtedly, that of our translation, referring to
the fugitives who should attempt to make their escape from Moab when the
calamities should come upon her.

Unto Zoar - Zoar was a small town in the southern extremity of the Dead
Sea, to which Lot fled when Sodom was overthrown [Gen
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#023.md). Abulfeda writes the name
Zoghar, and speaks of it as existing in his day. The city of Zoar was
near to Sodom, so as to be exposed to the danger of being overthrown in
the same manner that Sodom was, Zoar being exempted from destruction by
the angel at the solicitation of Lot [Gen
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md). That the town lay on the east
side of the Dead Sea, is apparent from several considerations. Lot
ascended from it to the mountain where his daughters bore each of them a
son, who became the ancestors of the Moabites and the Ammonites. But
these nations both dwelt on the east side of the Dead Sea. Further,
Josephus, speaking of this place, calls it Ζοάρων τῆς Ἀραβίας Zoarōn tēs
Arabias - 'Zoar of Arabia' (Bell. Jud. iv. 8, 4). But the Arabia of
Josephus was on the east of the Dead Sea. So the crusaders, in the
expedition of King Baldwin, 1100 a.d., after marching from Hebron,
proceeded around the lake, and came, at length, to a place called
"Segor," doubtless the Zoghar of Abulfeda. The probability, therefore,
is, that it was near the southern end of the sea, but on the eastern
side. The exact place is now unknown. In the time of Eusebius and
Jerome, it is described as having many inhabitants, and a Roman
garrison. In the time of the crusaders, it is mentioned as a place
pleasantly situated, with many palm trees. But the palm trees have
disappeared, and the site of the city can be only a matter of conjecture
(see Robinson's "Bib. Researches," vol. ii. pp. 648-651).

An heifer of three years old - That is, their fugitives flying unto Zoar
shall lift up the voice like an heifer, for so Jeremiah in the parallel
place explains it [Jer 48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md). Many
interpreters have referred this, however, to Zoar as an appellation of
that city, denoting its flourishing condition. Bochart refers it to
Isaiah, and supposes that he designed to say that "he" lifted his voice
as an heifer. But the more obvious interpretation is that given above,
and is that which occurs in Jeremiah. The expression, however, is a very
obscure one. See the various senses which it may bear, examined in
Rosenmuller and Gesenius in loc. Gesenius renders it, 'To Eglath the
third;' and supposes, in accordance with many interpreters, that it
denotes a place called "Eglath," called the third in distinction from
two other places of the same name; though he suggests that the common
explanation, that it refers to a heifer of the age of three years, may
be defended. In the third year, says he, the heifer was most vigorous,
and hence, was used for an offering [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md). Until that age she was
accustomed to go unbroken, and bore no yoke (Pliny, 8, 4, 5). If this
refers to Moab, therefore, it may mean that hitherto it was vigorous,
unsubdued, and active; but that now, like the heifer, it was to be
broken and brought under the yoke by chastisement. The expression is a
very difficult one, and it is impossible, perhaps, to determine what is
the true sense.

By the mounting up of Luhith - The "ascent" of Luhith. It is evident,
from [Jer 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md), that it was a
mountain, but where, is not clearly ascertained. Eusebius supposes it
was a place between Areopolis and Zoar (see Reland's "Palestine," pp.
577-579). The whole region there is mountainous.

In the way of Horonaim - This was, doubtless, a town of Moab, but where
it was situated is uncertain. The word means "two holes." The region
abounds to this day with caves, which are used for dwellings (Seetzen).
The place lay, probably, on a declivity from which one descended from
Luhith.

A cry of destruction - Hebrew, 'Breaking.' A cry "appropriate" to the
great calamity that should come upon Moab.

[Isaiah 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 15:6</span></span>

For the waters of Nimrim - It is supposed by some that the prophet here
states the cause why the Moabites would flee to the cities of the south,
to wit, that the "waters" of the northern cities would fail, and the
country become desolate, and that they would seek support in the south.
But it is more probable that he is simply continuing the description of
the desolation that would come upon Moab. Nimrah, or Beth Nimra, meaning
a "house of limpid waters," was a city of Reuben east of the Dead Sea
([Num 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003.md); compare [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034).md). It was, doubtless, a city
celebrated for its pure fountains and springs of water. Here Seetzen's
chart shows a brook flowing into the Jordan called "Nahr Nimrim, or Wady
Shoaib." 'On the east of the Jordan over against Jericho, there is now a
stream called Nimlim - doubtless the ancient Nimrim. This flows into the
Jordan, and as it flows along gives fertility to that part of the
country of Moab.' (Eli Smith.) It is possible that the waters failed by
a common practice in times of war when an enemy destroyed the fountains
of a country by diverting their waters, or by casting into them stones,
trees, etc. This destructive measure of war occurs, with reference to
Moab, in [Kg2 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md), when the
Israelites, during an incursion into Moab, felled the fruit trees, cast
stones into the plowed grounds, and "closed the fountains, or wells."

For the hay is withered away - The waters are dried up, and the land
yields nothing to support life.

[Isaiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 15:7</span></span>

Therefore, the abundance they have gotten - Their wealth they shall
remove from a place that is utterly burned up with drought, where the
waters and the grass fail, to another place where they may find water.

To the brook of willows - Margin, 'The valley of the Arabians.' The
Septuagint renders it, 'I will lead them to the valley of the Arabians,
and they shall take it.' So Saadias. It might, perhaps, be called the
valley of the Arabians, because it was the boundary line between them
and Arabia on the south. Lowth renders it, 'To Babylon.' The probability
is, that the prophet refers to some valley or brook that was called the
brook of the willows, from the fact that many willows grew upon its
bank. Perhaps it was the small stream which flows into the southern
extremity of the Dead Sea, and which forms the boundary of Arabia Petrea
of the province of Jebal. They withdrew toward the south, where toward
Petra or Sela they had their property in herds [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), for probably the invader came
from the north, and drove them in this direction. Lowth, and most
commentators, suppose that 'they' in this verse refers to the enemies of
Moab, and that it means that they would carry away the property of Moab
to some distant place. But the more probable meaning is, that when the
waters of the Nimrim should fail, they would remove to a place better
watered; that is, they would leave their former abode, and wander away.
It is an image of the desolation that was coming upon the land.

[Isaiah 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 15:8</span></span>

For the cry is gone round about ... - The cry of distress and calamity
has encompassed the whole land of Moab. There is no part of the land
which is not filled with lamentation and distress.

The howling - The voice of wailing on account of the distress.

Unto Eglaim - This was a city of Moab east of the Dead Sea, which,
Eusebius says, was eight miles south of Ar, and hence, says Rosenmuller,
it was not far from the south border of Moab. It is mentioned by
Josephus ("Ant." xiv. 1), as one of the twelve cities in that region
which was overthrown by Alexander the Great.

Unto Beer-elim - literally, "the well of the princes." Perhaps the same
as that mentioned in [Num 21:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014.md), as
being in the land of Moab, and near to Ar:

The princes digged the well,

The nobles of the people digged it.

[Isaiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 15:9</span></span>

For the waters of Dimon - Probably the same as "Dibon" [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md). Eusobius says it was a large
town on the northern bank of the river Arnon. Jerome says that the
letters "m and b" are often interchanged in oriental dialects (see the
note at [Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md).

Shall be full of blood - That is, the number of the slain of Moab shall
be so great, that the blood shall color the waters of the river - a very
common occurrence in times of great slaughter. Perhaps by the "waters"
of Dimon the prophet does not mean the river Arnon, but the small
rivulets or streams that might flow into it near to the city of Dibon.
Probably there were winter brooks there, which do not run at all
seasons. The Chaldee renders it, 'The waters of Dimon shall be full of
blood, because I will place upon Dimon an assembly of armies.'

For I will bring more upon Dimon - Hebrew, 'I will bring additions;'
that is, I will bring upon it additional calamities. Jerome says, that
by those additional calamities, the prophet refers to the "lions" which
are immediately after mentioned. "Lions upon him that escapeth of Moab."
Wild beasts upon those who escaped from the slaughter, and who took
refuge in the wilderness, or on the mountains. The Chaldee renders it,
'A king shall ascend with an army, and shall destroy the remainder of
their land.' Aben Ezra interprets it of the king of Assyria; and Jarchi
of Nebuchadnezzar, who is called a lion in [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md). Vitringa also supposes that
Nebnchadnezzar is meant. But it is more probable that the prophet refers
to wild beasts, which are often referred to in the Scriptures as objects
of dread, and as bringing calamities upon nations (see [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022.md); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003.md); [Kg2
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#025).md).

Upon the remnant of the land - Upon all those who escaped the desolation
of the war. The Septuagint and the Arabic render this, 'Upon the remnant
of Adama,' understanding the word rendered 'land' (ארמה 'ădâmâh), as the
name of a city. But it more probably means the land.
