### [Job Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#001.md)

[Job 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 6:2</span></span>

O that my grief were thoroughly weighed - The word rendered "grief" here
(כעשׂ ka‛aś) may mean either vexation, trouble, grief; [Ecc
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018.md); [Ecc
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md); or it may mean anger; [Deu
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019.md); [Eze
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028.md). It is rendered by the
Septuagint here, ὀργή orgē - anger; by Jerome, peccata - sins. The sense
of the whole passage may either be, that Job wished his anger or his
complaints to be laid in the balance with his calamity, to see if one
was more weighty than the other - meaning that he had not complained
unreasonably or unjustly (Rosenmuller); or that he wished that his
afflictions might be put into one scale and the sands of the sea into
another, and the one weighed against the other (Noyes); or simply, that
he desired that his sorrows should be accurately estimated. This latter
is, I think, the true sense of the passage. He supposed his friends had
not understood and appreciated his sufferings; that they were disposed
to blame him without understanding the extent of his sorrows, and he
desires that they would estimate them aright before they condemned him.
In particular, he seems to have supposed that Eliphaz had not done
justice to the depth of his sorrows in the remarks which he had just
made. The figure of weighing actions or sorrows, is not uncommon or
unnatural. It means to take an exact estimate of their amount. So we
speak of heavy calamities, of afflictions that crush us by their weight.
etc.

Laid in the balances - Margin, "lifted up." That is, raised up and put
in the scales, or put in the scales and then raised up - as is common in
weighing.

Together - יחד yachad. At the same time; that all my sorrows, griefs,
and woes, were piled on the scales, and then weighed. He supposed that
only a partial estimate had been formed of the extent of his calamities.

[Job 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 6:3</span></span>

Heavier than the sand of the sea - That is, they would be found to be
insupportable. Who could bear up the sands of the sea? So Job says of
his sorrows. A comparison somewhat similar is found in [Pro
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003.md).

Heavy is a stone, and weighty the sand of the Sea,

But a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.

My words are swallowed up - Margin, "I want words to express my grief."
This expresses the true sense - but not with the same poetic beauty. We
express the same idea when we say that we are choked with grief; we are
so overwhelmed with sorrow that we cannot speak. Any very deep emotion
prevents the power of utterance. So in [Psa
77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md) :

Thou holdest mine eyes waking:

I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

So the well-known expressions in Virgil,

Obstupui, steteruntque comae, et vox faucibus haesit.

There has been, however, considerable variety in the interpretation of
the word here rendered swallowed up - לוּע lûa‛. Gesenius supposes that
it means to speak rashly, to talk at random, and that the idea is, that
Job now admits that his remarks had been unguarded - "therefore were my
words rash." The same sense Castell gives to the Arabic word. Schultens
renders it, "therefore are my words tempestuous or fretful."
Rosenmuller, "my words exceed due moderation." Castellio, "my words
fail." Luther, "therefore it is vain that I speak." The Septuagint, "but
my words seem to be evil." Jerome, "my words are full of grief." In this
variety it is difficult to determine the meaning; but probably the old
interpretation is to be retained, by which the word is derived from לוּע
lûa‛, to absorb, to swallow up; compare [Pro
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025.md); [Oba
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md); [Job
39:30](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#030.md); [Pro
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#002.md). The word does not elsewhere
occur.

[Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 6:4</span></span>

For the arrows of the Almighty are within me - That is, it is not a
light affliction that I endure. I am wounded in a manner which could not
be caused by man - called to endure a severity of suffering which shows
that it proceeds from the Almighty. Thus called to suffer what man could
not cause, he maintains that it is right for him to complain, and that
the words which he employed were not an improper expression of the
extent of the grief.

The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit - Takes away my rigor, my
comfort, my life. He here compares his afflictions with being wounded
with poisoned arrows. Such arrows were not unfrequently used among the
ancients. The object was to secure certain death, even where the wound
caused by the arrow itself would not produce it. Poison was made so
concentrated, that the smallest quantity conveyed by the point of an
arrow would render death inevitable. This practice contributed much to
the barbarity of savage war. Thus, Virgil speaks of poisoned arrows:

Ungere tela manu, ferrumque armare veneno.

Aeneid ix. 773

And again, Aen x. 140:

Vulnera dirigere, et calamos armare veneno.

So Ovid, Lib. 1. de Ponto, Eleg. ii. of the Scythians:

Qui mortis saevo geminent ut vulnere causas,

Omnia vipereo spicula felle linunt.

Compare Justin, Lib. ii. c. 10. section 2; Grotius, de Jure Belli et
Pacis; and Virgil, En. xii. 857. In the Odyssey, i. 260ff we read of
Ulysses that he went to Ephyra, a city of Thessaly, to obtain from Ilus,
the son of Mermer, deadly poison, that he might smear it over the iron
point of his arrows. The pestilence which produced so great a
destruction in the Grecian camp is also said by Homer (Iliad i. 48) to
have been caused by arrows shot from the bow of Apollo. The phrase
"drinketh up the spirit" is very expressive. We speak now of the sword
thirsting for blood; but this language is more expressive and striking.
The figure is not uncommon in the poetry of the East and of the
ancients. In the poem of Zohair, the third of the Moallakat, or those
transcribed in golden letters, and suspended in the temple of Mecca, the
same image occurs. It is thus rendered by Sir William Jones:

Their javelins had no share in drinking the blood of Naufel.

A similar expression occurs in Sophocles in Trachinn, verse 1061, as
quoted by Schultens, when describing the pestilence in which Hercules
suffered:

ἐκ δὲ χλωρὸν αἵμα μου Πέπωκεν ἤδη -

ek de chlōron haima mou Pepōken ēdē -

This has been imitated by Cicero in Tusculan. Disp. ii. 8:

Haec me irretivit veste furiali inscium,

Quae lateri inhaerens morsu lacerat viscera,

Urgensque graviter, pulmonum haurit spiritus,

Jam decolorem sanguinem omnem exsorbuit.

So Lucan, Pharsa. ix. 741ff gives a similar description:

Ecce subit virus taciturn, carpitque medullas

Ignis edax calidaque iacendit viscera tabe.

Ebibit humorem circa vitalia fusum

Pestis, et in sicco linguan torrere palato Coepit.

Far more beautiful, however, than the expressions of any of the ancient
Classics - more tender, more delicate, more full of pathos - is the
description which the Christian poet Cowper gives of the arrow that
pierces the side of the sinner. It is the account of his own conversion:

I was a stricken deer that left the herd

Long since. With many an artery deep infix'd

My panting side was charged when I withdrew

To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.

There I was found by one, who had himself

Been hurt by the archers. In his side he bore,

And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.

Task, b. iii.

Of such wounding he did not complain. The arrow was extracted by the
tender hand of him who alone had power to do it. Had Job known of him;
had he been fully acquainted with the plan of mercy through him, and the
comfort which a wounded sinner may find there, we should not have heard
the bitter complaints which he uttered in his trials. Let us not judge
him with the severity which we may use of one who is afflicted and
complains under the full light of the gospel.

The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me - Those things
which God uses to excite terror. The word which is rendered "set in
array" (ערך ‛ârak) properly denotes the drawing up of a line for battle;
and the sense is here, that all these terrors seem to be drawn up in
battle array, as if on purpose to destroy him. No expression could more
strikingly describe the condition of an awakened sinner, though it is
not certain that Job used it precisely in this sense. The idea as he
used it is, that all that God commonly employed to produce alarm seemed
to be drawn up as in a line of battle against him.

[Job 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 6:5</span></span>

Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? - On the habits of the wild
ass, see the notes at [Job 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012.md). The
meaning of Job here is, that he did not complain without reason; and
this he illustrates by the fact that the wild animal that had a
plentiful supply of food would be gentle and calm, and that when its
bray was heard it was proof that it was suffering. So Job says that
there was a reason for his complaining. He was suffering; and perhaps he
means that his complaint was just as natural, and just as innocent, as
the braying of the ass for its food. He should have remembered however,
that he was endowed with reason, and that he was bound to evince a
different spirit from the brute creation.

Or loweth the ox over his fodder? - That is, the ox is satisfied and
uncomplaining when his needs are supplied. The fact that he lows is
proof that he is in distress, or there is a reason for it. So Job says
that his complaints were proof that he was in distress, and that there
was a reason for his language of complaint.

[Job 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 6:6</span></span>

Can that which is unsavoury - Which is insipid, or without taste.

Be eaten without salt - It is necessary to add salt in order to make it
either palatable or wholesome. The literal truth of this no one can
doubt, Insipid food cannot be relished, nor would it long sustain life.
"The Orientals eat their bread often with mere salt, without any other
addition except some dry and pounded summer-savory, which last is the
common method at Aleppo." Russell's Natural History of Aleppo, p. 27. It
should be remembered, also, that the bread of the Orientals is commonly
mere unleavened cakes; see Rosenmuller, Alte u. neue Morgenland, on [Gen
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006.md). The idea of Job in this adage or
proverb is, that there was a fitness and propriety in things. Certain
things went together, and were necessary companions. One cannot be
expected without the other; one is incomplete without the other. Insipid
food requires salt in order to make it palatable and nutritious, and so
it is proper that suffering and lamentation should be united.

There was a reason for his complaints, as there was for adding salt to
unsavory food. Much perplexity, however, has been felt in regard to this
whole passage; [Job 6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006.md). Some have
supposed that Job means to rebuke Eliphaz severely for his harangue on
the necessity of patience, which he characterizes as insipid,
impertinent, and disgusting to him; as being in fact as unpleasant to
his soul as the white of an egg was to the taste. Dr. Good explains it
as meaning, "Doth that which has nothing of seasoning, nothing of a
pungent or irritating power within it, produce pungency or irritation? I
too should be quiet and complain not, if I had nothing provocative or
acrimonious; but alas! the food I am doomed to partake of is the very
calamity which is most acute to my soul, that which I most loathe, and
which is most grievous or trying to my palate." But the real sense of
this first part of the verse is, I think, that which is expressed above
- that insipid food requires proper condiment, and that in his
sufferings there was a real ground for lamentation and complaint - as
there was for making use of salt in that which is unsavory. I see no
reason to think that he meant in this to reproach Eliphaz for an insipid
and unmeaning address.

Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? - Critics and commentators
have been greatly divided about the meaning of this. The Septuagint
renders it, εἰ δέ καί ἐστί γεῦμα ἐν ῥήμασι κενοῖς ei de kai esti geuma
en rēmasi kenois; is there any taste in vain words? Jerome (Vulgate),
"can anyone taste that which being tasted produces death?" The Targums
render it substantially as it is in our version. The Hebrew word
rendered "white" (ריר rı̂yr) means properly spittle; [Sa1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#013.md). If applied to an egg, it means
the white of it, as resembling spittle. The word rendered "egg" (חלמוּת
challâmûth) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. If it be regarded as
derived from חלם châlam, to sleep, or dream, it may denote somnolency or
dreams, and then fatuity, folly, or a foolish speech, as resembling
dreams; and many have supposed that Job meant to characterize the speech
of Eliphaz as of this description.

The word may mean, as it does in Syriac, a species of herb, the
"purslain" (Gesenius), proverbial for its insipidity among the Arabs,
Greeks, and Romans, but which was used as a salad; and the whole phrase
here may denote purslain-broth, and hence, an insipid discourse. This is
the interpretation of Gesenius. But the more common and more probable
explanation is that of our common version, denoting the white of an egg.
But what is the point of the remark as Job uses it? That it is a
proverbial expression, is apparent; but in what way Job meant to apply
it, is not so clear. The Jews say that he meant to apply it to the
speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull, without anything to
penetrate the heart or to enliven the fancy; a speech as disagreeable to
the mind as the white of an egg was insipid to the taste. Rosenmuller
supposes that he refers to his afflictions as being as unpleasant to
bear as the white of an egg was to the taste. It seems to me that the
sense of all the proverbs used here is about the same, and that they
mean, "there is a reason for everything which occurs. The ass brays and
the ox lows only when destitute of food. That which is insipid is
unpleasant, and the white of an egg is loathsome. So with my
afflictions. They produce loathing and disgust, My very food [Job
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#007.md) is disagreeable, and everything
seems tasteless as the most insipid food would. Hence the language which
I have used - language spoken not without reason, and expressive of this
state of the soul."

[Job 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 6:7</span></span>

The things that my soul refused to touch - That I refused to touch - the
word "soul" here being used to denote himself. The idea here is, that
those things which formerly were objects of loathing to him, had become
his painful and distressing food. The idea may be either that he was
reduced to the greatest pain and distress in partaking of his food,
since he loathed that which he was obliged to eat (compare notes, [Job
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#024).md), or more probably his calamity
is described under the image of loathsome food in accordance with the
Oriental usage, by which one is said to eat or taste anything; that is,
to experience it. His sorrows were as sickening to him as the articles
of food which he had mentioned were to the stomach. The Septuagint
renders it strangely, "For my wrath - μοῦ ἡ ὀργή mou hē orgē - cannot
cease. For I see my food offensive as the smell of a lion' - ὥσπερ ὀσμὴν
λέοντος hōsper osmēn leontos.

[Job 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 6:8</span></span>

Oh that I might have my request - To wit, death. This he desired as the
end of his sorrows, either that he might be freed from them, or that he
might be admitted to a happy world - or both.

Would grant me the thing that I long for - Margin, "My expectation."
That is, death. He expected it; he looked out for it; he was impatient
that the hour should come. This state of feeling is not uncommon - where
sorrows become so accumulated and intense that a man desires to die. It
is no evidence, however, of a preparation for death. The wicked are more
frequently in this state than the righteous. They are overwhelmed with
pain; they see no hope of deliverance from it and they impatiently wish
that the end had come. They are stupid about the future world, and
either suppose that the grave is the end of their being, or that in some
undefinable way they will be made happy hereafter. The righteous, on the
other hand, are willing to wait until God shall be pleased to release
them, feeling that He has some good purpose in all that they endure, and
that they do not suffer one pang too much. Such sometimes were Job's
feelings; but here, as in some other instances, no one can doubt that he
was betrayed into unjustifiable impatience under his sorrows, and that
he expressed an improper wish to die.

[Job 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 6:9</span></span>

Even that it would please God to destroy me - To put me to death, and to
release me from my sorrows; compare [Job
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md). The word rendered "destroy"
here (דכא dâkâ') means properly to break in pieces, to crush, to trample
under foot, to make small by bruising. Here the sense is, that Job
wished that God would crush him, so as to take his life. The Septuagint
renders it "wound" - τρωσάτω trōsatō. The Chaldee renders it, "Let God,
who has begun to make me poor, loose his hand and make me rich."

That he would let loose his hand - Job here represents the hand of God
as bound or confined. He wishes that that fettered hand were released,
and were so free in its inflictions that he might be permitted to die.

And cut me off - This expression, says Gesenius (Lexicon on the word בצע
betsa‛), is a metaphor derived from a weaver, who, when his web is
finished, cuts it off from the thrum by which it is fastened to the
loom; see the notes at [Isa 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012.md). The
sense is, that Job wished that God would wholly finish his work, and
that as he had begun to destroy him he would complete it.

[Job 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 6:10</span></span>

Then should I yet have comfort - Dr. Good renders this, "then would I
already take comfort." Noyes, "yet it should still be my consolation."
The literal sense is, "and there would be to me yet consolation;" or "my
consolation would yet be." That is, he would find comfort in the grave
(compare [Job 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013) ff.md), or in the
future world.

I would harden myself in sorrow - Dr. Good renders this, "and I will
leap for joy." In a similar way Noyes renders it, "I would exult." So
Schultens understands the expression. The Hebrew word rendered "I would
harden myself" (סלד sâlad) occurs nowhere else, and expositors have been
divided in regard to its meaning. According to Castell, it means to
strengthen, to confirm. The Chaldee (סלד) means to grow warm, to glow,
to burn. The Arabic word is applied to a horse, and means to beat the
earth with his feet, and then to leap, to exult, to spring up; and this
is the idea which Gesenius and others suppose is to be retained here -
an idea which certainly better suits the connection than the common one
of hardening himself in sorrow. The Septuagint renders it ἡλλόμήν
hēllomēn - "I would leap," or exult, although they have sadly missed the
sense in the other part of the verse. They render it, "Let but my city
be a grave, upon whose walls I will leap; I will not spare, for I have
not falsified the holy words of my God." The Chaldee renders it, "and I
will exult (ואבוע) when fury comes upon the wicked." The probable
meaning is, that Job would exult or rejoice, if be was permitted to die;
he would triumph even in the midst of his sorrow, if he might lie down
and expire.

Let him not spare - Let him not withhold or restrain those sufferings
which would sink me down to the grave.

For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One - I have openly and
boldly maintained a profession of attachment to the cause of God, and to
his truth. I have, in a public and solemn manner, professed attachment
to my Maker; I have not refused to acknowledge that I am his; I have not
been ashamed of him and his cause. How much consolation may be found in
such a reflection when we come to die! If there has been a consistent
profession of religion; if there has been no shrinking back from
attachment to God; if in all circles, high and low, rich and poor,
frivolous and serious, there has been an unwavering and steady, though
not ostentatious, attachment to the cause of God, it will give
unspeakable consolation and confidence when we come to die. If there has
been concealment, and shame, and shrinking back from a profession of
religion, there will be shame, and regret, and sorrow; compare [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md); [Act
20:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md).

[Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 6:11</span></span>

What is my strength, that I should hope? - Job had hitherto borne his
trials without apprehension that he would lose his constancy of hope, or
his confidence in God. He here seems to apprehend that his constancy
might fail, and he therefore wishes to die before he should be left to
dishonor God. He asks, therefore, what strength he had that he should
hope to be able to sustain his trials much longer.

And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? - Various
interpretations have been given of this passage. Some suppose it means,
"What is the limit of my strength? How long will it last?" Others, "What
end is there to be to my miseries?" Others, "How distant is mine end?
How long have I to live?" Noyes renders it, "And what is mine end that I
should be patient?" Rosenmuller supposes that the word "end" here means
the "end of his strength," or that he had not such fortitude as to be
certain that he could long bear his trials without complaining or
murmuring. The phrase rendered "prolong my life," probably means rather
"to lengthen the patience," or to hold out under accumulated sorrows.
The word rendered life נפשׁ nephesh often means soul, spirit, mind, as
well as life, and the sense is, that he could not hope, from any
strength that he had, to bear without complaining these trials until the
natural termination of his life; and hence, he wished God to grant his
request, and to destroy him. Feeling that his patience was sinking under
his calamities, be says that it would be better for him to die than be
left to dishonor his Maker. It is just the state of feeling which many a
sufferer has, that his trials are so great that nature will sink under
them, and that death would be a relief. Then is the time to look to God
for support and consolation.

[Job 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 6:12</span></span>

Is my strength the strength of stones? - That is, like a rampart or
fortification made of stones, or like a craggy rock that can endure
assaults made upon it. A rock will bear the beatings of the tempest, and
resist the floods, but how can frail man do it? The idea of Job is, that
he had no strength to bear up against these accumulated trials; that he
was afraid that he should be left to sink under them, and to complain of
God; and that his friends were not to wonder if his strength gave way,
and he uttered the language of complaint.

Or is my flesh of brass? - Margin, "brazen." The comparison used here is
not uncommon. So Cicero, Aca. Qu. iv. 31, says, Non enim est e saxo
sculptus, ant e robore dolatus homo; habet corpus, habet animum; movetur
mente, movetur sensibus: - "for man is not chiselled out of the rock,
nor cut from a tree; he has a body, he has a soul; he is actuated by
mind, he is swayed by senses." So Theocritus, in his description of
Amycus, Idyll. xxii. 47:

Στήθεα δ ̓ ἐσφαίρωτο πελώρια και πλατὺ νῶτον,

Σαρκὶ σιδαρείῃ σφυρήλακος οἷα κολασσός.

Stēthea d' esfairōto pelōria kai platu nōton,

Sarki sidareiē sfurēlakos hoia kolossos.

Round as to his vast breast and broad back, and with iron flesh, he is
as if a colossus formed with a hammer - So in Homer the expression
frequently occurs - σιδήρειον ἦτορ sidēreion ētor - an iron heart - to
denote courage. And so, according to Schultens, it has come to be a
proverb, οὐκ ἀπὸ δρυὸς, οὐκ ἀπο πέτρης ouk apo druos, ouk apo petrēs -
not from a tree, not from a rock. The meaning of Job is plain. He had
flesh like others. His muscles, and nerves, and sinews, could not bear a
constant force applied to them, as if they were made of brass or iron.
They must give way; and he apprehended that he would sink under these
sorrows, and be left to use language that might dishonor God. At all
events, he felt that these great sorrows justified the strong
expressions which he had already employed.

[Job 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 6:13</span></span>

Is not my help in me? - This would be better rendered in an affirmative
manner, or as an exclamation. The interrogative form of the previous
verses need not be continued in this. The sense is, "alas! there is no
help in me!" That is, "I have no strength; I must give up under these
sorrows in despair." So it is rendered by Jerome, Rosenmuller, Good,
Noyes, and others.

And is wisdom quite driven from me? - This, also, should be read as an
affirmation, "deliverance is driven from me." The word rendered wisdom
(תשׁיה tûshı̂yâh) means properly a setting upright; then help,
deliverance; and then purpose, enterprise; see the notes at [Job
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012.md). Here it means that all hope of
deliverance had fled, and that he was sinking in despair.

[Job 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 6:14</span></span>

To him that is afflicted - Margin, "melteth." The word here used (מס
mâs) is from מסס mâsas, to melt, flow down, waste away, and here means
one who pines away, or is consumed under calamities. The design of this
verse is, to reprove his friends for the little sympathy which they had
shown for him. He had looked for consolation in his trials, and he had a
right to expect it; but he says that he had met with just the opposite,
and that his calamity was aggravated by the fact that they had dealt
only in the language of severity.

Pity should be showed from his friend - Good renders this, "shame to the
man who despiseth his friend." A great variety of interpretations have
been proposed of the passage, but our translation has probably expressed
the true sense. If there is any place where kindness should be shown, it
is when a man is sinking under accumulated sorrows to the grave.

But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty - This may be either
understood as referring to the language which Job says they had used of
him - charging him with forsaking the fear of God, instead of consoling
him; or it may mean that they had forsaken the fear of God in
reproaching him, and in failing to comfort him; or it may mean that if
such kindness were not shown to a friend in trial, he would be left to
cast off the fear of God. This last interpretation is adopted by Noyes.
Good supposes that it is designed to be a severe reproach of Eliphaz,
for the course which he had pursued. It seems to me that this is
probably the correct interpretation, and that the particle ו (v) here is
used in an adversative sense, meaning that while it was an obvious
dictate of piety to show kindness to a friend, Eliphaz had forgotten
this obligation, and had indulged himself in a strain of remark which
could not have been prompted by true religion. This sentiment he
proceeds to illustrate by one of the most beautiful comparisons to be
found in any language.

[Job 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 6:15</span></span>

My brethren - To wit, the three friends who had come to condole with
him. He uses the language of brethren, to intimate what he had a right
to expect from them. It is common in all languages to give the name
brethren to friends.

Have dealt deceitfully - That is, I have been sadly disappointed. I
looked for the language of condolence and compassion; for something to
cheer my heart, and to uphold me in my trials - as weary and thirsty
travelers look for water and are sadly disappointed when they come to
the place where they expected to find it, and find the stream dried up.
The simile used here is exquisitely beautiful, considered as a mere
description of an actual occurrence in the deserts of Arabia. But its
chief beauty consists in its exact adaptation to the case before him,
and the point and pith of the reproof which it administers. "The
fullness, strength, and noise of these temporary streams in winter,
answer to the large professions made to Job in his prosperity by his
friends. The dryness of the waters at the approach of summer, resembles
the failure of their friendship in time of affliction." Scott, as quoted
by Noyes.

As a brook - That is, as a stream that is swelled by winter torrents,
and that is dry in summer. Such streams abound in Arabia, and in the
East generally. The torrents pour down from the hills in time of rain,
or when swelled by the melting of the ice; but in summer they are dry,
or their waters are lost in the sand. Even large streams are thus
absorbed. The river Barrady, which waters Damascus, after passing to a
short distance to the southeast of the city toward the Arabian deserts,
is lost in the sand, or evaporated by the heat of the sun. The idea here
is, that travelers in a caravan would approach the place where water had
been found before, but would find the fountain dried up, or the stream
lost in the sand; and when they looked for refreshment, they found only
disappointment. In Arabia there are not many rivers. In Yemen, indeed,
there are a few streams that flow the year round, and on the East the
Euphrates has been claimed as belonging to Arabia. But most of the
streams are winter torrents that become dry in summer, or rivulets that
are swelled by heavy rains.

An illustration of the verse before us occurs in Campbell's Travels in
Africa. "In desert parts of Africa it has afforded much joy to fall in
with a brook of water, especially when running in the direction of the
journey, expecting it would prove a valuable companion. Perhaps before
it accompanied us two miles it became invisible by sinking into the
sand; but two miles farther along it would reappear and raise hopes of
its continuance; but after running a few hundred yards, would sink
finally into the sand, no more again to rise." A comparison of a man who
deceives and disappoints one to such a Stream is common in Arabia, and
has given rise, according to Schultens, to many proverbs. Thus, they say
of a treacherous friend, "I put no trust in thy torrent;" and, "O
torrent, thy flowing subsides." So the Scholiast on Moallakat says, "a
pool or flood was called Gadyr, because travelers when they pass by it
find it full of water, but when they return they find nothing there, and
it seems to have treacherously betrayed them. So they say of a false
man, that he is more deceitful than the appearance of water" -
referring, perhaps, to the deceitful appearance of the mirage in the
sands of the desert; see the notes at [Isa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007.md).

And as the stream of brooks they pass away - As the valley stream - the
stream that runs along in the valley, that is filled by the mountain
torrent. They pass away on the return of summer, or when the rain ceases
to fall, and the valley is again dry. So with the consolations of false
friends. They cannot be depended on. All their professions are temporary
and evanescent.

[Job 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 6:16</span></span>

Which are blackish - Or, rather, which are turbid. The word used here
(קדרים qoderı̂ym) means to be turbid, foul, or muddy, spoken of a
torrent, and then to be of a dusky color, to be dark-colored, as e. g.
the skin scorched by the sun, [Job
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028.md); or to be dark - as when the sun
is obscured; [Joe 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md). Jerome renders it, Qui timent
pruinam - "which fear the frost, when the snow comes upon them." The
Septuagint renders it, "they who had venerated me now rushed upon me
like snow or hoar frost, which melting at the approach of heat, it was
not known whence it was." The expression in the Hebrew means that they
were rendered dark and turbid by the accumulated torrents caused by the
dissolving snow and ice.

By reason of the ice - When it melts and swells the streams.

And wherein the snow is hid - That is, says Noyes, melts and flows into
them. It refers to the melting of the snow in the spring, when the
streams are swelled as a consequence of it. Snow, by melting in the
spring and summer, would swell the streams, which at other times were
dry. Lucretius mentions the melting of the snows on the mountains of
Ethiopia, as one of the causes of the overflowing of the Nile:

Forsitan Aethiopum pentrue de montibus altis

Crescat, ubi in campos albas descendere ningues

Tahificiss subigit radiis sol, omnia lustrans.

vi\. 734.

Or, from the Ethiop-mountains, the bright sun,

Now full matured, with deep-dissolving ray,

May melt the agglomerate snows, and down the plains

Drive them, augmenting hence the incipient stream.

Good

A similar description occurs in Homer, Iliad xi. 492:

Ὡς δ ̓ ὁπόε πλήφων ποταμός πεδίνδε κάτεισι

Χειμάῤῥους κατ ̓ ὄρεσφιν, κ. τ. λ.

Hōs d' hopote plēthōn potamos pedionde kateisi

Cheimarrous kat' oresfin, etc.

And in Ovid also, Fast. ii. 219:

Ecce, velut torrens andis pluvialibus auctus,

Ant hive, quae, Zephyro victa, repente fluit,

Per sara, perque vias, tertur; nec, ut ante solebat,

Riparum clausas margine finit aquas.

[Job 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 6:17</span></span>

What time - In the time; or after a time.

They wax warm - Gesenius renders this word (יזרבו yezorebû) when they
became narrow, and this version has been adopted by Noyes. The word
occurs nowhere else. Taylor (Concord.) renders it, "to be dissolved by
the heat of the sun." Jerome, fuerint dissipati - "in the time in which
they are scattered." The Septuagint, τακεῖσα Θέρμης γενομένης takeisa
thermēs genomenēs - "melting at the approach of heat." The Chaldee, "In
the time in which the generation of the deluge sinned, they were
scattered." Castell says that the word זרב zârab in the Piel, as the
word in Chaldee (זרב zerab) means "to flow"; and also that it has the
same signification as צרב tsârab, to become warm. In Syriac the word
means to be straitened, bound, confined. On the whole, however, the
connection seems to require us to understand it as it is rendered in our
common translation, as meaning, that when they are exposed to the rays
of a burning sun, they evaporate. They pour down from the mountains in
torrents, but when they flow into burning sands, or become exposed to
the intense action of the sun, they are dried up, and disappear.

They vanish - Margin, "are cut off." That is, they wander off into the
sands of the desert until they are finally lost.

When it is hot - Margin, "in the heat thereof." When the summer comes,
or when the rays of the sun are poured down upon them.

They are consumed - Margin, "extinguished." They are dried up, and
furnish no water for the caravan.

[Job 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 6:18</span></span>

The paths of their way are turned aside - Noyes renders this, "The
caravans turn aside to them on their way." Good, "The outlets of their
channel wind about." Rosenmuller, "The bands of travelers direct their
journey to them." Jerome, "Involved are the paths of their steps."
According to the interpretation of Rosenmuller, Noyes, Umbreit, and
others, it means that the caravans on their journey turn aside from
their regular way in order to find water there; and that in doing it
they go up into a desert and perish. According to the other
interpretation, it means that the channels of the stream wind along
until they diminish and come to nothing. This latter I take to be the
true sense of the passage, as it is undoubtedly the most poetical. It is
a representation of the stream winding along in its channels, or making
new channels as it flows from the mountain, until it diminishes by
evaporation, and finally comes to nothing.

They go to nothing - Noyes renders this very singularly, "into the
desert," - meaning that the caravans, when they suppose they are going
to a place of refreshment, actually go to a desert, and thus perish. The
word used here, however תהוּ tôhû, does not occur in the sense of a
desert elsewhere in the Scriptures. It denotes nothingness, emptiness,
vanity (see [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md), and very
appropriately expresses the nothingness into which a stream vanishes
when it is dried up or lost in the sand. The sense is, that those
streams wander along until they become smaller and smaller, and then
wholly disappear. They deceive the traveler who hoped to find
refreshment there. Streams depending on snows and storms, and having no
permanent fountains, cannot be confided in. Pretended friends are like
them. In times of prosperity they are full of professions, and their aid
is proffered to us. But we go to them when we need their assistance,
when we are like the weary and thirsty traveler, and they disappear like
deceitful streams in the sands of the desert.

[Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 6:19</span></span>

The troops of Tema looked - That is, looked for the streams of water. On
the situation of Tema, see Notes, [Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md). This was the country of Eliphaz,
and the image would be well understood by him. The figure is one of
exquisite beauty. It means that the caravans from Tema, in journeying
through the desert, looked for those streams. They came with an
expectation of finding the means of allaying their thirst. When they
came there they were disappointed, for the waters had disappeared.
Reiske, however, renders this, "Their tracks (the branchings of the
flood) tend toward Tema;" - a translation which the Hebrew will bear,
but the usual version is more correct, and is more elegant.

The companies of Sheba waited for them - The "Sheba" here referred to
was probably in the southern part of Arabia; see the notes at [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md). The idea is, that the caravans
from that part of Arabia came and looked for a supply of water, and were
disappointed.

[Job 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 6:20</span></span>

They were confounded because they had hoped - The caravans of Tema and
Sheba. The word "confounded" here means ashamed. It represents the state
of feeling which one has who has met with disappointment. He is
perplexed, distressed, and ashamed that he had entertained so confident
hope; see the notes at [Isa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#005.md). They
were downcast and sad that the waters had failed, and they looked on one
another with confusion and dismay. There are few images more poetic than
this, and nothing that would more strikingly exhibit the disappointment
of Job, that he had looked for consolation from his friends, and had not
found it. He was down-cast, distressed, and disheartened, like the
travelers of Tema and of Sheba, because they had nothing to offer to
console him; because he had waited for them to sustain him in his
afflictions, and had been wholly disappointed.

[Job 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 6:21</span></span>

For now ye are as nothing - Margin, "or, Ye are like to it, or them." In
the margin also the word "nothing" is rendered "not." This variety
arises from a difference of reading in the Hebrew text, many MSS. having
instead of (לא lô'), not, (לו lô'), to him, or to it. Which is correct,
it is not easy to determine. Rosenmuller supposes that it is only a
variety in writing the word לא l', where the waw is often used for .א
The probability is, that it means, that they were as nothing - like the
stream that had disappeared. This is the point of the comparison; and
this Job now applies to his friends. They had promised much by their
coming - like the streams when swollen by rains and melted ice. But now
they were found to be nothing.

Ye see my casting down - חתת chăthath - my being broken or crushed; my
calamity. Vulgate, plugam. Septuagint, τραῦμα trauma, wound.

And are afraid - Are timid and fearful. You shrink back; you dare not
approach the subject boldly, or come to me with words of consolation.
You came with a professed intention to administer comfort, but your
courage fails.

[Job 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 6:22</span></span>

Did I say, Bring unto me? - Job proceeds to state that their conduct in
this had been greatly aggravated by the fact that they had come
voluntarily. He had not asked them to come. He had desired no gift; no
favor. He had not applied to them in any way or form for help. They had
come of their own accord, and when they came they uttered only the
language of severity and reproach. If he had asked them to aid him, the
case would have been different. That would have given them some excuse
for interposing in the case. But now the whole was gratuitous and
unasked. He did not desire their interference, and he implies by these
remarks that if they could say nothing that would console him, it would
have been kindness in them to have said nothing.

Or, Give a reward for me of your substance? - That is, did I ask a
present from you out of your property? I asked nothing. I have on no
occasion asked you to interpose and aid me.

[Job 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 6:23</span></span>

Or, Deliver me out of the enemy's hand? - At no time have I called on
you to rescue me from a foe.

Or, Redeem me? - That is, rescue me from the hand of robbers. The
meaning is, that he was in no way beholden to them; he had never called
on them for assistance; and there was therefore no claim which they
could now have to afflict him further by their reflections. There seems
to be something peevish in these remarks; and we need not attempt to
justify the spirit which dictated them.

[Job 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 6:24</span></span>

Teach me, and I will hold my tongue - That is, give me any real
instruction, or show me what is my duty, and I will be silent. By this
he means that Eliphaz had really imparted no instruction, but had dealt
only in the language of reproof. The sense is, "I would willingly sit
and listen where truth is imparted, and where I could be enabled to see
the reason of the divine dealings. If I could be made to understand
where I have erred, I would acquiesce."

[Job 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 6:25</span></span>

How forcible are right words! - How weighty and impressive are words of
truth! Job means that he was accustomed to feel their power, and to
admit it on his soul. If their words were such, he would listen to them
with profound attention, and in silence. The expression has a proverbial
cast.

But what doth your arguing reprove? - Or rather, what doth the reproof
from you reprove? or what do your reproaches prove? Job professes a
readiness to listen to words of truth and wisdom; he complains that the
language of reproach used by them was not adapted to instruct his
understanding or to benefit his heart. As it was, he did not feel
himself convinced, and was likely to derive no advantage from what they
said.

[Job 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 6:26</span></span>

Do ye imagine to reprove words? - A considerable variety of
interpretation has occurred in regard to this verse. Dr. Good, following
Schultens, supposes that the word translated wind here רוּח rûach means
sighs, or groans, and renders it,

Would ye then take up words for reproof,

The mere venting the means of despair?

But Rosenmuller has well remarked that the word never has this
signification. Noyes renders it,

Do ye mean to censure words?

The words of a man in despair are but wind.

In this, he has probably expressed the true sense. This explanation was
proposed by Ludov. de Dieu, and is adopted by Rosenmuller. According to
this, the sense is, "Do you think it reasonable to carp at mere words?
Will you pass over weighty and important arguments and facts, and dwell
upon the words merely that are extorted from a man in misery? Do you not
know that one in a state of despair utters many expressions which ought
not to be regarded as the result of his deliberate judgment? And will
you spend your time in dwelling on those words rather than on the main
argument involved?" This is probably the true sense of the verse; and if
so it is a complaint of Job that they were disposed to make him "an
offender for a word" rather than to enter into the real merits of the
case, and especially that they were not disposed to make allowances for
the hasty expressions of a man almost in despair.

[Job 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 6:27</span></span>

Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless - Job undoubtedly means that this
should be applied to himself. He complains that they took advantage of
his words, that they were disposed to pervert his meaning, and unkindly
distorted what he said. The word rendered" fatherless" יתום yâthôm
properly denotes an orphan; [Exo
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022.md); [Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md); [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md). But it is possible that it is
not to be taken in this limited signification here. The word is still
retained in the Arabic language - the language spoken in the country
where Job lived, - where the word יתום yâthôm means to be lonely,
bereaved, etc. It may be that this idea occurs under the form of the
word used here, that Job was lonely and bereaved; that he was as
desolate and helpless as a fatherless child; and especially that they
manifested a spirit like that of those who would oppress an orphan. The
word "overwhelm" תפילוּ tapı̂ylû means properly, "ye fall upon;" that is,
you deal with him violently. Or, it may mean here, in the Hiphil, "you
cause to fall upon," referring to a net, and meaning, that they sprung a
net for the orphan. So Rosenmuller and Noyes understand it. To do this
was, in Oriental countries, regarded as a crime of special enormity, and
is often so spoken of in the Bible; see the notes at [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md).

And ye dig a pit for your friend - You act toward your friend as hunters
do toward wild beasts. They dig a pit and cover it over with brushwood
to conceal it, and the hunted animal, deceived, falls into it unawares.
So you endeavor to entrap your friend. You lay a plan for it. You
conceal your design. You contrive to drive him into the pit that you
have made, and urge him on until you have caught him in the use of
unguarded language, or driven him to vent expressions that cover him
with confusion. Instead of throwing a mantle of charity over his
frailties and infirmities, you make the most of every word, take it out
of its proper connection, and attempt to overwhelm him in shame and
disgrace. On the method of hunting in ancient times, see the notes at
-[Job 18:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008.md).

[Job 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 6:28</span></span>

Now, therefore, be content - Rosenmuller has better rendered this, "if
it please you." The sense is, "if you are willing, look upon me." That
is, "if you are disposed, you may take a careful view of me. Look me in
the countenance. You can see for yourselves whether I am sincere or
false. I am willing that my whole demeanor should be subjected to the
utmost scrutiny."

For it is evident unto you if I lie - Margin, as in Hebrew before your
face. That is, "you yourselves can see by my whole demeanor, by my
sufferings, my patience, my manifest sincerity, that I am not playing
the hypocrite." Conscious of sincerity, he believed that if they would
look upon him, they would be convinced that he was a sincere and an
upright man.

[Job 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 6:29</span></span>

Return, I pray you - That is, return to the argument. Give your
attention to it again. Perhaps he may have discerned a disposition in
them to turn away from what he was saying, and to withdraw and leave
him. Job expresses his belief that he could convince them; and he
proposes more fully to state his views, if they would attend to him.

Let it not be iniquity - Let it not be considered as wrong thus to come
back to the argument. Or, let it not be assumed that my sentiments are
erroneous, and my heart evil. Job means, that it should not be taken for
granted that he was a hypocrite; that he was conscious of sincerity, and
that he was convinced that he could satisfy them of it if they would
lend a listening ear. A similar sentiment he expresses in [Job
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028.md) :

But ye should say, Why persecute we him?

Seeing the root of the matter is found in me.

My righteousness is in it - Margin, that is, this matter. The sense is,
"my complete vindication is in the argument which I propose to state. I
am prepared to show that I am innocent." On that account, he wishes them
to return and attend to what he proposed to say.

[Job 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 6:30</span></span>

Is there iniquity in my tongue? - This is a solemn appeal to their
consciences, and their own deep conviction that he was sincere. Iniquity
in the tongue means falsehood, deceit, hypocrisy - that which would be
expressed by the tongue.

Cannot my taste discern perverse things? - Margin, palate. The word used
here חך chêk means properly the palate, together with the corresponding
lower part of the mouth, the inside mouth. Gesenius. Hence, it means the
organ of taste, residing in the mouth. The meaning is, that Job was
qualified to discern what was true or false, sincere or hypocritical,
just or unjust, in the same manner as the palate is fitted to discern
the qualities of objects, whether bitter or sweet, pleasant or
unpleasant, wholesome or unwholesome. His object is to invite attention
to what he had to state on the subject. To this proposed vindication he
proceeds in the following chapter, showing the greatness of his
calamity, and his right, as he supposes, to complain. Their attention
was gained. They did not refuse to listen to him, and he proceeds to a
fuller statement of his calamity, and of the reasons why he had allowed
himself to use the language of complaint. They listened without
interruption until he was done, and then replied in tones of deeper
severity still.
