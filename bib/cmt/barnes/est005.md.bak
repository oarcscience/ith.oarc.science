### [Esther Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md)

[Esther 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 5:1</span></span>

Over against the gate - This is the usual situation of the throne in the
"throne-room" of an Oriental palace. The monarch, from his raised
position, can see into the court through the doorway opposite to him,
which is kept open.

[Esther 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 5:3</span></span>

It shall be even given thee ... - Xerxes, on another occasion, when
pleased with one of his wives, offered to grant her any request
whatever, without limitation. Compare the margin reference.

[Esther 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 5:4</span></span>

Esther seems to have been afraid to make her real request of Xerxes too
abruptly. She concluded that the king would understand that she had a
real petition in the background, and would recur to it, as in fact he
did [Est 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006.md); [Est
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#002.md).

[Esther 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 5:6</span></span>

The banquet of wine - After the meats were removed, it was customary in
Persia to continue the banquet for a considerable time with fruits and
wine. During this part of the feast, the king renewed his offer.

[Esther 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 5:9</span></span>

He stood not up, nor moved for him - This was undoubtedly a serious
breach of Persian etiquette, and may well have angered Haman.

[Esther 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 5:10</span></span>

Zeresh - This name is probably connected with the Zend zara, "gold."
Compare the Greek "Chrysis."

[Esther 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 5:11</span></span>

The multitude of his children - Herodotus tells us that, next to prowess
in arms, it was regarded as the greatest proof of manly excellence in
Persia to be the father of many sons." Haman had ten sons (see the
margin reference).

[Esther 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 5:14</span></span>

A gallows, in the ordinary sense, is scarcely intended, since hanging
was not a Persian punishment. The intention, no doubt, was to crucify
(see the [Est 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023) note.md) or impale
Mordecai; and the pale or cross was to be 75 feet high, to make the
punishment more conspicuous.

Speak thou unto the king ... - Requests for leave to put persons to
death were often made to Persian kings by their near relatives, but only
rarely by others.
