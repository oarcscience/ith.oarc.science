### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 111:0</span></span>

The author of this psalm is unknown, as is the occasion on which it was
composed. It is one of the psalms, of which there are in all ten in
number, that commence with the phrase "Hallelu-jah" in the Hebrew; in
our version rendered, "Praise ye the Lord." Those psalms are Ps. 106;
[Psa 111:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md); [Psa
112:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001.md); [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md); Ps. 135; [Psa
146:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md); Ps. 147; [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md); [Psa
149:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001.md); and [Psa
150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md) : The use of this phrase shows
that the psalms where it is found were designed for public worship. It
is probable that this was one of the later psalms - a fact that might be
indicated by the very use of this phrase "Hallelujah." Venema supposes
that it was composed in the time of the Maccabees, but of this there is
no evidence.

This is one of the alphabetical psalms. In that class of psalms there is
considerable variety. In some a letter of the Hebrew alphabet commences
each verse in the psalm; in others, the successive letters of the
alphabet begin each two or three verses in succession, or, as in Ps.
119; eight verses in succession; in others, the successive letters of
the alphabet are used in the beginning of separate clauses of the
"verses" of a psalm.

The peculiarity of this psalm is that the first eight verses of the
psalm contain "two" clauses, beginning with the letters of the alphabet
taken in their order; the last two verses, "three". Why this arrangement
was adopted, it is impossible now to determine - as it is in regard to
"many" things which are thought to be beauties in poetry. There is very
much in the measure, the rhythm, the rhyme, of modern poetry, that is
quite as artificial, and quite as inexplicable, as this.

The psalm is call to the praise of God on account of his "works," and is
designed to suggest grounds of confidence in him as drawn "from" those
works. It is, therefore, of universal applicability; and may be used in
any nation, at any time, and among any people. It is a psalm which may
be translated into all the languages of the world, and whatever language
people may speak, it would exppress in their own tongue what they have
occasion to give thanks for in the various lands where they dwell.

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 111:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - Margin, "Hallelujah." See [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md).

I will praise the Lord with my whole heart - With undivided affections;
holding back nothing. I will allow nothing to be in my heart that would
interfere with the fullness of praise; no coldness or dividedness of
affection; no love for other things that would deaden my love for God;
no suspicion respecting him that would chill my ardor; no unbelief that
would drag me down to earth, while the language of my lips ascended to
God. See the notes at [Psa 86:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#012.md).

In the assembly of the upright - With the righteous when they are
gathered together for public worship.

And in the congregation - See [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md), [Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md); [Psa
66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md); [Psa
89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 111:2</span></span>

The works of the Lord are great - They are great in number; great in
magnitude; great in wisdom; great in goodness. This language was
appropriate in the time of the psalmist, when people looked upon the
heavens with the naked eye alone, and when they had very imperfect views
of the real magnitude of the universe as it is now disclosed by the
telescope. It is entirely appropriate now, and conveys a more solemn and
sublime impression than it would in the time of the psalmist. It will
still be appropriate under the larger views which may yet be obtained of
the universe by more perfect instruments, by more accurate observation,
and by more profound study. And it will be appropriate when people shall
survey the greatness of the universe from the heights of heaven.

Sought out of all them - Studied by all such.

That have pleasure therein - More literally, "Sought to all their
wishes." Perhaps the meaning is, that they would find all their desires
gratified in those works; they would find in them all that they would
wish to find respecting the power, wisdom, goodness, and majesty of God.
Still it implies that they have a desire thus to study his works, or
that they do find a pleasure in examining the proofs of the being and
attributes of God in his works. A man who loves God will have real
pleasure in studying his works as well as his word; and it is as proper
to find pleasure in the one as in the other - as proper to wish to find
the knowledge which the one imparts as that which the other bestows. One
great error among the friends of God is the neglect to study his works.
In doing this, people need not neglect or undervalue the Bible and the
knowledge which it gives, for such studies would be among the best means
of illustrating the Bible.

[Psalms 111:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 111:3</span></span>

His work is honorable and glorious - literally, "Honour and glory is his
work;" that is, All that he does is honorable and glorious. The language
would cover all that God does in the works of creation, providence, and
redemption. There is honor - there is majesty - in "everything" that he
does.

And his righteousness endureth for ever - That is, It will be found in
all the investigations of his works, that he is unchangeably righteous
or just. All that he has done, or that he now does, goes to demonstrate
this. There are doings of people - even of good people - which will not
bear investigation; but there are no such acts of God. There are things
that people do which excite admiration only when there is no
investigation in regard to them; but the works of God are admired the
more, the more they are studied. There are things which appear
beautiful, or appear sweet only when they are not shaken; a collection
of perfumes will give out sweets the more it is stirred.

[Psalms 111:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 111:4</span></span>

He hath made his wonderful works - In heaven and in earth.

To be remembered - literally, "Memory hath he made for his wonderful
works." "They" are so made, that man may remember them; the memory of
man, also, is so made, that it may retain them. The highest and most
appropriate exercise of memory is to retain the lessons which the works
of God inculcate; to treasure up for gratitude and for use what he
teaches his intelligent creation through those works. Memory can never
be better employed than in treasuring up the truths which the Creator
teaches in his providential dealings with us, and in his word. How much
better would it be for man if he labored more to "remember" these
things; if he sought to forget many of those things which he is so
careful now to retain in his recollection.

The Lord is gracious ... - See the notes at [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005.md). This is stated here as the
result of the careful study of the doings of God; as the conclusion to
which all will come who carefully study his works. "Illustrations" of
what God has done that deserves to be remembered occupy the remainder of
the psalm, except the last verse.

[Psalms 111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 111:5</span></span>

He hath given meat unto them that fear him - Margin, "prey." The idea
is, that he has supplied their needs. The Hebrew word is, "prey," and
the allusion is to the mode in which the needs of the beasts of the
field are supplied. The meaning may be that they had obtained this from
their enemies, as beasts of prey take their food by making war; or the
word may be used in a general sense, as meaning that God had supplied
their needs.

He will ever be mindful of his covenant - He will never leave or forsake
his people; he will be faithful to all the promises that he has made to
them.

[Psalms 111:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 111:6</span></span>

He hath showed his people - The Jewish people. He has made this known to
them. The reference here is not to his "announcing" it, or stating it,
but to his acts of interposition in their behalf in which he had
manifested the greatness of his power.

The power of his works - The power of his acts; the power involved in
what he does. The power referred to here was that which was evinced in
destroying the Egyptians, and in subduing the nations of Canaan.

That he may give them the heritage of the heathen - The nations; to wit,
the nations of Palestine. The word "heritage" is often used in the large
sense of possessions; and the meaning here is, that God had shown the
greatness of his power by giving all that they possessed into the hands
of his people.

[Psalms 111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 111:7</span></span>

The works of his hands - All that he does in the works of creation and
providence; all in his acts toward the children of men.

Are verity - Truth. That is, They tend to establish and confirm the
truth; they are done in the cause or the defense of truth. Truth in any
case may be ascertained by what God "does," for all that he defends and
protects is "truth," and his acts, therefore, may be regarded as an
expression of what is true and right.

And judgment - In the cause of justice; or, in maintaining the
principles of right. God never does anything to vindicate wrong. None of
his acts can be fairly interpreted as having been done to sustain
injustice, fraud, deceit, ambition, oppression, murder, or
licentiousness. That he suffers free agents to do these things without
interference is no evidence that he approves of them. That he
"disapproves" of them is shown

\(a\) by his declarations;

\(b\) by his threatenings;

\(c\) by all that he does to punish the wicked here.

All his commandments are sure - His statutes; his ordinances. They are
sure; that is, they are to be relied on; or, are worthy of confidence.

[Psalms 111:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 111:8</span></span>

They stand fast forever and ever - Margin, "established." The Hebrew
word means "sustained, supported." They will not fail or fall. Whatever
else may be shaken, his law, his word, and the principles of his
administration, will not fail. See the notes at [Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018.md). Compare [Luk
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#017.md); [Mat
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md). The great principles of truth
and righteousness will stand, and whatever is founded on those
principles will endure forever.

And are done in truth and uprightness - Are based on truth, or on a just
view of things; they are done in such a way that truth will be
maintained and promoted. The word "uprightness" here means that all this
is done on the principles of equity - of what "ought" to be done, or
what is "best" to be done. Compare [Psa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 111:9</span></span>

He sent redemption unto his people - In their deliverance from Egypt. He
has now sent it in a higher sense under the great Deliverer, the
Saviour.

He hath commanded his covenant for ever - He has ordained or appointed
it. The covenant is here represented as if it were obedient to the will
of God, or under his control. The covenant refers to his arrangements
with his people; his assurances of favor, with the terms on which that
favor will be shown.

Holy and reverend is his name - Holy and to be venerated; literally, "to
be feared." That is, he has shown in all this that he is holy, and that
he is a Being who is to be had in reverence.

[Psalms 111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 111:10</span></span>

The fear of the Lord - Reverence for God; respect for his law, his will,
his government, himself; the fear of offending him, which will lead us
to do right. This fear is not that of a slave; it is not mere dread; it
is not terror. It is consistent with love, and springs from it. It is
consistent with calmness of mind, and promotes it. It does not produce
terror, but rather delivers from it, and preserves the mind from alarms.
The word here rendered "fear" is a noun of the same origin as the word
rendered "reverend" in the previous verse. The suggestion to the mind of
the psalmist that the "name of the Lord" was "reverend," or was to be
venerated, introduced this thought that such reverence is the very
foundation of wisdom.

Is the beginning of wisdom - The foundation, the origin, the
commencement of being truly wise. It is so. There is no true wisdom
which does not recognize the being, the perfections, and the claims of
God. The highest wisdom - the most lofty endowment of man - is that he
"may" know and honor God. This, in capability, makes him wise above the
brute creation; this, in exercise, makes one man more wise than another;
this, when it springs up in the soul, makes a man more wise than he was
before - or, is the "beginning" of true wisdom in the soul. Compare [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md); [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md); [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md); [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); [Ecc
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md).

A good understanding ... - Margin, "good success." The original word -
שׂכל śêkel - is rendered "understanding" (as here) in [Sa1
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#003.md); [Ezr
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018.md); [Job
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004.md); [Pro
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md); [Pro
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#015.md); [Pro
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022.md); "wisdom" in [Ch1
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#012.md); [Pro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008.md); [Pro
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#009.md); "prudence," [Ch2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012.md); [Pro
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011) (margin.md); "sense," in [Neh
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#008.md); "knowledge," [Ch2
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md); and "policy" in [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md). It "may" denote, therefore,
understanding, wisdom, knowledge, success, prudence; and it is true in
regard to "all" of these - for the fear of the Lord, or true religion,
produces them "all." It is not necessary, therefore, to endeavor to
ascertain precisely which of these is the meaning here.

That do his commandments - Margin, as in the Hebrew, "do them." That do
the things connected with the fear of the Lord; that is, who obey God.

His praise endureth for ever - That is, the foundation for his praise
endures to all eternity; or, is unchangeable. As God is always the same,
so there is, as derived from his being and perfections, always the same
foundation for praise. As there will always be created beings who can
and will appreciate this, so it will be literally true, as it should be,
that his praise "will" be celebrated forever.
