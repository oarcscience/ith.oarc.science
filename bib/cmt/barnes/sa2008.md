### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 8:1</span></span>

Metheg-ammah must be the name of some stronghold which commanded Gath,
and the taking of which made David master of Gath and her towns.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 8:2</span></span>

David took great numbers of the Moabites prisoners of war, and made them
lie down on the ground, and then divided them by a measuring line into
three parts, putting two-thirds to death, and saving alive one-third.
The cause of the war with the Moabites, who had been very friendly with
David [Sa1 22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003), and of this severe
treatment, is not known. But it seems likely, from the tone of [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) that David had met with some
temporary reverse in his Syrian wars, and that the Moabites and Edomites
had treacherously taken advantage of it, and perhaps tried to cut off
his retreat.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 8:3</span></span>

Hadadezer - Not (see the margin) Hadarezer. Hadadezer, is the true form,
as seen in the names Benhadad, Hadad ([Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018), etc.; [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014), etc.). Hadad was the chief
idol, or sun-god, of the Syrians.

To recover his border - literally, to cause his hand to return. The
phrase is used sometimes literally, as e. g. [Exo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#007); [Kg1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004); [Pro
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024); and sometimes figuratively, as
[Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025); [Isa
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027); [Amo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008); [Psa
74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011). The exact force of the metaphor
must in each case be decided by the context. If, as is most probable,
this verse relates to the circumstances more fully detailed in [Sa2
10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015), the meaning of the phrase
here will be when he (Hadadezer) went to renew his attack (upon Israel),
or to recruit his strength against Israel, at the river Euphrates.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 8:4</span></span>

Seven hundred horsemen - It should be seven thousand, as in [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 8:5</span></span>

Syrians of Damascus - The Syrians (Aram), whose capital was Damascus,
were the best known and most powerful. Damascus (written Darmesek in
marginal references, according to the late Aramean orthography) is first
mentioned in [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002). According to
Nicolaus of Damascus, cited by Josephus, the Syrian king's name was
Hadad.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 8:6</span></span>

Garrisons - The word is used for officers in [Kg1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005), [Kg1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019), and some think that that is its
meaning here. Perhaps, however, it is best to take it with the King
James Version in the same sense as in [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005); [Sa1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003).

Brought gifts - Rather, "tribute" (and in [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)); meaning they became subject and
tributary.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 8:8</span></span>

Betah and Berothai - These names (see also margin) have not been
identified with certainty.

Exceeding much brass - "Wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the
pillars, and the vessels of brass" [Ch1
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008). The Septuagint and Vulgate both
add these words here, so that perhaps they have fallen out of the Hebrew
text. For the existence of metals in Lebanon or Antilebanon, see [Deu
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 8:9</span></span>

Hamath - This appears as an independent kingdom so late as the time of
Senacherib [Isa 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#013). But in the time
of Nebuchadnezzar, both Hamath and Arpad appear to have been
incorporated in the kingdom of Damascus [Jer
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 8:10</span></span>

Joram - Or, more probably, Hadoram. See the margin.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 8:12</span></span>

Syria - Rather, as in [Ch1 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011),
Edom, which is manifestly the right reading, both because Edom, Moab,
and Ammon are so frequently joined together, and because David's Syrian
spoil is expressly mentioned at the end of the verse. (The Hebrew
letters for Aram (Syria) and Edom are very similar.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 8:13</span></span>

The Syrians - Read the Edomites, as in marginal references (compare [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) title), and as the context
[Sa2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014) requires. For a further
account of this war of extermination with Edom, see [Kg1
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015). The war with Edom was of
some duration, not without serious reverses and dangers to the
Israelites ([Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002) note). The
different accounts probably relate to different parts of the campaign.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 8:16</span></span>

For a similar account of the officers of Solomon's kingdom, see [Kg1
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001), where Jehoshaphat is still the
recorder, and Benaiah is advanced to be captain of the host in the room
of Joab. The recorder seems to have been a high officer of state, a kind
of chancellor, whose office was to keep a record of the events of the
kingdom for the king's information, and hence, he would naturally be the
king's adviser. See [Est 6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001); [Isa
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#022); [Ch2
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008). Such an officer is found among
the ancient Egyptians and Persians.

Ahimelech the son of Abiathar - According to [Sa1
22:9-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009), Abiathar, Zadok's colleague,
was the son of Ahimelech. Abiathar the son of Ahimelech continued to be
priest through the reign of David. (Compare also [Kg1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007), [Kg1
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#042); [Kg1
2:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022).) It almost necessarily
follows that there is some error in the text.

The scribe - Or secretary of state [Kg2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010); [Kg2
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#037), different from the military
scribe ([Jdg 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014) note).

[Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018)

The Cherethites and the Pelethites - See the marginal reference note.

Chief rulers - The word כהן kôhên, here rendered a "chief ruler," is the
regular word for a priest. In the early days of the monarchy the word
כהן kôhên had not quite lost its etymological sense, from the root
meaning to minister, or manage affairs, though in later times its
technical sense alone survived.
