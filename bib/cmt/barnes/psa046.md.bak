### [Psalms Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 46:0</span></span>

This psalm has been called Luther's Psalm. It was that which he was
accustomed to sing in trouble. When the times were dark; when the
enemies of truth appeared to triumph; when disaster seemed to come over
the cause in which he was engaged, and the friends of the Reformation
were disspirited, disheartened, and sad, he was accustomed to say to his
fellow-laborers, "Come, let us sing the 46th Psalm."

The author of the psalm is unknown. It is not ascribed to David, but to
"the Sons of Korah," and there are no indications in the psalm that
David was the author, or that it refers to his times. There is reason to
believe that most of the psalms attributed to the "Sons of Korah" were
composed subsequent to the time of David.

The title of the psalm is, "To the chief Musician, for the Sons of
Korah, a song upon Alamoth." On the phrase "To the chief Musician," see
the notes at the title to [Psa 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).
On the phrase "For the Sons of Korah," see the notes at the title to
[Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md). The word "song" in the
title occurs also in that to [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md). (see the notes at that
title), and also in the titles to Ps. 45; [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md); [Psa
65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md); Ps. 66; [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md); Ps. 68; [Psa
75:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md); [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md); Ps. 83; [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md); Ps. 88; [Psa
92:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md); [Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md); and Ps. 120-134 inclusive.
Nothing seems to be indicated by it in regard to the nature and
character of the psalms where it is found. The word "Alamoth" occurs
only here and in [Ch1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md), where it
is found in connection with the mention of certain singers or musicians,
evidently referring to some kind of musical instruments which those who
are mentioned used; "so the singers" [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md) :19, "Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,
to sound with cymbals of brass; and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, etc., with psalteries on Alamoth." The word from which this
is derived - עלמה ‛almâh - means properly a "virgin," or a youthful
spouse (compare the notes at [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md); and the phrase here, and in
[Ch1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md), would seem properly to
denote "after the manner of virgins;" that is, with the female voice,
answering to our treble or soprano, as opposed to the deep bass or
baritone voice of men. Then the reference might be to some musical
instruments that were suited to accompany that voice, or whose tones
resembled that voice, as distinguished from cymbals, trumpets, harps,
etc. The form of the instrument is now unknown.

It is not possible now to ascertain the occasion on which the psalm was
written. It was evidently in view of trouble, or of some impending
calamity; apparently some national calamity, or some time when the
nation was in danger, and when it was felt that their only refuge -
their last hope - was in God. It would seem to be not improbable that
the psalm was composed when wars were ragtag abroad in the earth; when
the nations were convulsed; and when Jerusalem itself was besieged and
threatened with ruin. The main thought Of the psalm - the central idea
in it - is, that, amidst these general and far-spreading agitations and
convulsions among the nations of the earth, the people of God were safe.
They had nothing to fear, even though those convulsions and agitations
should be multiplied and increased; even though they should be carried
so far that the very foundations of the earth should be shaken, and the
mountains removed and carried into the midst of the sea.

There was to them an Infinite Protector; there were unfailing sources of
peace; they had nothing to dread. It was their duty, therefore, to be
calm, still, confiding, for God would be exalted among the nations of
the earth. It is possible that the psalm refers to the invasion of the
land of Israel by Sennacherib, and to the miraculous destruction of his
host, as recorded in 2 Kings 19 and Isa. 36; 37. All the circumstances
in that invasion - the tumul tuous hosts summoned for the war [Isa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002.md); the overthrow of numerous
nations by their armies [Isa 36:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#018.md);
the siege of Jerusalem itself [Isa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002.md); the confidence of Hezekiah and
of his people in God when the city was besieged [Isa
37:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#014.md); and the final overthrow of
the Assyrian host by the angel of the Lord [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md), agree well with all the
statements in the psalm, and seem well to "illustrate" the psalm, though
it be impossible now to determine with precise accuracy to what
particular historical occasion it has reference. The circumstances in
that invasion, however, are so similar to those supposed in the psalm,
that, perhaps, we shall not be likely to err in supposing that the psalm
"had" reference to that occasion.

The psalm is divided into three parts or strophes, the close of each of
which is indicated by the word "Selah," in [Psa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md), [Psa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md),[Psa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md).

I. The first strophe, [Psa 46:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md). In
this there is the general statement that God is a refuge and strength,
and that the people of God would have nothing to fear though the earth
should be removed, and though the raging waters of the ocean should
shake the very mountains.

II\. The second, [Psa 46:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md). In this
there is the statement that the people of God had an unfailing source of
consolation, like an ever-flowing river, making glad the city of God;
that God himself was in that city as its Protector; that though the
nations raged, and the kingdoms were moved, he had only to utter his
voice and even the earth would be dissolved; that they had nothing to
fear while the God of hosts - the God of mightier armies than those
which had invaded the land - was with them.

III\. The third strophe, [Psa 46:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md).
In this we have a reference to the mighty power of God as actually put
forth in the desolations, which "he" had made in the earth. He had shown
that power by making wars to cease; by breaking the bow, and cutting the
spear in sunder; and by causing the warchariot to be burned in the fire.
They had, therefore, nothing to fear while such a God was their
Protector, and it was their duty calmly to confide in him, and leave the
whole issue with him, for it was his purpose to exalt himself among the
nations of the earth.

[Psalms 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 46:1</span></span>

God is our refuge and strength - God is for us as a place to which we
may flee for safety; a source of strength to us in danger. The first
word, "refuge," from a verb meaning to "flee," and then "to flee to" -
הסה châsâh - or to take shelter in - denotes a place to which one would
flee in time of danger - as a lofty wall; a high tower; a fort; a
fortress. See the notes at [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).
The idea here is, that the people of God, in time of danger, may find
him to be what such a place of refuge would be. Compare [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md). The word "strength" implies
that God is the source of strength to those who are weak and
defenseless; or that we may rely on his strength "as if" it were our
own; or that we may feel as safe in his strength as though we had that
strength ourselves. We may make it the basis of our confidence as really
as though the strength resided in our own arm. See the notes at [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).

A very present help - The word "help" here means aid, assistance. The
word "trouble" would cover all that can come upon us which would give us
anxiety or sorrow. The word rendered "present" - נמצא nimetsâ' - means
rather, "is found," or "has been found;" that is, he has "proved"
himself to be a help in trouble. The word "present," as if he were near
to us, or close by us, does not accurately express the idea, which is
rather, that "he has been found" to be such, or that he has always
"proved" himself to be such a help, and that, therefore, we may now
confide in him. The word "very," or "exceedingly," is added to qualify
the whole proposition, as if this were "emphatically true." It was true
in the most eminent sense that God had always been found to be such a
helper, and, "therefore," there was nothing to fear in the present
distress. [Psa 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 46:2</span></span>

Therefore will not we fear - Our confidence in God shall be unshaken and
abiding. Having Him for our refuge and strength [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), we can have nothing to fear.
Compare [Psa 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003.md).

Though the earth be removed - literally, "in the changing of the earth;"
that is, though the earth should be changed. This may either mean,
Though the earth should change its place or its very structure in these
convulsions; or, though it should perish altogether. Compare [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md). The idea is, that they would
not be afraid, though the convulsions then occurring in the world should
be continued, and should be extended so far as to destroy the very earth
itself. God would remain their friend and protector, and they would have
nothing to fear.

And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea - Margin,
as in Hebrew, "into the heart of the seas." This may either be
understood literally, as implying that they would "not" be afraid though
the mountains, the most fixed and firm things of earth, should be
uprooted and sunk in the ocean - implying that nothing earthly was
stable; or, the mountains here may be referred to as emblems of that
which seemed to be most settled and established on earth - the kingdoms
of the world. The idea is, that in any convulsion - any change - any
threatened danger - they would place confidence in God, who ruled over
all, and who could not change. It will be seen at once that this entire
description of trust and confidence in God is applicable to the time of
Hezekiah, and to the feelings which he manifested when the land was
invaded by the hosts of Sennacherib, and when wars and commotions were
abroad among the kingdoms of the earth. See the introduction to the
psalm. It was, also, eminently suited to console the mind in the
circumstances to which Luther so often applied the psalm - the
agitations, convulsions, wars, dangers in Europe, in the time of the
Reformation. It is suited to any time of trouble, when commotions and
revolutions are occurring in the earth, and when everything sacred,
true, and valuable seems to be in danger.

[Psalms 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 46:3</span></span>

Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled - The waters of the sea.
The idea is, that they would not be afraid though everything should be
in commotion, and be as unsettled as the restless waves of the ocean.
The earth might be changed, the mountains removed, the agitated sea roar
and dash against the shore, but their minds would be calm. The word
rendered "be troubled" means to boil; to ferment; to foam; and here it
refers to the ocean as agitated and lashed into foam. Nothing is more
sublime and fearful than the ocean in a storm; nothing furnishes a
better illustration of the peace produced by confidence in God amid the
agitations which occur in the world, than the mind of a seaman that is
calm when the ocean is heaved in wild commotion.

Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof - The rolling ocean
breaking against; the sides of the mountains on its shore, and seeming
to shake them to their foundation. The word rendered "swelling" means
properly majesty, glory; then pride, haughtiness, insolence. Literally,
"though the mountains tremble through their pride." Compare [Psa
124:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#005.md). On the word "Selah," see the
notes at [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 46:4</span></span>

There is a river - There is no allusion here to any particular stream or
river, but the image is designed to represent a state of peace and calm
security in contrast with the rough and troubled ocean. While the ocean
rages, and foams, and dashes against the mountains as if it would
overturn them, the state of Jerusalem, the city of God, was well
represented by a calm and gently-flowing river; a river of full banks,
diffusing joy and fertility and beauty wherever it flowed. This image,
to represent happiness, abundance, peace, joy, is one that is often
employed in the Scriptures. Compare [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md); [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md); [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md). The "idea" here is simply that
Jerusalem would be calm and serene amidst all the external agitations in
the world - calm as a gently-flowing stream. The streams - the canals -
the water-courses of such a river flowing around each dwelling and along
each garden, would diffuse happiness and beauty everywhere.

The streams whereof - The allusion here is undoubtedly to the canals,
watercourses, or rivulets that were led off from the main stream for the
purpose of supplying fountains and watering gardens. Thus the city of
Damascus is watered by streams or canals cut from the river Barrady,
that flows down from the regions of Anti-Libanus. The greenness - the
beauty - the fertility - of Damascus is owing wholly to the waters of
the river thus conducted to every house and garden in the city. Compare
introduction to [Isa 17:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md). So here,
the flowing river of divine mercy and goodness is conveyed, as in
smaller canals or streams, to each home and heart, producing peace,
calmness, joy - while the world around is full of commotion and trouble.

Shall make glad the city of God - Jerusalem, considered as the place
where God was worshipped, and where he was supposed especially to dwell:
[Psa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md).

The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High - Of the "tent" where
the Most High is supposed to abide. The word is applicable to any
habitation or dwelling-place; but in the Scriptures it is applied
especially to the sacred tent erected by Moses in the wilderness, and
ultimately removed to Mount Zion by David, as the divine abode on earth.
It is sometimes, also, applied to the temple; and if this psalm was
written, as I have supposed, in the time of Hezekiah, it would be
applicable to that. Compare [Psa 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md);
[Psa 132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md). The tabernacle and the
temple were alike divided into two parts - the holy and the most holy
place - and hence the "plural" term is sometimes applied to them.
Compare the notes at [Heb 9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 46:5</span></span>

God is in the midst of her - God is in the midst of the "city" referred
to above - the "city of God." That is,

\(a\) he dwelt there by the visible symbol of his presence, the
Shekinah;

\(b\) he was there "actually" as a help and a protector.

It was his chosen abode, and as long as such a Being dwelt in the city,
they had nothing to fear.

God shall help her - That is, in her danger, he will interpose to save
her. This is language such as would be used in reference to a place that
was besieged, and would well apply to the state of things when Jerusalem
was besieged by the armies of Assyria under Sennacherib. The language
expresses the confidence of the people in the time of the impending
danger.

And that right early - Margin, "when the morning appeareth." Literally,
"in the faces of the morning," as the word is commonly used; or, more
literally, in the "turning" of the morning - for the verb from which the
word is derived means properly "to turn," and then "to turn to or from
any one." The noun is applied to the face or countenance, because the
person is "turned" to us when we see his countenance. The poetic idea
here seems to refer to the day as having turned away "from" us at night,
and then as turning about "toward" us in the morning, after having gone,
as it were, to the greatest distance from us. "Possibly" there may be an
allusion here to what occurred in the camp of the Assyrians, when the
discovery that the angel of the Lord had smitten them was made early in
the morning, or when men arose in the morning: "The angel of the Lord
went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and
fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose in the morning" (that
is, when men arose in the morning), "behold, they were all dead
corpses," [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md).

[Psalms 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 46:6</span></span>

The heathen raged - The nations were in commotion, or were agitated like
the waves of the sea. This language would well describe the
consternation of the nations when the Assyrians went forth to conquest,
and when, having subdued so many other kingdoms, they made war on
Jerusalem. Compare [Isa 36:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#018.md).

The kingdoms were moved - That is, those who were invaded, as well as
those that made the invasion. There was a general convulsion or shaking
among the nations of the earth.

He uttered his voice - God spoke; he gave command; he expressed his
will. Compare [Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md).

The earth melted - The very earth seemed to melt or dissolve before him.
Everything became still. The danger passed away at his command, and the
raging world became calm. The Bible abounds in language of this kind,
showing the absolute power of God, or his power to control all the
raging elements on land and ocean by a word. Compare the notes at [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009.md). See also [Psa
107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md), [Psa
107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md); [Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md).

[Psalms 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 46:7</span></span>

The Lord of hosts - The God commanding, ordering, marshalling the hosts
of heaven - the angels, and the starry worlds. See the notes at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md). Compare [Psa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010.md). The reference here is to God
considered as having control over all "armies," or all that can be
regarded and described as a marshalled host, in earth and in heaven.
Having such a Being, therefore, for a protector, they had nothing to
fear. See [Psa 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md).

Is with us - Is on our side; is our defender. The Hebrew phrase used
here is employed in [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014) (notes.md);
[Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008) (notes.md), to describe the
Messiah. See the notes at those passages.

The God of Jacob - See the notes at [Psa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md). The meaning is, The God whom
Jacob acknowedged, and whom he found to be his friend, is with us.

Is our refuge - literally, a high place, as a tower, far above the reach
of enemies. See [Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md), note; [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), note. So the margin, "an high
place for us."

[Psalms 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 46:8</span></span>

Come, behold the works of the Lord - Go forth and see what the Lord has
done. See, in what his hand has accomplished, how secure we are if we
put our trust in him.

What desolations he hath made in the earth - Or, in the land. The word
"desolations" might refer to any "ruin" or "overthrow," which he had
brought upon the land of Israel, or on the nations abroad - the
destruction of cities, towns, or armies, as proof of his power, and of
his ability to save those who put their trust in him. But if this be
supposed to refer to the invasion of the land of Israel by Sennacherib,
it may point to what occurred to his armies when the angel of the Lord
went forth and smote them in their camp [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md), and to the consequent
deliverance of Jerusalem from danger. Without impropriety, perhaps, this
may be regarded as all appeal to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go
forth and see for themselves how complete was the deliverance; how utter
the ruin of their foes; how abundant the proof that God was able to
protect his people in times of danger. It adds great beauty to this
psalm to suppose that it "was" composed on that occasion, or in view of
that invasion, for every part of the psalm may receive a beautiful, and
an ample illustration from what occurred at that memorable period.
Nothing "could" furnish a clearer proof of the power of God to save, and
of the propriety of putting confidence in him in times of national
danger, than a survey of the camp of the Assyrians, where an hundred and
eighty-five thousand men had been smitten down in one night by the angel
of God. Compare [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md); [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md); [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md).

[Psalms 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 46:9</span></span>

He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth - Either in all the
land, or in all the world. The overthrow of the Assyrian army would
probably put an end to all the wars then raging in the world. The
Assyrian empire was then the most mighty on the globe; it was engaged in
wide schemes of conquest; it had already overrun many of the smaller
kingdoms of the world [Isa 37:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#018.md);
and it hoped to complete its conquests, and to secure the ascendancy
over the entire earth, by the subjugation of India and Egypt. When the
vast army of that empire, engaged in such a purpose, was overthrown, the
consequence would be that the nations would be at rest, or that there
would be universal peace. Compare the notes at [Isa
14:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md).

He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder - That is, he makes
them useless, as a bow that is broken is of no value, or a spear that is
cut into parts.

He burneth the chariot in the fire - The war-chariot, that which was
employed in battle. See the notes at [Isa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007.md); notes at [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md). The expression here may refer to
a custom of collecting the spoils of war into a heap, and setting them
on fire. This was particularly done when the victors were unable to
remove them, or so to secure them as to preclude all danger of their
being taken again and used against themselves. Tiffs custom is alluded
to by Virgil, AEn. viii. 561, 562,

"Qualis cram, cum primam aciem Prseneste sub ipsa

Stravi, scutorumque iucendi victor acervos."

The idea here is, that God had wholly overthrown the foe, and had
prevented all danger of his returning again for purposes of conquest.

[Psalms 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 46:10</span></span>

Be still - The word used here - from רפה râphâh - means properly to cast
down; to let fall; to let hang down; then, to be relaxed, slackened,
especially the hands: It is also employed in the sense of not making an
effort; not putting forth exertion; and then would express the idea of
leaving matters with God, or of being without anxiety about the issue.
Compare [Exo 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md), "Stand still, and
see the salvation of God." In this place the word seems to be used as
meaning that there was to be no anxiety; that there was to be a calm,
confiding, trustful state of mind in view of the displays of the divine
presence and power. The mind was to be calm, in view of the fact that
God had interposed, and had shown that he was able to defend his people
when surrounded by dangers. If this the divine interposition when
Jerusalem was threatened by the armies of the Assyrians under
Sennacherib, the force and beauty of the expression will be most clearly
seen.

And know that I am God - See, in what I have done, the evidence that I
am God. See a work accomplished which none "but" God could effect.
Compare [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md).

I will be exalted among the heathen - That is, among the nations. The
nations abroad that do not worship me, but worship idols, shall see in
these deeds full proof that I am the true God, and that I am worthy of
universal adoration. Compare the notes at [Dan
3:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md); notes at [Dan
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001.md), notes at [Dan
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037.md). See also [Exo
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md); [Rom
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md).

I will be exalted in the earth - In the lands abroad; all over the
world. The defeat and destruction of the armies of Sennacherib were
eminently suited to make a deep impression on the world that the God of
the Hebrew people was the true God.

[Psalms 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 46:11</span></span>

The Lord of hosts is with us ... - See [Psa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md). This is the conclusion, or the
result of the whole. As applied to the invasion of Sennacherib, this
would be clearly seen, for all that occurred in that invasion was
adapted to leave the impression that Jehovah, God of hosts, was with the
Hebrew people. He had interposed in time of danger; he had saved his
city and nation; he had overthrown one of the most mighty armies that
had ever been assembled; he had caused the boasting conqueror himself to
retrace his steps to his capita; he had wholly delivered the nation from
all danger; and he had shown how easy it was, in ways which they could
not have anticipated, to bring deliverance. The truth thus conveyed was
adapted to the people of God in all lands and at all times, as showing
that God has power to defend his people against the most formidable
enemies, and that all their interests are safe in his hands.
