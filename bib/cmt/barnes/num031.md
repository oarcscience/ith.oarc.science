### [Numbers Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001)

[Numbers 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 31:2</span></span>

The Midianites - The Moabites are not included. It would thus seem that
it was the Midianites, and they only, who deliberately set themselves to
work the corruption of Israel.

[Numbers 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 31:3</span></span>

Avenge the Lord of Midian - The war against the Midianites was no
ordinary war. It was indeed less a war than the execution of a divine
sentence against a most guilty people.

Doubtless there were many among the Midianites who were personally
guiltless as regards Israel. But the rulers deliberately adopted the
counsel of Balaam against Israel, and their behests had been but too
readily obeyed by their subjects. The sin therefore was national, and
the retribution could be no less so.

But the commission of the Israelites in the text must not be conceived
as a general license to slay. They had no discretion to kill or to
spare. They were bidden to exterminate without mercy, and brought back
to their task [Num 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#014) when they
showed signs of flinching from it. They had no alternarive in this and
similar matters except to fulfill the commands of God; an awful but
doubtless salutary manifestation, as was afterward the slaughter of the
Canaanites, of God's wrath against sin; and a type of the future
extermination of sin and sinners from His kingdom.

[Numbers 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 31:5</span></span>

Were delivered - Or, "were told off."

[Numbers 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 31:6</span></span>

Phinehas - He was marked out as the fitting director of the expedition
by his conduct (compare [Num 25:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007))
in the matter of Zimri and Cozbi.

With the holy instruments, and the trumpets - Or rather, "with the holy
instruments, to wit, the trumpets," for the trumpets themselves seem to
be the instruments intended.

[Numbers 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 31:8</span></span>

And they slew ... were slain ... - Render: And the kings of Midian they
put to death, beside those that fell in the battle; namely, etc. From
which it would seem that beside these five, put to death after the
battle, there were other Midianite kings who perished fighting. The five
chieftains here mentioned were vassals of Sihon the Amorite [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021).

[Numbers 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 31:10</span></span>

Goodly castles - Rather, both here and in [Gen
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#016), hamlets. The word is derived
from a word טוּר ṭûr,) signifying "a row" or "range" (compare [Eze
46:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#023)); and probably indicates those
collections of rude dwellings, made of stones piled one on another and
covered with tent-cloths, which are used by the Arabs to this day; and
which are frequently mentioned as douars in narratives of the French
campaigns in Algeria. These dwellings would be formed usually in a
circle. See the word "Hazeroth," in [Num
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035).

[Numbers 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 31:11</span></span>

The "prey" refers to the captives and live-stock: the "spoil" to the
ornaments and other effects.

[Numbers 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 31:16</span></span>

Caused ... to commit trespass - More literally, "became to the children
of Israel for a cause (or, incitement) of treachery to the Lord."

[Numbers 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 31:22</span></span>

Brass - Render copper. See [Gen 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022)
note. The verse is curious as illustrating the variety of metals in use
at this early date for domestic purposes. All these metals were common
in Egypt centuries before the date of the Exodus.

[Numbers 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 31:29</span></span>

An heave-offering - Render simply an offering, and compare [Num
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#024). The verb from which the word
here rendered "heave-offering" is derived, is rightly translated "levy"
in [Num 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028).

[Numbers 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 31:32</span></span>

Compare [Num 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011), and render "And
the prey" (i. e., the live prey) "in addition to the spoil which the men
of war seized, etc." The "spoil" is described in [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050).

The number of sheep, beeves, asses, and persons taken is given in this
and following verses in round thousands. Hence, the Lord's tribute ([Num
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#029), [Num
31:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#037), etc.), being the 500th part
of the half, comes out also in round numbers. The enormous amount both
of live stock and of personal ornament was characteristic of the
Midianites. When they invaded Israel in the days of the Judges, their
wealth was still of the same kind ([Jdg
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005); [Jdg
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024) ff). The Bedouins,
notwithstanding their wild nomadic life, retain their ancestral love of
finery to the present day.

[Numbers 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">num 31:49</span></span>

There is no mention of any resistance on the part of the Midianites. The
Israelites saw in this and in the preservation of all those engaged,
proofs that the Lord had been with them in the work, and hence, the
free-will oblation of [Num 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050).

[Numbers 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 31:50</span></span>

The "chains" were "armlets" [Sa2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010).
The "rings" were "finger-rings," or "seal-rings;" and the "tablets" were
worn suspended from the neck [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).

To make an atonement for our souls before the Lord - Compare [Exo
30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011). The atonement was not for
any special offence committed (which would have called for a sacrifice
of blood-shedding), but rather like the half-shekel given at the census
in the Book of Exodus (loc. cite), was an acknowledgment of having
received undeserved mercies. These, if unacknowledged, would have
entailed guilt on the soul.

[Numbers 31:52](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">num 31:52</span></span>

The value of the offering was about 20,000 British pounds.

[Numbers 31:53](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">num 31:53</span></span>

This verse seems to imply that the soldiers, as distinct from the
officers (compare [Num 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049)), did not
make any offering from their plunder. Of course besides the gold there
would be much spoil of less precious materials; see [Num
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#020), [Num
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#022).
