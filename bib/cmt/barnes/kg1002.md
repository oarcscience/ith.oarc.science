### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 2:1</span></span>

The events related in 1 Chr. 28-29 had occurred in the interval which
separates the last and this present chapter.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 2:2</span></span>

David appears to have in his thoughts the divine address to Joshua.
Without following it servilely, he reproduces several of its leading
expressions and sentiments (compare the margin reference). Solomon's
youth clearly constituted one of the chief difficulties of his position.
If he was about nineteen or twenty, and known to be of a pacific
disposition [Ch1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009), then to have to
rule over the warlike and turbulent Hebrew nation, with a strong party
opposed to him, and brothers of full age ready to lead it, was evidently
a most difficult task. Hence, he is exhorted, though in years a boy, to
show himself in Spirit "a man."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 2:3</span></span>

The "statutes" have been explained to be the positive ordinances of the
Law; the "commandments" the moral precepts, not to steal, etc.; the
"judgments" the laws belonging to civil government; and the
"testimonies" the laws directing the commemoration of certain events.
Compare [Psa 19:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 2:4</span></span>

That the Lord may continue his word - The original promise given to
David indirectly, through Nathan [Sa2
7:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011), and apparently unconditional,
afterward was made conditional upon continued obedience. (See the margin
reference "f.") David reminds Solomon of this, in order to impress upon
him a powerful motive to continue faithful and obedient.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

In his directions with respect to certain important persons, David,
anxious for the security of his young successor's kingdom, allows old
animosities to revive, and is willing to avenge himself indirectly and
by deputy, though he had been withheld by certain scruples from taking
vengeance in his own person. We must not expect Gospel morality from the
saints of the Old Testament. They were only the best men of their
several ages and nations. The maxim of "them of old time," whether Jews
or Gentiles, was "Love your friends and hate your enemies" (see [Mat
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043)); and David perhaps was not in
this respect in advance of his age. Joab's chief offence against David,
besides his two murders, was no doubt his killing Absalom [Sa2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014). Another serious crime was his
support of the treasonable attempt of Adonijah [Kg1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007). But besides these flagrant
misdemeanours, he seems to have offended David by a number of little
acts. He was a constant thorn in his side. He treated him with scant
respect, taking important steps without his orders [Sa2
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#026), remonstrating with him roughly
and rudely [Sa2 2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#024), almost
betraying his secrets [Sa2 11:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#019),
and, where he disliked the orders given him, disobeying them [Ch1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#006). David allowed his ascendancy,
but he chafed against it, finding this "son of Zeruiah," in particular
"too hard" for him (margin reference).

Put the blood of war upon his girdle ... - Meaning "The blood of Amasa
spirited all over the girdle to which the sword of Joab was attached;
and the sandals on his feet were reddened with the stains left by the
falling corpse."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 2:6</span></span>

His hoar head - Joab, though the nephew of David, was probably not very
greatly his junior, David being the youngest of the family, and Zeruiah,
as is most likely, one of the eldest.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 2:7</span></span>

One of the sons of Barzillai here intended was probably Chimham (see the
margin reference). Who the others were is not known. The family
continued down to the return from the captivity, and still held property
in Israel (compare [Ezr 2:61](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#061) and [Neh
7:63](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#063)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 2:9</span></span>

Hold him not guiltless - i. e. "Do not treat him as an innocent man.
Punish him as in thy wisdom thou deemest best. Not capitally at once;
but so that he may be likely to give thee in course of time a just
occasion to slay him." So, at least, Solomon seems to have understood
the charge. (See [Kg1 2:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 2:11</span></span>

Forty years - In all forty years and six months. See [Sa2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005), and [Ch1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#004). The Jewish writers almost
universally omit the fractions of a year.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 2:12</span></span>

The "establishment" of the kingdom here intended is probably its
universal acceptance both by the tribe of Judah and the other
Israelites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 2:16</span></span>

Deny me not - literally, as in the margin, i. e. "make me not to hide my
face through shame at being refused."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 2:19</span></span>

A seat - Or, "a throne." We have here a proof of the high dignity of the
Queen-mother. Compare also [Kg1 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013);
[Kg2 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001). In the Persian court the
Queen-mother had often the chief power.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 2:22</span></span>

Ask for him the kingdom also - Bath-sheba had not seen anything
dangerous or suspicious in Adonijah's request. Solomon, on the contrary,
takes alarm at once. To ask for Abishag was to ask for the kingdom. To
the Oriental mind a monarch was so sacred, that whatever was brought
near to him was thenceforth separate from common use. This sacred and
separate character attached especially to the Royal harem. The inmates
either remained widows for the rest of their lives, or became the wives
of the deceased king's successor. When a monarch was murdered, or
dethroned, or succeeded by one whose title was doubtful, the latter
alternative was almost always adopted (compare [Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008); [Sa2
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#022)). Public opinion so closely
connected the title to the crown and the possession of the deceased
monarch's wives, that to have granted Adonijah's request would have been
the strongest encouragement to his pretensions. Solomon, seeing this,
assumes that Adonijah cherishes a guilty purpose, that there has been a
fresh plot, that Abiathar and Joab - Adonijah's counselors in the former
conspiracy [Kg1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007) - are privy to it,
and that the severest measures are necessary to crush the new treason.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 2:23</span></span>

Against his own life - Adonijah had forfeited his life by his former
conduct, and his pardon had been merely conditional [Kg1
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#052).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 2:24</span></span>

The phrase "making a house" means "continuing the posterity" of a
person, and, in the case of a royal person, "maintaining his descendants
upon the throne."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 2:26</span></span>

For Anathoth and the allusions in this verse, see the margin reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 2:27</span></span>

That he might fulfil the word of the L RD - We need not understand this
as stating that the fulfillment of the old prophecy was Solomon's
motive, or even one of his motives. The reference is to the overruling
providence of God, which thus brought about the fulfillment of the
prophecy. (Compare [Mat 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022); [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015); [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035), etc.) The deposition of
Abiathar involved the rejection of the house of Ithamar [Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003), to which Eli belonged, and the
reestablishment of the high priesthood in the line of Eleazar.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 2:28</span></span>

Joab followed the example of Adonijab (margin reference). The tabernacle
was now at Gibeon [Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004); [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 2:31</span></span>

It was only a murderer to whom the tabernacle was to be no protection
(margin reference). Hence, the reference to the "innocent blood."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 2:32</span></span>

Shalt return his blood - i. e. "his shedding of blood."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 2:33</span></span>

Upon the head of his seed - Compare the margin reference. Nothing
further is heard of Joab's descendants in the history.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 2:34</span></span>

Retribution overtook Joab on the very scene (Gibeon) of the most
treacherous of his murders. It was at the "great stone which is in
Gibeon" that Joab killed Amasa [Sa2
20:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 2:35</span></span>

The high priesthood had been for some time in a certain sense divided
between Zadok and Abiathar. (See the [Kg1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#008) note). Henceforth, Zadok became
sole high priest.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 2:36</span></span>

The object, apparently, was to keep Shimei under the immediate eye of
the government. Shimei's old home, Bahurim, lay east of Jerusalem, on
the road to Jericho, [Sa2 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#018), and
could only be reached by crossing the Kedron valley. Solomon assumes,
that, if he quits the city, it will probably be in this direction [Kg1
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 2:39</span></span>

Achish - Possibly the Achish of the marginal reference, but more
probably the grandson of the former Achish.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 2:42</span></span>

Did I not make thee to swear - The Septuagint add to [Kg1
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037) a clause stating that Solomon
"made Shimei swear" on the day when he commanded him to reside at
Jerusalem.
