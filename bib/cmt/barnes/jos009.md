### [Joshua Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 9:0</span></span>

The two verses serve as a general introduction to Josh. 9-11. The
Canaanites had recovered to some extent from their panic [Jos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001), perhaps in consequence of the
repulse of the Israelites before Ai. They resolved to make a league and
to resist jointly the progress of the Israelites. The defection of
Gibeon Josh. 9:3-27 determined the five kings of the Amorites, whose
territories were nearest Gibeon, to take instant action against that
city. Their forces were defeated by Joshua in the battle before Gibeon
([Jos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001) ff). The other confederates
subsequently gathered their armies together, [Jos
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001), and were defeated at the
waters of Merom ([Jos 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006) ff). The
former of these two great battles gave Joshua possession of the southern
half of Palestine west of Jordan; the latter of the northern half.

[Joshua 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 9:1</span></span>

In the hills - See the [Num 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017)
note.

The valleys - Or "the vale" (the Shephelah, [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007)), which imports the lowland
country between the mountains and the sea coast.

[Joshua 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 9:3</span></span>

Gibeon was the head of the four towns [Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017) occupied by the Hivites [Jos
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019). The inhabitants were Amorites
[Sa2 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#002); the name "Amorites" being
used as a general name for the Canaanite population ([Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044) note). The Hivites seem to have
had a non-monarchical form of government (compare [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003), [Jos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011)), but their city was [Jos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002) in size and importance equal to
those cities which the kings of the country made their capitals. Gibeon
signifies "pertaining to a hill," i. e. built on a hill (compare Gibeah
and Geba, towns in the same neighborhood), and describes the site, which
is on two of the rounded hills unique to this district. It is still
known as El-Jib, and lies about five miles north of Jerusalem by the
most direct route. It stands at the head of the pass of Beth-horon,
through which lies the main route from Jerusalem and the lower Jordan
valley to Joppa and the sea coast. Thus from its position, no less than
from the number and valor of its people [Jos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002), it was one of the most important
cities of southern Canaan. Gibeon fell within the lot of Benjamin [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025), and was one of the cities
assigned to the priests [Jos 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017). In
later times it was famous as the scene of various events ([Sa2
2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012); [Sa2
20:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004); [Kg1
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028), compare with [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)). It was for a long time the
spot where the tabernacle of Moses, together with the brass altar of
burnt offering [Ch1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029) and other
portions of the sacred furniture, were placed. It was the scene of the
magnificent ceremonial with which Solomon inaugurated his reign 1 Kings
3, but no doubt lost much of its importance after the tabernacle and its
accompaniments were removed to the temple of Solomon.

[Joshua 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004)

They did work wilily - literally, "they also," or "they too, did work,
etc." The "also" serves, apparently, to connect the stratagem of the
Gibeonites with that employed by the Israelites before Ai. It hints that
the Gibeonites resolved to meet craft with craft.

Rent and bound up - i. e. the wine skins were torn and roughly repaired
by tying up the edges of the tear. The more thorough and careful way,
hardly feasible in a hasty journey, would have been to insert a patch.

[Joshua 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 9:6</span></span>

Camp at Gilgal - While Joshua was engaged in more distant enterprises,
the women, children, and property of the Israelites were left with a
sufficient guard at this place, where they had been established
immediately after crossing the Jordan [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009).

[Joshua 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 9:7</span></span>

Compare the marginal references.

[Joshua 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 9:14</span></span>

The elders of Israel [Jos 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018),
tasting what was offered them by the Gibeonites, pledged themselves
according to the usage of Eastern nations to peace and friendship with
them. They credited the story at once, instead of seeking the direction
of God in the matter. The rendering of the margin is not to be preferred
to that of the text.

At the mouth of the Lord - i. e. by the Urim and Thummim [Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030).

[Joshua 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 9:17</span></span>

Chephirah (Kefir) is situated eight or nine miles west of Gibeon, and
was an inhabited city in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah [Ezr
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#025); [Neh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#029).

Beeroth (Birch), about eight miles north of Jerusalem. Kirjath-jearim,
i. e. "city of woods," is identified by Robinson with the modern Kuriet
el Enab, nine miles from Jerusalem on the road to Jaffa (and by Conder
with Soba). The town was numbered among those belonging to Judah, and
was in the northern boundary of that tribe. Beyond this city the six
hundred Danites encamped on their famous expedition to Laish [Jdg
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#012). Kirjath-jearim was also, and
probably before the Israelite conquests exclusively, called Baalah and
Kirjath-baal [Jos 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009), [Jos
15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060), names which seem to point to
its early sanctity as a special seat of Baal-worship. To this place also
the ark was brought from Beth-shemesh after it was sent back by the
Philistines, and here it remained for twenty years [Sa1
6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#020); [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002). It was fetched thence by David
and deposited in the house of Obed-edom [Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002). Hence, the allusion, [Psa
132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006), where David is said to have
found the ark "in the fields of the wood."

[Joshua 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 9:21</span></span>

Render "they shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water:" menial
duties belonging to the lowest classes only (compare the marginal
reference). The curse of Noah [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025) on the children of Ham was thus
fulfilled to the letter in the case of these Hivites.

[Joshua 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 9:22</span></span>

Were the Israelites bound to respect an oath thus procured by fraud?
Were they right in doing so? Dr. Sanderson ("Works," vol. iv. 4 pp. 269,
300, Oxford edition), determines these questions in the affirmative; and
rightly, since the oath, though unlawfully taken, was not an oath taken
to do an unlawful thing, i. e. a thing in itself unlawful. It was the
carelessness of the Israelites themselves which betrayed them into this
league. It was therefore their duty when they found themselves entrapped
into this unlawful covenant, to devise means by which they might respect
both their own oath and God's purposes as intimated in His injunctions
[Deu 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002) against sparing the
Canaanites. This was accomplished by granting their lives to the
Gibeonites, but reducing them to a servile condition, which might be
expected to disable them from influencing the Israelites to do wrong. It
may be added, that had the Israelites broken their oath, taken solemnly
in the Name of the Lord, they would have brought that Name into contempt
among the pagan; and, while punishing perfidy in others, would have
themselves, the Lord's people, incurred the reproach of perjury. The
result showed that Joshua and the princes judged rightly in this matter.
God gave to Israel a notable victory, crowned with special miracles,
over the kings who were confederated against Gibeon, because of the
treaty made with Israel [Jos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#004),
[Jos 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008),[Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013); and God punished as a national
act of blood-guiltiness the slaughter of the Gibeonites by Saul, which
was a distinct violation of the covenant here before us (compare [Sa2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001)). This sparing of the Gibeonites,
as well as the previous sparing of Rahab and her household, must be
borne in mind when the massacre of the Canaanites by Joshua and the
Israelites is discussed.

[Joshua 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 9:24</span></span>

It was mere fear which drove the Gibeonites to act as they did. They
sought for union with God's people, not for its own sake, but to save
their lives. Rahab's motives were higher ([Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009) ff). Hence, she was adopted into
Israel; the Gibeonites remained forever bondsmen of Israel.
