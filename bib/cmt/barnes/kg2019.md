### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 19:1</span></span>

Hezekiah, like his officers, probably rent his clothes on account of
Rab-shakeh's blasphemies: and he put on sackcloth in self-humiliation
and in grief. The only hope left was in Yahweh, for Egypt could not be
trusted to effect anything of importance. Rab-shakeh's boldness had told
upon Hezekiah. He was dispirited and dejected. He perhaps began to doubt
whether he had done right in yielding to the bolder counsels of Eliakim
and Isaiah. He had not lost his faith in God; but his faith was being
severely tried. He wisely went and strove by prayer to strengthen it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 19:2</span></span>

Isaiah is here for the first time introduced into the history. His own
writings show us how active a part he had taken in it for many years
previously. This was the fourth reign since he began his prophesyings;
and during two reigns at least, those of Ahaz and Hezekiah, he had been
a familiar counselor of the monarch. He had probably counseled the
revolt from Assyria, and had encouraged the king and people to persevere
in their resistance. The exact date of prophecies can seldom be fixed
with any certainty; but we can scarcely he mistaken in regarding 2 Kings
10; 30; 31 as written about the time of Hezekiah's second revolt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 19:3</span></span>

The "trouble" consisted in rebuke" (rather, "chastisement,") for sins at
the hand of God, and "blasphemy" (rather, "reproach,") at the hands of
man.

The children ... - i. e., "we are in a fearful extremity - at the last
gasp - and lack the strength that might carry us through the danger."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 19:4</span></span>

Will hear - i. e., "will show that he has heard - will notice and
punish."

The living God - See [Sa1 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026) note.

And will reprove the words - Rather, "will reprove him for the words."

The remnant - i. e., for the kingdom of Judah, the only remnant of God's
people that was now left, after Galilee and Gilead and Samaria had all
been carried away captive.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 19:7</span></span>

Will send a blast upon him - Rather, "I will put a spirit in him " - i.
e., "I will take from him his present pride and will put in him a new
spirit, a spirit of craven fear." Men shall tell him of the destruction
that has come upon his host [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035), and he shall straightway
return, etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 19:8</span></span>

On Lachish and Libnah, see [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003),
note; [Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029), note. The phrase,
"he was departed from Lachish" is suggestive of successful resistance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 19:9</span></span>

Tirhakah king of Ethiopia - The Tehrak or Teharka of the hieroglyphics.
He was the last king of the 25th or Ethiopian dynasty, which commenced
with Shebek or Sabaco, and he reigned upward of 26 years. The Assyrian
inscriptions show that he still ruled in Egypt as late as 667 B.C., when
Esarhaddon [Kg2 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037) died, and his
son Asshur-bani-pal succeeded him. He probably ascended the Egyptian
throne about 692 B.C., having previously ruled over Ethiopia before he
became king of Egypt (compare [Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)). Thus he was probably reigning
in Ethiopia at the time of Sennacherib's expedition, while Sethos and
perhaps other secondary monarchs bore rule over Egypt. His movements
caused Sennacherib to send a second embassy, instead of marching in
person against the Jewish king.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 19:11</span></span>

All lands - This boast is in strict accordance with the general tenor of
the Assyrian inscriptions. Hyperbole is the general language of the
East; but in this instance it was not so extreme as in some others. The
Assyrians under Sargon and Sennacherib had enjoyed an uninterrupted
series of military successes: they had succeeded in establishing their
pre-eminence from the Median desert to the banks of the Nile, and from
the shores of Lake Van to those of the Persian Gulf.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 19:12</span></span>

Haran - Harran, the Carrhae of the Greeks and Romans [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031), was among the earliest
conquests of the Assyrians; being subject to them from the 12th century.
Its conquest would have naturally followed that of Gozan (Gauzanitis,
[Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006)), which lay between it and
Assyria proper.

Rezeph - Probably the Rozappa of the Assyrian inscriptions, a city in
the neighborhood of Haran.

The children of Eden - Or, "the Beni-Eden," who appear from the Assyrian
inscriptions to have inhabited the country on the east bank of the
Euphrates, about the modern Balis. Here they had a city called
Beth-Adina, taken by the Assyrians about 880 B.C. This is probably the
"Eden" of marginal reference.

Thelasar - Or Telassar. Probably a city on the Euphrates, near
Beth-Adina, called after the name of the god Asshur. The name would
signify "the Hill of Asshur."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 19:13</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024). [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012) refers to former Assyrian
successes, [Kg2 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#013) to comparatively
recent ones.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 19:14</span></span>

Hezekiah received the letter - The inscriptions show that scribes
accompanied the Assyrian armies, with the materials of their craft, so
that such a dispatch might be easily drawn up. As Hezekiah himself
"read" it, we may presume that it was in the Hebrew tongue.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 19:15</span></span>

Which dwellest between the cherubims - The reference is to the
shechinah, or miraculous glory, which from time to time appeared above
the mercy-seat from between the two cherubims, whose wings overshadowed
the ark of the covenant ([Kg1 6:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023);
compare [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022); [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002), etc.).

Thou art the God, even thou alone - This is the protest of the pure
theist against the intense polytheism of Sennacherib's letter, which
assumes that gods are only gods of particular nations, and that
Hezekiah's God is but one out of an indefinite number, no stronger or
more formidable than the rest.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 19:18</span></span>

Have cast their gods into the fire - In general the Assyrians carried
off the images of the gods from the temples of the conquered nations,
and deposited them in their own shrines, as at once trophies of victory
and proof of the superiority of the Assyrian deities over those of their
enemies. But sometimes the gods are said to have been "destroyed" or
"burnt with fire;" which was probably done when the idols were of rude
workmanship or coarse material; and when it was inconvenient to encumber
an army with spoils so weighty and difficult, of transport.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 19:19</span></span>

If the mighty army of the great Assyrian king were successfully defied
by a petty monarch like Hezekiah, it would force the surrounding nations
to confess that the escape was owing to the protecting hand of Yahweh.
They would thus be taught, in spite of themselves, that He, and He
alone, was the true God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 19:21</span></span>

Concerning him - i. e., "concerning Sennacherib." [Kg2
19:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021) are addressed to the great
Assyrian monarch himself, and are God's reply to his proud boastings.

The virgin, the daughter of Zion, - Rather, holy eastern city, is here
distinguished from Jerusalem, the western one, and is given the
remarkable epithet "virgin," which is not applied to her sister;
probably because the true Zion, the city of David, had remained
inviolable from David's time, having never been entered by an enemy.
Jerusalem, on the other hand, had been taken, both by Shishak [Kg1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026) and by Jehoash [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013). The personification of cities
as females is a common figure (compare marginal references).

Hath shaken her head at thee - This was a gesture of scorn with the
Hebrews (compare the marginal references; [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 19:22</span></span>

The Holy One of Israel - This is a favorite phrase with Isaiah, in whose
prophecies it is found 27 times, while it occurs five times only in the
rest of Scripture [Psa 71:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022); [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041); [Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018); [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029); [Jer
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005). Its occurrence here is a strong
proof - one among many - of the genuineness of the present passage,
which is not the composition of the writer of Kings, but an actual
prophecy delivered at this time by Isaiah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 19:23</span></span>

And hast said - Isaiah clothes in words the thoughts of Sennacherib's
heart - thoughts of the most extreme self-confidence. Compare [Isa
10:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007), where, probably at an earlier
date, the same overweening pride is ascribed to this king.

With the multitude of my chariots - There are two readings here, which
give, however, nearly the same sense. The more difficult and more
poetical of the two is to be preferred. Literally, translated it runs -
"With chariots upon chariots am I come up, etc."

To the sides of Lebanon - , "Lebanon," with its "cedars" and its
"fir-trees," is to be understood here both literally and figuratively.
Literally, the hewing of timber in Lebanon was an ordinary feature of an
Assyrian expedition into Syria. Figuratively, the mountain represents
all the more inaccessible parts of Palestine, and the destruction of its
firs and cedars denotes the complete devastation of the entire country
from one end to the other.

The lodgings of his borders - literally, "the lodge of its (Lebanon's)
end;" either an actual habitation situated on the highest point of the
mountain-range, or a poetical periphrasis for the highest point itself.

The forest of his Carmel - Or, "the forest of its garden" - i. e., "its
forest which is like a garden," etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 19:24</span></span>

Have digged and drunk ... and dried up - The meaning seems to be -
"Mountains do not stop me - I cross them even in my chariots. Deserts do
not stop me - I dig wells there, and drink the water. Rivers do not stop
me - I pass them as easily as if they were dry land."

The rivers of besieged places - Rather, "the rivers of Egypt." The
singular form, Mazor (compare the modern Misr and the Assyrian Muzr), is
here used instead of the ordinary dual form, Mizraim, perhaps because
"Lower Egypt" only is intended. This was so cut up with canals and
branches of the Nile, natural and artificial, that it was regarded as
impassable for chariots and horses. Sennacherib, however, thought that
these many streams would prove no impediments to him; he would advance
as fast as if they were "dried up."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 19:25</span></span>

Hast thou not heard long ago ... - Rather, "Hast thou not heard, that
from long ago I did this, from ancient times I fashioned it? etc." The
former part of the verse refers to the secret divine decrees, whereby
the affairs of this world are determined and ordered from the very
beginning of things. Sennacherib's boasting, however, proved that he did
not know this, that he did not recognize himself simply as God's
instrument - "the rod of His anger" [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005) - but regarded his victories as
gained by his own "strength and wisdom" [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 19:26</span></span>

The weakness of the nations exposed to the Assyrian attacks was as much
owing to the divine decrees as was the strength of the Assyrians
themselves.

The grass on the house tops - Compare the marginal reference. The
vegetation on the flat roofs of Oriental houses is the first to spring
up and the first to fade away.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 19:27</span></span>

See [Kg1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 19:28</span></span>

Thy tumult - Rather, "thy arrogance."

I will put my hook in nose - Rather, "my ring." The sculptures show that
the kings of Babylon and Assyria were in the habit of actually passing a
ring through the flesh of their more distinguished prisoners, of
attaching a thong or a rope to it, and of thus leading them about as
with a "bridle." In Assyria the ring was, at least ordinarily, passed
through the lower lip; while in Babylonia it appears to have been
inserted into the membrane of the nose. Thus Sennacherib would be here
threatened with a punishment which he was perhaps in the habit of
inflicting.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 19:29</span></span>

The prophet now once more addresses Hezekiah, and gives him a "sign," or
token, whereby he and his may be assured that Sennacherib is indeed
bridled, and will not trouble Judaea anymore. It was a sign of the
continued freedom of the land from attack during the whole of the
remainder of Sennacherib's reign - a space of 17 years.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 19:30</span></span>

The remnant that is escaped - Terrible ravages seem to have been
committed in the first attack ([Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013) note). And though the second
invasion was comparatively harmless, yet it probably fell heavily on the
cities of the west and the southwest. Thus the "escaped" were but "a
remnant."

Bear fruit upward - The flourishing time of Josiah is the special
fulfillment of this prophecy [Kg2
23:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 19:32</span></span>

Nor come before it with shield - The "shields" of the Assyrians are very
conspicuous in the sculptures, and were of great importance in a siege,
since the assailing archers were in most instances defended, as they
shot their weapons, by a comrade, who held before himself and his friend
a shield of an enormous size. It was made of a framework of wood, filled
in with wattling, and perhaps lined with skin; it was rested upon the
ground, and it generally curved backward toward the top; ordinarily it
somewhat exceeded the height of a man. From the safe covert afforded by
these large defenses the archers were able to take deliberate aim, and
deliver their volleys with effect.

Nor cast a bank against it - "Mounds" or "banks" were among the most
common of the means used by the Assyrians against a besieged town. They
were thrown up against the walls, and consisted of loose earth, trees,
brushwood, stones, and rubbish. Sometimes the surface of the mound was
regularly paved with several layers of stone or brick, which formed a
solid road or causeway capable of bearing a great weight. The intention
was not so much to bring the mounds to a level with the top of the
walls, as to carry them to such a height as should enable the
battering-ram to work effectively. Walls were made very solid toward
their base, for the purpose of resisting the ram; halfway up their
structure was comparatively weak and slight. The engines of the
assailants, rams and catapults, where therefore far more serviceable if
they could attack the upper and weaker portion of the defenses; and it
was to enable them to reach these portions that the "mounds" were
raised.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 19:33</span></span>

By the way that he came - i. e., through the low country of the
Shephelah, thus avoiding not only Jerusalem, but even Judaea.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 19:34</span></span>

For mine own sake - God's honor was concerned to defend His own city
against one who denied His power in direct terms, as did Sennacherib
[Kg2 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#035); [Kg2
19:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#010). His faithfulness was also
concerned to keep the promise made to David [Psa
132:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 19:35</span></span>

The camp of the Assyrians - Which was now moved to Pelusium, if we may
trust Herodotus; or which, at any rate, was at some considerable
distance from Jerusalem.

When they arose early in the morning, behold ... - These words form the
only trustworthy data that we possess for determining to any extent the
manner of the destruction now worked. They imply that there was no
disturbance during the night, no alarm, no knowledge on the part of the
living that their comrades were dying all around them by thousands. All
mere natural causes must be rejected, and God must be regarded as having
slain the men in their sleep without causing disturbance, either by
pestilence or by that "visitation" of which English law speaks. The most
nearly parallel case is the destruction of the first-born, [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029).

The Egyptian version of this event recorded in Herodotus is that, during
the night, silently and secretly, an innumerable multitude of field-mice
spread themselves through the Assyrian host, and gnawed their quivers,
bows, and shield-straps, so as to render them useless. When morning
broke, the Assyrians fled hastily, and the Egyptians pursuing put a vast
number to the sword.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 19:36</span></span>

Dwelt at Nineveh - The meaning is not that Sennacherib made no more
expeditions at all, which would he untrue, for his annals show us that
he warred in Armenia, Babylonia, Susiana, and Cilicia, during his later
years; but that he confined himself to his own part of Asia, and did not
invade Palestine or threaten Jerusalem anymore. Nineveh, marked by some
ruins opposite Mosul, appears here unmistakably as the Assyrian capital,
which it became toward the close of the 9th century B.C. It has
previously been mentioned only in Genesis (marginal reference).
Sennacherib was the first king who made it his permanent residence. Its
great size and large population are marked in the description of Jonah
[Jon 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#002); [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011), whose visit probably fell about
760 B.C.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 19:37</span></span>

The death of Sennacherib, which took place many years afterward (680
B.C.), is related here, as, from the divine point of view, the sequel to
his Syrian expeditions.

Nisroch his god - Nisroch has not been as yet identified with any known
Assyrian deity. The word may not be the name of a god at all but the
name of the temple, as Josephus understood it. Assyrian temples were
almost all distinguished by special names. If this be the true solution,
the translation should run - "As he was worshipping his god in the house
Nisroch."

They escaped into the land of Armenia - literally, "the land of Ararat,"
or the northeastern portion of Armenia, where it adjoined Media. The
Assyrian inscriptions show that Armenia was at this time independent of
Assyria, and might thus afford a safe refuge to the rebels.

Esar-haddon (or Esar-chaddon), is beyond a doubt the Asshur-akh-iddin of
the inscriptions, who calls himself the son, and appears to be the
successor of Sin-akh-irib. He commenced his reign by a struggle with his
brother Adrammelech, and occupied the throne for only thirteen years,
when he was succeeded by his son, Sardanapalus or Asshur-bani-pal. He
warred with Phoenicia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, and Media, and built three
palaces, one at Nineveh, and the others at Calah and Babylon.
