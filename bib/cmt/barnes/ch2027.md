### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 27:1</span></span>

This short chapter runs parallel with 2 Kings (marginal reference), and
is taken mainly from the same source or sources which it amplifies.

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

Ophel was the name given to the long, narrowish, rounded spur or
promontory, which intervenes between the central valley of Jerusalem
(the Tyropoeon) and the Kidron, or valley of Jehoshaphat. The anxiety of
Uzziah and Jotham to fortify their territory indicates a fear of
external attack, which at this time was probably felt mainly in
connection with Samaria and Syria ([Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037) note). The faithless trust put
in fortifications was rebuked by the prophets of the time [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014); [Isa
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015).

[2 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 27:5</span></span>

The Ammonites, who had submitted to Uzziah [Ch2
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008), revolted against Jotham. This
revolt he firmly repressed; and, to punish it, he exacted a high rate of
tribute for the three years following the termination of the war. The
productiveness of the Ammonite country in grain, which is here
indicated, has been remarked upon as extraordinary by modern travelers.
