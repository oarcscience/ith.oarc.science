The Epistle to the Church at Sardis

The contents of the epistle to the church at Sardis [Rev
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md) are:

\(1\) The usual salutation to the angel of the church, [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md).

\(2\) the usual reference to the attributes of the Saviour - those
referred to here being that he had the seven Spirits of God, and the
seven stars, [Rev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md).

\(3\) the assurance that he knew their works, [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md).

\(4\) the statement of the uniqueness of the church, or what he saw in
it - that it had a name to live and was dead, [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md).

\(5\) a solemn direction to the members of the church, arising from
their character and circumstances, to be watchful, and to strengthen the
things which remained, but which were ready to die; to remember what
they had received, and to hold fast what had been communicated to them,
and to repent of all their sins, [Rev
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md).

\(6\) a threat that if they did not do this, he would come suddenly upon
them, at an hour which they could not anticipate, [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md).

\(7\) a commendation of the church as far as it could be done, for there
were still a few among them who had not defiled their garments, and a
promise that they should walk before him in white, [Rev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md).

\(8\) a promise, as usual, to him that should be victorious. The promise
here is, that he should walk before him in white; that his name should
not be blotted out of the book of life; that he should be acknowledged
before the Father, and before the angels, [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

\(9\) the usual call on all persons to hear what the Spirit said to the
churches.

Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, one of the
provinces of Asia Minor, and was situated at the foot of Mount Tmolus,
in a fine plain watered by the river Pactolus, famous for its golden
sands. It was the capital where the celebrated Croesus, proverbial for
his wealth, reigned. It was taken by Cyrus (548 bc), when Croesus was
king, and was at that time one of the most splendid and opulent cities
of the East. It subsequently passed into the hands of the Romans, and
under them sank rapidly in wealth and importance. In the time of
Tiberius it was destroyed by an earthquake, but was rebuilt by order of
the emperor. The inhabitants of Sardis bore an ill repute among the
ancients for their voluptuous modes of life. Perhaps there may be an
allusion to this fact in the words which are used in the address to the
church there: "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not
defiled their garments."

Successive earthquakes, and the ravages of the Saracens and the Turks,
have reduced this once-celebrated city to a heap of ruins, though
exhibiting still many remains of former splendor. The name of the
village which now occupies the place of this ancient capital is Sart. It
is a miserable village, comprising only a few wretched cottages,
occupied by Turks and Greeks. There are ruins of the theater, the
stadium, and of some ancient churches. The most remarkable of the ruins
are two pillars supposed to have belonged to the temple of Cybele; and
if so, they are among the most ancient in the world, the temple of
Cybele having been built only three hundred years after that of Solomon.
The Acropolis serves well to define the site of the city. Several
travelers have recently visited the remains of Sardis, and its
appearance will be indicated by a few extracts from their writings.
Arundell, in his "Discoveries in Asia Minor," says: "If I were asked
what impresses the mind most strongly in beholding Sardis, I should say
its indescribable solitude, like the darkness of Egypt - darkness that
could be felt. So the deep solitude of the spot, once the 'lady of
kingdoms,' produces a corresponding feeling of desolate abandonment in
the mind, which can never be forgotten."

John Hartley, in regard to these ruins, remarks: "The ruins are, with
one exception, more entirely gone to decay than those of most of the
ancient cities which we have visited. No Christians reside on the spot:
two Greeks only work in a mill here, and a few wretched Turkish huts are
scattered among the ruins. We saw the churches of John and the Virgin,
the theater, and the building styled the Palace of Croesus; but the most
striking object at Sardis is the temple of Cybele. I was filled with
wonder and awe at beholding the two stupendous columns of this edifice,
which are still remaining: they are silent but impressive witnesses of
the power and splendor of antiquity."

The impression produced on the mind is vividly described in the
following language of a recent traveler, who lodged there for a night:
"Every object was as distinct as in a northern twilight; the snowy
summit of the mountain (Tmolus), the long sweep of the valley, and the
flashing current of the river (Pactolus). I strolled along toward the
banks of the Pactolus, and seated myself by the side of the
half-exhausted stream.

"There are few individuals who cannot trace on the map of their memory
some moments of overpowering emotion, and some scene, which, once dwelt
upon, has become its own painter, and left behind it a memorial that
time could not efface. I can readily sympathize with the feelings of him
who wept at the base of the pyramids; nor were my own less powerful, on
that night when I sat beneath the sky of Asia to gaze upon the ruins of
Sardis, from the banks of the golden-sanded Pactolus. Beside me were the
cliffs of the Acropolis, which, centuries before, the hardy Median
scaled, while leading on the conquering Persians, whose tents had
covered the very spot on which I was reclining. Before me were the
vestiges of what had been the palace of the gorgeous Croesus; within its
walls were once congregated the wisest of mankind, Thales, Cleobulus,
and Solon. It was here that the wretched father mourned alone the
mangled corse of his beloved Atys; it was here that the same humiliated
monarch wept at the feet of the Persian boy who wrung from him his
kingdom. Far in the distance were the gigantic "tumuli" of the Lydian
monarchs, Candaules, Halyattys, and Gyges; and around them were spread
those very plains once trodden by the countless hosts of Xerxes, when
hurrying on to find a sepulchre at Marathon.

"There were more varied and more vivid remembrances associated with the
sight of Sardis than could possibly be attached to any other spot of
earth; but all were mingled with a feeling of disgust at the littleness
of human glory. All - all had passed away! There were before me the
fanes of a dead religion, the tombs of forgotten monarchs, and the
palm-tree that waved in the banquet-hall of kings; while the feeling of
desolation was doubly heightened by the calm sweet sky above me, which,
in its unfading brightness, shone as purely now as when it beamed upon
the golden dreams of Croesus" (Emerson's "Letters from the Aegean," p.
113ff). The present appearance of the ruins is shown by the engraving in
this volume.

And unto the angel of the church in Sardis - notes on [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md).

These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God - See the notes
on [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md). If the phrase, "the seven
Spirits of God," as there supposed, refers to the Holy Spirit, there is
great propriety in saying of the Saviour, that he has that Spirit,
inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is represented as sent forth by him into the
world, [Joh 15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md), [Joh
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md). It was one of the highest
characteristics that could be given of the Saviour to say, that the Holy
Spirit was his to send forth into the world, and that that great Agent,
on whose gracious influences all were dependent for the possession of
true religion, could be given or withheld by him at his pleasure.

And the seven stars - See the notes on [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md). These represented the angels of
the seven churches (notes on [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020).md); and the idea which the Saviour
would seem to intend to convey here is, that he had entire control over
the ministers of the churches, and could keep or remove them at
pleasure.

I know thy works - See the notes on [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md).

That thou hast a name that thou livest - Thou dost profess attachment to
me and my cause. The word "life" is a word that is commonly employed, in
the New Testament, to denote religion, in contradistinction from the
natural state of man, which is described as death in sin. By the
profession of religion they expressed the purpose to live unto God, and
for another world; they professed to have true, spiritual life.

And art dead - That is, spiritually. This is equivalent to saying that
their profession was merely in name; and yet this must be understood
comparatively, for there were some even in Sardis who truly lived unto
God, [Rev 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md). The meaning is, that in
general, the profession of religion among them was a mere name. The
Saviour does not, as in the case of the churches of Ephesus and
Thyatira, specify any prevailing form of error or false doctrine; but it
would seem that here it was a simple waist of religion.

[Revelation 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 3:2</span></span>

Be watchful - Be wakeful; be attentive and earnest - in
contradistinction from the drowsy condition of the church.

Strengthen the things which remain - The true piety that still lives and
lingers among you. Whatever there was of religion among them, it was of
importance to strengthen it, that the love of the Saviour might not
become wholly extinct. An important duty in a low and languishing state
of religion is, to "strengthen the things that still survive." It is to
cultivate all the graces which do exist; to nourish all the love of
truth which may linger in the church; and to confirm, by warm
exhortation, and by a reference to the gracious promises of God's word,
the few who may be endeavoring to do their duty, and who, amidst many
discouragements, are aiming to be faithful to the Saviour. In the lowest
state of religion in a church there may be a few, perhaps quite obscure
and of humble rank, who are mourning over the desolations of Zion, and
who are sighing for better times. All such it is the duty of the
ministers of religion to comfort and encourage; for it is in their
hearts that piety may be kept alive in the church - it is through them
that it may be hoped religion may yet be revived. In the apparent
hopelessness of doing much good to others, good may always be done to
the cause itself by preserving and strengthening what there may be of
life among those few, amidst the general desolation and death. It is
much to preserve life in grain sown in a field through the long and
dreary winter, when all seems to be dead - for it will burst forth, with
new life and beauty, in the spring. When the body is prostrate with
disease, and life just lingers, and death seems to be coming on, it is
much to preserve the little strength that remains; much to keep the
healthful parts from being invaded, that there may be strength yet to
recover.

That are ready to die - That seem just ready to become extinct. So,
sometimes, in a plant, there seems to be but the least conceivable life
remaining, and it appears that it must die. So, when we are sick, there
seems to be but the feeblest glimmering of life, and it is apparently
just ready to go out. So, when a fire dies away, there seems but a spark
remaining, and it is just ready to become extinct. And thus, in religion
in the soul - religion in a church - religion in a community - it often
seems as if it were just about to go out forever.

For I have not found thy works perfect before God - I have not found
them complete or full. They come short of what is required. Of what
church, of what individual Christian, is not this true? Whom might not
the Saviour approach with the same language? It was true, however, in a
marked and eminent sense, of the church at Sardis.

[Revelation 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 3:3</span></span>

Remember therefore how thou hast received - This may refer either to
some uniqueness in the manner in which the gospel was conveyed to them -
as, By the labors of the apostles, and by the remarkable effusions of
the Holy Spirit; or to the ardor and love with which they embraced it;
or to the greatness of the favors and privileges conferred on them; or
to their own understanding of what the gospel required, when they were
converted. It is not possible to determined in which sense the language
is used; but the general idea is plain, that there was something marked
and unusual in the way in which they had been led to embrace the gospel,
and that it was highly proper in these circumstances to look back to the
days when they gave themselves to Christ. It is always well for
Christians to call to remembrance the "day of their espousals," and
their views and feelings when they gave their hearts to the Saviour, and
to compare those views with their present condition, especially if their
conversion was marked by anything unusual.

And heard - How thou didst hear the gospel in former times; that is,
with what earnestness and attention thou didst embrace it. This would
rather seem to imply that the reference in the whole passage is to the
fact that they embraced the gospel with great ardor and zeal.

And hold fast -

\(1\) Hold fast the truths which thou didst then receive;

\(2\) hold fast what remains of true religion among you.

And repent - Repent in regard to all that in which you have departed
from your views and feelings when you embraced the gospel.

If therefore thou shalt not watch - The speaker evidently supposed that
it was possible that they would not regard the warning; that they would
presume that they would be safe if they refused to give heed to it, or,
that by mere inattention and indifference they might suffer the warning
to pass by unheeded. Similar results have been so common in the world as
to make such a supposition not improbable, and to make proper, in other
cases as well as that, the solemn threatening that he would come
suddenly upon them.

I will come on thee as a thief - In a sudden and unexpected manner. See
the notes on [Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md).

And ye shall not know what hour I will come upon thee - You shall not
know beforehand; you shall have no warning of my immediate approach.
This is often the way in which God comes to people in his heavy
judgments. Long beforehand, he admonishes us, indeed, of what must be
the consequences of a course of sin, and warns us to turn from it; but
when sinners refuse to attend to his warning, and still walk in the way
of evil, he comes suddenly, and cuts them down. Every man who is warned
of the evil of his course, and who refuses or neglects to repent, has
reason to believe that God will come suddenly in his wrath, and call him
to his bar, [Pro 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001.md). No such man can
presume on impunity; no one who is warned of his guilt and danger can
feel that he is for one moment safe. No one can have any basis of
calculation that he will be spared; no one can flatter himself with any
probable anticipation that he will have time to repent when God comes to
take him away. Benevolence has done its appropriate work in warning him
- how can the Great Judge of all be to blame, if he comes then, and
suddenly cuts the sinner off?

[Revelation 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 3:4</span></span>

Thou hast a few names even in Sardis - See the analysis of the chapter.
The word "names" here is equivalent to "persons"; and the idea is, that
even in a place so depraved, and where religion had so much declined,
there were a few persons who had kept themselves free from the general
contamination. In most cases, when error and sin prevail, there may be
found a few who are worthy of the divine commendation; a few who show
that true religion may exist even when the mass are evil. Compare the
notes on [Rom 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md).

Which have not defiled their garments - Compare the notes on [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md). The meaning is, that they had
not defiled themselves by coming in contact with the profane and the
polluted; or, in other words, they had kept themselves free from the
prevailing corruption. They were like persons clothed in white walking
in the midst of the defiled, yet keeping their raiment from being
soiled.

And they shall walk with me in white - White is the emblem of innocence,
and is hence appropriately represented as the color of the raiment of
the heavenly inhabitants. The persons here referred to had kept their
garments uncontaminated on the earth, and as an appropriate reward it is
said that they would appear in white raiment in heaven. Compare [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md).

For they are worthy - They have shown themselves worthy to be regarded
as followers of the Lamb; or, they have a character that is suited for
heaven. The declaration is not that they have any claim to heaven on the
ground of their own merit, or that it will be in virtue of their own
works that they will be received there; but that there is a fitness or
propriety that they should thus appear in heaven. We are all personally
unworthy to be admitted to heaven, but we may evince such a character as
to show that, according to the arrangements of grace, it is fit and
proper that we should be received there. We have the character to which
God has promised eternal life.

[Revelation 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 3:5</span></span>

He that overcometh - See the notes on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

The same shall be clothed in white raiment - Whosoever he may be that
shall overcome sin and the temptations of this world, shall be admitted
to this glorious reward. The promise is made not only to those in Sardis
who should be victorious, but to all in every age and every land. The
hope that is thus held out before us, is that of appearing with the
Redeemer in his kingdom, clad in robes expressive of holiness and joy.

And I will not blot out his name out of the book of life - The book
which contains the names of those who are to live with him forever. The
names of his people are thus represented as enrolled in a book which he
keeps - a register of those who are to live forever. The phrase "book of
life" frequently occurs in the Bible, representing this idea. See the
notes on [Phi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md). Compare [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md), [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015.md); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019.md). The expression "I will not blot
out" means, that the names would be found there on the great day of
final account, and would be found there forever. It may be remarked,
that as no one can have access to that book but he who keeps it, there
is the most positive assurance that it will never be done, and the
salvation of the redeemed will be, therefore, secure. And let it be
remembered that the period is coming when it will be felt to be a higher
honor to have the name enrolled in that book than in the books of
heraldry - in the most splendid catalogue of princes, poets, warriors,
nobles, or statesmen that the world has produced.

But I will confess his name, ... - I will acknowledge him to be my
follower. See the notes on [Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md).

[Revelation 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 3:6</span></span>

He that hath an ear ... - See the notes on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

The Epistle to the Church in Philadelphia

This epistle [Rev 3:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md) comprises the
following subjects:

\(1\) The usual address to the angel of the church, [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md).

\(2\) the reference to some attribute or characteristic of the speaker,
[Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). He here addresses the church
as one who is holy and true; as he who has the key of David, and who can
shut and no one can open, and open and no one can shut. The
representation is that of one who occupies a royal palace, and who can
admit or exclude anyone whom he pleases. The reference to such a palace
is continued through the epistle.

\(3\) the usual declaration that he knows their works, and that he has
found that they had strength, though but a little, and had kept his
word, [Rev 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md).

\(4\) a declaration that he would constrain some who professed that they
were Jews, but who were of the synagogue of Satan, to come and humble
themselves before them, [Rev 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md).

\(5\) the particular promise to that church. He would keep them in the
hour of temptation that was coming to try all that dwelt upon the earth,
[Rev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md).

\(6\) the command addressed to them as to the other churches. He
solemnly enjoins it on them to see that no one should take their crown,
or deprive them of the reward which he would give to his faithful
followers, [Rev 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md).

\(7\) a general promise, in view of the circumstances in Philadelphia,
to all who should overcome, [Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md).
They would be made a pillar in the temple of God, and go no more out.
They would have written on themselves the name of his God, and the name
of the holy city - showing that they were inhabitants of the heavenly
world.

\(8\) the usual call on all to attend to what was said to the churches,
[Rev 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#013.md).

Philadelphia stood about 25 miles south-cast from Sardis, in the plain
of Hermus, and about midway between the river of that name and the
termination of Mount Tmolus. It was the second city in Lydia, and was
built by King Attalus Philadelphus, from whom it received its name. In
the year 133 b.c. the place passed, with the country in the vicinity,
under the dominion of the Romans. The site is reported by Strabo to be
liable to earthquakes, but it continued to be a place of importance down
to the Byzantine age; and, of all the towns in Asia Minor, it withstood
the Turks the longest. It was taken by Bajazat, 1392 a.d. "It still
exists as a Turkish town, under the name of Allah Shehr, 'City of God,'
that is, the 'High Town.' It covers a considerable extent of ground,
running up the slopes of four hills, or rather of one hill with four
flat summits. The country, as viewed from these hills, is extremely
magnificent - gardens and vineyards lying at the back and sides of the
town, and before it one of the most beautiful and extensive plains of
Asia. The missionaries Fisk and Parsons were informed by the Greek
bishop that the town contained 3,000 houses, of which he assigned 250 to
the Greeks, and the rest to the Turks (the mid-19th century). On the
same authority it is stated that there are five churches in the town,
besides twenty others which were too old or too small for use. Six
minarets, indicating as many mosques, are seen in the town, and one of
these mosques is believed by the native Christians to have been the
church in which assembled the primitive Christians addressed in the
Apocalypse. There are few ruins; but in one part are four pillars, which
are supposed to have been columns of a church.

One solitary pillar has been often noticed, as reminding beholders of
the remarkable words in the Apocalypse - 'Him that overcometh I will
make a pillar in the temple of my God'" (Kitto's Encyclopedia. See also
the Missionary Herald for 1821, p. 253; 1839, pp. 210-212). The town is
the seat of a Greek archbishop, with about twenty inferior clergy. The
streets are narrow, and are described as remarkably filthy. The
engraving in this volume will give a representation of the town as it
now appears.

[Revelation 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 3:7</span></span>

And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia - See the notes on [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md).

These things saith he that is holy - This refers undoubtedly to the Lord
Jesus. The appellation holy, or the holy one, is one that befits him,
and is not infrequently given to him in the New Testament, [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md); [Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md); [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md). It is not only an appellation
appropriate to the Saviour, but well adapted to be employed when he is
addressing the churches. Our impression of what is said to us will often
depend much on our idea of the character of him who addresses us, and
solemnity and thoughtfulness always become us when we are addressed by a
holy Redeemer.

He that is true - Another characteristic of the Saviour well suited to
be referred to when he addresses people. It is a characteristic often
ascribed to him in the New Testament ([Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md); [Joh
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040.md), [Joh
8:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#045.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md), and one which is eminently
adapted to impress the mind with solemn thought in view of the fact that
he is to pronounce on our character, and to determine our destiny.

He that hath the key of David - This expression is manifestly taken from
[Isa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md), "And the key of the house
of David will I lay upon his shoulder." See the passage explained in the
notes on that place. As used by Isaiah, the phrase is applied to
Eliakim; and it is not to be inferred, because the language here is
applied to the Lord Jesus, that originally it had any such reference.
"The application of the same terms," says Prof. Alexander on [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md), "to Peter [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md), and to Christ himself [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), does not prove that they here
refer to either, or that Eliakim was a type of Christ, but merely that
the same words admit of different applications." The language is what
properly denotes authority or control - as when one has the key of a
house, and has unlimited access to it; and the meaning here is, that as
David is represented as the king of Israel residing in a palace, so he
who had the key to that palace had regal authority.

He that openeth, and no man shutteth, ... - He has free and unrestrained
access to the house; the power of admitting anyone, or of excluding
anyone. Applied here to the Saviour, as king in Zion, this means that in
his kingdom he has the absolute control in regard to tire admission or
exclusion of anyone. He can prescribe the terms; he can invite whom he
chooses; he can exclude those whom he judges should not be admitted. A
reference to this absolute control was every way proper when he was
addressing a church, and is every way proper for us to reflect on when
we think of the subject of our personal salvation.

[Revelation 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 3:8</span></span>

I know thy works - See the notes on [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md).

Behold, I have set before thee an open door - Referring to his authority
as stated in [Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). The "open door"
here evidently refers to the enjoyment of some privilege or honor; and,
so far as the language is concerned, it may refer to any one of the
following things - either:

\(1\) the ability to do good - represented as the "opening of the door."
Compare [Act 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md); [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009.md); [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md).

\(2\) the privilege of access to the heavenly palace; that is, that they
had an abundant opportunity of securing their salvation, the door being
never closed against them by day or by night. Compare [Rev
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025.md). Or.

\(3\) it may mean that they had before them an open way of egress from
danger and persecution.

This latter Prof. Stuart supposes to be the true meaning; and argues
this because it is immediately specified that those Jewish persecutors
would be made to humble themselves, and that the church would but
lightly experience the troubles which were coming upon the world around
them. But the more natural interpretation of the phrase "an open door"
is that it refers to access to a thing rather than egress from a thing;
that we may come to what we desire to approach, rather than escape from
what we dread. There is no objection, it seems to me, to the supposition
that the language may be used here in the largest sense - as denoting
that, in regard to the church at Philadelphia, there was no restraint.
He had given them the most unlimited privileges. The temple of salvation
was thrown open to them; the celestial city was accessible; the whole
world was before them as a field of usefulness, and anywhere, and
everywhere, they might do good, and at all times they might have access
to the kingdom of God.

And no man can shut it - No one has the power of preventing this, for he
who has control over all things concedes these privileges to you.

For then hast a little strength - This would imply that they had not
great vigor, but still that, notwithstanding there were so many
obstacles to their doing good, and so many temptations to evil, there
still remained with them some degree of energy. They were not wholly
dead; and as long as that was the case, the door was still open for them
to do good. The words "little strength" may refer either to the
smallness of the number - meaning that they were few; or it may refer to
the spiritual life and energy of the church - meaning that, though
feeble, their vital energy was not wholly gone. The more natural
interpretation seems to be to refer it to the latter; and the sense is,
that although they had not the highest degree of energy, or had not all
that the Saviour desired they should have, they were not wholly dead.
The Saviour saw among them the evidences of spiritual life; and in view
of that he says he had set before them an open door, and there was
abundant opportunity to employ all the energy and zeal which they had.
It may be remarked that the same thing is true now; that wherever there
is any vitality in a church, the Saviour will furnish ample opportunity
that it may be employed in his service.

And hast not denied my name - When Christians were brought before pagan
magistrates in times of persecution, they were required to renounce the
name of Christ, and to disown him in a public manner. It is possible
that, amidst the persecutions that raged in the early times, the members
of the church at Philadelphia had been summoned to such a trial, and
they had stood the trial firmly. It would seem from the following verse,
that the efforts which had been made to induce them to renounce the name
of Christ had been made by those who professed to be Jews, though they
evinced the spirit of Satan. If so, then the attempt was probably to
convince them that Jesus was not the Christ. This attempt would be made
in all places where there were Jews.

[Revelation 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 3:9</span></span>

Behold, I will make - Greek, "I give" - δίδωμι didōmi; that is, I will
arrange matters so that this shall occur. The word implies that he had
power to do this, and consequently proves that he has power over the
heart of man, and Call secure such a result as he chooses.

Them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews - Who profess to
be Jews, but are really of the synagogue of Satan. See the notes on [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md). The meaning is, that, though they
were of Jewish extraction, and boasted much of being Jews, yet they were
really under the influence of Satan, and their assemblages deserved to
be called his "synagogue."

And are not, but do lie - It is a false profession altogether. Compare
notes on [Jo1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006.md).

Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet - The word
rendered "worship" here, means, properly, to full prostrate; and then to
do homage, or to worship in the proper sense, as this was commonly done
by falling prostrate. See the notes on [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md). So far as the word is concerned,
it may refer either to spiritual homage, that is, the worship of God; or
it may mean respect as shown to superiors. If it is used here in the
sense of divine worship properly so called, it means that they would be
constrained to come and worship "before them," or in their very
presence; if it is used in the more general signification, it means that
they would be constrained to show them honor and respect. The latter is
the probable meaning; that is, that they would be constrained to
acknowledge that they were the children of God, or that God regarded
them with his favor. It does not mean necessarily that they would
themselves be converted to Christ, but that, as they had been accustomed
to revile and oppose those who were true Christians, they would be
constrained to come and render them the respect due to those who were
sincerely endeavoring to serve their Maker. The truth taught here is,
that it is in the power of the Lord Jesus so to turn the hearts of all
the enemies of religion that they shall be brought to show respect to
it; so to incline the minds of all people that they shall honor the
church, or be at least outwardly its friends. Such homage the world
shall yet be constrained to pay to it.

And to know that I have loved thee - This explains what he had just
said, and shows that he means that the enemies of his church will yet be
constrained to acknowledge that it enjoys the smiles of God, and that
instead of being persecuted and reviled, it should be respected and
loved.

[Revelation 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 3:10</span></span>

Because thou hast kept the word of my patience - My word commanding or
enjoining patience; that is, thou hast manifested the patience which I
require. They had shown this in the trials which they had experienced;
he promises now, that in return he will keep them in the future trials
that shall come upon the world. One of the highest rewards of patience
in one trial is the grace that God gives us to bear another. The fact
that we have been patient and submis sive may be regarded as proof that
he will give us grace that we may be patient and submissive in the
trials that are to come. God does not leave those who have shown that
they will not leave him.

I also will keep thee - That is, I will so keep you that you shall not
sink under the trials which will prove a severe temptation to many. This
does not mean that they would be actually kept from calamity of all
kinds, but that they would be kept from the temptation of apostasy in
calamity. He would give them grace to bear up under trials with a
Christian spirit, and in such a manner that their salvation should not
be endangered.

From the hour of temptation - The season; the time; the period of
temptation. You shall be no kept that what will prove to be a time of
temptation to so many, shall not endanger your salvation. Though others
fall, you shall not; though you may be afflicted with others, yet you
shall have grace to sustain you.

Which shall come upon all the world - The phrase used here - "all the
world" - may either denote the whole world; or the whole Roman empire;
or a large district of country; or the land of Judaea. See the notes on
[Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md). Here, perhaps, all that is
implied is, that the trial would be very extensive or general - so much
so as to embrace the world, as the word was understood by those to whom
the epistle was addressed. It need not be supposed that the whole world
literally was included in it, or even all the Roman empire, but what was
the world to them - the region which they would embrace in that term. If
there were some far-spreading calamity in the country where they
resided, it would probably be all that would be fairly embraced in the
meaning of the word. It is not known to what trial the speaker refers.
It may have been some form of persecution, or it may have been some
calamity by disease, earthquake, or famine that was to occur. Tacitus
(see Wetstein, in loco) mentions an earthquake that sank twelve cities
in Asia Minor, in one night, by which, among others, Philadelphia was
deeply affected; and 'it is possible that there may have been reference
here to that overwhelming calamity. But nothing can be determined with
certainty in regard to this.

To try them that dwell upon the earth - To test their character. It
would rather seem from this that the affliction was some form of
persecution as adapted to test the fidelity of those who were affected
by it. The persecutions in the Roman empire would furnish abundant
occasions for such a trial.

[Revelation 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 3:11</span></span>

Behold, I come quickly - That is, in the trials referred to. Compare the
notes on [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md), [Rev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011.md), [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md).

Hold that fast which thou hast - That is, whatever of truth and piety
you now possess. See the notes on [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md).

That no man take thy crown - The crown of life appointed for all who are
true believers. See the notes on [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md). The truth which is taught bore
is, that by negligence or unfaithfulness in duty we may be deprived of
the glory which we might have obtained if we had been faithful to our
God and Saviour. We need to be on our constant guard, that, in a world
of temptation, where the enemies of truth abound, we may not be robbed
of the crown that we might have worn forever. Compare notes on [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 3:12</span></span>

Him that overcometh - See the notes on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

Will make a pillar in the temple of my God - See the introductory
remarks to this epistle. The promised reward of faithfulness here is,
that he who was victorious would be honored as if he were a pillar or
column in the temple of God. Such a pillar or column was partly for
ornament, and partly for support; and the idea here is, that in that
temple he would contribute to its beauty and the justness of its
proportions, and would see the same time be honored as if he were a
pillar which was necessary for the support of the temple. It is not
uncommon in the New Testament to represent the church as a temple, and
Christians as parts of it. See [Co1
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

And he shall go no more out - He shall be permanent as a part of that
spiritual temple. The idea of "going out" does not properly belong to a
pillar; but the speaker here has in his mind the man, though represented
as a column. The description of some parts would be applicable more
directly to a pillar; in others more properly to a man. Compare [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md); [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md), for an illustration of the
sentiment here. The main truth here is, that if we reach heaven, our
happiness will be secure forever. We shall have the most absolute
certainty that the welfare of the soul will no more be perilled; that we
shall never be in danger of falling into temptation; that no artful foe
shall ever have power to alienate our affections from God; that we shall
never die. Though we may change our place, and may roam from world to
world until we shall have surveyed all the wonders of creation, yet we
shall never "go out of the temple of God." Compare the notes on [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md). When we reach the heavenly world
our conflicts will be over, our doubts at an end. As soon as we cross
the threshold we shall be greeted with the assurance, "he shall go no
more out forever." That is to be our eternal abode, and whatever of joy,
or felicity, or glory, that bright world can furnish, is to be ours.
Happy moment I when, emerging from a world of danger and of doubt, the
soul shall settle down into the calmness and peace of that state where
there is the assurance of God himself that that world of bliss is to be
its eternal abode!

And I will write upon him the name of my God - Considered as a pillar or
column in the temple. The name of God would be conspicuously recorded on
it to show that he belonged to God. The allusion is to a public edifice,
on the columns of which the names of distinguished and honored persons
were recorded; that is, where there is a public testimonial of the
respect in which one whose name was thus recorded was held. The honor
thus conferred on him "who should overcome" would be as great as if the
name of that God whom he served, and whose favor and friendship he
enjoyed, were inscribed on him in some conspicuous manner. The meaning
is, that he would be known and recognized as belonging to God; the God
of the Redeemer himself - indicated by the phrase, "the name of my God."

And the name of the city of my God - That is, indicating that he belongs
to that city, or that the New Jerusalem is the city of his habitation.
The idea would seem to be, that in this world, and in. all worlds
wherever he goes and wherever he abides, he will be recognized as
belonging to that holy city; as enjoying the rights and immunities of
such a citizen.

Which is New Jerusalem - Jerusalem was the place where the temple was
reared, and where the worship of God was celebrated. It thus came to be
synonymous with the church - the dwelling-place of God on earth.

Which cometh down out of heaven from my God - See this explained in the
notes on [Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md) ff. Of course this
must be a figurative representation, but the idea is plain. It is:

\(1\) that the church is, in accordance with settled Scripture language,
represented as a city - the abode of God on earth.

\(2\) that is, instead of being built here, or having an earthly origin,
it has its origin in heaven.

It is as if it had been constructed there, and then sent down to earth
ready formed. The type, the form, the whole structure is heavenly. It is
a departure from all proper laws of interpretation to explain this
literally, as if a city should be actually let down from heaven; and
equally so to infer from this passage, and the others of similar import
in this book, that a city will be literally reared for the residence of
the saints. If the passage proves anything on either of these points, it
is, that a great and splendid city, such as that described in Rev. 21,
will literally come down from heavens. But who can believe that? Such an
interpretation, however, is by no means necessary. The comparison of the
church with a beautiful city, and the fact that it has its origin in
heaven, is all that is fairly implied in the passage.

And I will write upon him my new name - See the notes on [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md). The reward, therefore, promised
here is, that he who, by persevering fidelity, showed that he was a real
friend of the Saviour, would be honored with a permanent abode in the
holy city of his habitation, In the church redeemed and triumphant he
would have a perpetual dwelling; and wherever he should be, there would
be given him sure pledges that he belonged to him, and was recognized as
a citizen of the heavenly world. To no higher honor could any man
aspire; and yet that is an honor to which the most humble and lowly may
attain by faith in the Son of God.

The Epistle to the Church at Laodicea

The contents of the epistle to the church at Laodicea [Rev
3:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md) are as follows:

\(1\) The usual salutation to the angel of the church, [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md),

\(2\) The reference to the attributes of the speaker - the one here
referred to being that he was the "Amen," "the faithful and true
witness," and "the beginning of the creation of God," [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md).

\(3\) the claim that he knew all their works, [Rev
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015.md).

\(4\) the characteristic of the church: it was "lukewarm" - neither
"cold nor hot," [Rev 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015.md).

\(5\) the punishment threatened, that he would "spue them out of his
mouth," [Rev 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016.md).

\(6\) a solemn reproof of their self-confidence, of their ignorance of
themselves, an of their pride, when they were in fact poor, and blind,
and naked; and a solemn counsel to them to apply to him for those things
which would make them truly rich - which would cover up the shame of
their nakedness, and which would give them clear spiritual vision, [Rev
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md).

\(7\) a command to repent, in view of the fact that he rebukes and
chastens those whom he loves.

\(8\) an assurance that an opportunity is still offered for repentance,
represented by his standing at the door and praying for admittance, [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md).

\(9\) a promise to him that should be victorious - in this case, that he
should sit down with him on his throne, [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); and,

\(10\) the usual call on those who had ears to hear, to attend to what
the Spirit said to the churches.

Laodicea was situated in the southern part of Phrygia, near the junction
of the small rivers Asopus and Carpus, on a plain washed at its edges by
each. It was about 40 miles from Ephesus, and not far from Colosse and
Hierapolis. In the time of Strabo it was a large city; but the frequency
of earthquakes, to which this district has been always liable,
demolished, long since, a large part of the city, and destroyed many of
the inhabitants, and the place was abandoned, and now lies in ruins. It
is now a deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar, or Old Castle.
From its ruins, 'which are numerous, consisting of the remains of
temples, theaters, etc., it seems to have been situated on six or seven
hills, taking up a large space of ground. The whole rising ground on
which the city stood is one vast tumulus of ruins, abandoned entirely to
the owl and the fox. Col. Leake says, "There are few ancient sites more
likely than Laodicea to preserve many curious remains of antiquity
beneath the surface of the soil; its opulence, and the earthquakes to
which it was subject, rendering it probable that valuable works of art
were there buried beneath the ruins of the public and private edifices."

The neighboring village contains some 50 or 60 people, among whom, on a
visit of a recent traveler there, there were only two nominal Christians
(circa the mid-19th century). "The name of Christianity," says Emerson
(p. 101), "is forgotten, and the only sounds that disturb the silence of
its desertion are the tones of the Muezzin, whose voice from the distant
village (Eski-hissar) proclaims the ascendency of Muhammed. Laodicea is
even more solitary than Ephesus; for the latter has the prospect of the
rolling sea or of a whitening sail to enliven its decay; while the
former sits in widowed loneliness, its walls are grass-grown, its
temples desolate, its very name has perished." A thunderstorm gathered
on the mountains at a distance while this traveler was examining the
ruins of Laodicea. He returned to Eski-hissar, and waited until the fury
of the storm had abated, but set off on his journey again before it had
entirely ceased to blow and to rain. "We preferred," says he, "hastening
on, to a further delay in that melancholy spot, where everything
whispered desolation, and where the very wind that swept impetuously
through the valley sounded like the fiendish laugh of time exulting over
the destruction of man and his proudest monuments." See Prof. Stuart,
vol. ii. pp. 44, 45; Kitto's Encyclopedia; "Smith's Journey to the Seven
Churches," 1671; Leake, Arundell, Hartley, MacFarlane, Pococke, etc. The
engraving in this vol. will furnish a representation of the ruins of
Laodicea.

[Revelation 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 3:14</span></span>

And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write - See the notes
on [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md).

These things saith the Amen - Referring, as is the case in every
epistle, to some attribute of the speaker adapted to impress their
minds, or to give special force to what he was about to say to that
particular church. Laodicea was characterized by lukewarmness, and the
reference to the fact that he who was about to address them was the
"Amen" - that is, was characterized by the simple earnestness and
sincerity denoted by that word - was eminently suited to make an
impression on the minds of such a people. The word "Amen" means "true,"
"certain," "faithful"; and, as used here, it means that he to whom it is
applied is eminently true and faithful. What he affirms is true; what he
promises or threatens is certain. Himself characterized by sincerity and
truth (notes on [Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md), he can
look with approbation only on the same thing in others: and hence he
looks with displeasure on the lukewarmness which, from its very nature,
always approximates insincerity. This was an attribute, therefore, every
way appropriate to be referred to in addressing a lukewarm church.

The faithful and true witness - This is presenting the idea implied in
the word "Amen" in a more complete form, but substantially the same
thing is referred to. He is a witness for God and his truth, and he can
approve of nothing which the God of truth would not approve. See the
notes on [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md).

The beginning of the creation of God - This expression is a very
important one in regard to the rank and dignity of the Saviour, and,
like all similar expressions respecting him, its meaning has been much
controverted. Compare the notes on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). The phrase used here is
susceptible, properly, of only one of the following significations,
namely, either:

\(a\) that he was the beginning of the creation in the sense that he
caused the universe to begin to exist - that is, that he was the author
of all things; or.

\(b\) that he was the first created being; or.

\(c\) that he holds the primacy over all, and is at the head of the
universe.

It is not necessary to examine any other proposed interpretations, for
the only other senses supposed to be conveyed by the words, that he is
the beginning of the creation in the sense I that he rose from the dead
as the first-fruits of them that sleep, or that he is the head of the
spiritual creation of God, axe so foreign to the natural meaning of the
words as to need no special refutation. As to the three significations
suggested above, it may be observed, that the first one - that he is the
author of the creation, and in that sense the beginning - though
expressing a scriptural doctrine [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), is not in accordance with the
proper meaning of the word used here - ἀρχὴ archē. The word properly
refers to the "commencement" of a thing, not its "authorship," and
denotes properly primacy in time, and primacy in rank, but not primacy
in the sense of causing anything to exist. The two ideas which run
through the word as it is used in the New Testament are those just
suggested. For the former - primacy in regard to time - that is properly
the commencement of a thing, see the following passages where the word
occurs: [Mat 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md), [Mat
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md); [Mat
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008.md), [Mat

3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md); [Jo2
1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005.md). For the latter signification,
primacy of rank or authority, see the following places: [Luk
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md); [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md); [Rom

2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md). The word is not, therefore, found
in the sense of authorship, as denoting that one is the beginning of
anything in the sense that he caused it to have an existence. As to the
second of the significations suggested, that it means that he was the
first created being, it may be observed:

\(a\) that this is not a necessary signification of the phrase, since no
one can show that this is the only proper meaning which could be given
to the words, and therefore the phrase cannot be adduced to prove that
he is himself a created being. If it were demonstrated from other
sources that Christ was, in fact, a created being, and the first that
God had made, it cannot be denied that this language would appropriately
express that fact. But it cannot be made out from the mere use of the
language here; and as the language is susceptible of other
interpretations, it cannot be employed to prove that Christ is a created
being.

\(b\) Such an interpretation would be at variance with all those
passages which speak of him as uncreated and eternal; which ascribe
divine attributes to him; which speak of him as himself the Creator of
all things. Compare [Joh 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md), [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md),[Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md), [Heb
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md). The third signification,
therefore, remains, that he is "the beginning of the creation of God,"
in the sense that he is the head or prince of the creation; that is,
that he presides over it so far as the purposes of redemption are to be
accomplished, and so far as is necessary for those purposes. This is:

\(1\) in accordance with the meaning of the word, [Luk
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md); [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md), et al. ut supra; and,

\(2\) in accordance with the uniform statements respecting the Redeemer,
that "all power is given unto him in heaven and in earth" [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); that God has "given him power
over all flesh" [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md); that all
things are "put under his feet" the. [Joh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008.md); [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027).md); that he is exalted over all
things, [Eph 1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md). Having this
rank, it was proper that he should speak with authority to the church at
Laodicea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 3:15</span></span>

I know thy works - notes on [Rev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md).

That thou art neither cold nor hot - The word "cold" here would seem to
denote the state where there was no pretension to religion; where
everything was utterly lifeless and dead. The language is obviously
figurative, but it is such as is often employed, when we speak of one as
being cold toward another, as having a cold or icy heart, etc. The word
"hot" would denote, of course, the opposite - warm and zealous in their
love and service. The very words that we are constrained to use when
speaking on this subject - such words as ardent (that is, hot or
burning); fervid (that is, very hot, burning, boiling) - show how
necessary it is to use such words, and how common it is. The state
indicated here, therefore, would be that in which there was a profession
of religion, but no warm-hearted piety; in which there was not, on the
one hand, open and honest opposition to him, and, on the other, such
warm-hearted and honest love as he had a right to look for among his
professed friends; in which there was a profession of that religion
which ought to warm the heart with love, and fill the soul with zeal in
the cause of the Redeemer; but where the only result, in fact, was
deadness and indifference to him and his cause. Among those who made no
profession he had reason to expect nothing but coldness; among those who
made a profession he had a right to expect the glow of a warm affection;
but he found nothing but indifference.

I would thou wert cold or hot - That is, I would prefer either of those
states to what now exists. Anything better than this condition, where
love is professed, but where it does not exist; where vows have been
assumed which are not fulfilled. Why he would prefer that they should be
"hot" is clear enough; but why would he prefer a state of utter coldness
- a state where there was no profession of real love? To this question
the following answers may be given:

\(1\) Such a state of open and professed coldness or indifference is
more honest. There is no disguise; no concealment; no pretence. We know
where one in this state "may be found"; we know with whom we are
dealing; we know what to expect. Sad as the state is, it is at least
honest; and we are so made that we all prefer such a character to one
where professions are made which are never to be realized - to a state
of insincerity and hypocrisy.

\(2\) such a state is more honorable. It is a more elevated condition of
mind, and marks a higher character. Of a man who is false to his
engagements, who makes professions and promises never to be realized, we
can make nothing. There is essential meanness in such a character, and
there is nothing in it which we can respect. But in the character of the
man who is openly and avowedly opposed to anything; who takes his stand,
and is earnest and zealous in his course, though it be wrong, there are
traits which may be, under a better direction, elements of true
greatness and magnanimity. In the character of Saul of Tarsus there were
always the elements of true greatness; in that of Judas Iscariot there
were never. The one was capable of becoming one of the noblest men that
has ever lived on the earth; the other, even under the personal teaching
of the Redeemer for years, was nothing but a traitor - a man of
essential meanness.

\(3\) there is more hope of conversion and salvation in such a case.
There could always have been a ground of hope that Saul would be
converted and saved, even when "breathing out threatening and
slaughter"; of Judas, when numbered among the professed disciples of the
Saviour, there was no hope. The most hopeless of all persons, in regard
to salvation, are those who are members of the church without any true
religion; who have made a profession without any evidence of personal
piety; who are content with a name to live. This is so, because:

\(a\) the essential character of anyone who will allow himself to do
this is eminently unfavorable to true religion. There is a lack of that
thorough honesty and sincerity which is so necessary for true conversion
to God. He who is content to profess to be what he really is not, is
riot a man on whom the truths of Christianity are likely to make an
impression.

\(b\) Such a mall never applies the truth to himself. Truth that is
addressed to impenitent sinners he does not apply to himself, of course;
for he does not rank himself in that class of persons. Truth addressed
to hypocrites he will not apply to himself; for no one, however
insincere and hollow he may be, chooses to act on the presumption that
he is himself a hypocrite, or so as to leave others to suppose that he
regards himself as such. The means of grace adapted to save a sinner, as
such, he will not use; for he is in the church, and chooses to regard
himself as safe. Efforts made to reclaim him he will resist; for he will
regard it as proof of a meddlesome spirit, and an uncharitable judging
in others, if they consider him to be anything different from what he
professes to be. What right have they to go back of his profession, and
assume that he is insincere? As a consequence, there are probably fewer
persons by far converted of those who come into the church without any
religion, than of any other class of persons of similar number; and the
most hopeless of all conditions, in respect to conversion and salvation,
is when one enters the church deceived.

\(c\) It may be presumed that, for these reasons, God himself will make
less direct effort to convert and save such persons. As there are fewer
appeals that can be brought to bear on them; as there is less in their
character that is noble, and that can be depended on in promoting the
salvation of a soul; and as there is special guilt in hypocrisy, it may
be presumed that God will more frequently leave such persons to their
chosen course, than he will those who make no professions of religion.

So then because thou art lukewarm ... I will spue thee out of my mouth -
Referring, perhaps, to the well-known fact that tepid water tends to
produce sickness at the stomach, and an inclination to vomit. The image
is intensely strong, and denotes deep disgust and loathing at the
indifference which prevailed in the church at Laodicea. The idea is,
that they would be utterly rejected and cast off as a church - a
threatening of which there has been an abundant fulfillment in
subsequent times. It may be remarked, also, that what was threatened to
that church may be expected to occur to all churches, if they are in the
same condition; and that all professing Christians, and Christian
churches, that are lukewarm, have special reason to dread the
indignation of the Saviour.

[Revelation 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 3:17</span></span>

Because thou sayest, I am rich - So far as the language here is
concerned, this may refer either to riches literally, or to spiritual
riches; that is, to a boast of having religion enough. Prof. Stuart
supposes that it refers to the former, and so do Wetstein, Vitringa, and
others. Doddridge, Rosenmuller, and others, understand it in the latter
sense. There is no doubt that there was much wealth in Laodicea, and
that, as a people, they prided themselves on their riches. See the
authorities in Wetstein on [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md),
and Vitringa, p. 160. It is not easy to determine which is the true
sense; but may it not have been that there was an allusion to both, and
that, in every respect, they boasted that they had enough? May it not
have been so much the characteristic of that people to boast of their
wealth, that they carried the spirit into everything, and manifested it
even in regard to religion? Is it not true that they who have much of
this world's goods, when they make a profession of religion, are very
apt to suppose that they are well off in everything, and to feel
self-complacent and happy? And is not the possession of much wealth by
an individual Christian, or a Christian church, likely to produce just
the lukewarmness which it is said existed in the church at Laodicea? If
we thus understand it, there will be an accordance with the well-known
fact that Laodicea was distinguished for its riches, and, at the same
time, with another fact, so common as to be almost universal, that the
possession of great wealth tends to make a professed Christian
self-complacent and satisfied in every respect; to make him feel that,
although he may not have much religion, yet he is on the whole well off;
and to produce, in religion, a state of just such lukewarmness as the
Saviour here says was loathsome and odious.

And increased with goods - πεπλουτηκα peploutēka - "am enriched." This
is only a more emphatic and intensive way of saying the same thing. It
has no reference to the kind of riches referred to, but merely denotes
the confident manner in which they affirmed that they were rich.

And have need of nothing - Still an emphatic and intensive way of saying
that they were rich. In all respects their needs were satisfied; they
had enough of everything. They felt, therefore, no stimulus to effort;
they sat down in contentment, self-complacency, and indifference. It is
almost unavoidable that those who are rich in this world's goods should
feel that they have need of nothing. There is no more common illusion
among people than the feeling that if one has wealth he has everything;
that there is no want of his nature which cannot be satisfied with that;
and that he may now sit down in contentment and ease. Hence, the almost
universal desire to be rich; hence the common feeling among those who
are rich that there is no occasion for solicitude or care for anything
else. Compare [Luk 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md).

And knowest not - There is no just impression in regard to the real
poverty and wretchedness of your condition.

That thou art wretched - The word "wretched" we now use to denote the
actual consciousness of being miserable, as applicable to one who is
sunk into deep distress or affliction. The word here, however, refers
rather, to the condition itself than to the consciousness of that
condition, for it is said that they did not know it. Their state was, in
fact, a miserable state, and was suited to produce actual distress if
they had had any just sense of it, though they thought that it was
otherwise.

And miserable - This word has, with us now, a similar signification; but
the term used here - ἐληινὸς elēinos - rather means a pitiable state
than one actually felt to be so. The meaning is, that their condition
was one that was suited to excite pity or compassion; not that they were
actually miserable. Compare the notes on [Co1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019.md).

And poor - Notwithstanding all their boast of having enough. They really
had not what was necessary to meet the actual needs of their nature,
and, therefore, they were poor. Their worldly property could not meet
the needs of their souls; and, with all their pretensions to piety, they
had not religion enough to meet the necessities of their nature when
calamities should come, or when death should approach; and they were,
therefore, in the strictest sense of the term, poor.

And blind - That is, in a spiritual respect. They did not see the
reality of their condition; they had no just views of themselves, of the
character of God, of the way of salvation. This seems to be said in
connection with the boast which they made in their own minds - that they
had everything; that they wanted nothing. One of the great blessings of
life is clearness of vision, and their boast that they had everything
must have included that; but the speaker here says that they lacked that
indispensable thing to completeness of character and to full enjoyment.
With all their boasting, they were actually blind - and how could one
who was in that state say that he "had need of nothing?"

And naked - Of course, spiritually. Salvation is often represented as a
garment [Mat 22:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md); [Rev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md), [Rev
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013.md); and the declaration here is
equivalent to saying that they had no religion. They had nothing to
cover the nakedness of the soul, and in respect to the real needs of
their nature they were like one who had no clothing in reference to
cold, and heat, and storms, and to the shame of nakedness. How could
such an one be regarded as rich? We may learn from this instructive
verse:

\(1\) That people may think themselves to be rich, and yet, in fact, be
miserably poor. They may have the wealth of this world in abundance, and
yet have nothing that really will meet their needs in disappointment,
bereavement, sickness, death; the needs of their never-dying soul; their
needs in eternity. What had the "rich fool," as he is commonly termed,
in the parable, when he came to die? [Luk
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md) ff. What had "Dives," as he is
commonly termed, to meet the needs of his nature when he went down to
hell? [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md) ff.

\(2\) people may have much property, and think that they have all they
want, and yet be wretched. In the sense that their condition is a
wretched condition, this is always true; and in the sense that they are
consciously wretched, this may be, and often is, true also.

\(3\) people may have great property, and yet be miserable. This is true
in the sense that their condition is a pitiable one, and in the sense
that they are actually unhappy. There is no more pitiable condition than
that where one has great property, and is self-complacent and proud, and
who has nevertheless no God, no Saviour, no hope of heaven, and who
perhaps that very day may "lift up his eyes in hell, being in torments";
and it need not be added that there is no greater actual misery in this
world than what sometimes finds its way into the palaces of the rich. He
greatly errs who thinks that misery is confined to the cottages of the
poor.

\(4\) people may be rich, and think they have all that they want, and
yet be blind to their condition. They really have no distinct vision of
anything. They have no just views of God, of themselves, of their duty,
of this world, or of the next. In most important respects they are in a
worse condition than the inmates of an asylum for the blind, for they
may have clear views of God and of heaven. Mental darkness is a greater
calamity than the loss of natural vision; and there is many an one who
is surrounded by all that affluence can give, who never yet had one
correct view of his own character, of his God, or of the reality of his
condition, and whose condition might have been far better if he had
actually been born blind.

\(5\) there may be gorgeous robes of adorning, and yet real nakedness.
With all the decorations that wealth can impart, there may be a
nakedness of the soul as real as that of the body would be if, without a
rag to cover it, it were exposed to cold, and storm, and shame. The soul
destitute of the robes of salvation, is in a worse condition than the
body without raiment; for how can it bear the storms of wrath that shall
beat upon it forever, and the shame of its exposure in the last dread
day?

[Revelation 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 3:18</span></span>

I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire - Pure gold; such as
has been subjected to the action of heat to purify it from dross. See
the notes on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). Gold here is
emblematic of religion - as being the most precious of the metals, and
the most valued by human beings. They professed to be rich, but were
not; and he counsels them to obtain from him what would make them truly
rich.

That thou mayest be rich - In the true and proper sense of the word.
With true religion; with the favor and friendship of the Redeemer, they
would have all that they really needed, and would never be in want.

And white raiment - The emblem of purity and salvation. See the notes on
[Rev 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md). This is said in reference to
the fact [Rev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md) that they were then
naked.

That thou mayest be clothed - With the garments of salvation. This
refers, also, to true religion, meaning that what the Redeemer furnishes
will answer the same purpose in respect to the soul which clothing does
in reference to the body. Of course it cannot be understood literally,
nor should the language be pressed too closely, as if there was too
strict a resemblance.

And that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear - We clothe the body
as well for decency as for protection against cold, and storm, and heat.
The soul is to be clothed that the "shame" of its sinfulness may not be
exhibited, and that it may not be offensive and repellent in the sight.

And anoint thine eyes with eye-salve - In allusion to the fact that they
were blind, [Rev 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md). The word
"eye-salve" - κολλούριον kollourion - occurs no where else in the New
Testament. It is a diminutive from κολλύρα kollura - collyra - a coarse
bread or cake, and means properly a small cake or cracknel. It is
applied to eye-salve as resembling such a cake, and refers to a
medicament prepared for sore or weak eyes. It was compounded of various
substances supposed to have a healing quality. See Wetstein, in loco.
The reference here is to a spiritual healing - meaning that, ill respect
to their spiritual vision, what he would furnish would produce the same
effect as the collyrium or eye-salve would in diseased eyes. The idea
is, that the grace of the gospel enables people who were before blind to
see clearly the character of God, the beauty of the way of salvation,
the loveliness of the person and work of Christ, etc. See the notes on
[Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 3:19</span></span>

As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten - Of course, only on the
supposition that they deserve it. The meaning is, that it is a proof of
love on his part, if his professed friends go astray, to recall them by
admonitions and by trials. So a father calls back his children who are
disobedient; and there is no higher proof of his love than when, with
great pain to himself, he administers such chastisement as shall save
his child. See the sentiment here expressed fully explained in the notes
on [Heb 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md). The language is taken
from [Pro 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md).

Be zealous therefore, and repent - Be earnest, strenuous, ardent in your
purpose to exercise true repentance, and to turn from the error of your
ways. Lose no time; spare no labor, that you may obtain such a state of
mind that it shall not be necessary to bring upon you the severe
discipline which always comes on those who continue lukewarm in
religion. The truth taught here is, that when the professed followers of
Christ have become lukewarm in his service, they should lose no time in
returning to him, anti seeking his favor again. As sure as he has any
true love for them, if this is not done he will bring upon them some
heavy calamity, alike to rebuke them for their errors, and to recover
them to himself.

[Revelation 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 3:20</span></span>

Behold, I stand at the door, and knock - Intimating that, though they
had erred, the way of repentance and hope was not closed against them.
He was still willing to be gracious, though their conduct had been such
as to be loathsome, [Rev 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016.md). To see
the real force of this language, we must remember how disgusting and
offensive their conduct had been to him. And yet he was willing,
notwithstanding this, to receive them to his favor; nay more, he stood
and pled with them that he might be received with the hospitality that
would be shown to a friend or stranger. The language here is so plain
that it scarcely needs explanation. It is taken from an act when we
approach a dwelling, and, by a well-understood sign - knocking -
announce our presence, and ask for admission. The act of knocking
implies two things:

\(a\) that we desire admittance; and,

\(b\) that we recognize the right of him who dwells in the house to open
the door to us or not, as he shall please.

We would not obtrude upon him; we would not force his door; and if,
after we are sure that we are heard, we are not admitted, we turn
quietly away. Both of these things are implied here by the language used
by the Saviour when he approaches man as represented under the image of
knocking at the door: that he desires to be admitted to our friendship;
and that he recognizes our freedom in the matter. He does not obtrude
himself upon us, nor does he employ force to find admission to the
heart. If admitted, he comes and dwells with us; if rejected, he turns
quietly away - perhaps to return and knock again, perhaps never to come
back. The language used here, also, may be understood as applicable to
all persons, and to all the methods by which the Saviour seeks to come
into the heart of a sinner. It would properly refer to anything which
would announce his presence: his word; his Spirit; the solemn events of
his providence; the invitations of his gospel. In these and in other
methods he comes to man; and the manner in which these invitations ought
to be estimated would be seen by supposing that he came to us personally
and solicited our friendship, and proposed to be our Redeemer. It may be
added here, that this expression proves that the attempt at
reconciliation begins with the Saviour. It is not that the sinner goes
out to meet him, or to seek for him; it is that the Saviour presents
himself at the door of the heart, as if he were desirous to enjoy the
friendship of man. This is in accordance with the uniform language of
the New Testament, that "God so loved the world as to give his
only-begotten Son"; that "Christ came to seek and to save the lost";
that the Saviour says, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden," etc. Salvation, in the Scriptures, is never represented as
originated by man.

If any man hear my voice - Perhaps referring to a custom then
prevailing, that he who knocked spake, in order to let it be known who
it was. This might be demanded in the night [Luk
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md), or when there was apprehension
of danger, and it may have been the custom when John wrote. The language
here, in accordance with the uniform usage in the Scriptures (compare
[Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md); [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).md), is universal, and proves that
the invitations of the gospel are made, and are to be made, not to a
part only, but fully and freely to all people; for, although this
originally had reference to the members of the church in Laodicea, yet
the language chosen seems to have been of design so universal (ἐάν τις
ean tis) as to be applicable to every human being; and anyone, of any
age and in any land, would be authorized to apply this to himself, and,
under the protection of this invitation, to come to the Saviour, and to
plead this promise as one that fairly included himself. It may be
observed further, that this also recognizes the freedom of man. It is
submitted to him whether he will hear the voice of the Redeemer or not;
and whether he will open the door and admit him or not. He speaks loud
enough, and distinctly enough, to be heard, but he does not force the
door if it is not voluntarily opened.

And open the door - As one would when a stranger or friend stood and
knocked. The meaning here is simply, if anyone will admit me; that is,
receive me as a friend. The act of receiving him is as voluntary on our
part as it is when we rise and open the door to one who knocks. It may
be added:

\(1\) that this is an easy thing. Nothing is more easy than to open the
door when one knocks; and so everywhere in the Scriptures it is
represented as an easy thing, if the heart is willing, to secure the
salvation of the soul.

\(2\) this is a reasonable thing.

We invite him who knocks at the door to come in. We always assume,
unless there is reason to suspect the contrary, that he applies for
peaceful and friendly purposes. We deem it the height of rudeness to let
one stand and knock long; or to let him go away with no friendly
invitation to enter our dwelling. Yet how different does the sinner
treat the Saviour! How long does he suffer him to knock at the door of
his heart, with no invitation to enter - no act of common civility such
as that with which he would greet even a stranger! And with how much
coolness and indifference does he see him turn away - perhaps to come
back no more, and with no desire that he ever should return!

I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me - This is
an image denoting intimacy and friendship. Supper, with the ancients,
was the principal social meal; and the idea here is, that between the
Saviour and those who would receive him there would be the intimacy
which subsists between those who sit down to a friendly meal together.
In all countries and times, to eat together, to break bread together,
has been the symbol of friendship, and this the Saviour promises here.
The truths, then, which are taught in this verse, are:

\(1\) that the invitation of the gospel is made to all - "if any man
hear my voice";

\(2\) that the movement toward reconciliation and friendship is
originated by the Saviour - "behold, I stand at the door and knock";

\(3\) that there is a recognition of our own free agency in religion -
"if any man will hear my voice, and open the door";

\(4\) the ease of the terms of salvation, represented by "hearing his
voice," and "opening the door"; and,

\(5\) the blessedness of thus admitting him, arising from his friendship
- "I will sup with him, and he with me." What friend can man have who
would confer so many benefits on him as the Lord Jesus Christ? Who is
there that he should so gladly welcome to his bosom?

To him that overcometh - See the notes on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

Will I grant to sit with me in my throne - That is, they will share his
honors and his triumphs. See the notes on [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md); compare the notes on [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).

Even as I also overcame - As I gained a victory over the world, and over
the power of the tempter. As the reward of this, he is exalted to the
throne of the universe [Phi 2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md),
and in these honors, achieved by their great and glorious Head, all the
redeemed will share.

And am set down with my Father in his throne - Compare the notes on [Phi
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). That is, he has dominion over
the universe. All things are put under his feet, and in the strictest
unison and with perfect harmony he is united with the Father in
administering the affairs of all worlds. The dominion of the Father is
that of the Son - that of the Son is that of the Father; for they are
one. See the notes on [Joh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md);
compare the [Eph 1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md) notes; [Co1

This closes the epistolary part of this book, and the "visions" properly
commence with the next chapter. Two remarks may be made in the
conclusion of this exposition:

\(1\) The first relates to the truthfulness of the predictions in these
epistles. is an illustration of that truthfulness, and of the present
correspondence of the condition of those churches with what the Saviour
said to John they would be, the following striking passage may be
introduced from Mr. Gibbon. It occurs in his description of the
conquests of the Turks ("Decline and Fall," iv. 260, 261). "Two Turkish
chieftains, Sarukhan and Aidin left their names to their conquests, and
their conquests to their posterity. The captivity or ruin of the seven
churches of Asia was consummated; and the barbarous lords of Ionia and
Lydia still trample on the monuments of classic and Christian antiquity.
In the loss of Ephesus, the Christians deplored the fall of the first
angel, the extinction of the first candlestick of the Revelations: the
desolation is complete; and the temple of Diana, or the church of Mary,
will equally elude the search of the curious traveler. The circus and
three stately theaters of Laodicea are now populated with wolves and
foxes; Sardis is reduced to a miserable village; the God of Muhammed,
without a rival or a son, is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira and
Pergamos; and the populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign
trade of Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by
prophecy or courage. At a distance from the sea, forgotten by the
emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant citizens
defended their religion and freedom above fourscore years, and at length
capitulated with the proudest of the Ottomans. Among the Greek colonies
and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is still erect, a column in a scene
of ruins; a pleasing example that the paths of honor and safety may
sometimes be the same."

\(2\) the second remark relates to the applicability of these important
truths to us. There is perhaps no part of the New Testament more
searching than these brief epistles to the seven churches; and though
those to whom they were addressed have long since passed away, and the
churches have long since become extinct; though darkness, error, and
desolation have come over the places where these churches once stood,
yet the principles laid down in these epistles still live, and they are
full of admonition to Christians in all ages and all lands. It is a
consideration of as much importance to us as it was to these churches,
that the Saviour now knows our works; that he sees in the church, and in
any individual, all that there is to commend and all that there is to
reprove; that he has power to reward or punish now as he had then; that
the same rules in apportioning rewards and punishments will still be
acted on; that he who overcomes the temptations of the world will find
an appropriate reward; that those who live in sin must meet with the
proper recompense, and that those who are lukewarm in his service will
be spurned with unutterable loathing. His rebukes are awful; but his
promises are full of tenderness and kindness. While they who have
embraced error, and they who are living in sin, have occasion to tremble
before him, they who are endeavoring to perform their duty may find in
these epistles enough to cheer their hearts, and to animate them with
the hope of final victory, and of the most ample and glorious reward.
