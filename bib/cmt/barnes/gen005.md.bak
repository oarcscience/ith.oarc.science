### [Genesis Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

\- Section V - The Line to Noah

\- The Line of Sheth

1\. ספר sepher "writing, a writing, a book."

9\. קינן qēynān, Qenan, "possessor, or spearsman."

12\. &lt;מהללאל mahelal'ēl, Mahalalel, "praise of 'El."

15\. ירד yerĕd, Jered, "going down."

21\. מתוּשׁלה metûshālach, Methushelach, "man of the missile."

29\. נה noach, Noach, "rest," נחם nācham "sigh; repent; pity; comfort
oneself; be revenged."

32\. שׁם shēm, Shem, "name, fame; related: be high." חם chām Cham,
"hot." יפת yāpet, Japheth, "spreading; related: spread out."

We now enter upon the third of the larger documents contained in
Genesis. The first is a diary, the second is a history, the third a
genealogy. The first employs the name אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym exclusively; the
second uses אלהים יהוה yehovâh'ĕlohı̂ym in the second and third chapters,
and יהוה yehovâh usually in the fourth; the third has אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym in
the first part, and יהוה yehovâh in the second part. The name אלהים
'ĕlohı̂ym is employed in the beginning of the chapter with a manifest
reference to the first document, which is here quoted and abridged.

This chapter contains the line from Adam to Noah, in which are stated
some common particulars concerning all, and certain special details
concerning three of them. The genealogy is traced to the tenth in
descent from Adam, and terminates with the flood. The scope of the
chapter is to mark out the line of faith and hope and holiness from
Adam, the first head of the human race, to Noah, who became eventually
the second natural head of it.

[Gen 5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

These verses are a recapitulation of the creation of man. The first
sentence is the superscription of the new piece of composition now
before us. The heading of the second document was more comprehensive. It
embraced the generations, evolutions, or outworkings of the skies and
the land, as soon as they were called into existence, and was
accordingly dated from the third day. The present document confines
itself to the generations of man, and commences, therefore, with the
sixth day. The generations here are literal for the most part, though a
few particulars of the individuals mentioned are recorded. But taken in
a large sense this superscription will cover the whole of the history in
the Old and New Testaments. It is only in the prophetic parts of these
books that we reach again in the end of things to the wider compass of
the heavens and the earth [Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md);
[Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md). Then only does the sphere of
history enlarge itself to the pristine dimensions in the proper and
blessed sense, when the second Adam appears on earth, and re-connects
heaven and earth in a new, holy, and everlasting covenant.

The present superscription differs from the former one in the
introduction of the word ספר sepher, "book". There is here some ground
in the text for supposing the insertion by Moses of an authentic
document, handed down from the olden time, in the great work which he
was directed to compose. The chapter before us could not have been
completed, indeed, until after the birth of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. But
if we except the last verse, there is no impossibility or improbability
in its being composed before the deluge.

The invention of writing at that early period is favored by some other
circumstances connected with these records. We cannot say that it is
impossible for oral tradition to preserve the memory of minute
transactions - sayings, songs, names, and numbers of years up to a
thousand - especially in a period when men's lives exceeded nine hundred
years. But we can easily see that these details could be much more
easily handed down if there was any method of notation for the help of
the memory. The minute records of this kind, therefore, which we find in
these early chapters, though not very numerous, afford a certain
presumption in favor of a very early knowledge of the art of writing.

[Gen 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002.md)

And called their name man. - This name seems to connect man אדם 'ādām
with the soil from which he was taken ארמה 'ădāmâh [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md). It is evidently a generic or
collective term, denoting the species. God, as the maker, names the
race, and thereby marks its character and purpose.

[Gen 5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003.md)

In the compass of [Gen 5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003.md) the
course of Adam's life is completed. And after the same model the lines
of all his lineal descendants in this chapter are drawn up. The certain
particulars stated are the years he lived before the birth of a certain
son, the number of years he afterward lived during which sons and
daughters were born to him, and his death. Two sons, and most probably
several daughters, were born to Adam before the birth of Sheth. But
these sons have been already noticed, and the line of Noah is here
given. It is obvious, therefore, that the following individuals in the
genealogy may, or may not, have been first-born sons. The stated
formula, "and he died," at the close of each life except that of Henok,
is a standing demonstration of the effect of disobedience.

The writer, according to custom, completes the life of one patriarch
before he commences that of the next; and so the first event of the
following biography is long antecedent to the last event of the
preceding one. This simply and clearly illustrates the law of Hebrew
narrative.

The only peculiarity in the life of Adam is the statement that his son
was "in his likeness, after his image." This is no doubt intended to
include that depravity which had become the characteristic of fallen
man. It is contrasted with the preceding notice that Adam was originally
created in the image of God. If it had been intended merely to indicate
that the offspring was of the same species with the parent, the phrase,
"after his kind" (למינהוּ lemı̂ynâh, would have been employed, as in the
first chapter. This is one of the mysteries of the race, when the head
of it is a moral being, and has fallen. His moral depravity, affecting
the essential difference of his nature, descends to his offspring.

As this document alludes to the first in the words, "in the day of God's
creating man, in the likeness of God made he him," quotes its very words
in the sentence, "male and female created he them, refers to the second
in the words, and called their name man" [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), and also needs this second for
the explication of the statement that the offspring of man bore his
likeness, it presupposes the existence and knowledge of these documents
at the time when it was written. If it had been intended for an
independent work, it would have been more full and explanatory on these
important topics.

[Gen 5:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#021.md)

The history of the Shethite Henok is distinguished in two respects:
First, after the birth of Methushelah, "he walked with the God." Here
for the first time we have God אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym with the definite article,
with which it occurs more than four hundred times. By this he is
emphatically distinguished as the God, now made known by his acts and
manifestations, in opposition to atheism, the sole God in opposition to
polytheism, and the true God in opposition to all false gods or notions
of God. It is possible that in the time of Henok some had forsaken the
true God, and fallen into various misconceptions concerning the Supreme
Being. His walking with "the God" is a hint that others were walking
without this God.

The phrase "walked with God" is rendered in the Septuagint εὐηρέστησε τῷ
Θεῷ euērestēse tō Theō, "pleased God," and is adduced in the Epistle to
the Hebrews [Gen 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md) as an evidence
of Henok's faith. Walking with God implies community with him in
thought, word, and deed, and is opposed in Scripture to walking contrary
to him. We are not at liberty to infer that Henok was the only one in
this line who feared God. But we are sure that he presented an eminent
example of that faith which purifies the heart and pleases God.

He made a striking advance upon the attainment of the times of his
ancestor Sheth. In those days they began to call upon the name of the
Lord. Now the fellowship of the saints with God reaches its highest
form, - that of walking with him, doing his will and enjoying his
presence in all the business of life. Hence, this remarkable servant of
God is accounted a prophet, and foretells the coming of the Lord to
judgment [Jde 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md). It is further
to be observed that this most eminent saint of God did not withdraw from
the domestic circle, or the ordinary duties of social life. It is
related of him as of the others, that during the three hundred years of
his walking with God he begat sons and daughters.

Secondly, the second peculiarity of Henok was his teleportation. This is
related in the simple language of the times. "And he was not, for God
took him;" or, in the version of the Septuagint, "and he was not found,
for God translated him." Hence, in the New Testament it is said, [Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md), "By faith Enoch was translated,
that he should not see death." This passage is important for the
interpretation of the phrase ואיננוּ ve'ēynenû καί ουχ εὑρίσκετο kai
ouch heurisketo "and he was not (found)." It means, we perceive, not
absolutely, he was not, but relatively, he was not extant in the sphere
of sense. If this phrase do not denote annihilation, much less does the
phrase "and he died." The one denotes absence from the world of sense,
and the other indicates the ordinary way in which the soul departs from
this world. Here, then, we have another hint that points plainly to the
immortality of the soul (see on [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md).

This glimpse into primeval life furnishes a new lesson to the men of
early times and of all succeeding generations. An atonement was shadowed
forth in the offering of Habel. A voice was given to the devout feelings
of the heart in the times of Sheth. And now a walk becoming one
reconciled to God, calling upon his name, and animated by the spirit of
adoption, is exhibited. Faith has now returned to God, confessed his
name, and learned to walk with him. At this point God appears and gives
to the antediluvian race a new and conclusive token of the riches and
power of mercy in counteracting the effects of sin in the case of the
returning penitent. Henok does not die, but lives; and not only lives,
but is advanced to a new stage of life, in which all the power and pain
of sin are at an end forever. This crowns and signalizes the power of
grace, and represents in brief the grand finale of a life of faith. This
renewed man is received up into glory without going through the
intermediate steps of death and resurrection. If we omit the violent end
of Habel, the only death on record that precedes the translation of
Henok is that of Adam. It would have been incongruous that he who
brought sin and death into the world should not have died. But a little
more than half a century after his death, Henok is wafted to heaven
without leaving the body. This translation took place in the presence of
a sufficient number of witnesses, and furnished a manifest proof of the
presence and reality of the invisible powers. Thus, were life and
immortality as fully brought to light as was necessary or possible at
that early stage of the world's history. Thus, was it demonstrated that
the grace of God was triumphant in accomplishing the final and full
salvation of all who returned to God. The process might be slow and
gradual, but the end was now shown to be sure and satisfactory.

[Gen 5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#025.md)

Methushelah is the oldest man on record. He lived to be within 31 years
of a millenium, and died in the year of the flood.

[Gen 5:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#028.md)

In the biography of Lamek the name of his son is not only given, but the
reason of it is assigned. The parents were cumbered with the toil of
cultivating the ground. They looked forward with hope to the aid or
relief which their son would give them in bearing the burden of life,
and they express this hope in his name. In stating the reason of the
name, they employ a word which is connected with it only by a second
remove. נוּח nûach and נחם nācham are stems not immediately connected;
but they both point back to a common root נח (n-ch) signifying "to sigh,
to breathe, to rest, to lie down."

This is only another recorded instance of the habit of giving names
indicative of the thoughts of the parents at the time of the child's
birth. All names were originally significant, and have still to this day
an import. Some were given at birth, others at later periods, from some
remarkable circumstance in the individual's life. Hence, many characters
of ancient times were distinguished by several names conferred at
different times and for different reasons. The reason of the present
name is put on record simply on account of the extraordinary destiny
which awaited the bearer of it.

Which the Lord hath cursed. - Here is another incidental allusion to the
second document, without which it would not be intelligible. If the
present document had been intended to stand alone, this remark would
have had its explanation in some previous part of the narrative.

[Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md)

And Noah was the son of five hundred years. - A man is the son of a
certain year, in and up to the close of that year, but not beyond it.
Thus, Noah was in his six hundredth year when he was the son of six
hundred years [Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md), [Gen
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#006.md), and a child was circumcised on
the eighth day, being then the son of eight days [Lev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md); [Gen
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md).

When the phrase indicates a point of time, as in Lev. 27, it is the
terminating point of the period in question. The first part only of the
biography of Noah is given in this verse, and the remainder will be
furnished in due time and place. Meanwhile, Noah is connected with the
general history of the race, which is now to be taken up. His three sons
are mentioned, because they are the ancestors of the postdiluvian race.
This verse, therefore, prepares for a continuation of the narrative, and
therefore implies a continuator or compiler who lived after the flood.

From the numbers in this chapter it appears that the length of human
life in the period before the deluge was ten times its present average.
This has seemed incredible to some, and hence they have imagined that
the years must have consisted of one month, or at least of a smaller
number than twelve. But the text will not admit of such amendment or
interpretation. In the account of the deluge the tenth month is
mentioned, and sixty-one days are afterward indicated before the
beginning of the next year, whence we infer that the primeval year
consisted of twelve lunar months at least. But the seemingly incredible
in this statement concerning the longevity of the people before the
flood, will be turned into the credible if we reflect that man was made
to be immortal. His constitution was suited for a perpetuity of life, if
only supplied with the proper nutriment. This nutriment was provided in
the tree of life. But man abused his liberty, and forfeited the source
of perpetual life. Nevertheless, the primeval vigor of an unimpaired
constitution held out for a comparatively long period. After the deluge,
however, through the deterioration of the climate and the soil, and
perhaps much more the degeneracy of man's moral and physical being,
arising from the abuse of his natural propensities, the average length
of human life gradually dwindled down to its present limits. Human
physiology, founded upon the present data of man's constitution, may
pronounce upon the duration of his life so long as the data are the
same; but it cannot fairly affirm that the data were never different
from what they are at present. Meanwhile, the Bible narrative is in
perfect keeping with its own data, and is therefore not to be disturbed
by those who still accept these without challenge.

The following table presents the age of each member of this genealogy,
when his son and successor was born and when he himself died, as they
stand in the Hebrew text, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, and
Josephus:

1056 2006 100 100 100 100 Deluge 1656 1307 2262 2256 On comparing the
series of numbers in the Hebrew with those in the Samaritan, the
Septuagint, and Josephus, it is remarkable that we have the main body of
the original figures in all. In the total ages of the first five and the
seventh, and in that of Noah at the flood, they all agree. In those of
the sixth and eighth, the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Josephus agree. In
that of the ninth, the Hebrew and Josephus agree, while the Samaritan
and Septuagint differ from them and from each other. On examining the
figures of the Samaritan, it appears that the sixth, eighth, and ninth
total ages would have reached beyond the flood, if the numbers found in
the other authorities had been retained. And they are so shortened as to
terminate all in the year of the flood. This alteration betrays design.
The totals in the Hebrew, then, have by far the preponderating
authority.

Of the numbers before the birth of a successor, which are chiefly
important for the chronology, the units agree in all but Lamek, in
regard to whom the Hebrew and Josephus agree, while the Samaritan and
the Septuagint differ from them and from each other. The tens agree in
all but two, Methushelah and Lamek, where the Hebrew, the Septuagint, at
least in the Codex Alexandrinus, and Josephus agree, while the Samaritan
differs from them all. In the hundreds a systematic and designed
variation occurs. Still they agree in Noah. In Jared, Methushelah, and
Lamek, the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Josephus agree in a number greater by
a hundred than the Samaritan. In the remaining six the Hebrew and
Samaritan agree; while the Septuagint and Josephus agree in having a
number greater by a hundred. On the whole, then, it is evident that the
balance of probability is decidedly in favor of the Hebrew. To this
advantage of concurring testimonies are to be added those of being the
original, and of having been guarded with great care.

These grounds of textual superiority may be supported by several
considerations of less weight. The Samaritan and the Septuagint follow a
uniform plan; the Hebrew does not, and therefore has the mark of
originality. Josephus gives the sum total to the deluge as two thousand
six hundred and fifty-six years, agreeing with the total of the Hebrew
in three figures, with that of the Septuagint only in two, and with that
of the Samaritan in none. Some MSS. even give one thousand six hundred
and fifty-six, which is the exact sum of the Hebrew numbers. Both these
readings, moreover, differ from the sum of his own numbers, which itself
agrees with the Hebrew in two figures and with the Septuagint in the
other two. This looks like a studied conformation of the figures to
those of the Septuagint, in which the operator forgot to alter the sum
total. We do not at present enter into the external arguments for or
against the Hebrew text. Suffice it to observe, that the internal
evidence is at present clearly in its favor, so far as the antediluvian
figures go.
