### [Judges Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

[Judges 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 11:1</span></span>

The history of Jephthah appears to be an independent history inserted by
the compiler of the Book of Judges. [Jdg
11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md) introduce the Ammonite war
without any apparent reference to [Jdg
10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md).

A genealogy of Manasseh [Ch1 7:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md)
gives the families which sprang from Gilead, and among them mention is
made of an "Aramitess" concubine as the mother of one family. Jephthah,
the son of Gilead by a strange woman, fled, after his father's death, to
the land of Tob [Jdg 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md), presumably
the land of his maternal ancestors (compare [Jdg
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001).md) and an "Aramean" settlement ([Sa2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md), [Sa2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008); 1 Macc. 5:13.md). It is difficult
to conceive that Jephthah was literally the son of Gilead, if Gilead was
the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh. Possibly "Gilead" here denotes
the heir of Gilead, the head of the family, whose individual name has
not been preserved, nor the time when he lived.

[Judges 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 11:3</span></span>

The land of Tob - To the north of Gilead, toward Damascus. The readiness
with which Jephthah took to the freebooter's life gives us a lively
picture of the unsettled times in which he lived.

[Judges 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 11:7</span></span>

This gives a wider signification to [Jdg
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#002.md), and shows that Jephthah's
"brethren" include his fellow tribesmen.

[Judges 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 11:9</span></span>

Jephthah made his own aggrandisement the condition of his delivering;
his country. The circumstances of his birth and long residence in a
pagan land were little favorable to the formation of the highest type of
character. Yet he has his record among the faithful [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md).

[Judges 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 11:11</span></span>

Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh - This phrase
designates the presence of the tabernacle, or the ark, or of the high
priest with Urim and Thummim [Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Jdg
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#002.md); [Jos
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008.md); [Sa1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md). The high priest waited upon
Jephthah with the ephod, and possibly the ark, at his own house (see
[Jdg 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018) here.md). A trace of
Jephthah's claim to unite all Israel under his dominion is found in [Jdg
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md), and breathes through his whole
message to the king of the Ammonites. See [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md), [Jdg
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#015.md), [Jdg
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023.md), [Jdg
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#027.md).

[Judges 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 11:13</span></span>

From Arnon even unto Jabbok ... - The land bounded by the Arnon on the
south, by the Jabbok on the north, by the Jordan on the west, and by the
wilderness on the east was, of old, the kingdom of Sihon, but then the
territory of Reuben and Gad.

[Judges 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 11:15</span></span>

Consult the marginal references. If the ark with the copy of the Law
[Deu 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md) was at Mizpeh, it would
account for Jephthah's accurate knowledge of it; and this exact
agreement of his message with Numbers and Deuteronomy would give
additional force to the expression, "he uttered all his words before the
Lord" [Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md).

[Jdg 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#017.md)

No mention is made of this embassy to Moab in the Pentateuch.

[Jdg 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#019.md)

Into my place - This expression implies that the trans-Jordanic
possessions of Israel were not included in the land of Canaan properly
speaking.

[Jdg 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#021.md)

The title "God of Israel" has a special emphasis here, and in [Jdg
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023.md). in a narrative of transactions
relating to the pagan and their gods.

[Jdg 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md)

Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites (see the marginal
references); and as the territory in question was Moabitish territory
before the Amorites took it from "the people of Chemosh," this may
account for the mention of Chemosh here rather than of Moloch, or
Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. Possibly the king of the children of
Ammon at this time may have been a Moabite.

[Jdg 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#025.md), [Jdg
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026.md)

Jephthah advances another historical argument. Balak, the king of Moab,
never disputed the possession of Sihon's kingdom with Israel.

[Judges 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 11:29</span></span>

Then the Spirit of the Lord ... - This was the sanctification of
Jephthah for his office of Judge and savior of God's people Israel.
Compare [Jdg 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md); [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md). The declaration is one of the
distinctive marks which stamp this history as a divine history.

The geography is rather obscure, but the sense seems to be that Jephthah
first raised all the inhabitants of Mount Gilead; then he crossed the
Jabbok into Manasseh, and raised them; then he returned at the head of
his new forces to his own camp at Mizpeh to join the troops he had left
there; and thence at the head of the whole army marched against the
Ammonites, who occupied the southern parts of Gilead.

[Judges 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 11:31</span></span>

The words of this verse prove conclusively that Jephthah intended his
vow to apply to human beings, not animals: for only one of his household
could be expected to come forth from the door of his house to meet him.
They also preclude any other meaning than that Jephthah contemplated a
human sacrifice. This need not, however, surprise us, when we recollect
his Syrian birth and long residence in a Syrian city, where such fierce
rites were probably common. The Syrians and Phoenicians were conspicuous
among the ancient pagan nations for human sacrifices, and the transfer,
under such circumstances, to Yahweh of the rites with which the false
gods were honored, is just what one might expect. The circumstance of
the Spirit of the Lord coming on Jephthah [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md) is no difficulty; as it by no
means follows that because the Spirit of God endued him with
supernatural valor and energy for vanquishing the Ammonites, He
therefore also endued him with spiritual knowledge and wisdom. The
Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, but that did not prevent his erring
in the matter of the ephod [Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027.md).
Compare [Co1 12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md); [Gal
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md).

[Judges 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 11:33</span></span>

As in the conflicts with the Moabites, Canaanites, and Midianites Judg.
3; 4; 7, the battle was on Israelite territory, in self-defense, not in
aggressive warfare.

The plain of the vineyards - Rather, "Abel-Ceramim" (compare
Abel-Meholah), identified with an "Abel" situated among vineyards, 7
miles from Robbah. "Minnith" is "Maanith," 4 miles from Heshbon, on the
road to Rab-bah.

[Judges 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 11:34</span></span>

His daughter came out to meet him - The precise phrase of his vow [Jdg
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031.md). She was his "only child," a
term of special endearment (see [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). The same word is used of Isaac
[Gen 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md), [Gen
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012.md), [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md).

[Judges 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 11:35</span></span>

Jephthah was right in not being deterred from keeping his vow by the
loss and sorrow to himself (compare the marginal references), just as
Abraham was right in not withholding his son, his only son, from God,
when commanded to offer him up as a burnt-offering. But Jephthah was
wholly wrong in that conception of the character of God which led to his
making the rash vow. And he would have done right not to slay his child,
though the guilt of making and of breaking such a vow would have
remained. Josephus well characterizes the sacrifice as "neither
sanctioned by the Mosaic law, nor acceptable to God."

[Judges 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 11:36</span></span>

The touching submission of Jephthah's daughter to an inevitable fate
shows how deeply-rooted at that time was the pagan notion of the
propriety of human sacrifice.

[Judges 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 11:37</span></span>

Bewail my virginity - To become a wife and a mother was the end of
existence to an Israelite maiden. The premature death of Jephthah's
daughter was about to frustrate this end.

[Judges 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jdg 11:40</span></span>

There is no allusion extant elsewhere to this annual lamentation of the
untimely fate of Jephthah's daughter. But the poetical turn of the
narrative suggests that it may be taken from some ancient song (compare
the marginal note 4).
