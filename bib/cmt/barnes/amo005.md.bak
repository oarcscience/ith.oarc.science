### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

[Amos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 5:1</span></span>

In order to impress Israel the more, Amos begins this his third appeal
by a "dirge" over its destruction, mourning over those who were full of
joy, and thought themselves safe and enviable. As if a living man, in
the midst of his pride and luxury and buoyant recklessness of heart,
could see his own funeral procession, and hear, as it were, over himself
the "earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." It would give solemn
thoughts, even though he should impatiently put them from him. So must
it to Israel, when after the tide of victories of Jeroboam II, Amos
said, "Hear this word which I am lifting up," as a heavy weight, to cast
it down "against" or "upon you," a funeral "dirge," O house of Israel.
Human greatness is so unstable, human strength so fleeting, that the
prophet of decay finds a response in man's own conscience, however he
may silence or resent it. He would not resent it, unless he felt its
force.

Dionysius: "Amos, an Israelite, mourneth over Israel, as Samuel did over
Saul [Sa1 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035.md), or as Isaiah says, "I
will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of
the daughter of my people" [Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md);
images of Him who wept over Jerusalem." "So are they bewailed, who know
not why they are bewailed, the more miserable, because they know not
their own misery."

[Amos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 5:2</span></span>

She hath fallen, she shall rise no more, the virgin of Israel; she hath
been dashed down upon her land, there is none to raise her up - Such is
the dirge, a dirge like that of David over Saul and Jonathan, over what
once was lovely and mighty, but which had perished. He speaks of all as
past, and that, irremediably. Israel is one of the things which had
been, and which would never again be. He calls her tenderly, "the virgin
of Israel," not as having retained her purity or her fealty to God;
still less, with human boastfulness, as though she had as yet been
unsubdued by man. For she had been faithless to God, and had been many
times conquered by man. Nor does it even seem that God so calls her,
because He once espoused her to Himself For isaiah so calls Babylon. But
Scripture seems to speak of cities, as women, because in women
tenderness is most seen; they are most tenderly guarded; they, when
pure, are most lovely; they, when corrupted, are most debased.

Hence , "God says on the one hand, "I remember thee, the love of thine
espousals" [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md); on the other,
"Hear, thou harlot, the word of the Lord" [Eze
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#035.md). When He claims her faithfulness
He calls her, betrothed." Again , "when He willeth to signify that a
city or nation has been as tenderly loved and anxiously guarded, whether
by Himsclf or by others, He calleth it "virgin," or when lie would
indicate its beauty and lovely array. Isaiah saith, 'come down and sit
in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon' [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md), that is, thou who livedest
before in all delicacies, like a virgin under the shelter of her home.
For it follows, 'for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.'"
More pitiable, for their tenderness and delicacy, is the distress of
women. And so he pictures her as already fallen, "dashed" (the word
imitates the sound) to the earth "upon her own ground." An army may be
lost, and the nation recover. She was "dashed down upon her own ground."
In the abode of her strength, in the midst of her resources, in her
innermost retreat, she should fall. In herself, she fell powerless. And
he adds, she has "no one to raise her up;" none to have ruth upon her;
image of the judgment on a lost soul, when the terrible sentence is
spoken and none can intercede! "She shall not rise again." As she fell,
she did not again rise. The prophet beholds beyond the eighty-five years
which separated the prosperity under Jeroboam II from her captivity. As
a people, he says, she should be restored no more; nor was she.

[Amos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 5:3</span></span>

The city that went out by a thousand - (that is, probably that sent out
a thousand fighting men, as the word "went out" is often used for, "went
out" to fight,) "shall have" literally, "shall retain, an hundred." She
was to be decimated. Only, the tenth alone was to be reserved alive; the
nine-tenths were to be destroyed. And this, alike in larger places and
in the small. The city "that went forth an hundred shall retain ten."
Smaller places escape for their obscurity, the larger from their
strength and situation. One common doom was to befall all. Out of all
that multitude, one tithe alone was to he preserved , "dedicated to
God," that remnant which God always promised to reserve.

[Amos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 5:4</span></span>

Seek ye Me and ye shall live - Literally, "seek Me; and live." Wonderful
conciseness of the word of God, which, in two words, comprises the whole
of the creature's duty and his hopes, his time and his eternity. The
prophet users the two imperatives, inoneing both, man's duty and his
reward. He does not speak of them, as cause and effect, but as one.
Where the one is, there is the other. To seek God is to live. For to
seek God is to find Him, and God is Life and the Source of life.
Forgiveness, grace, life, enter the soul at once. But the seeking is
diligent seeking. : "It is not to seek God anyhow, but as it is right
and meet that He should be sought, longed for, prayed for, who is so
great, a Good, constantly, fervently, yea, to our power, the more
constantly and fervently, as an Infinite Good is more to be longed for,
more loved than all created good." The object of the search is God
Himself. "Seek Me," that is, seek God for Himself, not for anything out
of Him, not for His gifts, not for anything to be loved with Him. This
is not to seek Him purely. All is found in Him, but by seeking Him
first, and then loving Him in all, and all in Him. "And ye shall live,"
first by the life of the body, escaping the enemy; then by the life of
grace now, and the life of glory hereafter, as in that of the Psalmist,
"your heart shall live who seek God" [Psa
69:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#032.md).

[Amos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 5:5</span></span>

But (and) seek not Bethel - Israel pretended to seek God in Bethel. Amos
sets the two seeking, as incompatible. The god, worshiped at Bethel, was
not the One God. To seek God there was to lose Him. "Seek not God," he
would say, "and a phantom, which will lead from God."

And pass not to Beersheba - Jeroboam I pretended that it was too much
for Israel to go up to Jerusalem. And Yet Israel thought it not too much
to go to the extremest point of Judah toward Idumaea , perhaps, four
times as far south of Jerusalem, as Jerusalem lay from Bethel. For
Beersheba is thought to have lain some thirty miles south of Hebron ,
which is twenty-two miles south of Jerusalem ; while Bethel is but
twelve to the north. So much pains will people take in self-willed
service, and yet not see that it takes away the excuse for neglecting
the true. At Beersheba, Abraham "called upon the name of the Lord, the
everlasting God" [Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md). There God
revealed Himself to Isaac and Jacob [Gen
26:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#023.md); [Gen
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md). There, because He had so
revealed Himself, Judah made a place of idolatry, which Israel, seeking
nought besides from Judah, sought. Beersheba was still a town or large
village in the time of Jerome. Now all is swept away, except "some
foundations of ruins," spread over 34 of a mile, "with scarcely one
stone upon another" . The wells alone remain , with the ancient names.

Gilgal shall surely go into captivity - The verbal allusions in the
prophets are sometimes artificial; sometimes, they develop the meaning
of the word itself, as when Zephaniah says, "Ekron (probably the
"firm-rooting") "shall be uprooted" [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md); sometimes, as here, the words are
connected, although not the same. In all cases, the likeness of sound
was calculated to fix them in men's memories. It would be so, if one
with authority could say, "Paris perira" , "Paris shall perish" or
"London is undone." Still more would the words, Hag-gilgal galo yigleh,
because the name Gilgal still retained its first meaning, "the great
rolling , and the word joined with it had a kindred meaning. Originally
it probably means, "swept clear away." God first "rolled away the
reproaeh of Egypt" [Jos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md) from His
people there. Then, when it made itself like the pagan, it should itself
be rolled clear away [Jer 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md).
Gilgal was originally in Benjamin, but Israel had probably annexed it to
itself, as it had Bethel and Jericho [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md), both of which had been assigned
by Joshua to Benjamin [Jos 18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021.md).

And Bethel shall come to nought - Hosea had called "Bethel, God's
house," by the name of "Bethaven [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md), Vanity-house." Amos, in allusion
to this probably, drops the first half of the name, and says that it
shall not merely be "house of vanity," but "Aven, vanity" itself. "By
sin the soul, which was the house or temple of God, becomes the temple
of vanity and of devils."

[Amos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 5:6</span></span>

Seek ye the Lord and ye shall live - Literally, "seek the Lord and
live;" being united to Him, the Fountain of life. He reimpresses on them
the one simple need of the creature, "seek God," the one true God as He
revealed Himself, not as worldly people, or the politicians of
Jeroboam's court, or the calf-priests, fabled of Him. "Seek Him." For in
Him is all; without Him, nothing.

Lest He break out like fire in Bethel - Formerly the Spirit of God came
vehemently down upon Sansom [Jdg 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006.md),
[Jdg 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019.md); [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md) and Saul [Sa1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006.md); [Sa1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006.md) and David [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md), to fit them as instruments for
God; as did the Evil spirit, when God departed from Saul [Sa1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#010.md). So now, unless they repented,
God Himself would suddenly show His powerful presence among them, but,
as He had revealed Himself to be, "the, Lord thy God is a consuming
Fire" [Deu 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md). "And devour" it,
literally, "and it" (the fire) "shall devor, and" there be "none to
quench" it "in" (better, "for") Bethel." Bethel, the center of their
idol-hopes, so far from aiding them then, shall not be able to help
itself, nor shall there be any to help it. The fire of God kindles
around it, and there is none to quench it for her (as in [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004).md).

Montanus: "The whole place treateth of mercy and justice. The whole
ground of people's punishment, calamities, condemnation is ascribed to
their own fault and negligence, who neglect the deliverance often
promised and offered them by God, and 'love darkness rather than light,
because their deeds are evil' [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md). Whoever is not saved, the whole
blame lies in their own will and negligence and malice. God, who
'willeth not that any should perish, but that all should come to
repentance' [Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md), Himself
unsought, seeks, entreats, ceases not to monish, exhort, set before them
their guilt, that they may cease to prepare such evil for themselves.
But they neither give Him entrance, nor hear His entreaties, nor admit
the warnings of the divine mercy, which if they neglect, they must needs
be made over to His justice. The goodness of God is lacking to no one,
save those who are wanting to themselves. Wherefore, having often
besought them before, He invites them yet again to salvation, putting
forth that His Name, so full of mysteries of mercy; 'Seek the Lord and
live,'" seek Him who is, the Unchangeable. He who had willed their
salvation, still willed it, for He "changes not" [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md). "He adds threatenings, that those
whom He calls to life, He might either allure by promises, or scare from
death through fear of the impending evil."

[Amos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 5:7</span></span>

Ye who turn - Those whom he calls to seek God, were people filled with
all injustice, who turned the sweetness of justice into the bitterness
of wormwood . Moses had used "gall" and "wormwood" as a proverb; "lest
there be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; the Lord will
not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and His jealousy shall
smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book
shall lie upon him" [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md), [Deu
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020.md). The word of Amos would remind
them of the word of Moses.

And leave off righteousness in the earth - Better, "and set
righteousness to rest on the ground" . They dethroned righteousness, the
representative and vice-gerent of God, and made it rest on the ground.
The "little horn," Daniel says, should "cast truth to the ground" [Dan
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md). These seem to have blended
outrage with insult, as when "the Lord our Righteousness" [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md) took our flesh, "they put on Him"
the "scarlet robe, and the crown of thorns" upon His Head, and bowed the
knee before Him, and mocked Him," and then "crucified Him." They
"deposed" her, "set her down," it may be, with a mock make-believe
deference, as people now-a-days, in civil terms, depose God, ignoring
Him and His right over them. They set her on the ground and so left her,
the image of God. This they did, not in one way only, but in all the
ways in which they could. He does not limit it to the "righteousness"
shown in doing justice. It includes all transactions between man and
man, in which right enters, all buying and selling, all equity, all
giving to another his due. All the bands of society were dissolved, and
righteousness was placed on the ground, to be trampled on by all in all
things.

[Amos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 5:8</span></span>

Seek Him that maketh the seven stars - Misbelief effaces the thought of
God as He Is. It retains the name God, but means something quite
different from the One True God. So people spoke of "the Deity," as a
sort of First Cause of all things, and did not perceive that they only
meant to own that this fair harmony of things created was not (at least
as it now exists,) self-existent, and that they had lost sight of the
Personal God who had made known to them His Will, whom they were to
believe in, obey, fear, love. "The Deity" was no object of fear or love.
It was but a bold confession that they did not mean to be Atheists, or
that they meant intellectually to admire the creation. Such confessions,
even when not consciously atheistic, become at least the parents of
Atheism or Panotheism, and slide insensibly into either. For a First
Cause, who is conceived of as no more, is an abstraction, not God. God
is the Cause of all causes.

All things are, and have their relations to each other, as cause and
effect, because He so created them. A "Great First Cause," who is only
thought of as a Cause, is a mere fiction of a man's imagining, an
attempt to appear to account for the mysteries of being, without owning
that, since our being is from God, we are responsible creatures whom He
created for Himself, and who are to yield to Him an account of the use
of our being which He gave us. In like way, Israel had probably so mixed
up the thought of God with Nature, that it had lost sight of God, as
distinct from the creation. And so Amos, after appealing to their
consciences, sets forth God to them as the Creator, Disposer of all
things, and the Just God, who redresseth man's violence and injustice.
The "seven stars," literally, "the heap," are the striking cluster of
stars, called by Greeks and Latins the Pleiades, , which consist of
seven larger stars, and in all of above forty.

Orion, a constellation in one line with the Pleiades, was conceived by
the Arabs and Syrians also, as a gigantic figure. The Chaldee also
renders, the "violent" or "the rebel." The Hebrew title "כּסיל Keciyl,
fool," adds the idea of an irreligious man, which is also the meaning of
Nimrod, "rebel," literally, "let us rebel." Job, in that he speaks of
"the bands of Orion [Job 38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md),
pictures him as "bound," the "belt" being the "band." This falls in with
the later tradition, that Nimrod, who, as the founder of Babel, was the
first rebel against God , was represented by the easterns in their
grouping of the stars, as a giant chained , the same constellation which
we call Orion.

And turneth the shadow of death into the morning - This is no mere
alternation of night and day, no "kindling" of "each day out of night."
The "shadow of death" is strictly the darkness of death, or of the grave
[Job 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md); [Job
10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md); [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md); [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md). It is used of darkness intense
as the darkness of the grave [Job
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003.md), of gloom [Job
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017.md), or moral benightening ([Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002), (1 Hebrew).md) which seems to cast
"the shadow of death" over the soul, of distress which is as the
forerunner of death [Job 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md); [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md); [Psa
107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md), [Psa
107:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#014.md); [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006.md); [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md), or of things, hidden as the
grave, which God alone can bring to light [Job
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022.md). The word is united with
darkness, physical, moral, mental, but always as intensifying it, beyond
any mere darkness. Amos first sets forth the power of God, then His
goodness. Out of every extremity of ill, God can, will, does, deliver.
He who said, "let there be light and there was light," at once changeth
any depth of darkness into light, the death-darkness of sin into the
dawn of grace, the hopeless night of ignorance into "the day-star from
on high," the night of the grave into the eternal morn of the
Resurrection which knoweth no setting. But then on impenitence the
contrary follows;

And maketh the day dark with night - Literally, "and darkeneth day into
night." As God withdraws "the shadow of death," so that there should be
no trace of it left, but all is filled with His light, so, again, when
His light is abused or neglected, He so withdraws it, as at times, to
leave no trace or gleam of it. Conscience becomes benighted, so as to
sin undoubtingly: faith is darkened, so that the soul no more even
suspects the truth. Hell has no light.

That calleth for the waters of the sea - This can be no other than a
memory of the flood, "when the waters prevailed over the earth [Gen
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#024.md). The prophet speaks of nothing
partial. He speaks of "sea" and "earth," each, as a whole, standing
against the other. "God calleth the waters of the sea and poureth them
over the face of the earth." They seem ever threatening the land, but
for Him "which hath placed the sand for the bound of the sea, that it
cannot pass it" [Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md). Now God
calls them, and "pours them over the face," that is, the whole surface.
The flood, He promised, should not again be. But it is the image of that
universal destruction, which shall end man's thousands of years of
rebellion against God. The words then of Amos, in their simplest sense,
speak of a future universal judgment of the inhabitants of the earth,
like, in extent, to that former judgment, when God "brought in the flood
upon the world of the ungodly" [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md).

The words have been thought also to describe that daily marvel of God's
Providence, how, from the salt briny sea, which could bring but
barrenness, He, by the heat of the Sun, draws up the moisture, and
discharges it anew in life-giving showers on the surface of the earth.
God's daily care of us, in the workings of His creatures is a witness
[Act 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md) of His relation to us as
our Father; it is an earnest also of our relation, and so of our
accountableness, to Him.

The Lord is His name - He, the One Self-existent Unchangeable God, who
revealed Himself to their forefathers, and forbade them to worship Him
under any form of their own device.

[Amos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 5:9</span></span>

That strengtheneth the spoiled - (Literally, "spoil" English margin)
probably That "maketh devastation to smile on the strong." . The
"smile," in anger, attests both the extremity of anger, and the
consciousness of the ease, wherewith the offence can be punished. They
were strong in their own strength; strong, as they deemed, in their
"fortress" ; "strong with an evil strength, like one phrensied against
his physician." But their strength would be weakness. "Desolation" when
God willed, would "smile at" all which they accounted "might," and would
"come against the fortress," which, as they deemed, "cut off" all
approach.

[Amos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 5:10</span></span>

They hate him that rebuketh - "The gate" is the well-known place of
concourse, where just or, in Israel now, unjust judgment was given [Deu
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#007.md); [Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004.md); [Job
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#021.md); [Sa2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002.md); [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md); [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md), where all was done which was to
be done publicly [Rut 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md), [Rut
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md). Samaria had a large area by its
chief gate, where two kings could hold court, and the 400 false prophets
and the people, in great numbers, could gather [Kg1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#010.md); [Ch2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#009.md), and a market could be held [Kg2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001.md). Josiah brake down an idol-shrine,
which was in one of the gates of Jerusalem [Kg2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008.md). The prophets seized the
opportunity of finding the people together, and preached to them there.
So it was even in the days of Solomon. "Wisdom crieth without; she
uttereth her voice in the streets; she crieth in the chief place of
concourse, in the openings of the gates, in the city she uttereth her
words, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?..." [Pro
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md), and again, "She standeth in
the top of high places, by the way, in the meeting of the paths. She
crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the
doors; Unto you, O men, I call, "[Pro
8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002.md). Jeremiah mentions two
occasions, upon which God bade him reprove the king and people in the
gates of Jerusalem [Jer 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019.md); [Jer
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002.md). There doubtless Amos and Hosea
reproved them, and, for reproving, were "hated." As Isaiah says, "they
lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate" [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md). They sinned publicly, and
therefore they were to be rebuked publicly. They sinned "in the gate" by
injustice and oppression, and therefore were to be "rebuked before all,
that others also might fear" [Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md).

And they abhor him that speaketh uprightly - Literally, "perfectly." The
prophets spoke "perfectly" , "for they spoke the all-perfect word of
God, of which David says, "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting
the soul" [Psa 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md). "Carnal eyes hate
the light of truth, which they cast aside for execrable lies, closing to
themselves the fountain of the divine mercy" . Rup.: "This is the sin
which hath no remission; this is the sin of the strong and mighty, who
sin not out of ignorance or weakness, but with impenitent heart proudly
defend their sin, and 'hate him that rebuketh arid abhor him who' dareth
to 'speak perfectly,' that is, not things which please them, but
resisting their evil." This, like all other good of God and evil of man,
met most in and against Christ. Rup.: "Who is he who 'rebuked in the
gate' or who 'spake perfectly?' David rebuked them, and spake much
perfectly, and so they hated him and said, 'what portion have we in
David, or what inheritance have we in the son of Jesse?' [Kg1
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016.md), Him also who spake these very
words, and the other prophets they hated and abhorred. But as the rest,
so this too, is truly and indubitably fulfilled in Christ, rebuking
justly and speaking perfectly. He Himself saith in a Psalm, 'They that
sat in the gate spake against Me' [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012.md), wherefore, when He had said,
'he that hateth Me hateth My Father also' [Joh
15:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#023.md), and, 'now they have. both
seen and hated both Me and My Father,' He subjoined, 'that the word
might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated Me without a
cause.' Above all then, we understand Christ, whom they hated, 'rebuking
in the gate,' that is, openly and in public; as He said, 'I spake openly
to the world, and in secret have I said nothing' [Joh
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020.md). He alone spake perfectly, 'Who
did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.' [Pe1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md). In wisdom also and doctrine, He
alone spake perfectly, perfectly. and so wonderfully, that 'the officers
of the chief priests and Pharisees' who were 'sent to take, Him, said,
Never man spake like this Man.' [Joh
7:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045.md).

Jerome: "it is a great sin to hate him who rebuketh, especially if he
rebuke thee, not out of dislike, but out of love, if he doth it 'between
thee and him alone [Mat 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md), if,
taking with' him a brother, if afterward, in the presence of the Church,
so that it may be evident that he does not blame thee out of any love of
detraction, but out of zeal for thine amendment."

[Amos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 5:11</span></span>

Forasmuch therefore - (Since they rejected reproof, he pronounces the
sentence of God upon them,) "as your treading is upon the poor." This
expresses more habitual trampling on the poor, than if he had said, "ye
tread upon the poor." They were ever trampling on those who were already
of low and depressed condition. "And ye take from him burdens of wheat,
presents of wheat." The word always signifies presents, voluntary , or
involuntary , what was carried, offered to anyone. They received "wheat"
from the poor, cleansed, winnowed, and "sold the refuse [Amo
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006.md), requiring what it was wrong to
receive, and selling what at the least it was disgraceful not to give.
God had expressly forbidden to "lend food for interest" [Lev
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037.md); [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md). It may be that, in order to
evade the law, the interest was called "a present."

Ye have built house of hewn stone - The houses of Israel were, perhaps
most commonly, built of brick dried in the sun only. As least, houses
built of hewn stone, like most of our's, are proverbially contrasted
with them, as the more solid with the more ordinary building. "The white
bricks are fallen down, and we will build with hewn, stones" [Isa
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010.md). And Ezekiel is bidden to dig
through the wall of his house [Eze
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005.md), [Eze
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#007.md). Houses of stone there were, as
appears from the directions as to the unhealthy accretions, called the
leprosy of the house [Lev 14:34-48](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#034.md). It
may be, however, that their houses of "hewn stone," had a smoothed
surface, like our "ashlar." Anyhow, the sin of luxury is not simply
measured by the things themselves, but by their relation to ourselves
and our condition also; and wrong is not estimated by the extent of the
gain and loss of the two parties only, but by the injury inflicted.

These men, who built houses, luxurious for them, had wrung from the poor
their living, as those do, who beat down the wages of the poor.
Therefore they were not to take possession of what was their own; as
Ahab, who by murder possessed himself of Naboth's vineyard, forfeited
his throne and his life. God, in the law, consulted for the feeling
which desires to enter into the fruit of a man's toil. When they should
go to war they were to proclaim, "what man" is there that hath built a
new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what
man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not eaten of it? let him
go. and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man
eat of it" [Deu 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md). Now God
reversed all this, and withdrew the tender love, whereby He had provided
it. The words, from their proverbial character, express a principle of
God's judgments, that wrong dealing, whereby a man would secure himself
or enlarge his inheritance, destroys both. Who poorer than our Lord,
bared of all upon the Cross, of whom it had been written, "They
persecuted the poor helpless man, that they might slay him who was vexed
at the heart" [Psa 109:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#015.md), and of whom
the Jews said, "Come let us kill Him, that the inheritance may be ours?"
[Mat 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038.md). They killed Him, they
said, "lest the Romans take away our place and nation" [Joh
11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048.md). "The vineyard was taken from
them;" their "place" destroyed, their "nation" dispersed.

[Amos 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 5:12</span></span>

For I know - Literally, "I have known." They thought that God did not
know, because He did not avenge; as the Psalmist says, "Thy judgments
are far above out of his sight" [Psa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md). People who do not act with the
thought of God, cease to know Him, and forget that He knows them. "Your
manifold transgressions;" literally, "many are your transgressions and
mighty your sins." Their deeds, they knew, were mighty, strong,
vigorous, decided. God says, that their "sins" were so, not many and
great only, but "mighty, strong" , "issuing not out of ignorance and
infirmity, but out of proud strength" , "'strong' in the oppression of
the poor and in provoking God," and bringing down His wrath. So Asaph
says of the prosperous; "Pride encompasseth them, as a chain; they are
corrupt, they speak oppression wickedly; they speak from on high" [Psa
73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006.md), [Psa
73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md).

They afflict the just - Literally, "afflicters of the just," that is,
such as habitually afflicted him; whose habit and quality it was to
afflict him. Our version mostly renders the word "enemies." Originally,
it signifies "afflicting, persecuting" enemies. Yet it is used also of
the enemies of God, perhaps such as persecute Him in His people, or in
His Son when in the flesh. The unjust hate the just, as is said in the
book of Wisdom; "The ungodly said, Therefore let us lie in wait for the
righteous, because he is not for our turn, and is clean contrary to our
doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law. He profeseth to
have the knowledge of God, and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.
He was made to reprove our thoughts. He is grievous unto us even to
behold, for his life is not as other people's, his ways are of another
fashion" (Wisdom [Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), [Psa
2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012).md). So when the Truth and
Righteousness came into the world, the Scribes and Pharisees hated Him
because He reproved them, "denied" [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md) and crucified "the Holy one and
the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto" them, haters and
"enemies of the Just," and preferring to Him the unjust.

That take a bribe - Literally, "a ransom." It may be that, contrary to
the law, which forbade, in these same words [Num
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022.md), "to take any ransom for the
life of a murderer," they took some ransom to set free rich murderers,
and so, (as we have seen for many years to be the effect of unjust
acquittals,) blood was shed with impunity, and was shed the more,
because it was disregarded. The word, however, is used in one place
apparently of any bribe, through which a man connives at injustice [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md).

[Amos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 5:13</span></span>

Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time - The "time" may
be either the time of the obduracy of the wicked, or that of the common
punishment. For a time may be called "evil," whether evil is done, or is
suffered in it, as Jacob says, "Few and evil have the days of the years
of my life been" [Gen 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md). Of the
first, he would perhaps say, that the oppressed poor would, if wise, be
silent, not complaining or accusing, for, injustice having the mastery,
complaint would only bring on them fresh sufferings. And again also he
may mean that, on account of the incorrigibleness of the people, the
wise and the prophets would be silent, because the more the people were
rebuked, the more impatient and worse they became. So our Lord was
silent before His judges, as had been foretold of Him, for since they
would not hear, His speaking would only increase their condemnation. "If
I tell you, ye will not believe; and if I also ask you, ye will not
answer Me, nor let Me go" [Luk
22:67-68](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067.md). So God said by Solomon: "He
that reproveth a scorner getteth himself shame, and he that rebuketh a
wicked man getteth himself a blot" [Pro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md). And our Lord bids, "Give not that
which is holy unto dogs, and cast not your pearls before swine" [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md). They hated and rejected those who
rebuked them. [Mat 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#010.md). Since then
rebuke profited not, the prophets should hold their peace. It is a
fearful judgment, when God withholds His warnings. In times of
punishment also the prudent keep silence. Intense affliction is "dumb
and openeth not its month," owning the hand of God. It may be too, that
Amos, like Hosea [Hos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md), [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md), expresses the uselessness of all
reproof, in regard to the most of those whom be called to repentance,
even while he continued earnestly to rebuke them.

[Amos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 5:14</span></span>

Seek good and not evil - that is, and "seek not evil." Amos again takes
up his warning, "seek not Bethel; seek the Lord." Now they not only "did
evil," but they "sought" it diligently; they were diligent in doing it,
and so, in bringing it on themselves; they sought it out and the
occasions of it. People "cannot seek good without first putting away
evil, as it is written, 'cease to do evil, learn to do well' [Isa
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md)." "Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon." He bids them use the same diligence in seeking good which they
now used for evil. Seek it also wholly, not seeking at one while good,
at another, evil, but wholly good, and Him who is Good. "He seeketh
good, who believeth in Him who saith, 'I am the Good Shepherd' [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md)."

That ye may live - In Him who "is the Life; and so the Lord, the God of
hosts shall be with you," by His holy presence, grace and protection,
"as ye have spoken." Israel looked away from the sins whereby he
displeased God, and looked to his half-worship of God as entitling him
to all which God had promised to full obedience. : "They gloried in the
nobleness of their birth after the flesh, not in imitating the faith and
lives of the patriarchs. So then, because they were descended from
Abraham, they thought that God must defend them. Such were those Jews,
to whom the Saveour said, "If ye were Abraham's seed, ye would do the
works of Abraham" [Joh 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md); and His
forerunner, 'think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham for our
father' [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)." They wished that
God should abide with them, that they might "abide in the land" [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md), but they cared not to abide with
God.

[Amos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 5:15</span></span>

Hate the evil and love the good - Man will not cease wholly to "seek
evil," unless he "hate" it; nor will he "seek good," unless he "love"
it. Jerome: "He 'hateth evil,' who not only is not overcome by pleasure,
but hates its deeds; and he 'loveth good,' who, not unwillingly or of
necessity or from fear, doth what is good, but because it is good."
Dionysius: "Evil of sin must be hated, in and for itself; the sinner
must not be hated in himself, but only the evil in him." They hated him,
who reproved them; he bids them hate sin. They "set down righteousness
on the ground;" he bids them, "establish," literally, "set up firmly,
judgment in the gate." To undo, as far as anyone can, the effects of
past sin, is among the first-fruits of repentance.

It may be that the Lord God of Hosts will be gracious - o: "He speaks
so, in regard of the changeableness and uncertainty, not in God, but in
man. There is no question but that God is gracious to all who "hate evil
and love good;" but He doth not always deliver them from temporal
calamity or captivity, because it is not for their salvation. Yet had
Israel "hated evil and loved good," perchance He would have delivered
them from captivity, although He frequently said, they should be carried
captive. For so He said to the two tribes in Jeremiah, "Amend your ways,
and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place" [Jer
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md). But since God knew that most of
them would not repent, He saith not, "will be gracious unto Israel,"
but, "unto the remnant of Joseph, that is, "the remnant, according to
the election of grace" [Rom 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md);
such as had been "the seven thousand who bowed not the knee unto Baal;"
those who repented, while "the rest were hardened." He says, "Joseph,"
not Ephraim, in order to recall to them the deeds of their father.
Jacob's blessing on Joseph descended upon Ephraim, but was forfeited by
Jeroboam's "sin wherewith he made Israel to sin." Rup.: "Joseph in his
deeds and sufferings was a type of Jesus Christ, in whom the remnant is
saved." "A remnant," however, only, "should be saved;" so the prophet
says;

[Amos 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 5:16</span></span>

Therefore the Lord, the God of Hosts, the Lord - For the third time in
these three last verses Amos again reminds them, by whose authority he
speaks, His who had revealed Himself as "I am," the self-existent God,
God by nature and of nature, the Creator and Ruler and Lord of all,
visible or invisible, against their false gods, or fictitious
substitutes for the true God. Here, over and above those titles, "He
is," that is, He alone is, the "God of Hosts, God of all things, in
heaven and earth," the heavenly bodies from whose influences the
idolaters hoped for good, and the unseen evil beings [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md), who seduced them, he adds the
title, which people most shrink from, "Lord." He who so threatened, was
the Same who had absolute power over His creatures, to dispose of them,
as He willed. It costs people nothing to own God, as a Creator, the
Cause of causes, the Orderer of all things by certain fixed laws. It
satisfies certain intellects, so to own Him. What man, a sinner, shrinks
from, is that the God is Lord, the absolute disposer and Master of his
sinful self.

Wailing in all streets - Literally, "broad places," that is,
market-places. "There," where judgments were held, where were the
markets, where consequently had been all the manifold oppressions
through injustice in judgments and in dealings, and the wailings of the
oppressed; "wailing" should come on them.

They shall say in all-the highways - that is, "streets, alas! alas!"
our, "woe, woe." It is the word so often used by our Lord; "woe unto
you." This is no imagery. Truth has a more awful, sterner, reality than
any imagery. The terribleness of the prophecy lies in its truth. When
war pressed without on the walls of Samaria, and within was famine and
pestilence, woe, woe, woe, must have echoed in every street, for in
every street was death and fear of worse. Yet imagine every sound of joy
or din or hum of people, or mirth of children, hushed in the streets,
and woe, woe, going up from every street of a metropolis, in one
unmitigated, unchanging, ever-repeated monotony of grief. Such were the
present fruits of sin. Yet what a mere shadow of the inward grief is its
outward utterance!

And they shall call the farmer to mourning - To cultivate the fields
would then only be to provide food for the enemy. His occupation would
be gone. One universal sorrow would give one universal employment. To
this, they would call those unskilled, with their deep strong voices;
they would, by a public act, "proclaim wailing to those skillful in
lamentation." It was, as it were, a dirge over the funeral of their
country. As, at funerals, they employed minstrels, both men and women ,
who, by mournful anthems and the touching plaintiveness of the human
voice, should stir up deeper depths of sorrow, so here, over the whole
of Israel. And as at the funeral of one respected or beloved, they used
exclamations of woe, "ah my brother!" and "ah sister, ah lord, ah his
glory," so Jeremiah bids them, "call and make haste and take up a
wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears: for a voice of
wailing is heard out of Zion. How are we spoiled!" [Jer
9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md). : "In joy, men long to impart
their joys to others, and exhort them to joy with them. Our Lord
sanctions this, in speaking of the Good Shepherd, who called His friends
and neighbors together, "rejoice with Me, for I have found the sheep
which I had lost."

Nor is it anything new, that, when we have received any great benefit
from God, we call even the inanimate creation to thank and praise God.
So did David ofttimes and the three children. So too in sorrow. When
anything adverse has befallen us, we invite even senseless things to
grieve with us, as though our own tears sufficed not for so great a
sorrow." The same feeling makes the rich now clothe those of their
household in mourning, which made those of old hire mourners, that all
might be in harmony with their grief.

[Amos 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">amo 5:17</span></span>

And in all vineyards shall be wailing - All joy should be turned into
sorrow. Where aforetime was the vintage-shout in thankfulness for the
ingathering, and anticipating gladness to come, there, in the source of
their luxury, should be wailing, the forerunner of sorrow to come. it
was a vintage, not of wine, but of woe.

For I will pass through thee - In the destruction of the firstborn in
Egypt, God did not "pass through" but "passed over" them, and they kept,
in memory thereof the feast of the Passover. Now God would no longer
"pass over" them and their sins. He says, "I will pass through thee," as
He then said, "I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and
will smite all the firstborn of the land of Egypt - and against all the
gods of Egypt I will execute judgment" [Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md). As God says by Hosea, "I will
not enter the city" [Hos 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md), that
is, He would not make His presence felt, or take cognizance, when to
take cognizance would be to punish, so here, contrariwise, He says, "I
will pass through," taking exact and severe account, in judgment. Jerome
further says, "so often as this word is used in Holy Scripture, in the
person of God, it denotes punishment, that He would not abide among
them, but would pass through and leave them. Surely, it is an image of
this, that, when the Jews would have cast our Lord headlong from the
brow of the hill whereon their city was built, "He passed through the
midst of them [Luk 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030.md), so that they
could not see Him nor know Him, "and so went His way." And this, when He
had just told them, that none of the widows of Israel were fed by Elias,
or the lepers cleansed by Elisha, save the widow of Sarepta, and Naaman
the Syrian. So should their leprosy cleave to them, and the famine of
the word of God and of the oil of the Holy Spirit abide among them,
while the Gentiles were washed by His laver and fed with the bread of
life."

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

Woe unto you that desire - for yourselves.

The Day of the Lord - There were "mockers in those days" [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md), as there are now, and as there
shall be in the last. And as the "scoffers in the last days" [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md) shall say, "Where is the promise
of His coming?" so these said, "let Him make speed and hasten His work,
that we way see it, and let the council of the Holy One of Israel draw
nigh and come, that we may know it" [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md). Jeremiah complained; "they say
unto me, where is the word of the Lord? let it come now!" [Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md). And God says to Ezekiel, "Son
of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying,
the days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? The vision that he
seeth is for many days, and he prophesieth of the times far off" [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md), [Eze
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027.md). "They would shew their courage
and strength of mind, by longing for the Day of the Lord, which the
prophets foretold, in which God was to shew forth His power on the
disobedient."

Lap.: "Let it come, what these prophets threaten until they are hoarse,
let it come, let it come. It is ever held out to us, and never comes. We
do not believe that it will come at all, or if it do come, it will not
be so dreadful after all; it will go as it came." It may be, however,
that they who scoffed at Amos, cloked their unbelief under the form of
desiring the good days, which God had promised by Joel afterward.
Jerome: "There is not," they would say, "so much of evil in the
captivity, as there is of good in what the Lord has promised afterward."
Amos meets the hypocrisy or the scoff, by the appeal to their
consciences, "to what end is it to you?" They had nothing in common with
it or with God. Whatever it had of good, was not for such as them. "The
Day of the Lord is darkness, and not light." Like the pillar of the
cloud between Israel and the Egyptians, which betokened God's presence,
every day in which He shows forth His presence, is a day of light and
darkness to those of different characters.

The prophets foretold both, but not to all. These scoffers either denied
the Coming of that day altogether, or denied its terrors. Either way,
they disbelieved God, and, disbelieving Him, would have no share in His
promises. To them, the Day of the Lord would be unmixed darkness,
distress, desolation, destruction, without one ray of gladness. The
tempers of people, their belief or disbelief, are the same, as to the
Great Day of the Lord, the Day of Judgment. It is all one, whether
people deny it altogether or deny its terrors. In either case, they deny
it, such as God has ordained it. The words of Amos condemn them too.
"The Day of the Lord" had already become the name for every day of
judgment, leading on to the Last Day. The principle of all God's
judgments is one and the same. One and the same are the characters of
those who are to be judged. In one and the same way, is each judgment
looked forward to, neglected, prepared for, believed, disbelieved. In
one and the same way, our Lord has taught us, will the Great Day come,
as the judgments of the flood or upon Sodom, and will find people
prepared or unprepared, as they were then. Words then, which describe
the character of any day of Judgment, do, according to the Mind of God
the Holy Spirit, describe all, and the last also. Of this too, and that
chiefly, because it is the greatest, are the words spoken, "Woe unto
you, who desire," amiss or rashly or scornfully or in misbelief, "the
Day of the Lord, to what end is it for you? The Day of the Lord is
darkness and not light."

Rup.: "This sounds a strange woe. It had not seemed strange, had he
said, 'Woe to you, who fear not the Day of the Lord.' For, 'not to
fear,' belongs to bad, ungodly people. But the good may desire it, so
that the Apostle says, 'I desire to depart and to be with Christ' [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md). Yet even their desire is not
without a sort of fear. For 'who can say, I have made my heart clean?'
[Pro 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009.md). Yet that is the fear, not
of slaves, but of sons; 'nor hath it torment,' [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018.md), for it hath 'strong consolation
through hope' [Heb 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md). When then he says, 'Woe unto you
that desire the Day of the Lord,' he rebuketh their boldness, 'who trust
in themselves, that they are righteous' [Luk
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md)." "At one and the same time,"
says Jerome, "the confidence of the proud is shaken off, who, in order
to appear righteous before people, are accustomed to long for the Day of
Judgment and to say, 'Would that the Lord would come, would that we
might be dissolved and be with Christ,' imitating the Pharisee, who
spake in the Gospel, "God, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men are"
[Luk 18:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md).

For the very fact, that they "desire," and do not fear, "the Day of the
Lord," shows, that they are worthy of punishment, since no man is
without sin [Ch2 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#036.md), and the "stars
are not pure in His sight" [Job 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005.md).
And He "concluded all under sin, that he might have mercy upon all" [Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md); [Rom
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md). Since, then, no one can judge
concerning the Judgment of God, and we are to "give account of every
idle word" [Mat 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036.md), and Job
"offered sacrifices" [Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md) daily
for his sons, lest they should have thought something perversely against
the Lord, what rashness it is, to long to reign alone! [Co1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md). In troubles and distresses we are
accustomed to say, 'would that we might depart out of the body and be
freed from the miseries of this world,' not knowing that, while we are
in this flesh, we have place for repentance; but if we depart, we shall
hear that of the prophet, "in hell who will give Thee thanks?" [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md). That is "the sorrow of this
world" [Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md), which worketh
"death," wherewith the Apostle would not have him sorrow who had sinned
with his father's wife; the sorrow whereby the wretched Judas too
perished, who, "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow" [Co2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md), joined murder [Mat
27:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003.md) to his betrayal, a murder the
worst of murders, so that where he thought to find a remedy, and that
death by hanging was the end of ills, there he found the lion and the
bear, and the serpent, under which names I think that different
punishments are intended, or else the devil himself, who is rightly
called a lion or bear or serpent."

[Amos 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">amo 5:19</span></span>

As if a man, did flee from a lion - The Day of the Lord is a day of
terror on every side. Before and behind, without and within, abroad
under the roof of heaven, or under the shelter of his own, everywhere is
terror and death. The Syrian bear is said to have been more fierce and
savage than the lion. For its fierceness and voracity [Dan
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md), God made it, in Daniel's vision,
a symbol of the empire of the Medes. From both lion and bear there might
be escape by flight. When the man had "leaned his hand" trustfully "on
the wall" of his own house, "and the serpent bit him," there was no
escape. He had fled from death to death, from peril to destruction.

[Amos 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">amo 5:20</span></span>

Shall not the Day of the Lord be darkness? - He had described that Day
as a day of inevitable destruction, such its man's own conscience and
guilty fears anticipate, and then appeals to their own consciences, "is
it not so, as I have said?" People's consciences are truer than their
intellect. However, they may employ the subtlety of their intellect to
dull their conscience, they feel, in their heart of hearts, that there
is a Judge, that guilt is punished, that they are guilty. The soul is a
witness to its own deathlessness, its own accountableness, its own
punishableness . Intellect carries the question out of itself into the
region of surmising and disputings. Conscience is compelled to receive
it back into its own court, and to give the sentence, which it would
fain withhold. Like the god of the pagan fable, who changed himself into
all sorts of forms, but when he was still held fast, gave at the last,
the true answer, conscience shrinks back, twists, writhes, evades, turns
away, but, in the end, it will answer truly, when it must. The prophet
then, turns quick round upon the conscience, and says, "tell me, for you
know."

[Amos 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">amo 5:21</span></span>

I hate, I despise your feasts - Israel clave to its heart's sin, the
worship of the true God, under the idol-form of the calf; else, it would
fain be conscientious and scrupulous. It had its "feasts" of solemn
"joy" and the "restraint" of its "solemn assemblies" , which all were
constrained to keep, abstaining from all servile work. They offered
"whole burnt offerings," the token of self-sacrifice, in which the
sacrificer retained nothing to himself, but gave the whole freely to
God. They offered also "peace offerings," as tokens of the willing
thankfulness of souls at peace with God. What they offered, was the best
of its kind, "fatted beasts." Hymns of praise, full-toned chorus,
instrumental music! What was missing, Israel thought, to secure them the
favor of God? Love and obedience. "If ye love Me, keep My commandments."
And so those things, whereby they hoped to propitiate God, were the
object of His displeasure. "I hate, I despise, I will not accept" with
good pleasure; "I will not regard," look toward, "I will not hear, will
not smell." The words, "I will not smell," reminded them of that threat
in the law" [Lev 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031.md), "I will make
your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will
not smell the savor of your sweet odors." In so many ways does God
declare that He would not accept or endure, what they all the while were
building upon, as grounds of their acceptance. And yet so secure were
they, that the only sacrifice which they did not offer, was the sin or
trespass offering. Worshiping "nature," not a holy, Personal, God, they
had no sense of unholiness, for which to plead the Atoning Sacrifice to
come. Truly each Day of Judgment unveils much self-deceit. How much more
the Last!

[Amos 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">amo 5:23</span></span>

Take thou away from Me - Literally, "from upon Me," that is, from being
a burden to Me, a weight on Me. So God says by Isaiah, "your new moons
and your appointed feasts My soul hateth; they are a burden upon Me; I
am weary to bear them" [Isa 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014.md).
Their "songs" and hymns were but a confused, tumultuous, "noise," since
they had not the harmony of love.

For - (And) the melody of thy viols I will not hear - Yet the "nebel,"
probably a sort of harp, was almost exclusively consecrated to the
service of God, and the Psalms were God's own writing. Doubtless they
sounded harmoniously in their own ears; but it reached no further. Their
melody, like much Church-music, was for itself, and ended in itself. :
"Let Christian chanters learn hence, not to set the whole devotion of
Psalmody in a good voice, subtlety of modulation and rapid intonation,
etc., quavering like birds, to tickle the ears of the curious, take them
off to themselves and away from prayer, lest they hear from God, 'I will
not hear the melody of thy viols.' Let them learn that of the Apostle,
'I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding
also' [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md)." Augustine, in [Psa
30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md); Enarr. iv. (p. 203. Oxford
Translation) L.: "If the Psalm prays, pray; if it sorrows, sorrow; if it
is glad, rejoice; if full of hope, hope; if of fear, fear. For whatever
is therein written, is our mirror."

Augustine in Ps. 119 (n. 9. T. v. p. 470. Old Testament) L.: "How many
are loud in voice, dumb in heart! How many lips are silent, but their
love is loud! For the ears of God are to the heart of man. As the ears
of the body are to the mouth of man, so the heart of man is to the ears
of God. Many are heard with closed lips, and many who cry aloud are not
heard." Dionysius: "God says, 'I will not hear," as He says, 'praise is
not seemly in the mouth of a sinner' (Ecclesiaticus 15:9), and, 'to the
ungodly saith God, what hast thou to do, to declare My statutes?' [Psa
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016.md), and, 'he that turneth away his
ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination' [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009.md). It is not meant hereby that the
wicked ought wholly to abstain from the praise of God and from prayers,
but that they should be diligent to amend, and know that through such
imperfect services they cannot be saved." The prophet urges upon them
the terribleness of the Day of Judgment, that they might feel and flee
its terribleness, before it comes. He impresses on them the
fruitlessness of their prayers, that, amending, they might so pray, that
God would hear them.

[Amos 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">amo 5:24</span></span>

But - (And) let judgment run down (Literally, "roll" English margin)
"like water." The duties of either table include both; since there is no
true love for man without the love of God, nor any real love or duty to
God without the love of man. People will exchange their sins for other
sins. They will not break them off unless they be converted to God. But
the first outward step in conversion, is to break off sin. He bids them
then "let judgment," which had hitherto ever been perverted in its
course, "roll on like" a mighty tide of "waters," sweeping before it all
hindrances, obstructed by no power, turned aside by no bribery, but
pouring on in one perpetual flow, reaching all, refreshing all, and
"righteousness like a mighty (or ceaseless) stream." The word "ethan"
may signify "strong or perennial." Whence the seventh month, just before
the early rain, was called "the month Ethanim [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md), that is, the month of the
"perennial streams," when they alone flowed. In the meaning "perennial,"
it would stand tacitly contrasted with "streams which fail or lie." True
righteousness is not fitful, like an intermitting stream, vehement at
one time, then disappearing, but continuous, unfailing.

[Amos 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">amo 5:25</span></span>

Have ye offered - (better, "Did ye offer") unto Me sacrifices and
offerings? Israel justified himself to himself by his half-service. This
had been his way from the first. "Their heart was not whole with God,
neither abode they in His covenant" [Psa
78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md). He thought to be accepted by
God, because he did a certain homage to Him. He acknowledged God in his
own way. God sets before him another instance of this half-service and
what it issued in; the service of that generation which He brought out
of Egypt, and which left their bones in the wilderness. The idolatry of
the ten tribes was the revival of the idolatry of the wilderness. The
ten tribes owned as the forefathers of their worship those first
idolaters . They identified themselves with sin which they did not
commit. By approving it and copying it, they made that sin their own. As
the Church of God in all times is one and the same, and Hosea says of
God's vision to Jacob, "there He spake with us" , so that great opposite
camp, the city of the devil, has a continuous existence through all
time. These idolaters were "filling up the measure of" their
forefathers, and in the end of those forefathers, who perished in the
wilderness where they sinned, they might behold their own. As God
rejected the divided service of their forefathers, so He would their's.

God does not say that they did not offer sacrifice at all, but that they
did not offer unto "Him." The "unto Me" is emphatic. If God is not
served wholly and alone, He is not served at all. : "He regardeth not
the offering, but the will of the offerer." Some sacrifices were offered
during the 38 years and a half, after God had rejected that generation,
and left them to die in the wilderness. For the rebellion of Korah and
his company was a claim to exercise the priesthood, as Aaron was
exercising it [Num 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005.md), [Num
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009.md). When atonement was to be
made, the "live coals" were already on the altar [Num
16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md). These, however, were not the
free-will offerings of the people, but the ordinance of God, performed
by the priests. The people, in that they went after their idols, had no
share in nor benefit from what was offered in their name. So Moses says,
"they sacrificed to devils, not to God" [Deu
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md); and Ezekiel, "Their heart went
after their idols" [Eze 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#016.md).

Those were the gods of their affections, whom they chose. God had taken
them for His people, and had become their God, on the condition that
they should not associate other gods with Him [Exo
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md). Had they loved God who made
them, they would have loved none beside Him. Since they chose other
gods, these were the objects of their love. God was, at most, an object
of their fear. As He said by Hosea, "their bread is for themselves, it
shall not enter into the house of the Lord" [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md), so here He asks, and by asking
denies it, "Did ye offer unto Me?" Idolatry and heresy feign a god of
their own. They do not own God as He has revealed Himself; and since
they own not God as He is, the god whom they worship, is not the true
God, but some creature of their own imaginings, such as they conceive
God to be. Anti-Trinitarianism denies to God His essential Being,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Other heresies refuse to own His awful
holiness and justice; others, the depth of His love and condescension.
Plainly, their god is not the one true God. So these idolaters, while
they associated with God gods of cruelty and lust, and looked to them
for things which God in His holiness and love refused them, did not own
God, as the One Holy Creator, the Sole Disposer of all things.

[Amos 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">amo 5:26</span></span>

But ye have borne - Literally, "And ye bare the tabernacle of your
Moloch" (literally, "your king," from where the idol Moloch had its
name.) He assigns the reason, why he had denied that they sacririced to
God in the wilderness. "Did ye offer sacrifices unto Me, and ye bare?"
that is, seeing that ye bare. The two were incompatible. Since they did
"carry about the tabernacle of their king," they did not really worship
God. He whom they chose as "their king," was their god. The "tabernacle"
or "tent" was probably a little portable shrine, such as Demetrius the
silversmith and those of his craft made for the little statues of their
goddess Diana [Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md). Such are
mentioned in Egyptian idolatry. "They carry forth" we are told , "the
image in a small shrine of gilt wood."

Of your Moloch and Chiun - The two clauses must be read separately, the
"tabernacles of Moloch" (strictly, "of your king,") "and Chiun your
images." The two clauses, "the tabernacle of your king, and Chiun your
images," are altogether distinct. They correspond to one another, but
they must not be read as one whole, in the sense, "the tabernacle of
your king and of Chiun your images." The rendering of the last clause is
uncertain. God has so "utterly abolished the idols" [Isa
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018.md), through whom Satan contested
with Him the allegiance of His people, that we have no certain
knowledge, what they were. There may be some connection between the god
whom the Israelites in the wilderness worshiped as "their king," and him
whose worship Solomon, in his decay, brought into Jerusalem, the god
whom the Ammonites worshiped as "the king, Hammolech," or, as he is once
called, "Molech , and three times "Milchom" [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033.md); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md) (perhaps an abstract, as some
used to speak of "the Deity"). He is mostly called "Hammolech," the
Ammonite way of pronouncing what the Hebrews called "Hammelech, the
king."

But since the name designates the god only as "the king," it may have
been given to different gods, whom the pagan worshiped as their chief
god. In Jewish idolatry, it became equivalent to Baal [Jer
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005.md); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035.md), "lord;" and to avert his
displeasure, the Hebrews (as did the Carthaginians, a Phoenician people,
down to the time of our Lord ), burned their own children, "their sons
and their daughters," alive to him. Yet, even in these dreadful rites,
the Carthaginian worship was more cold-blooded and artificial than that
of Phoenicia. But whether "the king," whom the Israelites worshiped in
the wilderness, was the same as the Ammonite Molech or no, those
dreadful sacrifices were then no part of his worship; else Amos would
not have spoken of the idolatry, "as the carrying about his tabernacle"
only.

He would have described it by its greatest offensiveness. "The king" was
a title also of the Egyptian Deity, Osiris , who was identified with the
sun, and whose worship Israel may probably have brought with them, as
well as that of the calf, his symbol. Again most of the old translators
have retained the Hebrew word Chiyyan , either regarding it as a proper
name, or unable to translate it. Some later tradition identities it with
tire planet Saturn , which under a different name, the Arabs propitiated
as a malevolent being . In Ephrem's time, the pagan Syrians worshiped
"the child-devouring Chivan" .

Israel however, did not learn the idolatry from the neighboring Arabs,
since it is not the Arab name of that planet . In Egyptian, the name of
Chunsu, one of the 12 gods who severally were thought to preside over
the 12 months, appears in an abridged form Chuns or Chon . He was, in
their mythology, held to be "the oldest son of Ammon" ; "his name is
said to signify , "power, might;" and he to be that ideal of might,
worshiped as the Egyptian Hercules ."

Etymology M. See Sir G. Wilk. in Rawlinson, Herodotus, ii. 78. note.
"The Egyptians called Hercules Chon." L. Girald (Opp. ii. 327) from
Xenophon. Antioch. Drus. but the authority given is wrong). The name
Chun extended into Phoenician and Assyrian proper names. Still Chon is
not Chiyyun; and the fact that the name was retained as Chon or Chun in
Phoenicia (where the worship was borrowed) as well as in Assyria, is a
ground for hesitating to identify with it the word of Chiyyun, which has
a certain likeness only to the abridged name. Jerome's Hebrew teacher on
the other hand knew of no such tradition, and Jerome renders it "image .
And certainly it is most natural to render it not as a name, but as a
common noun. It may probably mean, "the pedestal," the "basis of your
images." The prophet had spoken of their images, as covered over with
their little "shrines, the shrines of your king." Here he may, not
improbably, speak of them, its fastened to a pedestal. Such were the
gods, whom they chose for the One true God, gods, "carried about,"
covered over, fixed to their place, lest they should fall.

The worship was certainly some form of star-worship, since there
follows, "the star of your god." It took place after the worship of the
calf. For Stephen, after having spoken of that idolatry says, "Then God
turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written
in the book of the prophets" [Act
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md). Upon their rebellions, God at
last gave them up to themselves. Stephen calls the god whom they
worshiped, "Rephan," quoting the then existing Greek translation,
"having regard," Jerome says, "to the meaning rather than the words.
This is to be observed in all Holy Scripture, that Apostles and
apostolic men, in citing testimonies from the Old Testament, regard, not
the words, but the meaning, nor do they follow the words, step by step,
provided they do not depart from the meaning."

Of the special idolatry there is no mention in Moses, in like way as the
mention of the worship of the "goat , a second symbol of the Pantheistic
worship of Egypt , is contained only incidentally in the prohibition of
that worship. After the final rebellion, upon which God rejected that
generation, Holy Scripture takes no account of them. They had failed
God; they had forfeited the distinction, for which God had created,
preserved, taught them, revealed Himself to them, and had, by great
miracles, rescued them from Egypt. Thenceforth, that generation was cast
aside unnoticed.

Which ye made to yourselves - This was the fundamental fault, that they
"made it for themselves." Instead of the tabernacle, which God, their
king, appointed, they "bare about the tabernacle" of him whom they took
for their king; and for the service which He gave, they "chose new gods"
[Jdg 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008.md) for themselves. Whereas God
made them for Himself, they made for themselves gods out of their own
mind. All idolatry is self will, first choosing a god, and then enslaved
to it.

[Amos 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">amo 5:27</span></span>

Therefore - (And) this being so, such having been their way from the
beginning until now, will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
Damascus Syria was the most powerful enemy by whom God had heretofore
chastened them [Kg2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md). From Syria
He had recently, for the time, delivered them, and had given Damascus
into their hands [Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md). That day of grace had been
wasted, and they were still rebellious. Now God would bring against them
a mightier enemy. Damascus, the scene of their triumph, should be their
pathway to captivity. God would "cause" them "to go into captivity," not
to "Damascus," from where they might have easily returned, but "beyond"
it, as He did, "into the cities of the Medes." But Israel had, up to the
time of Amos and beyond it, no enemy, no war, "beyond Damascus." Jehu
had probably paid tribute to Shalmanubar king of Assyria, to strengthen
himself . The Assyrian monarch had warred against Israel's enemies, and
seemingly received some check from them (see the note above at [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003).md).

Against Israel he had shown no hostility. But for the conspiracy of one
yet to be born in private life, one of the captains of Israel who by
murder, became its sovereign, it might have continued on in its own
land. The Assyrian monarchs needed tribute, not slaves; nor did they
employ Israel as slaves. Exile was but a wholesale imprisonment of the
nation in a large but safe prison-house. Had they been still, they were
more profitable to Assyria, as tributaries in their own land. There was
no temptation to remove them, when Amos prophesied. The temptation came
with political intrigues which had not then commenced. The then Assyrian
monarch, Shamasiva, defeated their enemies the Syrians, united with and
aiding the Babylonians ; "they" had then had no share in the opposition
to Assyria, but lay safe in their mountain-fastness.

It has been said , "Although the kingdom of Israel had, through
Jeroboam, recovercd its old borders, yet careless insolence, luxury,
unrighteousness, "must" bring the destruction of the kingdom which the
prophet foretells. The prophet does but dimly forebode the superior
power of Assyria." Solomon had declared the truth, "Righteousness
exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people" [Pro
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#034.md). But there are many sorts of
decay. Decay does not involve the transportation of a people. Nay, decay
would not bring it, but the contrary. A mere luxurious people rots on
its own soil, and would be left to rot there. It was the little remnant
of energy, political cabaling, warlike spirit, in Israel, which brought
its ruin from man. Idolatry, "insolence, luxury, unrighteousness," bring
down the displeasure of God, not of man. Yet Amos foretold, that God
would bring the destruction through man.

They were, too, no worse than their neighbors, nor so bad; not so bad as
the Assyrians themselves, except that, God having revealed Himself to
them, they had more light. The sin then, the punishment the mode of
punishment, belong to the divine revelation. Such sins and worse have
existed in Christian nations. They were in part sins directly against
God. God reserves to Himself, how and when He will punish. He has
annexed no such visible laws of punishment to a nation's sins that man
could, of his own wisdom or observation of God's ways, foresee it. They
through whom Itc willed to inflict it, and whom Amos pointed out, were
not provoked by "those" sins. There was no connection between Israel's
present sins, and Assyria's future vengeance. No Eastern despot cares
for the oppressions of his subjects, so that his own tribute is
collected. See the whole range of Muslim rule now. As far too as we
know, neither Assyria nor any other power had hitherto punished
rebellious nations by transporting them ; and certainly Israel had not
yet rebelled, or meditated rebellion. He only who controls the
rebellious wills of people, and through their self-will works out His
own all-wise Will and man's punishment, could know the future of Israel
and Assyria, and how through the pride of Assyria He would bring down
the pride of Samaria.

It has been well said by a thoughtful observer of the world's history,
"Whosoever attempts to prophesy, not being inspired, is a fool." We
English know our own sins, many and grievous; we know of a vast reign of
violence, murder, blasphemy, theft, uncleanness, covetousness, dishonest
dealing, unrighteousness, and of the breach of every commandment of God:
we know well now of an instrument in God's Hands, not far off; like the
Assyrian, but within two hours of our coast; armaments have been
collected; a harbor is being formed; our own coast openly examined;
iron-sheeted vessels prepared; night-signals provided; some of our own
alienated population organized; with a view to our invasion. We
recognize the likelihood of the invasion, fortify our coast, arm, not as
a profession, but for security. Our preparations testify, how widespread
is our expectation. No one scarcely doubts that it will be.

Yet who dare predict the issue? Will God permit that scourge to come?
Will he prevail? What would be the extent of our sufferings or loss? How
would our commerce or our Empire be impaired? Would it be dismembered?
Since no man can affirm anything as to this which is close at hand,
since none of us would dare to affirm in God's Name, in regard to any
one stage of all this future, that this or that would or would not
happen, then let people have at least the modesty of the magicians of
Egypt, and seeing in God's prophets those absolute predictions of a
future, such as their own wisdom, under circumstances far more
favorable, could not dare to make, own; "This is the finger of God" [Exo
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019.md). Not we alone. We see all Europe
shaken; we see powers of all sorts, heaving to and fro; we see the
Turkish power ready to dissolve, stayed up, like a dead man, only by
un-Christian jealousies of Christians. Some things we may partially
guess at.

But with all our means of knowing what passes everywhere, with all our
knowledge of the internal impulses of nations, hearing, as we do, almost
every pulse which beats in the great European system, knowing the
diseases which, here and there, threaten convulsion or dissolution, no
one dare stake his human wisdom on any absolute prediction, like these
of the shepherd of Tekoa as to Damascus (see the note above at [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005). pp. 160, 161.md) and Israel. To say
the like in God's Name, unless inspired, we should know to be blasphemy.
God Himself set the alternative before men. "Let all the nations be
gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who among them that
can declare this, and show former things? Let them bring forth their
witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say," It is
"truth" [Isa 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md).

Stephen, in quoting this prophecy, substitutes, Babylon for Damascus, as
indeed "the cities of the Medes" were further than Babylon. Perhaps he
set the name, in order to remind them, that as God had brought Abraham
"out of the land of the Chaldeans" [Act
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md), leaving the idols which his
"fathers" had "served" [Jos 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014.md), to
serve God only, so they, serving idols, were carried back, from where
Abraham had come, forfeiting, with the faith of Abraham, the promises
made to Abraham; aliens and outcasts.

Saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts - The Lord of the heavenly hosts for
whose worship they forsook God; the Lord of the hosts on earth, whose
ministry He employs to punish those who rebel against Him , "For He hath
many hosts to execute His judgments, the hosts of the Assyrians, the
Medes and Persians, the Greeks and Romans." All creatures in heaven and
in earth are, as He says of the holy Angels, "ministers of His, that do
His pleasure" [Psa 103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021.md).
