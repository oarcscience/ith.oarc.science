### [Zechariah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

[Zechariah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 13:1</span></span>

In that day there shall be a fountain opened - Zechariah often repeats,
"in that day" [Zac 12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003), [Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006), [Zac
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008), [Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011); [Zac
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001), [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004); [Zac
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006), [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008), [Zac
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013), [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020), resuming his subject again and
again, as a time not proximate, but fixed and known of God, of which he
declared somewhat. It is "that day" which "Abraham desired to see, and
saw it" [Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056), whether by direct
revelation, or in the typical sacrifice of Isaac, "and was glad:" it was
"that day" which "many prophets and kings and righteous men desired to
see" [Mat 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017); [Luk
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024), and in patience waited for it,:
"the" one "day of salvation" of the Gospel. He had spoken of repentance,
in contemplation of Christ crucified; he now speaks of forgiveness and
cleansing, of sanctification and consequent obedience. The "fountain
shall be" not simply "opened," but shall remain open. Isaiah had already
prophesied of the refreshment of the Gospel. "When the poor and needy
seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I,
the Lord, will hear them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. I
will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the
valleys" [Isa 41:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017); here it is
added, "for sin. and for uncleanness."

There were "divers" [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010)
symbolical "washings" under the law; the Levites were "sprinkled with
the water of purifying" [Num 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007),
literally, "the water of taking away of sin: living waters" [Num
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017), put to the ashes of an heifer,
were appointed as a "water for" (removing) "defilements" ([Num
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009), [Num
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013), [Num
19:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#020) bis; [Num
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023)); "a cleansing of sin" [Num
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009). Now, there should be one
ever-open fountain for all "the house of David." Theodoret: "Who that
fountain is, the Lord Himself teacheth through Jeremiah, 'they have
forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters' [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013); and in the Gospel He says, 'If
any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink' [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037); and 'The water which I shall
give him, is a fountain of living water, gushing up to everlasting life'
[Joh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014). This was 'open to the house
of David;' for of that kindred He took human nature. It was opened also
'for the dwellers of Jerusalem,' for the sprinkling of holy baptism;
through which we have received remission of sins." Cyril: "That,
receiving divine and holy baptism, we are sprinkled with the Blood of
Christ to the remission of sins, who can doubt?" Dionysius: "Of this
fountain much was foretold by Ezekiel, 'that a fountain should issue
forth from the temple of the Lord, and 'go down into the desert' [Eze
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001), [Eze
47:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008), and 'every soul, to whom it
shall come, shall live;' and Joel, 'A fountain shall come forth of the
house of the Lord, and water the valley of Shillim' [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018). Of this fountain Peter said to
the Jews, when 'pricked in the heart' and seeking forgiveness, 'Let
everyone of you be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the
remission of sins'" [Act 2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037).

[Zechariah 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 13:2</span></span>

I will cut off the names of the idols - This had been a fence against
idolatry. To name evil is a temptation to evil. Wrong words are the
parents of wrong acts. To speak of evil awakens curiosity or passion;
curiosity is one of the strongest incentives to act. All public mention
of terrible crimes (it has been observed) produces imitation of the
specific form of crime. Hence, it was commanded, "make no mention of the
name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth" [Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013). And Joshua names it in his
dying charge to Israel, "Be ye therefore very strong to keep and to are
all that is written in the book of the law of Moses - either make
mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them" [Jos
23:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#006). Hence, they "changed" the
"names" of cities , which bare idol names. David speaks of it, as part
of fealty to God. "I will, not take their names upon my lips" [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004).

Hosea prophesies of the times of the new covenant; "I will take away the
names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall be no more remembered
by their name" [Hos 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017). Isaiah, "The
idols he shall utterly abolish" [Isa
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018). Zechariah foretells their
abolition with a turn of words, formed apparently on those of Hosea ;
but slightly varied, because the worship of Baal, such a plague-spot in
the time of Hosea, one, which continued until the year before the
captivity , was gone, He implies nothing as to his own times, whether
idolatry still existed. He predicts its entire abolition in the whole
compass of the enlarged Judah, that is, of Christendom.

And also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of
the land - False prophecy sets itself to meet a craving of human nature
to know something of its future. False prophets there were, even in the
time of Nehemiah , and those in some number, hired to prophesy against
the word of God. Our Lord warns against them. "Beware of false prophets,
which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves" [Mat 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015). "Many false
prophets shall arise and shall deceive many" [Mat
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011). Many false prophets, John says,
"are gone out into the world" [Joh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001). False prophets attended the
decline of Judaism. Such was the author of the Jewish Sibylline book,
prophesying the destruction of the Romans , and fixing the mind of his
people on temporal aggrandizement : false prophets were suborned by the
Jewish "tyrants" and encouraged the Jews in the resistance which ruined
the devoted city: , false prophets have arisen in Christianity; but,
like the Phrygian women who led Tertullian astray, they "went out," were
cast out "from it, as not being of it."

Cyril: "After that the Only Begotten Word of God appeared to us, the
dull and childish toys of idolatry perished and were utterly destroyed,
and with it were taken away the strange and impious devices of the false
prophets, who were full of the evil, unclean spirit, and could be
readily detected as laboring under a kindred disease to the idolaters.
For both had one president of impiety, Satan." Not 50 years after the
Crucifixion, a pagan wrote his work, "on the failure of oracles." The
outpouring of the Holy "Spirit of grace and supplication" [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010), should sweep away "the unclean
spirit" , (Zechariah alone anticipates the language of the New
Testament) which became "a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets"
[Kg1 22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021) sought to them.

[Zechariah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 13:3</span></span>

His father and mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not
live - The prophet describes the zeal against false prophecy, with
reference to the law against those who seduced to apostasy from God.
[Deu 13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006) : "the nearest relations
were themselves to denounce any who had secretly tried to seduce them,
and themselves, as the accusers, to cast the first stone at them. Cyril:
"Such shall in those times be the reverence to Godward, so careful shall
they be of perfect probity and laudable life, that parents themselves
shall be stimulated against their children, if they should speak falsely
anything from their own heart, as though God spoke by them - How true
that word is, and how accredited the prophecy! This indicates clearly a
great advance toward godliness, God transforming things or the better.
What aforetime was held in great esteem, is now hated and accursed and
held intolerable."

[Zechariah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 13:4</span></span>

The prophets shall be ashamed, every one of them - They who before their
conversion, gave themselves to such deceits, shall be ashamed of their
deeds; as, after the defeat of the seven sons of the chief priest Sceva,
"fear fall on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified,
and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds: many
of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and
burned them before all, and they counted the price of them, and found it
fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily," Luke subjoins, "grew the
word of God and prevailed" [Act
19:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013).

Neither shall wear a rough garment to deceive Feigning themselves
ascetics and mourners for their people, as the true prophets were in
truth. The sackcloth, which the prophets wore [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002), was a rough garment of hair [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012); [Jer
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008); [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026), worn next to the skin [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027); [Kg2
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015), whence Elijah was known to
Ahaziah, when described as "a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of
leather about his loins" [Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008). It
was a wide garment, enveloping the whole frame, and so, afflictive to
the whole body. Jerome: "This was the habit of the prophets, that when
they called the people to penitence, they were clothed with sackcloth."

[Zechariah 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 13:5</span></span>

And he shall say - Repudiating his former claims, "I am a husbandman:"
for a man hath taught me from my youth." There was no room then for his
having been a false prophet, since he had had from his youth one simple
unlettered occupation, as Amos said truly of himself; "I was no prophet,
neither was I a prophet's son: but I was an herdsman and a gatherer of
sycamore fruit" [Amo 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014). The prophet
does not approve the lie, any more than our Lord did the injustice of
the "unjust steward." Our Lord contrasted the wisdom "in their
generation" of a bad man for his ends, with the unwisdom of "the
children of light," who took no pains to secure their God. Zechariah
pictures vividly, how people would anyhow rid themselves of all
suspicion of false prophesying.

[Zechariah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 13:6</span></span>

And one shall say unto him, What are those wounds in thy hands? - The
words are simple; the meaning different , according as they are united
with what immediately precedes, or the main subject, Him whom they
pierced, for whom they were to mourn, and, on their mourning, to be
cleansed, and of whom it is said in the next verse, "Awake, O sword,
against My Shepherd." Jerome and others explain it of the punishment
inflicted by parents. "These wounds and bruises I received, condemned by
the judgment of my parents, and of those who did not hate but loved me.
And so will truth prevail dissipating falsehood, that he too, who was
punished for his own fault, will own that he suffered rightly."

But wounds of chastisement are not inflicted on the hands, and the
punishment of false prophecy was not such wounds, but death. Wounds in
the hands were no punishment, which parents would inflict. They were the
special punishment of the cross , after sustaining which, One only
lived. The most literal interpretation, then, of the wounds in the hands
harmonizes with the piercing before, and the smiting of the Good
Shepherd which follows, of whom David too prophesied, "They pierced My
Hands and My Feet" [Psa 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016). "What
are those wounds on Thy hands? How long, think you, and how and by whom
will this be said to Him? For ever and ever, unceasingly, and with
unspeakable admiration it will be said, both by God the Father, "to whom
He was obedient unto death, the death of the Cross" [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008) : it will be said also both by the
holy "angels" who "desire to look into" Him [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012), and by people whom He has
redeemed. O great miracle, wonderful spectacle, especially in the Lord
of all, to bear wounds in the midst of His Hands! And He shall say;
"With these I was wounded in the house of those who loved Me." O great
sacrilege, sacrilegious homicide, that such wounds were inflicted in the
house of those who loved. He will not say, 'with these I was wounded by
those who loved Me,' but 'in the house of those who loved Me.' For they
who inflicted them, loved Him not.

But they were the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and David, and
the rest like them, who loved Me, and expected Me, who was promised to
them. Yet so to speak is not to answer the question, 'what are these
wounds?' For it is one thing to ask, what are these wounds, another to
say, where they were inflicted. Having said, that they were inflicted in
the house of those who loved Me. He says, what they are, 'the Cup which
My Father hath given Me to drink.' For what He subjoins, is the Voice of
the Father giving the Cup. 'Sword, awake, etc.' is as though he said,
Ask ye, What are these wounds? I say, 'the tokens of obedience, the
signs of the Father's will and command. The Lord of hosts, God the
Father 'hath not spared' Me, 'His own Son, but hath given' Me 'for' you
'all.' And He said, 'Awake, o sword, against Jify Shepherd, and against
the Man cohering to Me,' which is as much as, 'O Death, have thou power
over My Son, My good Shepherd, the Man who cohereth to Me, that is, who
is joined in unity of Person with the Word who is consubstantial with
Me!' And then, as though the sword asked, how or how far shall I arise
against this Thy Shepherd, he subjoins, 'Smite the shepherd, and the
sheep shall be scattered.' Hence, the Shepherd Himself, when about to be
smitten, spake, 'All ye shall be offended because of Me this night. For
it is written, I will smite the Shepherd and the sheep shall be
scattered' [Mat 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031). So then to
those who say, 'what are those wounds in the midst of Thy hands?' is
appositely subjoined the Voice of the Father, saying, 'Awake, O sword,
against My Shepherd etc.' in the meaning, 'They are monuments of the
Father's love, the tokens of My Obedience, because He 'spared not His
own Son,' and I 'became obedient' to Him for you all, 'even unto death,
and that, the death of the Cross. '"

[Zechariah 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 13:7</span></span>

Awake, O sword - So Jeremiah apostrophises the sword, "O thou sword of
the Lord, when wilt thou be quiet?" [Jer
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006). The prophets express what "will
be," by a command that it should be; "Make the heart of this people
heavy" [Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010). But by this command
he signifies that human malice, acting freely, could do no more than His
"Hand and" His "counsel determined before to be done" [Act
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028). The envy and hatred of Satan,
the blind fury of the chief priests, the contempt of Herod, the guilty
cowardice of Pilate, freely accomplished that Death, which God had
before decreed for the salvation of the world. The meaning then is,
(Ribera), "the sword shall be aroused against My Shepherd, that is, I
will allow Him to be smitten by the Jews. But by 'the sword' he
designates death, persecution, wounding etc. as above, the 'sword upon
his right arm' [Zac 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017), and, where
the passion of Christ is spoken of, 'Deliver my soul from the sword'
[Psa 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020). So also, 'All the sinners
of the people shall die by the sword' [Amo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010)," (Jerome), "which cannot be
taken literally; for many sinners perish by shipwreck, poison, drowning,
fire." Amos then "so spake, because many died by war, yet not all by the
sword, but others by pestilence and famine, all which he includes under
'the sword' [Amo 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010). This smiting
began, when the Lord was taken, and His sheep began to be scattered; but
the prophecy which, before, was being gradually fulfilled, was fully
fulfilled in His death, and the apostles were dispersed till the day of
the Resurrection at eventide."

Against the Man, My Fellow - that is, One united by community of nature.
A little before, God had spoken of Himself as priced at "the thirty
pieces of silver," yet as breaking the covenant which He had made with
all nations for His people; as "pierced through, yet as pouring the
spirit of grace and supplication" on those who pierced Him, that they
should mourn their deed, and as, thereon, ever cleansing them from sin.
As Man, God was sold, was pierced. : "God, in flesh, not working with
aught intervening as in the prophets, but having taken to Him a Manhood
connatural with Himself and made one, and through His flesh akin to us,
drawing up to Him all humanity. What was the manner of the Godhead in
flesh? As fire in iron, not transitively but by communication. For the
fire does not dart into the iron, but remains there and communicates to
it of its own virtue, not impaired by the communication, yet filling
wholly its recipient."

The bold language of the Fathers only expressed the actuality of the
Incarnation. Since the Manhood was taken into God, and in Him dwelt all
the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and God and Man were one Christ.
then was it all true language. His Body was "the Body of God" ; His
flesh "the flesh of the Word" ; and it was lawful to speak of "the flesh
of the Deity" , of "the Passion of the Word" , "the Passion of Christ,
my God" , "the Passion of God" , "God dead and buried" , "God suffered"
, "murderers of God" , "the Godhead dwelt in the flesh bodily, which is
all one with saying that, being God, He had a proper body, and using
this as an instrument, He became Man for our sakes, and, because of
this, things proper to the flesh are said to be His, since He was in it,
as hunger, thirst, suffering, fatigue and the like, of which the flesh
is capable, while the works proper to the Word Himself as raising the
dead and restoring the blind, He did through His own Body," is but a
continuance of the language of Zechariah, since He who was sold, was
priced, was Almighty God. Jesus being God and Man, the sufferings of His
Humanity were the sufferings of God, although, as God, He could not
suffer.

Now, conversely, God speaks of the Shepherd who was slain, as "My
Fellow," united in Nature with Himself, although not the Manhood of
Jesus which suffered, but the Godhead, united with It in one Person, was
Consubstantial with Himself. The name might perhaps be most nearly
represented by "connatural." : "When then the title is employed of the
relation of an individual to God, it is clear that that individual can
be no mere man, Jut must be one, united with God by unity of Being. The
Akin of the Lord is no, other than He who said in the Gospel "I and My
Father are One" [Joh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030), and who is
designated as "the Only-Begotten Son, who is in the Bosom of the Father"
[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018). The word, it seems, was
especially chosen, as being used in the Pentateuch, only in the laws
against injuring a fellow-man. The prophet thereby gives prominence to
the seeming contradiction between the command of the Lord, "Awake, O
sword, against My Shepherd," and those Of His own law, whereby no one is
to injure his fellow.

He thus points out the greatness of that end, for the sake of which the
Lord regards not that relation, whose image among men He commanded to be
kept holy. He speaks after the manner of people. He calls attention to
the greatness of that sacrifice, whereby He "spared not His own Son, but
freely gave Him up for us all" [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032). The word 'Man' forms a sort of
contrast with "My Fellow." He whom the sword is to reach must unite the
Human Nature with the divine." Jews too have seen that the words, "My
Fellow," imply an equality with God; only since they own not Him, who
was God and Man, they must interpret it of a false claim on the part of
man , overlooking that it is given Him by God.

And I will turn My hand o upon the little ones - Doing to them as He had
done to the Shepherd. So our Lord forewarned them: "If they have
persecuted Me they will also persecute you" [Joh
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020) : "If the world hate you, ye
know that it hated Me, before it hated you" [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018) : "Ye shall be hated of all men
for My name's sake" [Mat 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022); [Luk
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#017) : "they will deliver you up to
the councils and scourge you in the synagogues; and ye shall be brought
before governors and kings for My name's sake" ([Mat
10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017); add [Luk
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012)): "they shall deliver you up to
be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all men for
My name's sake" [Mat 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009); and to the
Scribes and Pharisees, "I send unto you prophets and wise men and
scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of them
shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to
city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
earth" [Mat 23:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034).

The little ones - As Jeremiah speaks of "the least of the flock" [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020), and the Lord said, "fear not,
little flock" [Luk 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032), little and
weak in itself but mighty in Him and in His grace. Three centuries of
persecution, alike in the Roman empire and beyond it in Persia,
fulfilled the prophet's words and deepened the foundation of the Church
and cemented its fabric.

[Zechariah 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 13:8</span></span>

In all the land, two parts therein shall be cut off and die - "In all
the land of Israel," says a Jewish interpreter; (Kimchi); " - the land,
in which the Good Shepherd had been slain and the sheep scattered, "that
upon you." our Lord had said, "may come all the righteous blood." As
David punished Moab, "with two lines measured he to put to death, and
with one full line to keep alive" [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002); and Ezekiel prophesied, "A third
part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they
be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the
sword round about thee" [Eze 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012); so
now, the greater part should be destroyed, but a remnant should be
saved. "But the third part shall be left therein. Even so then at this
present time also," Paul says, "there is a remnant according to the
election of grace" [Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005). Osorius:
"The third part only shall be saved from the common destruction; yet not
so, that they should suppose that glory was to be obtained amid ease."

[Zechariah 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 13:9</span></span>

I will bring the third part through the fire - Such is always God's
ways. "Thou hast proved us, O God; Thou hast tried us, like as silver is
tried. Thou broughtest us into the snare, Thou laidest trouble upon our
loins: we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a
wealthy place" [Psa 66:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009). "I have
refined thee, but not with silver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of
affliction" [Isa 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010); and, "Through
much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God" [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022).

Dionysius: "In adversity virtue is most tried, and it is shown what
advance a person has made; for 'patience' hath 'a perfect work' [Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004); and it is called the touchstone
of all other virtues, as is written; 'God tried His elect as gold in the
furnace and received them as a burnt offering' ; and, 'All the faithful
who have pleased the Lord have passed through many tribulations' . And
the angel Raphael saith to Tobias, 'Because thou wert accepted of God,
need was that temptation should prove thee' ." "Adversities are granted
to the elect of God, and therefore to be rejoiced in with the whole
heart." "Fire, crosses, racks were prepared; swords executioners
torturers were put in action; new forms of suffering were invented, and
yet Christian virtue remained moveless, unconquered: the fiercer the
onslaught, the more glorious was the triumph." : "The more suffered, the
more believed in Christ." Osorius: "Whose virtue they adimired, these
they imitated, and shared the suffering, that they might be partakers of
the glory. This was that fire, whereby God willed that His own should be
tried and purified, that, with Christ whom they gave themselves to
imitate, they might enjoy everlasting glory."

I will bless him and will say, It is My people - Dionysius: "not only by
creation as the rest, but by devotion and worship, by predestination and
infusion of grace, by singular Providence, by mutual love; 'and it shall
say, The Lord is my God,' whom alone above all things, I long for, love,
worship."

This promise is oftentimes renewed through the prophets, oftentimes
fulfilled in Christ, whenever the Church is recalled from listlessness
by fiery trials, and through them her children are restored to deeper
devotedness and closer union with God.
