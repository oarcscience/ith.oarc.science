### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 5:1</span></span>

My honeycomb - literally, "my reed" or "my wood," i. e., the substance
itself, or portions of it in which the comb is formed. The bees in
Palestine form their combs not only in the hollows of trees and rocks,
but also in reeds by the river-banks. The king's meaning appears to be:
"All pleases me in thee, there is nothing to despise or cast away."

Eat, O friends - A salutation from the king to his assembled guests, or
to the chorus of young men his companions, bidding them in the gladness
of his heart [Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011.md) partake of the
banquet. So ends this day of outward festivity and supreme heart-joy.
The first half of the Song of Songs is fitly closed. The second half of
the poem commences [Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md) with a
change of tone and reaction of feeling similar to that of [Sol
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001.md). It terminates with the sealing
[Sol 8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#006.md) of yet deeper love.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 5:2</span></span>

Some time may be supposed to have elapsed since the bride's solemn
espousals with the king Cant. 4:7-5:1. A transient cloud of doubt or
estrangement is now passing over her soul, as by the relation of this
dream she intimates to her friends. Ancient allegorical interpreters
find here a symbol of the condition and feelings of Israel during the
Babylonian captivity, when the glories and privileges of Solomon's
Temple were no more, and the manifested presence of the Holy One had
been withdrawn. Israel in exile seeks the Lord [Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md), and will find Him again in the
second temple [Sol 6:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md).

I sleep, but my heart waketh - A poetical periphrasis for "I dream."
Compare the ancient saying: "Dreams are the vigils of those who slumber,
hopes are waking dreams."

The voice - Or, "sound." Compare [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), note. She hears him knocking
before he speaks.

My undefiled - literally, "my perfect one." Vulgate "immaculata mea."
Compare [Sol 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#007.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 5:3</span></span>

She makes trivial excuses, as one in a dream.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 5:4</span></span>

Put in his hand - Through (literally "from") the hole (of the lock), in
order to raise the pins by which the bolt was fastened. The Oriental
lock is a hollow piece of wood attached to the doorpost, into which a
sliding-bolt is made to run. As soon as the bolt has been driven home a
number of pins drop into holes prepared in it for their reception. To
raise these pins, and so enable the bolt to be withdrawn, is to unfasten
the lock. This is commonly done by means of the key (literally
"opener"), but may often be accomplished by the fingers if dipped in
paste or some other adhesive substance. For such a purpose the beloved
inserts his fingers here anointed with the costly unguent, which will
presently distil on those of the bride when she rises to open to him.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 5:5</span></span>

Sweet smelling myrrh - Or (as in the margin) "running myrrh," that which
first and spontaneously exudes, i. e., the freshest, finest myrrh. Even
in withdrawing he has left this token of his unchanged love.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 5:8</span></span>

The bride, now awake, is seeking her beloved. The dream of his departure
and her feelings under it have symbolized a real emotion of her waking
heart.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 5:9</span></span>

Section 5:9-6:3: The bride's commendation of the beloved. In the
allegorical interpretations of Jewish expositors all is here spoken by
exiled Israel of the Holy One whose praise she sings "by the waters of
Babylon" [Psa 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md). Christian
interpreters apply the description directly to the Incarnate Son, partly
in His Eternal Godhead, but chiefly in His risen and glorified Humanity.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 5:10</span></span>

My beloved is white and ruddy - Compare [Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md); [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md). The complexion most admired in
youth. Jewish interpreters remark that he who is elsewhere called "the
Ancient of Days" is here described as the Ever-Young. "White in His
virgin-purity," says Jerome, "and ruddy in His Passion."

The chiefest among ten thousand - literally, "a bannered one among a
myriad;" hence one signalized, a leader of ten thousand warriors.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 5:11</span></span>

His head is as the most fine gold - Perhaps in the sense of noble and
precious as the finest gold. [Lam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md).

Bushy - Waving like branches of the palm.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 5:12</span></span>

Or, His eyes are doves. The comparison is to doves seen by streams of
water washing in milk (i. e., milk-white), and sitting on fulness (i.
e., on the full or abundant water-flood).

Fitly set - This rendering supposes that the eyes within their sockets
are compared to precious stones set in the foil of a ring (see the
margin); but the other rendering is preferable. The milk-white doves
themselves, sitting by full streams of water, or reflected in their
flittings athwart the glassy surface, present images of the calm repose
and vivid glances of the full pure lustrous eyes of the beloved.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 5:13</span></span>

Sweet flowers - Better as in the margin, i. e., plants with fragrant
leaves and flowers trained on trellis-work.

Like lilies - Are lilies dropping liquid myrrh (see the [Sol
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005) note.md). Perhaps the fragrance of
the flowers, or the delicate curl of the lip-like petals, is here the
point of comparison, rather than the color.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 5:14</span></span>

His hands ... - Are golden rings or cylinders. The fingers of the bent
or closed hand are compared to a massive ring or set of rings; or, if
outstretched or straightened, to a row of golden rods or cylinders.

The beryl - The "tarshish" (compare [Exo
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#020).md), probably the chrysolite of the
ancients (so called from its gold color), the modern topaz.

His belly ... - His body (the Hebrew term applies to the whole body,
from the shoulders to the thighs) is a piece of ivory workmanship
overlaid with sapphires. The sapphire of the ancients seems to have been
the lapis lazuli.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 5:15</span></span>

His countenance - Or, his appearance (his whole port and mien, but
especially head and countenance) "is as the Lebanon."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 5:16</span></span>

He is altogether lovely - literally, the whole of him desires or
delights; the plural substantive expressing the notion of the
superlative. Theodoret, applying to our Lord the whole description,
interprets well its last term: "Why should I endeavor to express His
beauty piecemeal when He is in Himself and altogether the One
longed-for, drawing all to love, compelling all to love, and inspiring
with a longing (for His company) not only those who see, but also those
who hear?"
