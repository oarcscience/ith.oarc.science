### [Psalms Chapter 94](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 94:0</span></span>

This psalm, in the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, is entitled "A
Psalm of David, for the fourth day of the week." What is the origin of
this title is unknown, as there is nothing corresponding to it in the
Hebrew. In the original the psalm is without a title, nor is there
anything in the contents of it which will enable us to determine who was
the author, or to fix the date or the occasion of its composition. There
is in it nothing necessarily inconsistent with the supposition that
David was the author; and there were undoubtedly occasions in his life,
when it would have been appropriate. There have been many conjectures as
to the author, and as to the occasion on which it was composed. Rudinger
refers it to the times of David and the rebellion of Absalom; Venema
supposes that it refers to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and the
persecution under him; DeWette refers it to the time of the Babylonian
exile; others suppose that it was written on the eve of the Babylonian
captivity. Whatever may have been the occasion, the style and form of
the psalm are so general that it may be made a vehicle of pious thought,
and of the feelings of the people of God, in all ages.

From the psalm itself it is plain that it was composed during some
Impending or actual national calamity. This is evident from [Psa
94:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md), [Psa
94:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#014.md), [Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md). It would seem, also, from [Psa
94:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007.md), that it was probably some
calamity which was brought upon the people by a foreign nation - a
nation that defied Yahweh, and proclaimed that he was unable to defend
his friends, or that he would not interpose in their behalf: "They say,
the Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it." The
object of the psalm is to show that God "is" the protector of his
people; that he "does" regard them; that he "will" interpose in their
behalf.

The psalm embraces the following subjects:

\(1\) An appeal or prayer to God as the God of vengeance, or as a just
God, [Psa 94:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md).

\(2\) a statement of the character and purposes of the wicked who were
bringing these calamities upon the nation, [Psa
94:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md).

\(3\) a direct appeal to these invaders themselves - an appeal based on
the ground that God could "not" be indifferent to the conduct of people;
that he must hear their words, understand their thoughts, see their
acts, and know all that they did, [Psa
94:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md).

\(4\) Consolation in the trouble derived from the fact that this was a
deserved chastening of the Lord, and was not designed for their
destruction, but for their good, [Psa
94:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md).

\(5\) The fact that God is a source of confidence, comfort, and support
to his people, in all Such times of trial, [Psa
94:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 94:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 94:1</span></span>

O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth ... - Margin, God of revenges
The idea is, that it pertains to God to take vengeance, or to punish for
crimes. See the notes at [Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).
The appeal here is made to God in view of the crimes committed by
others, and which are referred to in the subsequent part of the psalm.
God is addressed as having the right to restrain and punish wicked
people, and he is asked to interpose and assert that right in a case
which clearly demanded it. The appeal is repeated to make it emphatic,
or to denote "earnestness" in the petition.

Show thyself - Margin, as in Hebrew, "shine forth." The meaning is,
Manifest thyself; come forth as such a God; prove thy right; display thy
power, and show that thou art a God opposed to crime and wrong. The same
Hebrew word is used here which is found in [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md), and which is there rendered
"shine forth." See the notes at that passage.

[Psalms 94:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 94:2</span></span>

Lift up thyself - Be exalted or lifted up so as to be manifest in thy
true character. The idea is that God was, as it were, sitting at his
ease, or as if he were indifferent to what was occurring in the world.
See the notes at [Psa 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md).

Thou Judge of the earth - Ruler of the world; to whom it pertains to
exercise judgment over all classes of people, and in all circumstances.
The meaning here is, that as he was the Ruler of the whole earth, this
matter came without doubt under his jurisdiction. It was a case for his
interposition.

Render a reward to the proud - A just recompence to the people who are
confident in their own strength, and who are manifesting their pride in
depriving others of their rights.

[Psalms 94:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 94:3</span></span>

Lord, how long shall the wicked ... - As if there were to be no end to
their exaltation; their joy; their success. How long would God allow
this? How long would he sit by and see it done? Was he disposed to let
them go on forever? Would he never interpose, and arrest them in their
career? How often do we wonder that God does not interpose! How often
does it seem inexplicable that a Being of almighty power and infinite
goodness does not interfere with respect to the wickedness, the
oppression, the slavery, the wrong, the cruelty, the fraud, the violence
of the world - and put an end to it! Nay, how entirely are we
overwhelmed at the thought that he does not put an end to iniquity in
the universe altogether; that he never "will" thus interpose, and put an
end to sin and sorrow! Such things are too high for us now; perhaps will
be always so. Things on earth are not as we should suppose they would
be; and we can only pause and adore where we cannot comprehend!

[Psalms 94:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 94:4</span></span>

How long shall they utter and speak hard things? - The word rendered
utter means to pour forth - as water from a fountain; to pour forth
copiously. The meaning is, that they seemed to be full, and that they
poured forth evil words as a fountain pours forth water. The phrase
"hard things" means proud, unfeeling, insolent things; things which are
unjust, unkind, severe, harsh.

And all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? - Boast of their power
and their success. How long shall they be permitted to have such success
as may seem to justify them in their exultation?

[Psalms 94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 94:5</span></span>

They break in pieces thy people - They tread down; they grind; they
crush. The Hebrew word is often used as meaning to crush under foot; to
trample on; and hence, it means to oppress. [Lam
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#034.md); [Isa
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015.md).

And afflict - To wit, by oppression and wrong. If this refers to
foreigners, it means that they did this by invasion and by the ravages
of war.

Thine heritage - Thy people, regarded as an inheritance or possession.
See [Psa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009.md), note; [Psa
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012.md), note; [Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md), note; [Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002.md), note; [Isa
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md), note; [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md), note; [Pe1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md), note.

[Psalms 94:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 94:6</span></span>

They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless - To do
this is everywhere represented as a special crime, and as especially
offensive to God from the fact that these classes are naturally feeble
and unprotected. See the notes at [Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md); [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md); [Psa
82:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 94:7</span></span>

Yet they say - By their conduct; or, they seem to say.

The Lord shall not see - In the original, יה Yâhh. This is an
abbreviation of the word יהוה Yahweh. See [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md), note; [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md), note. On the impious sentiment
here expressed, see the notes at [Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md).

Neither shall the God of Jacob regard it - Implying that God was
indifferent to the conduct of people; that he would not punish the
wicked; that sinners have nothing to fear at his hand. This sentiment is
very common still, either as an article in their creed, or as implied in
their conduct. The doctrine of universal salvation is really founded on
this opinion; and most people ACT as if it were their belief that the
wicked are in no danger of being punished, and that there is no such
attribute in God as justice.

[Psalms 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 94:8</span></span>

Understand, ye brutish among the people - See [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022.md). The meaning here is, "You who
are like the brutes; you who see and understand no more of the character
and plans of God than the wild beasts of the desert." The meaning is,
that they did not employ their reason in the case; they acted like
beasts, regardless of the consequences of their conduct - as if God
would treat people as he does the beasts; as if there were no
retribution in the future world.

And ye fools, when will ye be wise? - How long is this stupidity to
continue? When will you attend to the truth; when will you act as
immortal beings; when will you suffer your rational nature to lead you
up to just views of God? It is implied that this folly had been
manifested for a long period, and that it was time they should arouse
from this condition, and act like people. With what propriety may this
language be addressed still to the great mass of mankind! What numbers
of the human race are there now, who in respect to God, and to the
purpose for which they were made, evince no more wisdom than the brutes
that perish! Oh, if people were truly wise, what a beautiful world would
this be; how noble and elevated would be our now degraded race!

[Psalms 94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 94:9</span></span>

He that planted the ear - He that made the ear. The word here used in
the original is a participle. "Shall not he planting the ear;" that is,
the "planter" of the ear. The idea seems to have been taken from the act
of making a "hole" in the ground when we set out a plant - as if, in
like manner, a "hole" had been made in the side of the head to insert
the ear.

Shall he not hear? - He could not have created the faculty of hearing,
without possessing it himself. Or, it is reasonable to suppose that he
who has made man capable of hearing, must be able to hear himself. We
have nothing in our nature which is not possessed in an infinitely
higher measure by God.

He that formed the eye - This, too, is a participle: "He forming the
eye;" that is, the Former of the eye. The word used here is frequently
employed in reference to a "potter;" and the idea is that God has
moulded or formed the eye as the potter fashions the clay. The more the
eye is studied in its structure, the more deeply shall we be impressed
with the wonderful skill and wisdom of God. See this beautifully
illustrated in Paley's Natural Theology.

Shall he not see? - He that made the eye to see must himself be able to
see. He must see all that the eye itself can see; he must see all that
all eyes see; he must have the power of sight far beyond what there is
in the mere organ which he has made.

[Psalms 94:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 94:10</span></span>

He that chastiseth the heathen - More literally, "Shall not the Reprover
of nations - shall he not chastise - he that teaches man knowledge?" The
idea is, that God exercises a government over the nations of the earth;
that he has them under his control; that he brings heavy judgments on
them; that he thus conveys great lessons to man. And shall not such a
Being, in individual cases, reprove and correct for sin? It is assumed
here that God, in fact, brings judgments on nations; that he does this
by fire, flood, famine, pestilence; that these things are proofs that he
presides over the nations of the earth; and the question here is,
whether he that does this on the large scale must not be expected to do
it in individual cases, so that the offender will not escape.

Shall not he correct? - Shall he not chastise, or bring judgments on
offenders?

He that teacheth man knowledge ... - The idea in our translation, that
he who imparts knowledge to mankind must himself possess intelligence,
is a true one, but it is probably not that which is in the original. The
sense is probably merely that God is the great Teacher, and this is the
impression which it is intended should be impressed on the mind, leaving
the consequences of this to be supplied by the reader: "He that teaches
man all the knowledge that he has!" - reflect on the consequences of
this, or what must follow from this! Such a Being cannot be ignorant; he
must understand all things; he must, therefore, see human conduct
everywhere as it is. The consequence - the result - of this is staffed
in the next verse, that he must see the thoughts of man, and understand
his real character.

[Psalms 94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 94:11</span></span>

The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man - That is, He who teaches people
all that they know [Psa 94:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#010.md), must
understand all that there is in the mind. See the notes at [Co1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020.md).

That they are vanity - That is, that they are foolish, vain, unwise,
wicked. The knowledge of the thoughts themselves carries with it also
the knowledge that they are vain and foolish - for that is their
character, and to know them truly is to know this of them. They do not
appear to him as they do to people themselves. They are to his view
stripped of all that is flattering and illusive, and are seen to be vain
and foolish.

[Psalms 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 94:12</span></span>

Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord - "Happy the man;" or
"Oh the blessedness of the man." See the notes at [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md). The word here rendered
"chastenest" does not mean to chasten in the sense of afflicting or
punishing. It means here to instruct; to warn; to admonish; to exhort.
So the word is employed in [Pro 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md);
[Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003.md); [Psa
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md). The meaning here is, that the
man is blessed or happy whom God so "instructs, warns, or teaches," that
he understands the principles of the divine administration. Such a man
will see reasons for confidence in him in trouble, and for calmness of
mind until punishment is brought upon his enemies.

And teachest him out of thy law - Causest him, from thy word, to
understand the great principles of thy government.

[Psalms 94:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 94:13</span></span>

That thou mayest give him rest - Mayest make his mind quiet and calm;
mayest save him from murmuring, from despondency, from impatience, by
just confidence in thee, and in thy government.

From the days of adversity - Or, in the days of evil; the time of
calamity and trouble. That his mind may then be composed and calm.

Until the pit be digged for the wicked - Until the wicked be punished;
that is, while the preparations are going on, or while God seems to
delay punishment, and the wicked are suffered to live as if God did not
notice them, or would not punish them. The idea is, that the mind should
not be impatient as if their punishment would not come, or as if God
were unconcerned; and that just views of the divine administration would
tend to make the mind calm even when the wicked "seemed" to prosper and
triumph. See the notes at [Psa
73:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md). The phrase "until the pit be
digged" is derived from the method of hunting wild beasts by digging a
pit into which they might fall and be taken. See the notes at [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 94:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 94:14</span></span>

For the Lord will not cast off his people ... - He will interpose in
their behalf though the wicked seem now to triumph. The certainty of
this would give consolation; this would make the mind calm in the days
of trouble. Compare [Sa1 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#022.md); [Kg1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013.md); [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md). See the notes at [Rom
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 94:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 94:15</span></span>

But judgment shall return unto righteousness - That is, The exercise of
judgment shall be so manifest to the world - as if it "returned" to it -
as to show that there is a righteous God. The truth here taught is, that
the "results" of God's interposition in human affairs will be such as to
show that he is on the side of righteousness, or such as to vindicate
and maintain the cause of righteousness in the earth.

And all the upright in heart shall follow it - Margin, shall be after
it. The meaning is, that all who are upright in heart - all who are
truly righteous - will follow on in the path of justice; that they will
regard what God does as right, and will walk in that path. The fact that
what occurs is done by God, will be to them a sufficient revelation of
what ought to be done; and they will follow out the teachings properly
suggested by the divine dealings as their rules of life. In other words,
the manifested laws of the divine administration will be to them an
indication of what is right; and they will embrace and follow the
lessons thus made known to them by the dealings of Divine Providence as
the rules of their own conduct.

[Psalms 94:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 94:16</span></span>

Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?... - This is the
language of the psalmist. It is what he had said in the circumstances
referred to in the first part of the psalm, when the wicked seemed to
triumph; when they had come in upon the land, and laid waste the
heritage of God, [Psa 94:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md). At that
time, full of anxiety and trouble, and deeply impressed with a sense of
danger, he had anxiously looked around for help, and had asked with deep
concern who would stand up for him and defend him. The following verses
[Psa 94:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md) show what was then his
reliance, and in what way confidence in God had kept him from falling
into despair.

[Psalms 94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 94:17</span></span>

Unless the Lord had been my help - At the time referred to. If I had not
had a God to whom I could have gone - if my mind had not been directed
to him - if I had not actually found him a refuge and strength, I should
have despaired altogether. There was no other one to whom I could go;
there was nothing else but the help of God on which I could rely.

My soul had almost dwelt in silence - Margin, quickly. The original is,
"It was as it were but little;" that is, there was little lacking to
bring this about; a little heavier pressure - a little added to what I
was then suffering - a little longer time before relief was obtained -
would have brought me down to the land of silence - to the grave. The
Latin Vulgate renders this, "My soul had dwelt in inpherno." The
Septuagint, "in Hades" - τᾤ ἅδῃ tō Hadē. See [Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017.md). The grave is represented as a
place of silence, or as the land of silence: [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md) : "The dead praise not the
Lord, neither any that go down into silence." Compare [Amo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 94:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 94:18</span></span>

When I said, My foot slippeth - I can no longer stand. My strength is
gone; and I must sink into the grave. The original here is, "If I say,
My foot slippeth," etc. The statement is general; that if at any time he
had been, or should be, in such circumstances, then God would interpose.
The general remark, however, is founded on his interposition on this
particular occasion. His aid was then so marked and timely, that he felt
that he could make the declaration general in regard to his whole life -
to all circumstances in which he would ever be placed.

Thy mercy, O Lord, held me up - By thy merciful interposition thou didst
keep me from falling. It was strength put forth as the expression of
"mercy;" not strength to which he had any claim. How often in life may
we say this of ourselves, that when just ready to sink; when our
strength was almost gone; when a little severer pressure would have
brought us to the grave, God by his mercy and his power interposed and
saved us! Every such act of mercy - every new interposition in this
manner - is a new gift of life, and lays us under obligation as if we
had been just created, for it is just so much more of life given us by
God.

[Psalms 94:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 94:19</span></span>

In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul -
The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render this, "In the multitude of
my griefs within me," etc. DeWette renders it, "Bei meinen vielen
Sorgen," "in my many cares." The Hebrew word, however, properly means
"thoughts;" and the idea seems to be that in the great number of
thoughts which passed through his mind, so many of them perplexing,
anxious, burdensome - so many of them vain and profitless - so many of
them that seemed to come and go without any aim or object, there was one
class that gave him comfort. They were those which pertained to God. In
those thoughts he found calmness and peace. However much he might be
disturbed by other thoughts, yet here he found rest and peace. In God -
in his character, in his law, in his government - he had an unfailing
source of consolation; and whatever trouble he might have from the cares
of life, and from the evil imaginings in his own mind, yet here his soul
found repose.

God was an unfailing refuge; and meditation on him and his perfections
made the mind calm. How many thoughts pass through our minds in a single
day or a single hour! Who can tell from where they come, or by what laws
they are linked together! How many of them seem to have no connection
with any that went before! How many of them seem to be thrown into our
minds when we would avoid them! How many are vain and frivolous; how
many are skeptical; how many are polluted and polluting! How many come
into the mind which we would not for worlds disclose to our best
friends! How few of us would walk abroad if we were conscious that all
whom we meet could look into our bosoms, and see all that is passing
there! What a consolation it is to us that they cannot see it! What a
world of confusion and blushes would this be if, in the streets of a
crowded city, or when man meets his fellow man anywhere, all that is in
his bosom were known! And yet, in this multitude of thoughts - so empty,
so foolish, so sinful, so vexing, so skeptical, so polluting - there are
others - there are thoughts of God, of Christ, of heaven, of hope, of
faith, of love, of benevolence; thoughts within us, when the divine
promises come to the heart, and the prospect of heaven warms the soul.
These give "comfort;" these fill the soul with "delight." Happy he who
can find in his bosom, amidst the multitude of thoughts within him,
those which pertain to God; to a higher life; to heaven!

[Psalms 94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 94:20</span></span>

Shall the throne of iniquity - The throne established in iniquity; or,
sustaining iniquity. The allusion is probably to what was referred to in
the former part of the psalm - the powers that were spreading desolation
through the land - wicked princes or rulers, [Psa
94:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#003.md). Their thrones were established
on evil; they defended wickedness and wrong by their authority; they
abused their power, and employed it to overthrow the rights of others.
The "phrase" would be applicable to any unjust government, or to any
laws that are designed to uphold that which is wrong. Such are all the
laws which authorize or uphold slavery, gaming, lotteries, the traffic
in intoxicating drinks, etc.

Have fellowship with thee - With God. Shall they be united with thee; be
sustained by thee; be regarded as a part of thine administration? Wilt
thou sanction them? Wilt thou give to them thy patronage, as if they met
with thine approbation? The Hebrew word means to be associated with, or
allied to, and would be properly applied to a partnership, or anything
where there is fellowship or alliance. The interrogative form here
strongly implies that this "cannot be." Such laws - such purposes -
"cannot" be in accordance with the laws and authority of God; or, in
other words, God does not sit on the same throne with those who
authorize and by law sustain slavery, intemperance, and gambling. There
can be no partnership here.

Which frameth mischief by a law - The word rendered "mischief" usually
means labor, toil; and then, trouble, vexation, sorrow. It may, however,
be used to denote evil of any kind - crime, or wrong. The word rendered
frameth means to form, to fashion, to make, as a potter does clay; [Gen
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), [Gen
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md); or as a workman does statues,
[Isa 44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md), [Isa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012.md); or as one makes weapons, [Isa
54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017.md). It is often applied to God as
the Creator. See the notes at [Psa
94:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#009.md) : "he that formed the eye." The
word law here means a rule or statute; and the idea is, that the
iniquity referred to was not the result of an irregular and fitful
impulse; or of passion; of sudden excitement; or of mere "will" in a
particular case; but was reduced to statute, and sustained by law. The
expression would apply to all those cases where evil is upheld by the
government or by civil authority, or where those who are engaged in it
can plead in their defense the sanction of law. The statement here is,
that such acts "cannot" have fellowship with God, or receive his
approval. It is an insult to God to suppose that he has ever appointed
legislators or magistrates for the purpose of making or upholding such
enactments. Yet there are many such laws in the world; and a main reason
why it is so difficult to remove such evils as have been above referred
to is the fact that they are sustained by law, and that they who hold
slaves, or open gambling-houses, or sell intoxicating drinks, can plead
the authority of the law; or, in other words, that the laws have done
all they can to place such things on a level with those which "ought" to
be protected by statute. Many a man in his business looks no further
than to the laws of the land, and if he has their sanction, in vain is
the attempt to induce him to abandon a business that leads to
oppression, or that scatters woe and sorrow through a community.

[Psalms 94:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 94:21</span></span>

They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous -
Against the life of the righteous; that is, to take their lives. The
Hebrew word rendered "gather together," means to press or crowd upon
anyone; to rush in crowds or troops. It would refer particularly to a
tumultuous gathering - "a mob" - intent on accomplishing its purpose.

And condemn the innocent blood - literally, make guilty; that is, they
hold that blood to be guilty; or, they treat the innocent as if they
were guilty.

[Psalms 94:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 94:22</span></span>

But the Lord is my defense ... - In all these purposes of the wicked; in
all that they do - whether under the form and sanction of law [Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020.md), or by the excitement of passion
- my trust is still in God. He is able to interpose in either case, and
I may confidently commit my cause to him. On the language used here, as
well as the sentiment, see the notes at [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 94:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 94:23</span></span>

And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity - The consequences of
their sin. He shall punish them as they deserve. See the notes at [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016.md).

And shall cut them off in their own wickedness - As the result of their
wickedness, and while they are engaged in perpetrating acts of sin.

Yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off - Expressing, by the repetition
of the sentiment, the utmost confidence that this would be so. This is
in accordance with the prayer with which the psalm opens, and is
expressive of entire faith that God will deal justly with the children
of men. However the wicked may seem to prosper and to triumph, yet the
day of vengeance is approaching, and all which they have deserved will
come upon them.
