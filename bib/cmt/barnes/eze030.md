### [Ezekiel Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 30:1</span></span>

Third prophecy Ezek. 30:1-19 against Egypt, probably to be connected
with the previous verses (compare [Eze
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010.md) with the [Eze
29:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017) note.md). Some consider it to
belong to the earlier part of Ezek. 29 (compare [Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md), [Eze
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012.md) with [Eze
30:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005).md).

[Ezekiel 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 30:3</span></span>

The time of the pagan - The time when the pagan (Egyptians) shall be
judged.

[Ezekiel 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 30:5</span></span>

Libya, and Lydia - Or, as in [Eze
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010.md), Phut and Lud.

The mingled people - Foreigners, who settled in Egypt. The Saite dynasty
of Egyptian kings were especially favorable to foreign immigrants.
Hophra employed many of them in his armies, and in this way, according
to Herodotus, lost the affections of his Egyptian subjects. See [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) note.

Chub - The word occurs here only. It was some tribe in alliance with
Egypt, either of African race like Lud and Phut, or settlers like the
"mingled people." A not-improbable suggestion connects it with Coptos,
of which the Egyptian form was Qeb, Qebt or Qabt.

The men of the land that is in league - Rather, the children of the land
of the covenant, i. e., of Israel (see [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008).md). After the destruction of
Jerusalem Jews withdrew into Egypt [Jer
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007.md). Many of them would naturally
enough be found in the Egyptian armies. This is in favor of the later
date assigned to this section.

[Ezekiel 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 30:6</span></span>

See the marginal reference note.

[Ezekiel 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 30:9</span></span>

Careless Ethiopians - The Ethiopians, who were dwelling in fancied
security [Zep 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md), shall tremble at
Egypt's ruin.

[Ezekiel 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 30:13</span></span>

Noph - Memphis [Isa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 30:14</span></span>

Zoan - Tanis, a city and nome of Lower Egypt [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md). See the marginal reference
note.

No - Diospolis. See the marginal reference note.

[Ezekiel 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 30:17</span></span>

Aven - The same as "On" [Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045.md), or
"Heliopolis." The word "Aven" means also "transgression" (compare [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008).md). Some have thought that here too
Ezekiel substituted the word "Aven" for "On" to mark the "sin" of
idolatry there in full vogue.

Pi-beseth - The Bubastis of Herodotus. The hieroglyphic name is
"Pe-bast," the house of Bast (the Egyptian Artemis, the cat-headed
goddess). Bubastis was situated on the easternmost, the Pelusian, branch
of the Delta. The road from Pelusium to Memphis lay through Bubastis and
On. In the days of Herodotus Bubastis was the seat of one of the chief
annual festivals of the Egyptians. The Persians took the town and razed
the walls. The ruins bear the modern name Tel-Basta.

[Ezekiel 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 30:18</span></span>

Tehaphnehes - See the marginal reference note. "break the yokes of
Egypt" i. e., break the yokes imposed by Egypt, or break up the
tyrannous dominion of Egypt over other lands.

[Ezekiel 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 30:20</span></span>

Fourth prophecy against Egypt spoken three months before the capture of
Jerusalem [Eze 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md), and three months
after the prophecy of [Eze 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md).
Meantime, Pharaoh-Hophra's attempt on Jerusalem had been foiled, and the
Egyptians driven back into their own country ([Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005) note.md).

[Eze 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021.md)

I have broken - Especially by the defeat at Carchemish.

A roller - Or, a bandage.

[Eze 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022.md)

The strong - Such power as Egypt yet retained at home and abroad.

That which was broken - The power which Egypt aimed at ineffectually,
the conquest of Palestine and Syria.
