*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 27:2</span></span>

Another - An "alienus" rather than "alius." Praise to be worth anything
must be altogether independent.

[Proverbs 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 27:3</span></span>

Compare Ecclus. 22:15; a like comparison between the heaviest material
burdens and the more intolerable load of unreasoning passion.

[Proverbs 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 27:4</span></span>

Envy - Better, as in the margin, the violence of passion in the husband
who thinks himself wronged (compare [Pro
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034).md).

[Proverbs 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 27:5</span></span>

Secret love - Better, love that is hidden; i. e., love which never shows
itself in this one way of rebuking faults. Rebuke, whether from friend
or foe, is better than such love.

[Proverbs 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 27:6</span></span>

Deceitful - Better, abundant. Very lavish is the enemy of the kisses
that cover perfidy, but lavish of them only. His courtesy goes no
deeper.

[Proverbs 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 27:7</span></span>

The special instance covers the general law, that indulgence in pleasure
of any kind brings on satiety and weariness, but self-restraint
multiplies the sources of enjoyment.

[Proverbs 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 27:8</span></span>

Change of place is thought of as in itself an evil. It is not easy for
the man to find another home or the bird another nest. The maxim is
characteristic of the earlier stages of Hebrew history, before exile and
travel had made change of country a more familiar thing. Compare the
feeling which made the thought of being "a fugitive and a vagabond" [Gen
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md) the most terrible of all
punishments.

[Proverbs 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 27:10</span></span>

"Better is a neighbor" who is really "near" in heart and spirit, than a
brother who though closer by blood, is "far off" in feeling.

[Proverbs 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 27:11</span></span>

The voice of the teacher to his true disciple. He pleads with him that
the uprightness of the scholar will be the truest answer to all attacks
on the character or teaching of the master.

[Proverbs 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 27:12</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference.

[Proverbs 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 27:14</span></span>

The picture of the ostentatious flatterer going at daybreak to pour out
blessings on his patron. For any good that he does, for any thanks he
gets, he might as well utter curses.

[Proverbs 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 27:15</span></span>

Continual dropping - Here, as in the marginal reference, the flat,
earthen roof of Eastern houses, always liable to cracks and leakage,
supplies the groundwork of the similitude.

[Proverbs 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 27:16</span></span>

The point is the impossibility of concealment or restraint. A person
cannot hide the wind, or clasp it in his hands. If he takes an unguent
in his right hand, the odor betrays him, or it slips out. So, in like
manner, the "contentious woman" is one whose faults it is impossible
either to hide or check. The difficulty of the proverb led to a
different reading, adopted by the versions, "The north wind is rough,
and yet it is called propitious"; it clears off the clouds and brings
fine weather.

[Proverbs 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 27:17</span></span>

The proverb expresses the gain of mutual counsel as found in clear,
well-defined thoughts. Two minds, thus acting on each other, become more
acute. This is better than to see in "sharpening" the idea of provoking,
and the point of the maxim in the fact that the quarrels of those who
have been friends are bitter in proportion to their previous intimacy.

[Proverbs 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 27:18</span></span>

Waiteth - literally, "keepeth," "observeth." As the fig tree requires
constant care but yields abundant crops, so the ministrations of a
faithful servant will not be without their due reward. Compare [Ti2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 27:19</span></span>

As we see our own face when we look on the mirror-like surface of the
water, so in every heart of man we may see our own likeness. In spite of
all diversities we come upon the common human nature in which we all
alike share. Others see in the reference to the reflection in the water
the thought that we judge of others by ourselves, find them faithful or
the reverse, as we ourselves are.

[Proverbs 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 27:20</span></span>

Hades, the world of the dead, and Destruction (Death, the destroying
power, personified) have been at all times and in all countries thought
of as all-devouring, insatiable (compare the marginal reference). Yet
one thing is equally so, the lust of the eye, the restless craving which
grows with what it feeds on [Ecc 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008.md).

[Proverbs 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 27:21</span></span>

So is ... - Better, So let a man be to his praise, let him purify it
from all the alloy of flattery and baseness with which it is too
probably mixed up.

[Proverbs 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 27:22</span></span>

Bray - To pound wheat in a mortar with a pestle, in order to free the
wheat from its husks and impurities, is to go through a far more
elaborate process than threshing. But the folly of the fool is not thus
to be got rid of. It sticks to him to the last; all discipline,
teaching, experience seem to be wasted on him.

[Proverbs 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 27:23</span></span>

The verses sing the praises of the earlier patriarchal life, with its
flocks and herds, and tillage of the ground, as compared with the
commerce of a later time, with money as its chief or only wealth.

[Pro 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md)

The state - literally, face. The verse is an illustration of [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md), [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md).

[Pro 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md)

Riches - The money which men may steal, or waste, is contrasted with the
land of which the owner is not so easily deprived. Nor will the crown
(both the "crown of pure gold" worn on the mitre of the high priest,
[Exo 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006.md); [Exo
39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030.md); and the kingly diadem, the
symbol of power generally) be transmitted (as flocks and herds had been)
"from one generation to another."

[Pro 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md)

Appeareth - Better, When the grass disappeareth, the "tender grass
showeth itself." Stress is laid on the regular succession of the
products of the earth. The "grass" ("hay") of the first clause is
(compare [Psa 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md); [Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md); [Psa
103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md); [Kg2
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026).md) the proverbial type of what is
perishable and fleeting. The verse gives a picture of the pleasantness
of the farmer's calling; compared with this what can wealth or rank
offer? With this there mingles (compare [Pro
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023).md) the thought that each stage of
that life in its season requires care and watchfulness.
