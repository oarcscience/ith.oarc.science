### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 7:1</span></span>

There is no indication how soon after the bringing up of the ark these
things occurred, but it was probably at no long interval.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 7:2</span></span>

Nathan the prophet - Here first mentioned, but playing an important part
afterward (e. g. [Sa2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001); [Kg1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#010); [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029); [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029)). From the two last passages it
appears that he wrote the history of David's reign, and a part at least
of Solomon's. His distinctive title is the prophet, that of Gad the seer
(compare [Sa1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009)). He was probably
nuch younger than David. In [Sa2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003),
he spoke his own private opinion; in [Sa2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004), this was corrected by the word of
the Lord.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 7:6</span></span>

Have walked - Implying the frequent moving of the tabernacle, in the
times of the Judges, as opposed to a settled resting in one place. The
word tent, refers especially to the outward covering of skins, etc.: the
tabernacle denotes the framework of beards and bars. Observe the
constant reference to the Exodus and to the details as given in the
books of Moses.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 7:7</span></span>

The tribes of Israel - The duplicate passage reads judges (see margin
and compare [Sa2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011)). But a
comparison with such passages as [Psa
78:67-68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067); [Kg1
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016); and [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004), favors the reading "tribes," and
the phrase is a condensed one, the meaning of which is, that whatever
tribe had in times past supplied the ruler of Israel, whether Ephraim in
the days of Joshua, or Benjamin in the time of Saul, or Judah in that of
David, God had never required any of these tribes to build a house in
one of their cities.

An house of cedar - See [Kg1 7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002);
[Kg1 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017), [Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021); [Jer
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014), [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023). Beams of cedar marked a costly
building. The cedar of Lebanon is a totally different tree from what we
improperly call the red or Virginian cedar, which supplies the
sweet-scented cedar wood, and is really a kind of juniper. The cedar of
Lebanon is a close-grained, light-colored, yellowish wood, with darker
knots and veins.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 7:10</span></span>

Moreover I will appoint ... - It should be: And I have appointed a
place, etc., and have planted them, etc. This was already done by the
consolidation of David's kingdom. The contrast between this and [Sa2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011) is that of the troubled,
unsettled times of the Judges and the frequent servitudes of Israel in
those times, with the settled prosperity and independence of the kingdom
of David and Solomon.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 7:12</span></span>

The prophet, having detailed God's past mercies to David, now passes on
to direct prophecy, and that one of the most important in the O d
Testament.

I will set up the seed - In one sense this mannifestly refers to
Solomon, David's successor and the builder of the temple. But we have
the direct authority of Peter [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030) for applying it to Christ the
seed of David, and His eternal kingdom; and the title the Son of David
given to the Messiah in the rabbinical writings, as well as its special
application to Jesus in the New Testament, springs mainly from the
acknowledged Messianic significance of this prophecy. (See also [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003); [Act
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034).)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 7:13</span></span>

He shall build an house ... - For the fulfillment of this in the person
of Solomon, see [Kg1 8:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016). For its
application to Christ, see [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012);
[Eph 1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006); etc.; and [Zac
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).

I will stablish the throne of his kingdom forever - The words forever,
emphatically twice repeated in [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016), show very distinctly that this
prophecy looks beyond the succession of the kings of Judah of the house
of David, and embraces the throne of Christ according to the Angel's
interpretation given in [Luk 1:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031),
where the reference to this passage cannot be mistaken. This is also
brought out fully in [Psa 89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029), [Psa
89:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036). See also [Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013); [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Jer
33:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014); [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024); [Zac
12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005), etc.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 7:14</span></span>

I will be his father ... - In marginal reference the equivalent
expressions are applied to David. In [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005), this text is applied to Christ.
But in [Ch1 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013); [Ch1
22:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009); [Ch1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006), it is expressly appropriated to
Solomon.

With the rod of men ... - i. e. such a chastisement as men inflict upon
their children, to correct and reclaim them, not to destroy them. The
whole clause is omitted in [Ch1 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 7:15</span></span>

My mercy shall not depart ... - Hence, Isaiah's saying, the sure mercies
of David [Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003), i. e. unfailing,
lasting mercies: mercies which are like streams of water that never dry
up [Isa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016); [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018). This is explained in [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016), where the word established is
the same word as is rendered sure in Isaiah.

Before thee - Before Me is probably the true reading in [Sa2
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015) (if the rest of the text be
sound), according to the analogy of [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019); [Sa1
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030), [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035); and many other places; whereas
the idea contained in the reading, before thee, is unparalleled. But the
reading in [Ch1 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013) is quite
different: "As I took it from him that was before thee," meaning Saul,
which gives a very good sense, and suggests that the text here may have
been corrupted.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 7:18</span></span>

Sat before the Lord - In the tent where the ark was. Standing or
kneeling was the usual attitude of prayer ([Kg1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022), [Kg1
8:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054); but compare [Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012)). Modern commentators mostly
take the word here in the sense of waiting, abiding, not sitting: but
sat is the natural rendering. David sat down to meditate, and then rose
up to pray.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 7:19</span></span>

Is this the manner of man - Compare [Ch1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#017). Our passage may be thus
understood: But this is the law (or prerogative) of a great man to found
dynasties which are to last into the far future. David expresses his
astonishment that he, of such humble birth, and one so little in his own
eyes, should not only be raised to the throne, but be assured of the
perpetuity of the succession in his descendants, as if he were a man of
high degree.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 7:23</span></span>

The nations and their gods - i e. the people and the idols of Canaan.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 7:27</span></span>

Therefore hath thy servant found in his heart ... - The promises of God
are the true guide to the prayers of His people. We may dare to ask
anything, how great soever it may be, which God has promised to give. In
this and the two following verses David expresses the same wonder at the
riches of God's grace, and the same expectation founded on that grace,
which Paul does. in such passages as [Eph
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005); [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007), etc. marginal references.
