### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 21:0</span></span>

This psalm likewise purports to be "A Psalm of David," and there is no
cause to doubt the correctness of the superscription which ascribes it
to him. There is, however, no certain intimation at what time of his
life, or on what occasion, it was composed, and it is impossible to
determine these points.

The most probable supposition in regard to its composition seems to me
to be, that it is a song of thanksgiving for the victory secured in
answer to the prayer of himself and the people in the previous psalm.
Nothing can be argued, indeed, on this point, from the mere fact that it
stands in close connection with the previous psalm; but there are, it
seems to me, internal marks that this was its design, and that it is the
expression of a heart overflowing with gratitude, and, therefore,
recalling not merely the immediate blessings of a recent victory, but
also the other blessings with which God had crowned his life, [Psa
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md).

Thus understood in regard to its origin, the psalm may be regarded as
divided into the following parts:

I. Thanksgiving for success, or for granting the object which had been
so earnestly sought, [Psa 21:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md). In
this thanksgiving the psalmist says that God had not only granted what
had been asked [Psa 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md), but that
he had greatly "exceeded" this: he had granted far more than had been
the literal request. He had added blessings which had not been
specifically sought; he had made those blessings permanent and eternal,
[Psa 21:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md).

II\. The general truth that "all" the foes of God would thus be
overcome, and that the cause of truth would be finally triumphant, [Psa
21:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md). This was "suggested" by the
victory which had been achieved. As God had granted that victory, as he
had so easily subdued the enemies of himself and of his people - as he
had gone so far beyond the expectations and the hopes of those who had
gone forth to the conflict, the idea is naturally suggested that it
would be thus with all his foes, and that there would be ultimately a
complete victory over them.

III\. The expression of an earnest "desire" that God might be thus
exalted, and might thus achieve a complete and final victory, [Psa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md),

For the meaning of the phrase, "To the chief Musician," in the title to
the psalm, see the notes at [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

The king shall joy in thy strength - King David, who had achieved the
victory which he had desired and prayed for, [Psa
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md). This is in the third person,
but the reference is doubtless to David himself, and is to be understood
as his own language. If it be understood, however, as the language of
"the people," it is still an ascription of praise to God for his favor
to their king. It seems better, however, to regard it as the language of
David himself. The word ""strength"" here implies that all the success
referred to was to be traced to God. It was not by the prowess of a
human arm; it was not by the valor or skill of the king himself; it was
by the power of God alone.

And in thy salvation - In the salvation or deliverance from foes which
thou hast granted, and in all that thou doest to save. The language
would embrace all that God does to save his people.

How greatly shall he rejoice! - Not only does he rejoice now, but he
ever will rejoice. It will be to him a constant joy. Salvation, now to
us a source of comfort, will always be such; and when we once have
evidence that God has interposed to save us, it is accompanied with the
confident anticipation that this will continue to be the source of our
highest joy forever.

[Psalms 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 21:2</span></span>

Thou hast given him his heart's desire - See the notes at [Psa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#004.md). This had been the prayer of the
people that God would "grant him according to his own heart, and fulfil
all his counsel," and this desire had now been granted. All that had
been wished; all that had been prayed for by himself or by the people,
had been granted.

And hast not withholden - Hast not denied or refused.

The request of his lips - The request, or the desire which his lips had
uttered. The meaning is, that his petitions had been filly granted.

Selah - See the notes at [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md).

[Psalms 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 21:3</span></span>

For thou preventest him - Thou goest before him; thou dost anticipate
him. See [Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md), margin. Our word
"prevent" is now most commonly used in the sense of "hinder, stop, or
intercept." This is not the original meaning of the English word; and
the word is never used in this sense in the Bible. The English word,
when our translation was made, meant to "go before," to "anticipate,"
and this is the uniform meaning of it in our English version, as it is
the meaning of the original. See the notes at [Job
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012.md). Compare [Psa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md); [Psa
79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md); [Psa
88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013.md); [Psa
95:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#002.md); [Psa
119:147-148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147.md); [Amo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010.md); see the notes at [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md). The meaning here is, that God
had "anticipated" him, or his desires. He had gone before him. He had
designed the blessing even before it was asked.

With the blessings of goodness - Blessings "indicating" goodness on his
part; blessings adapted to promote the "good" or the welfare of him on
whom they were bestowed. Perhaps the meaning here is, not only that they
were "good," but they "seemed" to be good; they were not "blessings in
disguise," or blessings as the result of previous calamity and trial,
but blessings where there was no trial - no shadow - no appearance of
disappointment.

Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head - This does not refer to
the time of his coronation, or the period when he was crowned a king,
but it refers to the victory which he had achieved, and by which he had
been made truly a king. He was crowned with triumph; he was shown to be
a king; the victory was like making him a king, or setting a crown of
pure gold upon his head. He was now a conqueror, and was indeed a king.

[Psalms 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 21:4</span></span>

He asked life of thee - An expression similar to this occurs in [Psa
61:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005.md), "For thou, O God, hast heard
my vows;...Thou wilt prolong the king's life, and his years to many
generations." The expression in both cases implies that there had been a
prayer for "life," as if life were in danger. The expression itself
would be applicable to a time of sickness, or to danger of any kind, and
here it is used doubtless in reference to the exposure of life in going
into battle, or in going forth to war. In this apprehended peril he
prayed that God would defend him. He earnestly sought protection as he
went forth to the perils of war.

And thou gavest it him - Thou didst hear and answer his prayer. He was
saved from danger.

Even length of days forever and ever - Thou didst grant him more than he
asked. He sought life for himself; thou bast not only granted that, but
hast granted to him the assurance that he should live in his posterity
to all generations. The idea is, that there would be an indefinite
contination of his race. His posterity would occupy his throne, and
there would be no end to his reign thus prolonged. Beyond all his
petitions and his hopes, God bad given the assurance that his reign
would be permanent and enduring. We cannot suppose that he understood
this as if it were a promise made to him personally, that "he" would
live and would occupy the throne forever; but the natural interpretation
is that which would refer it to his posterity, and to the perpetuity of
the reign of his family or descendants. A similar promise occurs
elsewhere: [Sa2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md), [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md); compare the notes at [Psa
18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md). It is by no means an uncommon
thing that God gives us more than we asked in our prayers. The offering
of prayer is not only the means of securing the blessing which we asked,
but also often of securing much more important blessings which we did
not ask. If the expression were allowable it might be said that the
prayer "suggested" to the divine mind the conferring of all needed
blessings, or it indicates such a state of mind on the part of him who
prays that God "takes occasion" to confer blessings which were not
asked; as a request made by a child to a parent for a specific favor is
followed not only by granting "that" favor, but by bestowing others of
which the child did not think. The state of mind on the part of the
child was such as to "dispose" the parent to grant much larger
blessings.

[Psalms 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 21:5</span></span>

His glory is great in thy salvation - Not in himself; not in anything
that he has done, but in what thou hast done. The fact that thou hast
saved him, and the manner in which it has been done, has put upon him
great honor. He felt indeed that his condition as king, and as to the
prospects before him, was one of great "glory" or honor; but he felt at
the same time that it was not in "himself," or for anything that he had
done: it was only in the ""salvation"" which "God" had conferred upon
him. Every child of God, in like manner, has great "glory" conferred
upon him, and his "glory" will be great forever; but it is not in
himself, or in virtue of anything that he has done. It is "great" in the
"salvation" of God:

\(a\) in the "fact" that God has interposed to save him; and

\(b\) in the "manner" in which it has been done.

The highest honor that can be put upon man is in the fact that God will
save him.

Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him -

\(a\) In making him a king;

\(b\) in the victories and triumphs which thou hast now given him,
placing on his head, as it were, a brighter crown;

\(c\) in the promised perpetuity of his reign.

So we may say of the ransomed sinner - the child of God - now. Honour
and majesty have been laid on him:

\(a\) in the fact that God has redeemed him;

\(b\) in the manner in which this has been accomplished;

\(c\) in his adoption into the family of God;

\(d\) in the rank and dignity which he occupies as a child of God;

\(e\) in the hope of immortal blessedness beyond the grave.

[Psalms 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 21:6</span></span>

For thou hast made him most blessed for ever - Margin, as in Hebrew,
"set him" to be "blessings." The expression in our translation, as it is
now commonly understood, would mean that God had made him "happy" or
"prosperous." This does not seem to be the sense of the original. The
idea is, that he had made him a blessing to mankind or to the world; or,
that he had made him to be a source of blessing to others. Blessings
would descend through him; and though in the consciousness of this fact
he would be "happy," and in that sense be "blessed," yet the idea is
rather that blessings would be imparted or scattered through him.
Blessings would abound to others through his own reign; blessings
through the reigns of those who should succeed him in the throne;
blessings would be imparted to men as far as the import of the promise
extended, that is, forever, [Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md).
The word "forever" here undoubtedly, as it was used by the Spirit of
inspiration, was designed to refer to the eternal blessings which would
descend on mankind through the Messiah, the illustrious descendant of
David. How far David himself understood this, is not material inquiry.
He was undoubtedly directed by the Spirit of inspiration to use such
language as would fairly and properly express this. It is right,
therefore, for us so to regard it, and so to interpret and apply it.

Thou hast made him exceeding glad - Margin, as in Hebrew, "gladded him
with joy." The Hebrew phrase means, as it is expressed in our
translation, that he had been made very glad, or very happy. The favors
of God to him, alike in his protection and in the promises which had
been made in reference to the future, were such as to make him happy in
the highest degree.

With thy countenance - With thy favor. By lifting the light of thy
countenance upon him; or, as we should express it, by "smiling" upon
him. See the notes at [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 21:7</span></span>

For the king - David, the author of the psalm.

Trusteth in the Lord - All these blessings have resulted from his
confiding in God, and looking to him for his favor and protection.

And through the mercy of the Most High - The favor of Him who is exalted
above all; the most exalted Being in the universe. The word "mercy" here
is equivalent to "favor." He had already experienced God's favor; he
looked for a continuance of it; and through that favor he was confident
that he would never be shaken in his purposes, and that he would never
be disappointed.

He shall not be moved - He shall be firmly established. That is, his
throne would be firm; he himself would live a life of integrity, purity,
and prosperity; and the promises which had been so graciously made to
him, and which extended so far into the future, would all be
acomplished. The truth taught here is, that however firm or prosperous
our way seems to be, the continuance of our prosperity, and the
completion of our hopes and our designs, depend wholly on the "mercy" or
the favor of the Most High. Confiding in that, we may feel assured that
whatever changes and reverses we may experience in our temporal matters,
our ultimate welfare will be secure. Nothing can shake a hope of heaven
that is founded on his gracious promises as made through a Saviour.

[Psalms 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 21:8</span></span>

Thine hand shall find out - That is, Thou wilt find out - the hand being
that by which we execute our purposes. This verse commences a new
division of the psalm (see the introduction) - in which the psalmist
looks forward to the complete and final triumph of God over "all" his
enemies. He looks to this in connection with what God had done for him.
He infers that he who had enabled him to achieve such signal conquests
over his own foes and the foes of God would not withdraw his
interposition until he had secured a complete victory for the cause of
truth and holiness. In connection with the promise made to him
respecting his permanent reign and the reign of his successors on the
throne [Psa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md), he infers that God
would ultimately subdue the enemies of truth, and would set up his
kingdom over all.

All thine enemies - However they may attempt to conceal themselves -
however they may evade the efforts to subdue them - yet they shall "all"
be found out and overcome. As this was intended by the Spirit of
inspiration, it undoubtedly refers to the final triumph of truth on the
earth, or to the fact that the kingdom of God will be set up over all
the world. All that are properly ranked among the enemies of God - all
that are in any way opposed to him and to his reign - will be found out
and conquered. All the worshippers of idols - all the enemies of truth -
all the rejecters of revelation - all the workers of iniquity, - all
that are infidels or scoffers - shall be found out and subdued. Either
by being made to yield to the claims of truth, and thus becoming the
friends of God, or by being cut off and punished for their sins - they
will be all so overcome that God shall reign over all the earth. An
important truth is further taught here, to wit, that no enemy of God can
escape him. There is no place to which he can flee where God will not
find him. "There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
of iniquity may hide themselves," [Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md).

Thy right hand - See the notes at [Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md).

Those that hate thee - All thine enemies.

[Psalms 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 21:9</span></span>

Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger - Thou
shalt consume or destroy them, "as if" they "were" burned in a heated
oven. Or, they shall burn, as if they were a flaming oven; that is, they
would be wholly consumed. The word rendered "oven" - תנור tannûr - means
either an "oven" or a "furnace." It is rendered "furnace and furnaces"
in [Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md); [Neh
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#011.md); [Neh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#038.md); [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md); and, as here, "oven" or "ovens,"
in [Exo 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003.md); [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md); [Lev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009.md); [Lev
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#035.md); [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Lam
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md); [Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md), [Hos
7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). It does not occur elsewhere. The
oven among the Hebrews was in the form of a large "pot," and was heated
from within by placing the wood inside of it. Of course, while being
heated, it had the appearance of a furnace. The meaning here is that the
wicked would be consumed or destroyed "as if" they were such a burning
oven; as if they were set on fire, and burned up.

The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath - The same idea of the utter
destruction of the wicked is here presented under another form - that
they would be destroyed as if the earth should open and swallow them up.
Perhaps the allusion in the language is to the case of Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram, [Num 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032.md); compare [Psa
106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017.md).

And the fire shall devour them - The same idea under another form. The
wrath of God would utterly destroy them. That wrath is often represented
under the image of "fire." See [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md); [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md); [Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042.md); [Mat
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#008.md); [Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md); [Mar
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md); [Th2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md). Fire is the emblem by which the
future punishment of the wicked is most frequently denoted.

[Psalms 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 21:10</span></span>

Their fruit - Their offspring; their children; their posterity, for so
the parallelism demands. The "fruit" is that which the tree produces;
and hence, the word comes to be applied to children as the production of
the parent. See this use of the word in [Gen
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002.md); [Exo
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#022.md); [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004.md), [Deu
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011.md), [Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018.md); [Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md); [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md); [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007.md).

Shalt thou destroy from the earth - Thou shalt utterly destroy them.
This is in accordance with the statement so often made in the
Scriptures, and with what so often occurs in fact, that the consequences
of the sins of parents pass over to their posterity, and that they
suffer in consequence of those sins. Compare [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); [Lev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005.md); [Lev
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md); compare the notes at [Rom
5:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md).

And their seed - Their posterity.

From among the children of men - From among men, or the human family.
That is, they would be entirely cut off from the earth. The truth taught
here is, that the wicked will ultimately be destroyed, and that God will
obtain a complete triumph over them, or that the kingdom of
righteousness shall be at length completely established. A time will
come when truth and justice shall be triumphant, when all the wicked
shall be removed out of the way; when all that oppose God and his cause
shall be destroyed, and when God shall show, by thus removing and
punishing the wicked, that he is the Friend of all that is true, and
good, and right. The "idea" of the psalmist probably was that this would
yet occur on the earth; the "language" is such, also, as may be applied
to that ultimate state, in the future world, when all the wicked shall
be destroyed, and the righteous shall be no more troubled with them.

[Psalms 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 21:11</span></span>

For they intended evil against thee - literally, "They stretched out
evil." The idea seems to be derived from "stretching out" or laying
snares, nets, or gins, for the purpose of taking wild beasts. That is,
they formed a plan or purpose to bring evil upon God and his cause: as
the hunter or fowler forms a purpose or plan to take wild beasts or
fowls. It is not merely a purpose in the head, as our word "intended"
would seem to imply; it supposes that arrangements had been entered
into, or that a scheme had been formed to injure the cause of God - that
is, through the person referred to in the psalm. The purposes of wicked
men against religion are usually much more than a mere "intention." The
intention is accompanied with a scheme or plan in their own mind by
which the act may be accomplished. The evil here referred to was that of
resisting or overpowering him who was engaged in the cause of God, or
whom God had appointed to administer his laws.

They imagined a mischievous device - They thought, or they purposed. The
word rendered "mischievous device" מזמה mezimmâh - means properly
"counsel, purpose; then prudence, sagacity;" then, in a bad sense,
"machination, device, trick." Gesenius, Lexicon. [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002.md); [Pro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#017.md); [Pro
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#008.md).

Which they are not able to perform - literally, "they could not;" that
is, they had not the power to accomplish it, or to carry out their
purpose. Their purpose was plain; their guilt was therefore clear; but
they were prevented from executing their design. Many such designs are
kept from being carried into execution for the want of power. If all the
devices and the desires of the wicked were accomplished, righteousness
would soon cease in the earth, religion and virtue would come to an end,
and even God would cease to occupy the throne.

[Psalms 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 21:12</span></span>

Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back - Margin, "Thou shalt set
them as a butt." The word back also is rendered in the margin
"shoulder." The word translated "therefore" means in this placer or, and
the rendering "therefore" obscures the sense. The statement in this
verse in connection with the previous verse, is, that they would not be
able to "perform" or carry out their well-laid schemes, "for" or
"because" God would make them turn the back; that is, he had vanquished
them. They were going forward in the execution of their purposes, but
God would interpose and turn them back, or compel them to "retreat." The
word rendered "back" in this place - שׁכם shekem - means properly
"shoulder," or, more strictly, the "shoulder-blades," that is, the part
where these approach each other behind; and then the upper part of the
back. It is not, therefore, incorrectly rendered by the phrase "thou
shalt make them turn "the back."" The expression is equivalent to saying
that they would be defeated or foiled in their plans and purposes.

When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings - Compare the
notes at [Psa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002.md). That is, when God
should go forth against them, armed as a warrior.

Against the face of them - Against them; or, in their very front. He
would meet them as they seemed to be marching on to certain conquest,
and would defeat them. It would not be by a side-blow, or by skillful
maneuver, or by turning their flank and attacking them in the rear.
Truth meets error boldly, face to face, and is not afraid of a fair
fight. In every such conflict error will ultimately yield; and whenever
the wicked come openly into conflict with God, they must be compelled to
turn and flee.

[Psalms 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 21:13</span></span>

Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength - This is the concluding
part of the psalm (see the introduction), expressing a desire that God
"might" be exalted over all his foes; or that his own strength might he
so manifestly put forth that he would be exalted as he ought to be. This
is the ultimate and chief desire of all holy created beings, that God
might be exalted in the estimation of the universe above all other
beings - or that he might so triumph over all his enemies as to reign
supreme.

So will we sing and praise thy power - That is, as the result of thy
being thus exalted to proper honor, we will unite in celebrating thy
glory and thy power. Compare [Rev
7:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md); [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md); [Rev
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md). This will be the result of all
the triumphs which God will achieve in the world, that the holy beings
of all worlds will gather around his throne and "sing and praise his
power." The "thought" in the psalm is that God will ultimately triumph
over all his foes, and that this triumph will be followed by universal
rejoicing and praise. Come that blessed day!
