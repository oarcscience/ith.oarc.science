### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 19:2</span></span>

The prophet had not long to wait before learning the intentions of the
queen. A priest's daughter herself, she would avenge the slaughtered
priests; a king's wife and a king's child, she would not quail before a
subject. That very night a messenger declared her determination to
compass the prophet's death within the space of a day.

So let the gods ... - A common oath about this time (marginal
references). The Greek Version prefixes to this another clause, which
makes the oath even more forcible, "As surely as thou art Elijah and I
am Jezebel, so let the gods," etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 19:3</span></span>

The rapid movement of the original is very striking. "And he saw (or,
"feared," as some read), and he rose, and he went, etc." The fear and
flight of Elijah are very remarkable. Jezebel's threat alone, had not,
in all probability, produced the extraordinary change but, partly,
physical reaction from the over-excitement of the preceding day; and,
partly, internal disquietude and doubt as to the wisdom of the course
which he had adopted.

Beer-sheba is about 95 miles from Jezreel, on the very borders of the
desert et-Tih. Elijah cannot possibly have reached it until the close of
the second day. It seems implied that he traveled both night and day,
and did not rest until he arrived thus far on his way. It was one of the
towns assigned to the tribe of Simeon [Jos
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002.md). The Simeonites were, however, by
this time absorbed into Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 19:4</span></span>

Elijah did not feel himself safe until he was beyond the territory of
Judah, for Ahab might demand him of Jehoshaphat [Kg1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#010.md), with whom he was on terms of
close alliance [Kg1 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004.md). He,
therefore, proceeds southward into the desert, simply to be out of the
reach of his enemies.

A juniper-tree - The tree here mentioned רתם rethem is not the juniper
but a species of broom (Genista monosperma), called "rethem" by the
Arabs, which abounds in the Sinaitic peninsula. It grows to such a size
as to afford shade and protection, both in heat and storm, to travelers.

Requested for himself that he might die - Like Moses and Jonah (marginal
references). The prophet's depression here reached its lowest point. He
was still suffering from the reaction of overstrained feeling; he was
weary with nights and days of travel; he was faint with the sun's heat;
he was exhausted for want of food; he was for the first time alone -
alone in the awful solitude and silence of the great white desert. Such
solitude might brace the soul in certain moods; but in others it must
utterly overwhelm and crush. Thus the prophet at length gave way
completely - made his prayer that he might die - and, exhausted sank, to
sleep.

I am not better than my fathers - i. e., "I am a mere weak man, no
better nor stronger than they who have gone before me, no more able to
revolutionize the world than they."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 19:5</span></span>

An angel touched him - The friendly ministration of angels, common in
the time of the patriarchs [Gen
18:2-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002.md); 19:1-22; [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012.md); [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), [Gen
32:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md), and known also under the
Judges [Jdg 6:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md); 13:3-20, was now
extended to Elijah. Any other explanation of this passage does violence
to the words. It is certainly not the intention of the writer to
represent Elijah as relieved on this occasion by a human "messenger."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 19:6</span></span>

A cake baken on the coals - It is not implied that Elijah found a fire
lighted and the cake on it, but only that he found one of the usual
baked cakes of the desert, which form the ordinary food of the Arab at
the present day.

At his head - The Hebrew word means simply "the place on which the head
lies;" hence, the marginal rendering, "bolster."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 19:7</span></span>

Arise and eat ... - i. e., "Eat a second time, for otherwise the journey
will be beyond thy powers." "The journey" was not simply a pilgrimage to
Horeb, which was less than 200 miles distant, and might have been
reached in six or seven days. It was to be a wandering in the
wilderness, not unlike that of the Israelites when they came out of
Egypt; only it was to last forty days instead of forty years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 19:8</span></span>

The old commentators generally understood this to mean that Elijah had
no other food at all, and compared this long fast with that of Moses and
that of our Lord (marginal references). But the words do not exclude the
notion of the prophet's having obtained such nourishment from roots and
fruits as the desert offers to a wanderer, though these alone would not
have sustained him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 19:9</span></span>

A cave - Rather, "the cave." Some well-known cave must be intended -
perhaps the "cliff of the rock" [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md). The traditional "cave of
Elijah" which is shown in the secluded plain immediately below the
highest summit of the Jebel Mousa, cannot, from its small size, be the
real cavern.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 19:10</span></span>

I, even I only, am left - The same statement as in [Kg1
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#022.md), but the sense is different.
There Elijah merely said that he alone remained to execute the prophet's
office, which was true; here he implies that he is the only prophet left
alive, whereas a hundred had been saved by Obadiah [Kg1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 19:11</span></span>

And behold, the Lord passed by - The remainder of this verse and the
whole of the next are placed by the Septuagint, and by the Arabic
translator, in the mouth of the Angel. But it seems best to regard the
vision as ending with the words "before the Lord" - and the writer as
then assuming that this was done, and proceeding to describe what
followed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 19:12</span></span>

A still small voice - literally, "a sound of soft stillness." The
teaching is a condemnation of that "zeal" which Elijah had gloried in, a
zeal exhibiting itself in fierce and terrible vengeances, and an
exaltation and recommendation of that mild and gentle temper, which
"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things." But it was so contrary to the whole character of the stern,
harsh, unsparing Tishbite, that it could have found no ready entrance
into his heart. It may have for a while moderated his excessive zeal,
and inclined him to gentler courses; but later in his life the old
harshness recurred in a deed in reference to which our Lord himself drew
the well-known contrast between the spirits of the two Dispensations
[Luk 9:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 19:13</span></span>

Mantle - The upper garment, a sort of short cloak or cape - perhaps made
of untanned sheepskin, which was, besides the strip of leather round his
loins, the sole apparel of the prophet (compare [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004).md). For the action compare the
marginal references.

There came a voice unto him ... - The question heard before in vision is
now put again to the prophet by the Lord Himself. Elijah gives no
humbler and more gentle answer. He is still satisfied with his own
statement of his case.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 19:15</span></span>

The answer is not a justification of the ways of God, nor a direct
reproof of the prophet's weakness and despondency, nor an explanation or
application of what Elijah had seen. For the present, he is simply
directed back into the path of practical duty. His mission is not yet
over, there is still work for him to do. He receives special injunctions
with respect to Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha; and he is comforted with a
revelation well adapted to rouse him from his despondency: there are
seven thousand who will sympathize with him in his trials, and who need
his care and attention.

The wilderness of Damascus - Probably the district north of the
prophet's own country, between Bashan and Damascus itself, and which was
known in later times as Iturea and Gaulanitis. Here the prophet might be
secure from Jezebel, while he could readily communicate with both Israel
and Damascus, and execute the commissions with which he was entrusted.

When thou comest, anoint - Rather, "and thou shalt go and anoint,"
Elijah performed one only of the three commissions given to him. He
appears to have been left free to choose the time for executing his
commissions, and it would seem that he thought the proper occasion had
not arisen either for the first or the second before his own
translation. But he took care to communicate the divine commands to his
successor, who performed them at the fitting moment (marginal
references).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 19:16</span></span>

Jehu, the son of Nimshi - In reality the grandson of Nimshi. But he
seems to have been commonly known by the above title [Kg2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020.md); [Ch2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007.md), perhaps because his father had
died and his grand-father had brought him up.

Abel-meholah - See [Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md) note.
(Conder identifies it with Ain Helweh.)

Elisha ... shalt thou anoint - This is almost the only place where we
hear of the anointing of prophets (compare [Ch1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022.md) and [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 19:17</span></span>

Compare the marginal references.

Shall Elisha slay - i. e., With a spiritual slaying by the "word of the
Lord," which is "sharper than any two-edged sword," and may be said to
slay those whose doom it pronounces (compare the marginal reference;
[Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md). Elisha does not seem, like
Elijah, to have executed God's judgments on the guilty.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 19:18</span></span>

Yet I have left me ... - Rather, as in the margin. "Seven thousand"
faithful Israelites shall survive all the persecutions of Ahab and
Jezebel, and carry down the worship of Yahweh to another generation.
Elijah is mistaken in supposing that he only is left. The number is
manifestly a "round" number, not an exact estimate. Perhaps it is,
moreover, a mystical or symbolic number. Compare [Rev
7:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#005.md). Of all the symbolic numbers
used in Scripture, seven is the most common.

Every mouth which hath not kissed him - Idolaters sometimes kissed the
hand to the object of their worship [Job
31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md); at other times they kissed
the actual image (marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 19:19</span></span>

Plowing - Elisha's occupation is an indication of his character. He is
emphatically a man of peace. He passes the year in those rural
occupations which are natural to the son of a wealthy yeoman -
superintending the field-laborers himself, and taking a share in their
toils. He thus presents a strong contrast to the stern, harsh, rugged
Gileadite, who is almost half an Arab, who seems to have no settled
home, no quiet family circle, who avoids the haunts of men, and is
content for months to dwell in a cavern instead of under a roof.

With twelve yoke of oxen - He was plowing in a field with eleven other
plows at work, each drawn by one yoke of oxen. Plowing with a single
pair of oxen was the practice in Egypt, in Assyria, in Palestine, and in
modern times throughout Western Asia.

Passed by him - Rather, "crossed over to him." Perhaps it is meant that
he crossed the stream of the Jordan.

Cast his mantle upon him - The action is explained as constituting a
species of adoption, because a father naturally clothes his children.
The notion of fatherhood and sonship was evidently understood between
them [Kg2 2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#009.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 19:20</span></span>

Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father ... - Not an unnatural request
before following his new spiritual father. Elijah sees in his address a
divided heart, and will not give the permission or accept the service
thus tendered. Hence, his cold reply. See [Luk
9:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061.md).

Go back again ... - i. e., "Go, return to thy plowing ... why shouldest
thou quit it? Why take leave of thy friends and come with me? What have
I done to thee to require such a sacrifice? for as a sacrifice thou
evidently regardest it. Truly I have done nothing to thee. Thou canst
remain as thou art."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 19:21</span></span>

Elisha returns to his oxen and laborers. He indicates his relinquishment
of his home and calling by the slaughter of the particular yoke of oxen
with which he had himself been plowing, probably the best beasts of the
twelve, and by burning the "instruments," the p oughs and yokes, both
made of wood. Next he feasts his people to show his gratitude for his
call, Elijah apparently remaining the while; and then, leaving father
and mother, cattle and land, good position and comfortable home, Elisha
became the "minister" to the wanderer. Compare [Exo
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013.md); [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md).
