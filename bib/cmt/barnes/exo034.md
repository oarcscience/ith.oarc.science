### [Exodus Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001)

[Exodus 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 34:1</span></span>

Hew thee - The former tables are called "the work of God;" compare [Exo
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016).

The words - See [Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028).

[Exodus 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 34:6</span></span>

This was the second revelation of the name of the God of Israel to
Moses. The first revelation was of Yahweh as the self-existent One, who
purposed to deliver His people with a mighty hand [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014); this was of the same Yahweh as a
loving Saviour who was now forgiving their sins. The two ideas that mark
these revelations are found combined, apart from their historical
development, in the second commandment, where the divine unity is shown
on its practical side, in its relation to human obligations (compare
[Exo 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014); [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004)). Both in the commandment and in
this passage, the divine love is associated with the divine justice; but
in the former there is a transposition to serve the proper purpose of
the commandments, and the justice stands before the love. This is
strictly the legal arrangement, brought out in the completed system of
the ceremonial law, in which the sin-offering, in acknowledgment of the
sentence of justice against sin, was offered before the burnt-offering
and the peace-offering. But in this place the truth appears in its
essential order; the retributive justice of Yahweh is subordinated to,
rather it is made a part of, His forgiving Love (see [Exo
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014) note). The visitation of God,
whatever form it may wear, is in all ages the working out purposes of
Love toward His children. The diverse aspects of the divine nature, to
separate which is the tendency of the unregenerate mind of man and of
all paganism, are united in perfect harmony in the Lord Yahweh, of whom
the saying is true in all its length and breadth, "God is love" [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008). It was the sense of this, in the
degree to which it was now revealed to him, that caused Moses to bow his
head and worship [Exo 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#008). But the
perfect revelation of the harmony was reserved for the fulness of time
when "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008) was made known to us in the flesh
as both our Saviour and our Judge.

[Exodus 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 34:9</span></span>

This yearning struggle after assurance is like the often-repeated
utterance of the heart, when it receives a blessing beyond its hopes,
"can this be real?"

[Exodus 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 34:10</span></span>

Marvels - Explained in the following verse. Compare [Sa2
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023); [Psa
77:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#014).

[Exodus 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 34:12</span></span>

The precepts contained in these verses are, for the most part, identical
in substance with some of those which follow the Ten Commandments and
are recorded in "the Book of the covenant" (Exo. 20-23; see [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007)).

[Exo 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013)

Cut down their groves - This is the first reference to what is commonly
known as grove-worship. The original word for "grove" in this connection
אשׁרה 'ăshêrāh is different from that so rendered in [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033). Our translators supposed that
what the law commands is the destruction of groves dedicated to the
worship of false deities [Jdg 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025);
[Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004); but inasmuch as the worship
of asherah is found associated with that of Astarte, or Ashtoreth [Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013); [Jdg
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006); [Sa1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#004), it seems probable that while
Astarte was the personal name of the goddess, the asherah was a symbol
of her, probably in some one of her characters, made in wood in some
conventional form.

[Exo 34:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015)

An expansion of [Exo 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012). The
unfaithfulness of the nation to its covenant with Yahweh is here for the
first time spoken of as a breach of the marriage bond. The metaphor is,
in any case, a natural one, but it seems to gain point, if we suppose it
to convey an allusion to the abominations connected with pagan worship,
such as are spoken of in [Num 25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001).

[Exo 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#021)

See [Exo 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#009); [Exo
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012). There is here added to the
commandment a particular caution respecting those times of year when the
land calls for most labor. The old verb "to ear" (i. e. to plow) is
genuine English.

[Exo 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024)

Neither shall any man desire etc. - Intended to encourage such as might
fear the consequences of obeying the divine law in attending to their
religious duties. Compare [Pro 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007).

[Exodus 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 34:28</span></span>

He wrote - i. e. Yahweh wrote [Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001).

[Exodus 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 34:29</span></span>

The two tables of testimony - Compare [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).

The skin of his face shone - Compare [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002). The brightness of the Eternal
Glory, though Moses had witnessed it only in a modified manner [Exo
33:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022), was so reflected in his
face, that Aaron and the people were stricken with awe, and feared to
approach him until he gave them words of encouragement.

The word translated "shine" is closely connected with a word translated
"horn"; and hence, the Latin version and others have rendered the verb
"to be horned." From this rendering of the word has arisen the popular
representation of Moses with horns on his forehead; e. g. in
Michaelangelo's statue at Rome.

[Exodus 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 34:33</span></span>

Paul refers to this passage as showing forth the glory of the law,
though it was but a "ministration of condemnation," and was to be done
away, in order to enhance the glory of the gospel, "the ministration of
the spirit," which is concealed by no veil from the eyes of believers,
and is to last forever [Co2 3:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007).

[Exo 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033)

When rather than until should be supplied. Moses did not wear the veil
when he was speaking to the people, but when he was silent. See [Exo
34:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035).

[Exo 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034)

Moses went in - i. e. to the tent of meeting.
