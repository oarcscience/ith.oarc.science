### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 9:2</span></span>

This appearance is fixed by [Kg1 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)
to Solomon's twenty-fourth year, the year in which he completed his
palace [Kg1 6:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037); [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001). The fact seems to be that, though
the temple was finished in Solomon's eleventh year, the dedication did
not take place until his twenty-fourth year. The order of the narrative
in Kings agrees with this view, since it interposes the account of the
building of the palace [Kg1 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001),
and of the making of the furniture 1 Kings 7:13-51, between the
completion of the building of the temple [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038) and the ceremony of the
Dedication 1 Kings 8.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 9:3</span></span>

The answer given by God to Solomon's prayer is reported more fully in
[Ch2 7:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012).

When God puts His Name in the temple He does it, in intention,
"forever." He will not arbitrarily withdraw it; there it will remain
"forever," so far as God is concerned. But the people may by
unfaithfulness drive it away [Kg1
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007).

And mine eyes and my heart - An answer in excess of the prayer [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029); "Not Mine eyes only, but Mine
eyes and Mine heart."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 9:4</span></span>

See [Kg1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014). Solomon's subsequent
fall lends to these repeated warnings a special interest.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 9:6</span></span>

At all turn - Rather, "If ye shall wholly turn from following Me." (See
[Ch2 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#019).) The Israelites were not to
be cut off, except for an entire defection.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 9:8</span></span>

The Hebrew text runs - "And this house shall be high: every one," etc.
The meaning appears to be, "This house shall be high" (i. e.,
conspicuous) "in its ruin as in its glory."

And shall hiss - In contempt. This expression first appears in the time
of Hezekiah [Ch2 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008); [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016). It is especially familiar to
Jeremiah ([Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008), etc.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 9:10</span></span>

The "twenty years" are to be counted from the fourth year of Solomon,
the year when he commenced the building of the temple. They are made up
of the seven years employed in the work of the temple [Kg1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038), and the thirteen years during
which Solomon was building his own house [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 9:11</span></span>

By the spirit, if not by the letter, of the Law, Solomon had no right to
give away these cities, or any part of the inheritance of Israel Lev.
25:13-34. But the exigences of a worldly policy caused the requirements
of the Law to be set aside.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 9:12</span></span>

They pleased him not - It is a reasonable conjecture that, when a
question arose with respect to a cession of land, Hiram had cast his
eyes on the bay or harbour of Acco, or Ptolemais, and was therefore the
more disappointed when he received an inland tract of mountain
territory.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 9:13</span></span>

Cabul is said to be a Phoenician word, and signified "displeasing" (see
margin). There is some reason to believe that the cities thus despised
by Hiram were restored to Solomon [Ch2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002), and that Solomon rebuilt them and
colonized them with Israelites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 9:14</span></span>

Hiram sent sixscore talents of gold - Apparently, to show that, although
disappointed, he was not offended. The sum sent was very large - above a
million and a quarter of our money, according to one estimate of the
weight of the Hebrew gold talent; or about 720,000 according to the
estimate adopted in [Exo 38:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024)
note. At any rate, it was more than equal to a sixth part of Solomon's
regular revenue [Kg1 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 9:15</span></span>

Levy - See the marginal reference note.

Millo - See [Sa2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009) note. The
Septuagint commonly render the word ἡ ἄκρα hē akra, "the citadel," and
it may possibly have been the fortress on Mount Zion connected with the
Maccabean struggles (1 Macc. 4:41; 13:49-52). Its exact site has not
been determined.

And the wall of Jerusalem - David's fortification [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009); [Ch1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008) had been hasty, and had now -
fifty years later - fallen into decay. Solomon therefore had to "repair
the breaches of the city of David" [Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027).

Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer were three of the most important sites in the
holy land. For the two first places, compare the marginal references and
notes.

Gezer was a main city of the south. It was situated on the great
maritime plain, and commanded the ordinary line of approach from Egypt,
which was along this low region. The importance of Gezer appears from
[Jos 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033); [Jos
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#012), etc. Its site is near Tell
Jezer, and marked now by Abu Shusheh. Though within the lot of Ephraim
[Jos 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003), and especially assigned to
the Kohathite Levites [Jos 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021), it
had never yet been conquered from the old inhabitants (marginal
references), who continued to dwell in it until Solomon's time, and
apparently were an independent people [Kg1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016).

Pharaoh took it before the marriage of Solomon with his daughter, and
gave it "for a present" - i. e., for a dowry. Though in the East
husbands generally pay for their wives, yet dower is given in some
cases. Sargon gave Cilicia as a dowry with his daughter when he married
her to Ambris king of Tubal: and the Persian kings seem generally to
have given satrapial or other high offices as dowries to the husbands of
their daughters.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 9:17</span></span>

Beth-horon the nether - See the marginal reference note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 9:18</span></span>

Tadmor - The Hebrew text here has, as written, Tamor (or Tamar), and as
read, Tadmor. That the latter place, or Palmyra, was meant appears,
first, from the distinct statement of Chronicles [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004) that Solomon built Tadmor, and the
improbability that the fact would be omitted in Kings; secondly, from
the strong likelihood that Solomon, with his wide views of commerce,
would seize and fortify the Palmy-rene Oasis: and thirdly, from the
unanimity of the old versions in rendering Tamar here by Tadmor. The
probability seems to be that Tamar was the original name of the place,
being the Hebrew word for "a palm," from where it is generally agreed
that the town derived its name. Tadmor was a corrupt or dialectic
variety of the word, which was adopted at the city itself, and prevailed
over the original appellation. No reference is found to Tadmor in the
Assyrian inscriptions, or in any Classical writer before Pliny.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 9:19</span></span>

"The cities of store" contained provisions stored up for the troops
(compare [Ch2 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028)). They seem to
have been chiefly in the north - in Hamath [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004) and Naphtali [Ch2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004). On the "cities for his
chariots," see [Kg1 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026) note.

By "that which Solomon desired to build" (see the margin) seem to be
intended "pleasaunces" in or near the capital, and in the Lebanon range,
built especially for the enjoyment of the king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 9:21</span></span>

See [Kg1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015) note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 9:22</span></span>

Comparing this with [Kg1 5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013), it
would seem that a modified service of forced labor for one-third of each
year was not regarded as reducing those who were subject to it to the
condition of bondmen.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 9:23</span></span>

Five hundred and fifty - See [Kg1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016)
note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 9:24</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Solomon was not satisfied that Pharaoh's
daughter should remain in the palace of David, which was on Mount Zion,
in the immediate vicinity of the temple, because he regarded the whole
vicinity of the temple as made holy by the presence of the ark of God.
His own palace was on the other (western) hill, probably directly
opposite to the temple, the valley of the Tyropoeum running between
them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 9:25</span></span>

Three times - i. e., (see the marginal reference) the three solemn
Feasts - the Feast of unleavened bread, the Feast of weeks, and the
Feast of tabernacles.

Did Solomon offer ... and he burnt incense - Not with his own hand, but
by his priests [Kg1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#006); [Ch2
5:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#007). In sacred, as in ordinary,
history, men are said to do that which they cause to be done.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 9:26</span></span>

On Ezion-geber and Eloth, see the notes to marginal references. As the
entire tract about Elath (Akaba) is destitute of trees, it is
conjectured that the wood of which Solomon built his fleet was cut in
Lebanon, floated to Gaza by sea, and thence conveyed across to
Ezion-geber, at the head of the E anitic Gulf, by land carriage.
(Compare [Ch2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016).)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 9:27</span></span>

Shipmen - See [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006) note. With
respect to the acquaintance of the Phoenicians with this particular sea,
it may be observed that they are not unlikely to have had trading
settlements there, as they had in the Persian Gulf, even at this early
period. The commerce with Ophir was probably an established trade,
previously either in their hands or in those of the Egyptians, when
Solomon determined to have a share in it. The Egyptians had navigated
the other arm of the Red Sea, and perhaps its lower parts, from a much
more ancient period.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 9:28</span></span>

On Ophir, see the marginal reference note. Among the various opinions
three predominate; all moderns, except a very few, being in favor of
Arabia, India, or Eastern Africa. Arabia's claims are supported by the
greatest number.
