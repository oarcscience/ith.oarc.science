### [Nehemiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 10:1</span></span>

The "Zidkijah" of this passage is probably the same as "Zadok" [Neh
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#013.md). "Zadok" is expressly called
"the scribe," and it was probably as the scribe who drew up the document
that "Zidkijah" signed it immediately after Nehemiah.

[Nehemiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 10:2</span></span>

The names are not personal, but designate families. The seal of the
high-priestly house of Seraiah was probably appended either by Ezra or
Eliashib, both of whom belonged to it.

[Nehemiah 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 10:31</span></span>

Bring ware ... on the sabbath day - Compare [Neh
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#016.md), where this desecration of the
Sabbath is shown to have commonly taken place.

Leave the seventh year ... - i. e., "let the land rest in the sabbatical
year" (margin reference) and give up the "pledge-taking" [Neh
10:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#002.md).

[Nehemiah 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 10:32</span></span>

The third part of a sheckel - This appears to have been the first
occasion on which an annual payment toward the maintenance of the temple
service and fabric was established. The half-shekel of the Law [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md) was paid only at the time of a
census (which rarely took place), and was thus not a recurring tax. In
later times, the annual payment was raised from the third of a shekel to
half a shekel [Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024.md).

[Nehemiah 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">neh 10:34</span></span>

No special provision was made by the Law, by David, or by Solomon, for
the supply of wood necessary to keep fire ever burning upon the altar.
Nehemiah established a system by which the duty of supplying the wood
was laid as a burden in turn on the various clans or families, which
were regarded as constituting the nation. The lot was used to determine
the order in which the several families should perform the duty. A
special day (the 14th of the fifth month, according to Josephus) was
appointed for the bringing in of the supply; and this day was after a
time regarded as a high festival, and called "the feast of the
wood-offering."
