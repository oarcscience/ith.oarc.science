### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 19:0</span></span>

The present prophecy Jer. 19-20 is to be taken in close connection with
the preceding. Jeremiah chooses a vessel baked in the fire, and
therefore incapable of being re-shaped (compare [Jer
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md), note; [Jer
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006), note.md). It is the symbol of the
obdurate, of those who have taken their final form [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011.md). In solemn procession he must
bear the vessel out to the place of doom, the valley of Gehenna. There
he was to break the vessel; and just as all the art of the potter would
be of no avail to restore the broken fragments, so did God proclaim the
final destruction of Jerusalem such as it then was, and of that
generation which inhabited it.

[Jeremiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 19:1</span></span>

Get (i. e., purchase) a potter's earthen bottle - The "bottle" was a
flask with a long neck, and took its name from the noise made by liquids
in running out.

The ancients - These "elders" were the regularly constituted
representatives of the people (see [Jer
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md); [Num
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016).md), and the organization lasted
down to our Saviour's time [Mat 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md).
Similarly the priests had also their representatives [Kg2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md). Accompanied thus by the
representatives of Church and State, the prophet was to carry the
earthen bottle, the symbol of their mean origin and frail existence,
outside the walls of Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 19:2</span></span>

The valley ... - See [Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md) note.

The east gate - Others render "the pottery gate." Two gates led into the
valley of Hinnom, the Fountain-gate at the southeast corner, and the
Dung-gate on the southwest side of Zion; some think that "the east gate"
was neither of these, but a small or postern gate, used for throwing out
rubbish, the valley having been put to this degrading use from the time
that Josiah defiled it [Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010.md). And
thus the mean symbol of a proud nation was carried out through a back
door to be broken upon the heaps of refuse already cast there.

[Jeremiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 19:3</span></span>

Kings - Plural because the message [Jer
19:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#003.md), related not especially to the
reigning king, but to the whole royal house.

[Jeremiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 19:4</span></span>

Have estranged this place - They have not recognized the sanctity of
this place, but have treated it as a strange place, by worshipping in it
strange gods.

Innocents - i. e., guiltless persons.

[Jeremiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 19:7</span></span>

Make void - The verb used here is that from which "bottle" [Jer
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md) is derived, and as it represents
the sound made by the water running out, it would be better translated,
"pour out." Jeremiah perhaps carried the bottle to Tophet full of water,
the symbol in the East of life [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md), and at these words emptied it
before the assembled elders.

[Jeremiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 19:11</span></span>

Made whole again - literally, "healed." In this lies the distinction
between this symbol and that of [Jer
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004.md). The plastic clay can be shaped
and re-shaped until the potter forms with it the vessel he had
predetermined: the broken bottle is of no further use, but its fragments
are cast away forever upon the heaps of rubbish deposited in Tophet.

[Jeremiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 19:13</span></span>

Because of all - literally, "with reference to all," limiting the
denunciation to those houses whose roofs had been defiled with altars.

Upon whose roofs they have burned incense - See [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md), note.

[Jeremiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 19:14</span></span>

Since it was this repetition of the prophecy in the temple which so
greatly irritated Pashur, these two verses ought to be joined to the
next chapter.
