### [Isaiah Chapter 63](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 63:0</span></span>

This chapter and the following relate to the same general subject, and
should not have been separated. The subject with which they are
introduced is the destruction of the enemies of God [Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md), and this is followed by tender
expressions of confidence in Yahweh, and by earnest supplications, on
the part of his people, that he would interpose in their behalf. The
prophet sees in vision a magnificent conqueror, stained with the blood
of his enemies, returning from Edom, and from its capital Bozrah - a
warrior flushed with victory, unsubdued, unweakened, and coming with the
pride and stateliness of conquest. Who he is, is the object of inquiry;
and the answer is, that he is a great and holy deliverer. Why his
gorgeous robes are thus polluted with blood, becomes also a question of
intense anxiety. The reply of the conqueror is, that he has been forth
to subdue mighty foes; that he went alone; that there was none that
could aid; and that he had trodden them down as a treader of grapes
treads in the wine-press. The whole image here is that of a triumphant,
blood-stained warrior, returning from the conquest of Idumea.

Who is referred to here has been a question in which interpreters have
greatly differed in opinion. The following are some of the opinions
which have been expressed.

1\. Some have referred it to Judas Maccabeus. This was the opinion of
Grotius, who supposed that it was designed to represent his conquest of
Idumea (1 Macc. 5:1-5; Jos. Ant. xii. 8. 1). But against this
interpretation there are insuperable objections.

\(1\) The attributes of the person here referred to do not agree with
him. How could he announce that he was the proclaimer of righteousness
and was mighty to save?

\(2\) The exploits of Judas Maccabeus were not such as to justify the
language which the prophet here uses. He overcame the Idumeans, and
killed twenty thousand men, but this event is by no means adequate to
the lofty prediction of the prophet.

\(3\) There is another objection suggested by Lowth to this supposition.
It is that the Idumea of the time of Isaiah was quite a different
country from that which was laid waste by Judas. In the time of Isaiah,
Idumea was known as the country south of Palestine, whose capital at one
time was Petra, and at another Bozrah. But during the captivity in
Babylon, the Nabatheans invaded and conquered the southern part of
Judea, and took possession of a great part of what was the territory of
the tribe of Judah, and made Hebron the capital. This was the Idumea
known in later times, and this was the Idumea that Judas Maccabeus
conquered (1 Macc. 5:65).

2\. One writer, referred to by Poole (Synopsis); supposes that the
allusion is to Michael, who came to assist Daniel against the Prince of
the kingdom of Persia [Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md).

3\. Others have referred it to Yahweh subduing his enemies, and
restoring safety to his people. This is the opinion of Calvin, Piscator,
Junius, Noyes, and Gesenius.

4\. The mass of interpreters have referred it to the Messiah. This is
the opinion, among the ancients, of Origen, Jerome, Cyril, Eusebius, and
Procopius; and among the moderns, of Lowth, Cocceius - of course,
Calovius, etc. But to this opinion Calvin makes the following weighty
objection; 'Christians,' says he, 'have violently distorted this passage
by referring it to Christ, when the prophet simply makes an announcement
respecting God. And they have reigned that Christ was red because he was
covered with his own blood, which he poured out on the cross. But the
simple sense is, that the Lord here goes forth in the sight of his
people with red garments, that all might understand that he was their
vindicator and avenger' - (Commentary in loc.). The objections to an
immediate and direct application to Christ, seem to me to be
insuperable.

\(1\) There is no reference to it in the New Testament as applicable to
him.

\(2\) The blood with which the hero was stained, was not his own blood,
but that of his foes; consequently all the applications of the words and
phrases here to the Messiah as stained with his own blood are misplaced.

\(3\) The whole image of the prophet is that of a triumphant warrior,
returning from conquest, himself unharmed and unwounded, not that of a
meek and patient sufferer such as the Messiah. It is, therefore, not
without the greatest perversion that it can be referred to the Messiah,
nor should it be so employed. (These objections against the application
of the passage to the Messiah, seem to be fatal only to one aspect of
it, namely, that which presents the Messiah as stained with his own
blood; but though the warrior here very clearly appears stained with the
blood of others, not his own, but the blood of vanquished foes, still
that warrior may be the Messiah, and this one of the numerous passages
in which he is represented as a victorious conqueror [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md); [Rev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002.md); [Rev
19:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md). The beautiful accommodation
of the language in the third verse to the sufferings of Christ, seems to
have led to the forced application of the whole passage to the
Redeemer's passion. It certainly refers, however, to a conquering, not a
suffering, Messiah. Alexander supposes the conqueror to be Yahweh, or
the Messiah; Henderson, the divine Logos, the Angel or Messenger of the
divine presence, who acted as the Protector and Saviour of ancient
Israel. Edom is generally taken as the type of the enemies of Israel, or
of the church; and this prophecy announces their overthrow - E. D.)

5\. Vitringa supposes that there is described under the emblem used
here, the final and peremptory manner with which the Messiah, the
vindicator and avenger of his people, will take severe vengeance, with
the shedding of much blood, on the princes, people, subjects, and
patrons of idolatrous and apostate Rome; that the true church on the
earth would be reduced to extremities; would be destitute of protectors;
and that the Messiah would interpose and by his own power destroy the
foes of his people.

The whole passage [Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md) has a
striking resemblance to Isa. 34, where the prophet predicts the
overthrow of Idumea, and the long desolations that would come upon that
country and people, and probably the same idea is intended to be
conveyed by this which was by that - that all the enemies of the Jews
would be destroyed (see the Analysis to [Isa
39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001), and the note at that chapter.md).
It is to be remembered that Idumea was a formidable foe to the Jews;
that there had been frequent wars between them; and especially that they
had greatly provoked the anger of the Hebrews, and deserved the severest
divine vengeance for uniting with the Chaldeans when they took
Jerusalem, and for urging them to raze it to its foundation [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md). On these accounts, Idumea was
to he destroyed. Vengeance was to be taken on this foe; and the
destruction of ldumea became a kind of Fledge and emblem of the
destruction of all the enemies of the people of God. Thus it is used
here; and the prophet sees in vision Yahweh returning in triumph from
the complete overthrow of the capital of that nation, and the entire
destruction of the inhabitants. He sees the mighty warrior return from
the conquest; his raiment stained with blood; and he inquires who he is,
and receives for answer that he has been alone to the conquest of the
foes of his people. The idea is, that all those foes would be destroyed,
and that it would be done by the power of God alone. The chapter,
therefore, I do not regard as immediately referring to the Messiah, but
to Yahweh, and to his solemn purpose to destroy the enemies of his
people, and to effect their complete deliverance. It may be further
remarked that the portion in [Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md), is a responsive song; a
species of composition common in the Bible (see [Psa
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); [Psa
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md); [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006).md).

The two chapters Isa. 63; [Isa 64:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)
may be divided into three parts.

I. The destruction of Edom [Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md).

1\. The view of the conquering hero coming from Bozrah, and the inquiry
by the people who he is ([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md),
first part). He comes with dyed garments, yet glorious, and with the
state and air of a conqueror.

2\. The response of Yahweh the conqueror, that it was he who was mighty
to save ([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001), last part.md).

3\. The inquiry of the people why he was thus red in his apparel, as if
he had been treading in the wine-press [Isa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md).

4\. The answer of Yahweh [Isa 63:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md).

\(1\) He had indeed trod the Wine-press, and he had done it alone. He
had trod down the people in his anger, and their blood had been
sprinkled on lids raiment.

\(2\) The day of his vengeance had arrived, and the year of his redeemed
had come.

\(3\) No one had been able to do it, and he had gone forth alone, and
had trod down their strength in his fury.

II\. A hymn of thanksgiving in view of the deliverance performed, and of
the many mercies conferred on Israel [Isa
63:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md).

1\. A general acknowledgment of his mercy [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md).

2\. His choice of them as his people [Isa
63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008.md).

3\. His sympathy for them in all their trials [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md).

4\. His kindness and compassion, illustrated by a reference to his
leading them through the wilderness, notwithstanding their ingratitude
and sin [Isa 63:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md).

III\. An earnest supplication in view of the condition of Israel [Isa
63:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md); [Isa
64:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md). The arguments are very
beautiful and various for his interposition.

1\. An appeal to Yahweh in view of his former mercies [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md).

2\. An argument from the fact that he was their Father, though they
should be disowned and despised by all others [Isa
63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016.md).

3\. Earnest intercession from the fact that his enemies had trodden down
the sanctuary, and that those who never acknowledged him, ruled in the
land that he had given to his own people [Isa
63:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md).

4\. An earnest pleading with God, in view of the inestimable value of
the favors which he conferred - the fact that there was nothing so much
to be desired, that the world could confer nothing that was to be
compared with his favor [Isa 64:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md).

5\. An argument derived from the general prevalence of irreligion among
the people [Isa 64:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md).

6\. Tender and affectionate pleading from the fact that they were his
people [Isa 64:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md).

7\. A tender and affectionate argument from the fact that the holy city
was waste; the temple in ruins; and the beautiful house where their
fathers worshipped had been burned up with fire [Isa
64:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md).

This last passage [Isa 64:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md),
proves that the scene of this prayer and vision is laid in Babylon. The
time is after Jerusalem had been destroyed, the temple fired, and their
sacred things transported; after Edom had joined with the Chaldeans in
demanding the entire destruction of the city and temple, and had urged
them on to the work of destruction [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md); after the Idumeans had invaded
the territories of Judea, and established a kingdom there. In their
exile they are represented as calling upon God, and they are assured
that the kingdom of their enemies would be wholly destroyed.

[Isaiah 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 63:1</span></span>

Who is this - The language of the people who see Yahweh returning as a
triumphant conqueror from Idumea. Struck with his stately bearing as a
warrior; with his gorgeous apparel; and with the blood on his raiment,
they ask who he could be? This is a striking instance of the bold and
abrupt manner of Isaiah. He does not describe him as going forth to war
nor the preparation for battle; nor the battle itself, nor the conquests
of cities and armies; but he introduces at once the returning conqueror
having gained the victory - here represented as a solitary warrior,
moving along with majestic gait from Idumea to his own capital,
Jerusalem. Yahweh is not unfrequently represented as a warrior (see the
notes at [Isa 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013).md).

From Edom - On the situation of Edom, and for the reasons of the
animosity between that country and Judea, see the Aanlysis to Isa. 34.

With dyed garments - That is, with garments dyed in blood. The word
rendered here 'dyed' ( חמוּץ châmûts), is derived from חמץ châmats, to
be sharp and pungent, and is usually applied to anything that is sharp
or sour. It is applied to color that is bright or dazzling, in the same
manner as the Greeks use the phrase χρῶμα ὀξύ chrōma oxu - a sharp color
- applied to purple or scarlet. Thus the phrase πορφύραι ὀξύταται
porphurai oxutatai means a brilliant, bright purple (see Bochart,
Hieroz. i. 2. 7). It is applied to the military cloak which was worn by
a warrior, and may denote here either that it was originally dyed of a
scarlet color, or more probably that it was made red by the blood that
had been sprinkled on it. Thus in [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md), the Son of God is represented
as clothed in a similar manner: 'And he was clothed with a vesture
dipped in blood.' In [Isa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md), the
answer of Yahweh to the inquiry why his raiment was red, shows that the
color was to be attributed to blood.

From Bozrah - On the situation of Bozrah, see the notes at [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md). It was for a time the principal
city of Idumea, though properly lying within the boundaries of Moab. In
[Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), Yahweh is represented as
having 'a great sacrifice in Bozrah;' here he is seen as having come
from it with his garments red with blood.

This that is glorious in his apparel - Margin, 'Decked.' The Hebrew word
(הדוּר hâdûr) means "adorned, honorable, or glorious." The idea is, that
his military apparel was gorgeous and magnificent - the apparel of an
ancient warrior of high rank.

Traveling in the greatness of his strength - Noyes renders this, 'Proud
in the greatness of his strength,' in accordance with the signification
given by Gesenius. The word used here (צעה tsâ‛âh) means properly "to
turn to one side, to incline, to be bent, bowed down as a captive in
bonds" [Isa 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014.md); then "to bend or
toss back the head as an indication of pride" (Gesenius). According to
Taylor (Concord.) the word has 'relation to the actions, the superb mien
or manner of a triumphant warrior returning from battle, in which he has
got a complete victory over his enemies. And it may include the pomp and
high spirit with which he drives before him the prisoners which he has
taken.' It occurs only in this place and in [Isa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014.md); [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012.md). The Septuagint omits it in
their translation. The sense is doubtless that Yahweh is seen returning
with the tread of a triumphant conqueror, flushed with victor, and
entirely successful in having destroyed his foes. There is no evidence,
however, as Taylor supposes, that he is driving his prisoners before
him, for he is seen alone, having destroyed all his foes.

I that speak in righteousness - The answer of the advancing conqueror.
The sense is, 'It is I, Yahweh, who have promised to deliver my people
and to destroy their enemies, and who have now returned from
accomplishing my purpose.' The assurance that he speaks in
righteousness, refers here to the promises which he had made that be
would rescue and save them.

Mighty to save - The sentiment is, that the fact that he destroys the
foes of his people is an argument that he can save those who put their
trust in him. The same power that destroys a sinner may save a saint;
and the destruction of a sinner may be the means of the salvation of his
own people.

[Isaiah 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 63:2</span></span>

Wherefore art thou red? - The inquiry of the people. Whence is it that
that gorgeous apparel is stained with blood?

And thy garment like him that treadeth in the wine-fat? - Or rather the
'wine-press.' The word used here (גת gath) means the place where the
grapes were placed to be trodden with the feet, and from which the juice
would flow off into a vat or receptacle. Of course the juice of the
grape would stain the raiment of him who was employed in this business,
and would give him the appearance of being covered with blood. 'The
manner of pressing grapes,' says Burder, 'is as follows: having placed
them in a hogshead, a man with naked feet gets in and tread the grapes;
in about an hour's time the juice is forced out; he then turns the
lowest grapes uppermost, and tread them for about a quarter of an hour
longer; this is sufficient to squeeze the good juice out of them, for an
additional pressure would even crush the unripe grapes and give the
whole a disagreeable flavor.' The following statement of I. D. Paxton,
in a letter from Beyrout, March 1, 1838, will show how the modern custom
accords with that in the time of Isaiah: 'They have a large row of stone
vats in which the grapes are thrown, and beside these are placed stone
troughs, into which the juice flows. People get in and tread the grapes
with their feet. It is hard work, and their clothes are often stained
with the Juice. The figures found in Scripture taken from this are true
to the life.' This method was also employed in Egypt. The presses there,
as represented on some of the paintings at Thebes, consisted of two
parts; the lower portion or vat, and the trough where the men with naked
feet trod the fruit, supporting themselves by ropes suspended from the
roof (see Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, ii, 155). Vitringa also notices
the same custom.

Huc, pater O Lenae, veni; nudataque musto

Tinge nero mecum direptis crura cothurnis.

Georg. ii. 7, 8

This comparison is also beautifully used by John, [Rev
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md) : 'And the angel thrust in
his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast
it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God. And the wine-press was
trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press even unto
the horses' bridles.' And in [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md), 'And he treadeth the wine-press
of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.' The comparison of blood
to wine is not uncommon. Thus in [Deu
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md), 'And thou didst drink the pure
blood of the grape.' Calvin supposes that allusion is here made to the
wine-press, because the country around Bozrah abounded with grapes.

[Isaiah 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 63:3</span></span>

I have trodden the wine-press alone - I, Yahweh, have indeed trod the
wine-press of my wrath, and I have done it alone (compare the notes at
[Isa 34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005).md). The idea here is, that
he had completely destroyed his foes in Idumea, and had done it by a
great slaughter.

For I will tread - Or rather, I trod them. It refers to what he had
done; or what was then past.

And their blood shall be sprinkled - Or rather, their blood was
sprinkled. The word used here (נצח nētsach) does not commonly mean
blood; but splendor, glory, purity, truth, perpetuity, eternity.
Gesenius derives the word, as used here, from an Arabic word meaning to
sprinkle, to scatter; and hence, the juice or liquor of the grape as it
is sprinkled or spirted from grapes when trodden. There is no doubt here
that it refers to blood - though with the idea of its being spirted out
by treading down a foe.

And I will stain all my raiment - I have stained all my raiment -
referring to the fact that the slaughter was extensive and entire. On
the extent of the slaughter, see the notes at [Isa
34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), [Isa
34:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md).

[Isaiah 63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 63:4</span></span>

For the day of vengeance - (See the notes at [Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008).md).

And the year of my redeemed is come - The year when my people are to be
redeemed. It is a year when their foes are all to be destroyed, and when
their entire liberty is to be effected.

[Isaiah 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 63:5</span></span>

And I looked and there was none to help - The same sentiment is
expressed in [Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md) (see the note
at that verse).

None to uphold - None to sustain or assist. The design is to express the
fact that he was entirely alone in this work: that none were disposed or
able to assist him. Though this has no direct reference to the plan of
salvation, or to the work of the Messiah as a Redeemer, yet it is true
of him also that in that work he stood alone. No one did aid him or
could aid him; but alone he 'bore the burden of the world's atonement.'

My fury, it upheld me - My determined purpose to inflict punishment on
my foes sustained me. There is a reference doubtless to the fact that
courage nerves the arm and sustains a man in deadly conflict; that a
purpose to take vengeance, or to inflict deserved punishment, animates
one to make efforts which he could not otherwise perform. In [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md), the sentiment is, 'his
righteousness sustained him;' here it is that his fury did it. There the
purpose was to bring salvation; here it was to destroy his foes.

[Isaiah 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 63:6</span></span>

And I will tread them down - Or rather, 'I did tread them down.' The
allusion here is to a warrior who tramples on his foes and treads them
in the dust (see the notes at [Isa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010).md).

And made them drunk - That is, I made them reel and fall under my fury
like a drunken man. In describing the destruction of Idumea in [Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md), Yahweh says that his sword was
made drunk, or that it rushed intoxicated from heaven. See the notes on
that verse. But here he says that the people, under the terrors of his
wrath, lost their power of self-command, and fell to the earth like an
intoxicated man. Kimchi says that the idea is, that Yahweh extended the
cup of his wrath for them to drink until they became intoxicated and
fell. An image of this kind is several times used in the Scriptures (see
the notes at [Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); compare [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008).md). Lowth and Noyes render this, 'I
crushed them.' The reason of this change is, that according to
Kennicott, twenty-seven manuscripts (three of them ancient) instead of
the present Hebrew reading ואשׁכרם va'ăshakerēm, 'And I will make them
drunk,' read ואשׁברם va'ăshaberēm, 'I will break or crush them.' Such a
change, it is true, might easily have been made from the similarity of
the Hebrew letters, כ (k) and ב (b). But the authority for the change
does not seem to me to be sufficient, nor is it necessary. The image of
making them stagger and fall like a drunken man, is more poetic than the
other, and is in entire accordance with the usual manner of writing by
the sacred penman. The Chaldee renders it, 'I cast to the lowest earth
the slain of their strong ones.'

And I will bring down their strength - I subdued their strong places,
and their mighty armies. Such is the sense giver, to the passage by our
translators. But Lowth and Noyes render it, more correctly, 'I spilled
their life-blood upon the ground.' The word which our translators have
rendered 'strength' (נצח nētsach), is the same word which is used in
[Isa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md), and which is rendered there
'blood' (see the note at that verse). It is probably used in the same
sense here, and means that Yahweh had brought their blood to the earth;
that is, he had spilled it upon the ground. So the Septuagint renders
it, 'I shed their blood (κατήγαγον τὸ αίμα katēgagon to haima) upon the
earth.' This finishes the vision of the mighty conqueror returning from
Edom. The following verse introduces a new subject. The sentiment in the
passage is, that Yahweh by his own power, and by the might of his own
arm, would subdue all his foes and redeem his people. Edom in its
hostility to his people, the apt emblem of all his foes, would be
completely humbled; and in its subjugation there would be the emblem and
the pledge that all his enemies would be destroyed, and that his own
church would be safe. See the notes at Isa. 34; [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 63:7</span></span>

I will mention - This is evidently the language of the people
celebrating the praises of God in view of all his mercies in former
days. See the analysis to the chapter. The design of what follows, to
the close of [Isa 64:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md), is to
implore the mercy of God in view of their depressed and ruined
condition. They are represented as suffering under the infliction of
long and continued ills; as cast out and driven to a distant land; as
deprived of their former privileges, and as having been long subjected
to great evils. Their temple is destroyed; their city desolate; and
their whole nation afflicted and oppressed. The time is probably near
the close of the captivity; though Lowth supposes that it refers to the
Jews as scattered over all lands, and driven away from the country of
their fathers. They begin their petitions in this verse with
acknowledging God's great mercies to their fathers and to their nation;
then they confess their own disobedience, and supplicate, by various
arguments, the divine mercy and favor. The Chaldee commences the verse
thus, 'The prophet said, I will remember the mercy of the Lord.' But it
is the language of the people, not that of the prophet. The word
rendered 'mention' (אזכיר 'azekiyr), means properly, I will cause to
remember, or to be remembered (see the notes at [Isa
62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md).

And the praises of the Lord - That is, I will recount the deeds which
show that he is worthy of thanksgiving. The repetitions in this verse
are designed to be emphatic; and the meaning of the whole is, that
Yahweh had given them abundant cause of praise, notwithstanding the
evils which they endured.

[Isaiah 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 63:8</span></span>

For he said - Yahweh had said. That is, he said this when he chose them
as his unique people, and entered into solemn covenant with them.

Surely they are my people - The reference here is to the fact that he
entered into covenant with them to be their God.

Children that will not lie - That will not prove false to me -
indicating the reasonable expectation which Yahweh might have, when he
chose them, that they would be faithful to him.

So he was their Saviour - Lowth renders this, 'And he became their
Saviour in all their distress;' connecting this with the first member of
the following verse, and translating that, 'it was not an envoy, nor an
angel of his presence that saved them.' So the Septuagint renders it,
'And he was to them for salvation εἰς σωτηρίαν eis sōtērian) from all
their affliction.' The Chaldee render it, 'And his word was redemption
(פריק pâriyq) unto them.' But the true idea probably is, that he chose
them, and in virtue of his thus choosing them he became their deliverer.

[Isaiah 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 63:9</span></span>

In all their affliction he was afflicted - This is a most beautiful
sentiment, meaning that God sympathized with them in all their trials,
and that he was ever ready to aid them. This sentiment accords well with
the connection; but there has been some doubt whether this is the
meaning of the Hebrew. Lowth renders it, as has been already remarked,
'It was not an envoy, nor an angel of his presence that saved him.'
Noyes, 'In all their straits they had no distress.' TheSeptuagint
renders it, 'It was not an ambassador (ου ̓ πρέσβυς ou presbus), nor an
angel (οὐδὲ ἄγγελος oude angelos), but he himself saved them.' Instead
of the present Hebrew word (צר tsâr, 'affliction'), they evidently read
it, ציר tsiyr, 'a messenger.' The Chaldee renders it, 'Every time when
they sinned against him, so that he might have brought upon them
tribulation, he did not afflict them.' The Syriac, 'In all their
calamities he did not afflict them.' This variety of translation has
arisen from an uncertainty or ambiguity in the Hebrew text.

Instead of the present reading (לא lo', 'not') about an equal number of
manuscripts read לו lô, 'to him,' by the change of a single letter.
According to the former reading, the sense would be, 'in all their
affliction, there was no distress,' that is, they were so comforted and
supported by God, that they did not feel the force of the burden.
According to the other mode of reading it, the sense would be, 'in all
their affliction, there was affliction to him;' that is, he sympathized
with them, and upheld them. Either reading makes good sense, and it is
impossible now to ascertain which is correct. Gesenius supposes it to
mean, 'In all their afflictions there would be actually no trouble to
them. God sustained them, and the angel of of his presence supported and
delivered them.' For a fuller view of the passage, see Rosenmuller. In
the uncertainty and doubt in regard to the true reading of the Hebrew,
the proper way is not to attempt to change the translation in our common
version. It expresses an exceedingly interesting truth, and one that is
suited to comfort the people of God; - that he is never unmindful of
their sufferings; that he feels deeply when they are afflicted; and that
he hastens to their relief. It is an idea which occurs everywhere in the
Bible, that God is not a cold, distant, abstract being; but that he
takes the deepest interest in human affairs, and especially that he has
a tender solicitude in all the trials of his people.

And the angel of his presence saved them - This angel, called 'the angel
of the presence of God,' is frequently mentioned as having conducted the
children of Israel through the wilderness, and as having interposed to
save them [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md), [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031.md); [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); [Exo
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md); [Num
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md). The phrase, 'the angel of his
presence,' (Hebrew, פניו מלאך פ male'âk pânâyv, 'angel of his face,' or
'countenance'), means an angel that stands in his presence, and that
enjoys his favor, as a man does who stands before a prince, or who is
admitted constantly to his presence (compare [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029).md). Evidently there is reference
here to an angel of superior order or rank, but to whom has been a
matter of doubt with interpreters. Jarchi supposes that it was Michael,
mentioned in [Dan 10:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md). The
Chaldee renders it, 'The angel sent (שׁליח shelı̂yach) from his
presence.' Most Christian interpreters have supposed that the reference
is to the Messiah, as the manifested guide and defender of the children
of Israel during their long journey in the desert. This is not the place
to go into a theological examination of that question. The sense of the
Hebrew here is, that it was a messenger sent from the immediate presence
of God, and therefore of elevated rank. The opinion that it was the Son
of God is one that can be sustained by arguments that are not easily
refuted. On the subject of angels, according to the Scripture doctrine,
the reader may consult with advantage an article by Dr. Lewis Mayer, in
the Bib. Rep., Oct. 1388.

He redeemed them - (See the notes at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

And he bare them - As a shepherd carries the lambs of the flock, or as a
nurse carries her children; or still more probably, as an eagle bears
her young on her wings [Deu 32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md).
The idea is, that he conducted them through all their trials in the
wilderness, and led them in safety to the promised land (compare the
notes at [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md).

All the days of old - In all their former history. He has been with them
and protected them in all their trials.

[Isaiah 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 63:10</span></span>

But they rebelled - Against God. This charge is often made against the
Jews; and indeed their history is little more than a record of a series
of rebellions against God.

And vexed - Or rather 'grieved.' The Hebrew word עצב ‛âtsab, in Piel,
means to pain, to afflict, to grieve. This is the idea here. Their
conduct was such as was suited to produce the deepest pain - for there
is nothing which we more deeply feel than the ingratitude of those who
have been benefited by us. Our translators have supposed that the word
conveyed the idea of provoking to wrath by their conduct (thus the
Septuagint renders it παρώξυναν τὸ πνεύμα, κ.τ.λ. parōxunan to pneuma,
etc.; but the more appropriate sense is, that their conduct was such as
to produce pain or grief. Compare [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md) : 'Grieve not (μὴ λυπεῖτε mē
lupeite) the Holy Spirit.' [Psa 78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md);
[Psa 95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md). [Heb
3:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md).

His Holy Spirit - The Chaldee renders this, 'But they were unwilling to
obey, and they irritated (provoked, blasphemed רגז râgaz) against the
words of the prophets.' But the reference seems rather to be to the
Spirit of God that renewed, comforted, enlightened, and sanctified them.
Grotius, Rosenmuller, and Gesenius, suppose that this means God himself
- a Spirit of holiness. But, with the revelation of the New Testament
before us, we cannot well doubt that the real reference here is to the
third person of the Trinity - the renewer and sanctifier of the people
of God. It may be admitted, perhaps, that the ancient Hebrews would
refer this to God himself, and that their views of the offices of the
different persons in the divine nature were not very clearly marked, or
very distinct. But this does not prove that the real reference may not
have been to 'the Holy Spirit.' The renewer and sanctifier of the human
heart at all times has been the same.

And when any operations of the mind and heart pertaining to salvation
are referred to in the Old Testament, nothing should forbid us to apply
to the explanation of the expressions and the facts, the clear light
which we have in the New Testament - in the same way as when the
ancients speak of phenomena in the physical world, we deem it not
improper to apply to the explanation of them the established doctrines
which we now have in the physical sciences. By this we by no means
design to say that the ancients had the same knowledge which we have, or
that the language which they used conveyed the same idea to them which
it now does to us, but that the events occurred in accordance with the
laws which we now understand, and that the language may be explained by
the light of modern science. Thus the word eclipse conveyed to them a
somewhat different idea from what it does to us. They supposed it was
produced by different causes. Still they described accurately the facts
in the case; and to the explanation of those facts we are permitted now
to apply the principles of modern science. So the Old Testament
describes facts occurring under the influence of truth. The facts were
clearly understood. What shall hinder us, in explaining them, from
applying the clearer light of the New Testament? Admitting this obvious
principle, I suppose that the reference here was really to the third
person of the Trinity; and that the sense is, that their conduct was
such as was suited to cause grief to their Sanctifier and Comforter, in
the same way as it is said in the New Testament that this is done now.

He was turned - He abandoned them for their sins, and left them to reap
the consequences.

And he fought against them - He favored their enemies and gave them the
victory. He gave them up to a series of disasters which finally
terminated in their long and painful captivity, and in the destruction
of their temple, city, and nation. The sentiment is, that when we grieve
the Spirit of God, he abandons us to our chosen course, and leaves us to
a series of spiritual and temporal disasters.

[Isaiah 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 63:11</span></span>

Then he remembered - He did not forget his solemn premises to be their
protector and their God. For their crimes they were subjected to
punishment, but God did not forget that they were his people, nor that
he had entered into covenant with them. The object of this part of the
petition seems to be, to recall the fact that in former times God had
never wholly forsaken them, and to plead that the same thing might occur
now. Even in the darkest days of adversity, God still remembered his
promises, and interposed to save them. Such they trusted it would be
still.

Moses and his people - Lowth renders this, 'Moses his servant,'
supposing that a change had occurred in the Hebrew text. It would be
natural indeed to suppose that the word 'servant' would occur here (see
the Hebrew), but the authority is not sufficient for the change. The
idea seems to be that which is in our translation, and which is approved
by Vitringa and Gesenius. 'He recalled the ancient days when he led
Moses and his people through the sea and the wilderness.'

Where is he - The Chaldee renders this, 'Lest they should say, Where is
he?' that is, lest surrounding nations should ask in contempt and scorn,
Where is the protector of the people, who defended them in other times?
According to this, the sense is that God remembered the times of Moses
and interposed, lest his not doing it should bring reproach upon his
name and cause. Lowth renders it, 'How he brought them up;' that is, he
recollected his former interposition. But the true idea is that of one
asking a question. 'Where now is the God that formerly appeared for
their aid? And though it is the language of God himself, yet it
indicates that state of mind which arises when the question is asked,
Where is now the former protector and God of the people?

That brought them up out of the sea - The Red Sea, when he delivered
them from Egypt. This fact is the subject of a constant reference in the
Scriptures, when the sacred writers would illustrate the goodness of God
in any great and signal deliverance.

With the shepherd of his flock - Margin, 'Shepherds.' Lowth and Noyes
render this in the singular, supposing it to refer to Moses. The
Septuagint, Chaldee, and Syriac, also read it in the singular. The
Hebrew is in the plural (רעי ro‛ēy), though some manuscripts read it in
the singular. If it is to be read in the plural, as the great majority
of manuscripts read it, it probably refers to Moses and Aaron as the
shepherds or guides of the people. Or it may also include others,
meaning that Yahweh led up the people with all their rulers and guides.

Where is he that put his Holy Spirit within him? - (see the notes at
[Isa 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010).md). Hebrew, בקרבו beqirebô -
'In the midst of him,' that is, in the midst of the people or the flock.
They were then under his guidance and sanctifying influence. The
generation which was led to the land of Canaan was eminently pious,
perhaps more so than any other of the people of Israel (compare [Jos
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md); [Jdg
2:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006).md). The idea here is, that God,
who then gave his Holy Spirit, had seemed to forsake them. The nation
seemed to be abandoned to wickedness; and in this state, God remembered
how he had formerly chosen and sanctified them; and he proposed again to
impart to them the same Spirit.

[Isaiah 63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 63:12</span></span>

That led them by the right hand of Moses - (See the notes at [Isa
41:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md).

Dividing the water before them - [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md).

To make himself an everlasting name - He designed to perform a work
which, it would be seen, could not be performed by any false god or by
any human arm, and to do it in such circumstances, and in such a manner,
that it might be seen everywhere that this was the true God (compare the
notes at [Isa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006).md). The deliverance
from Egypt was attended with such amazing miracles, and with such a
sudden destruction of his foes, that none but the true God could have
performed it. Egypt was at that time the center of all the science,
civilization, and art known among mankind; and what occurred there would
be known to other lands. God, therefore, in this signal manner, designed
to make a public demonstration of his existence and power that shall be
known in all lands, and that should never be forgotten.

[Isaiah 63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 63:13</span></span>

That led them through the deep - They went through the deep on dry land
- the waters having divided and left an unobstructed path.

As an horse in the wilderness - As an horse, or a courser, goes through
a desert without stumbling. This is a most beautiful image. The
reference is to vast level plains like those in Arabia, where there are
no stones, no trees, no gullies, no obstacles, and where a fleet courser
bounds over the plain without any danger of stumbling. So the Israelites
were led on their way without falling. All obstacles were removed, and
they were led along as if over a vast smooth plain. Our word
'wilderness,' by no means expresses the idea here. We apply it to
uncultivated regions that are covered with trees, and where there would
be numerous obstacles to such a race-horse. But the Hebrew word (מדבר
midbâr) rather refers to "a desert, a waste" - a place of level sands or
plains where there was nothing to obstruct the fleet courser that should
prance over them. Such is probably the meaning of this passage, but
Harmer (Obs. i. 161ff) may be consulted for another view, which may
possibly be the correct one.

[Isaiah 63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 63:14</span></span>

As a beast that goeth down into the valley - As a herd of cattle in the
heat of the day descends into the shady glen in order to find rest. In
the vale, streams of water usually flow. By those streams and fountains
trees grow luxuriantly, and these furnish a cool and refreshing shade.
The cattle, therefore, in the heat of the day, naturally descend from
the hills, where there are no fountains and streams, and where they are
exposed to an intense sun, to seek refreshment in the shade of the
valley. The figure here is that of resting in safety after exposure; and
there are few more poetic and beautiful images of comfort than that
furnished by cattle lying quietly and safely in the cool shade of a
well-watered vale. This image would be much more striking in the intense
heat of an Oriental climate than it is with us. Harmer (Obs. i. 168ff)
supposes that the allusion here is to the custom prevailing still among
the Arabs, when attacked by enemies, of withdrawing with their herds and
flocks to some sequestered vale in the deserts, where they find safety.
The idea, according to him, is, that Israel lay thus safely encamped in
the wilderness; that they, with their flocks and herds and riches, were
suffered to remain unattacked by the king of Egypt; and that this was a
state of grateful repose, like that which a herd feels after having been
closely pursued by an enemy, when it finds a safe retreat in some quiet
vale. But it seems to me that the idea first suggested is the most
correct - as it is, undoubtedly the most poetical and beautiful of a
herd of cattle leaving the hills, and seeking a cooling shade and quiet
retreat in a well-watered vale. Such repose, such calm, gentle,
undisturbed rest, God gave his people. Such he gives them now, amidst
sultry suns and storms, as they pass through the world.

The Spirit of the Lord - (See the note at [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010).md).

So didst thou lead - That is, dividing the sea, delivering them from
their foes, and leading them calmly and securely on to the land of rest.
So now, amidst dangers seen and unseen, God leads his people on toward
heaven. He removes the obstacles in their way; he subdues their foes; he
'makes them to lie down in green pastures, and leads them beside the
still waters' [Psa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md); and he bears
them forward to a world of perfect peace.

[Isaiah 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 63:15</span></span>

Look down from heaven - This commences an earnest appeal that God would
have mercy on them in their present calamities and trials. They entreat
him to remember his former mercies, and to return and bless them, as he
had done in ancient times.

And behold from the habitation - (See the notes at [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md).

Where is thy zeal - That is, thy former zeal for thy people; where is
now the proof of the interest for their welfare which was vouchsafed in
times that are past.

And thy strength - The might which was formerly manifested for their
deliverance and salvation.

The sounding of thy bowels - Margin, 'Multitude.' The word rendered
'sounding' (המון hâmôn), means properly a noise or sound, as of rain;
[Kg1 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#041.md); of singing, [Eze
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013.md); of a multitude, [Sa1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#014.md); [Sa1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md). It also means a multitude, or a
crowd of people [Isa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md); [Isa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003.md). Here it relates to an emotion or
affection of the mind; and the phrase denotes compassion, or tender
concern for them in their sufferings. It is derived from the customary
expression in the Bible that the bowels, that is, the organs in the
region of the chest - for so the word is used in the Scriptures - were
the seat of the emotions, and were supposed to be affected by any strong
and tender emotion of the mind (see the notes at [Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011).md). The idea here is, 'Where is
thy former compassion for thy people in distress?'

Are they restrained? - Are they witcheld? Are thy mercies to be
exercised no more?

[Isaiah 63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 63:16</span></span>

Doubtless - Hebrew, כי kı̂y - 'For;' verily; surely. It implies the
utmost confidence that he still retained the feelings of a tender
father.

Thou art our father - Notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, and
though we should be disowned by all others, we will still believe that
thou dost sustain the relation of a father. Though they saw no human
aid, yet their confidence was unwavering that he had still tender
compassion toward them.

Though Abraham be ignorant of us - Abraham was the father of the nations
- their pious and much venerated ancestor. His memory they cherished
with the deepest affection, and him they venerated as the illustrious
patriarch whose name all were accustomed to speak with reverence. The
idea here is, that though even such a man - one so holy, and so much
venerated and loved - should refuse to own them as his children, yet
that God would not forget his paternal relation to them. A similar
expression of his unwavering love occurs in [Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md) : 'Can a woman forget her
sucking child?' See the note at that place. The language here expresses
the unwavering conviction of the pious, that God's love for his people
would never change; that it would live when even the most tender earthly
ties are broken, and when calamities so thicken around us that we seem
to be forsaken by God; and are forsaken by our sunshine friends, and
even by our most tender earthly connections.

And Israel acknowledge us not - And though Jacob, another much honored
and venerated patriarch, should refuse to recognize us as his children.
The Jewish expositors say, that the reason why Abraham and Jacob are
mentioned here and Isaac omitted, is, that Abraham was the first of the
patriarchs, and that all the posterity of Jacob was admitted to the
privileges of the covenant, which was not true of Isaac. The sentiment
here is, that we should have unwavering confidence in God. We should
confide in him though all earthly friends refuse to own us, and cast out
our names as evil. Though father and mother and kindred refuse to
acknowledge us, yet we should believe that God is our unchanging friend;
and it is of more value to have such a friend than to have the most
honored earthly ancestry and the affections of the nearest earthly
relatives. How often have the people of God been called to experience
this! How many times in the midst of persecution; when forsaken by
father and mother; when given up to a cruel death on account of their
attachment to the Redeemer, have they had occasion to recoil this
beautiful sentiment, and how unfailingly have they found it to be true!
Forsaken and despised; cast out and rejected; abandoned apparently by
God and by people, they have yet found, in the arms of their heavenly
Father, a consolation which this world could not destroy, and have
experienced his tender compassions attending them even down to the
grave.

Our Redeemer - Margin, 'Our Redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.' The
Hebrew will bear either construction. Lowth renders it, very loosely, in
accordance with the reading of one ancient manuscript, 'O deliver us for
the sake of thy name.' Probably the idea is that which results from a
deeply affecting and tender view of God as the Redeemer of his people.
The heart, overflowing with emotion, meditates upon the eternal honors
of his name, and is disposed to ascribe to him everlasting praise.

[Isaiah 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 63:17</span></span>

O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways? - Lowth and Noyes
render this, 'Why dost thou suffer us to wander from thy way?' Calvin
remarks on the passage, 'The prophet uses a common form of speaking, for
it is usual in the Scriptures to say that God gives the wicked over to a
reprobate mind, and hardens their hearts. But when the pious thus speak,
they do not intend to make God the author of error or sin, as if they
were innocent - nolunt Deum erroris aut sceleris facere auctorem, quasi
sint innoxii - or to take away their own blameworthiness. But they
rather look deeper, and confess themselves, by their own fault, to be
alienated from God, and destitute of his Spirit; and hence it happens
that they are precipitated into all manner of evils. God is said to
harden and blind when he delivers those who are to be blinded to Satan
(Satanae excaecandos tradit), who is the minister and the executor of
his wrath.' (Commentary in loc.) This seems to be a fair account of this
difficult subject.

At all events, this is the doctrine which was held by the father of the
system of Calvinism; and nothing more should be charged on that system,
in regard to blinding and hardening people, than is thus avowed (compare
the notes at [Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md); [Mat
13:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014).md). It is not to be supposed
that this result took place by direct divine agency. It is not by
positive power exerted to harden people and turn them away from God. No
man who has any just views of God can suppose that he exerts a positive
agency to make them sin, and then punishes them for it; no one who has
any just views of man, and of the operations of his own mind, can doubt
that a sinner is voluntary in his transgression. It is true, at the same
time, that God foresaw it, and that he did not interpose to prevent it.
Nay, it is true that the wickedness of people may be favored by his
abused providence - as a pirate may take advantage of a fair breeze that
God sends, to capture a merchant-man; and true, also, that God foresaw
it would be so, and yet chose, on the whole, that the events of his
providence should be so ordered.

His providential arrangements might be abused to the destruction of a
few, but would tend to benefit and save many. The fresh gale that drove
on one piratical vessel to crime and bloodshed, might, at the same time,
convey many richly freighted ships toward the port. One might suffer;
hundreds might rejoice. One pirate might be rendered successful in the
commission of crime; hundreds of honest people might be benefited. The
providential arrangement is not to compel people to sin, nor is it for
the sake of their sinning. It is to do good, and to benefit many -
though this may draw along, as a consequence, the hardening and the
destruction of a few. He might, by direct agency, prevent it, as he
might prevent the growth of the briers and thorns in a field; but the
same arrangement, by witcholding suns and dews and rains, would also
prevent the growth of flowers and grain and fruit, and turn extended
fertile lands into a desert. It is better that the thorns and briers
should be suffered to grow, than to convert those fields into a barren
waste.

Return - That is, return to bless us.

The tribes of thine inheritance - The Jewish tribes spoken of as the
heritage of God on the earth.

[Isaiah 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 63:18</span></span>

The people of thy holiness - The people who have been received into
solemn covenant with thee.

Have possessed it but a little while - That is, the land meaning that
the time during which they had enjoyed a peaceable possession of it,
compared with the perpetuity of the promise made, was short. Such is the
idea given to the passage by our translators. But there is considerable
variety in the interpretation of the passage among expositors. Lowth
renders it:

It is little, that they have taken possession of thy holy mountain;

That our enemies have trodden down thy sanctuary.

Jerome renders it, 'It is as nothing (quasi nihilum), they possess thy
holy people; our enemies have trodden down thy sanctuary.' The
Septuagint renders it, 'Return on account of thy servants, on account of
the tribes of thine inheritance, that we may inherit thy holy mountains
for a little time' ἵνα μικρὸν κληρονομήσωμεν τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ ἁγίου hina
mikron klēronomēsōmen tou orous tou hagiou). It has been generally felt
that there was great difficulty in the place. See Vitringa. The sense
seems to be that which occurs in our translation. The design is to
furnish an argument for the divine interposition, and the meaning of the
two verses may be expressed in the following paraphrase: 'We implore
thee to return unto us, and to put away thy wrath. As a reason for this,
we urge that thy temple thy holy sanctuary - was possessed by thy people
but a little time. For a brief period there we offered praise, and met
with our God, and enjoyed his favor. Now thine enemies trample it down.
They have come up and taken the land, and destroyed thy holy place [Isa
64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md). We plead for thine
interposition, because we are thy covenant people. Of old we have been
thine. But as for them, they were never thine. They never yielded to thy
laws. They were never called by thy name. There is, then, no reason why
the temple and the land should be in their possession, and we earnestly
pray that it may be restored to the tribes of thine ancient
inheritance.'

Our adversaries - This whole prayer is supposed to be offered by the
exiles near the close of their captivity. Of course the language is such
as they would then use. The scene is laid in Babylon, and the object is
to express the feelings which they would have then, and to furnish the
model for the petitions which they would then urge. We are not,
therefore, to suppose that the temple when Isaiah lived and wrote was in
ruins, and the land in the possession of his foes. All this is seen in
vision; and though a hundred and fifty years would occur before it would
be realized, yet, according to the prophetic manner, he describes the
scene as actually passing before him (see the Introduction, Section 7;
compare the notes at [Isa 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 63:19</span></span>

We are thine - We urge it as a reason for thy interposition to restore
the land and the temple, that we are thine from ancient times. Such I
take to be the meaning of the passage - in accordance with the common
translation, except that the expression מעולם mē‛ôlâm, 'from ancient
times,' rendered by our translators in connection with לא lo', 'never,'
is thus connected with the Jewish people, instead of being regarded as
applied to their enemies. The idea is, that it is an argument why God
should interpose in their behalf, that they had been for a long time his
people, but that his foes, who then had possession of the land, had
never submitted to his laws. There has been, however, great variety in
interpreting the passage. Lowth renders it:

We have long been as those whom thou hast not ruled;

We have not been called by thy name.

Noyes renders it better:

It has been with us as if thou hadst never ruled over us,

As if we had not been called by thy name.

Symmachus and the Arabic Saadias render it in the same manner. The
Septuagint renders it, 'We have been as at the beginning when thou didst
not rule over us, neither were we called by thy name;' that is, we have
gone back practically to our former pagan condition, by rejecting thy
laws, and by breaking thy covenant. Each of these interpretations makes
a consistent sense, but it seems to me that the one which I have
expressed above is more in accordance with the Hebrew.

Thou never barest rule over them - Over our enemies - regarded in the
prophetic vision as then in possession of the land. The idea is, that
they have come into thy land by violence, and laid waste a nation where
they had no right to claim any jurisdiction, and have now no claim to
thy protection.

They were not called by thy name - Hebrew, 'Thy name was not called upon
them.' They were aliens and strangers who had unjustly intruded into the
heritage of the Lord.
