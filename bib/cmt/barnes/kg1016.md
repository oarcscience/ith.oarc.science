### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 16:1</span></span>

Hanani, the father of Jehu, was seer to Asa in the kingdom of Judah [Ch2
16:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007). His son Jehu, who here
discharges the same office in the kingdom of Israel, appears at a later
date as an inhabitant of Jerusalem where he prophesied under
Jehoshaphat, whom he rebuked on one occasion. He must have lived to a
great age, for he outlived Jehoshaphat, and wrote his life (marginal
references).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 16:5</span></span>

The "might" of Baasha is sufficiently indicated by those successes which
drove Asa to call Ben-hadad to his aid. [Kg1
15:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 16:7</span></span>

The natural position of this verse would be after [Kg1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#004) and before [Kg1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#005). But it may be regarded as added
by the writer, somewhat irregularly, as an afterthought; its special
force being to point out that the sentence on Baasha was intended to
punish, not only his calf-worship, but emphatically his murder of
Jeroboam and his family. Though the destruction of Jeroboam had been
foretold, and though Baasha may be rightly regarded as God's instrument
to punish Jeroboam's sins, yet, as he received no command to execute
God's wrath on the offender, and was instigated solely by ambition and
self-interest, his guilt was just as great as if no prophecy had been
uttered. Even Jehu's commission [Kg2
9:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#005) was not held to justify,
altogether, his murder of Jehoram and Jezebel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 16:8</span></span>

Two years - i. e., More than one year, or, at any rate, some portion of
two distinct years (compare [Kg1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#010)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 16:9</span></span>

The conspiracy of Zimri - Elah's "servant" (i. e., "subject") - was
favored by his position, which probably gave him military authority in
the city, by the absence of a great part of the people and of the
officers who might have checked him, at Gibbethon [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015), and by the despicable character
of Elah, who, instead of going up to the war, was continually reminding
men of his low origin by conduct unworthy of royalty.

Steward - The office was evidently one of considerable importance. In
Solomon's court it gave the rank of שׂר śar, prince. In Persia the
"steward of the household" acted sometimes as a sort of regent during
the king's absence.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 16:11</span></span>

Neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends - Zimri's measures were of
much more than ordinary severity. Not only was the royal family
extirpated, but the friends of the king, his councillors and favorite
officers, were put to death. Omri, as having been in the confidence of
the late monarch, would naturally fear for himself, and resolve to take
the course which promised him at least a chance of safety.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 16:13</span></span>

Their vanities - The "calves." The Hebrews call an idol by terms
signifying "emptiness," "vapor," or "nothingness." (Compare marginal
references.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 16:16</span></span>

All Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king - This passage of
history recalls the favorite practice of the Roman armies under the
Empire, which, when they heard of the assassination of an emperor at
Rome, were accustomed to invest their own commander with the purple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 16:17</span></span>

Went up - The expression "went up" marks accurately the ascent of the
army from the Shephelah, where Gibbethon was situated [Jos
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044), to the hill country of Israel,
on the edge of which Tirzah stood [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 16:18</span></span>

The palace of the king's house - The tower of the king's house. A
particular part of the palace - either the "harem," or, more probably,
the keep or citadel, a tower stronger and loftier than the rest of the
palace.

Zimri's desperate act has been repeated more than once. That the last
king of Assyria, the Sardanapalus of the Greeks, thus destroyed himself,
is almost the only "fact" which we know concerning him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 16:19</span></span>

Zimri's death illustrates the general moral which the writer of Kings
draws from the whole history of the Israelite monarchs. that a curse was
upon them on account of their persistence in Jeroboam's sin, which,
sooner or later, brought each royal house to a bloody end.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 16:22</span></span>

From a comparison of the dates given in [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015), [Kg1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023), [Kg1
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029) it follows that the contest
between the two pretenders lasted four years.

Tibni's death can scarcely be supposed to have been natural. Either he
must have been slain in battle against Omri, or have fallen into his
hands and been put to death.

There has probably been some derangement of the text here. The passage
may have run thus: "So Tibni died, and Omri reigned in the thirty-first
year of Asa, king of Judah. Omri reigned over Israel twelve years: six
years reigned he in Tirzah." Omri's reign of 12 years began in Asa's
27th [Kg1 16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015), and terminated in
his 38th [Kg1 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029). The event
belonging to Asa's 31st year was the death of Tibni, and the consequent
extension of Omri's kingdom.

The six years in Tirzah are probably made up of the four years of
contention with Tibni, and two years afterward, during which enough of
Samaria was built for the king to transfer his residence there.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 16:24</span></span>

"Samaria" represents the Greek form of the name Σαμάρεια Samareia; the
original is שׁמרון shômerôn (margin). The site is marked by the modern
"Sebustiyeh," an Arabic corruption of Sebaste, the name given by Herod
to Samaria when he rebuilt it. Sebustiyeh is situated on a very
remarkable "hill." In the heart of the mountains of Israel occurs a deep
basin-shaped depression, in the midst of which rises an oblong hill,
with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. This was the
site which Omri chose for his new capital. Politically it was rather
more central than Shechem, and probably than Tirzah. In a military point
of view it was admirably calculated for defense. The country round it
was especially productive. The hill itself possessed abundant springs of
water. The result is that we find no further change. Shechem and Tirzah
were each tried and abandoned; but through all the later alterations of
dynasty Samaria continued uninterruptedly, to the very close of the
independence, to be the capital of the northern kingdom.

Omri purchased the right of property in the hill, just as David
purchased the threshing-floor ([Sa2
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024); compare [Kg1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#002)). Two talents, or 6,000 shekels
([Exo 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note) - about 500 British
pounds (or perhaps 800 pounds) of our money - may well have been the
full value of the ground. And while naming his city after Shemer, Omri
may also have had in view the appropriateness of such a name to the
situation of the place. Shomeron, to a Hebrew ear, would have
necessarily conveyed the idea of a "watch-tower." This name, however,
appears not to have been at first accepted by the surrounding nations.
The earlier Assyrian kings knew the Israelite capital, not as Samaria,
but as Beth-Khumri, i. e., "the city (house) of Omri." It is not until
the time of Tiglath-pileser that they exchange this designation for that
of "Sammirin."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 16:25</span></span>

Omri outwent his idolatrous predecessors in his zeal, reducing the
calf-worship to a regular formal system, which went down to posterity
(compare the marginal reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 16:27</span></span>

His might - Perhaps in the war between Israel and Syria of Damascus
([Kg1 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001), etc.), during the reign of
Omri. Its issue was very disadvantageous to him [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034); [Kg1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 16:29</span></span>

Twenty and two years - Rather, from a comparison between [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010) and [Kg1
22:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#051), not more than 21 years. Perhaps
his reign did not much exceed 20 years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 16:30</span></span>

See [Kg1 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033). The great sin of Ahab
- that by which he differed from all his predecessors, and exceeded them
in wickedness - was his introduction of the worship of Baal, consequent
upon his marriage with Jezebel, and his formal establishment of this
gross and palpable idolatry as the religion of the state.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 16:31</span></span>

As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam
- Idolatries are not exclusive. Ahab, while he detested the pure worship
of Yahweh, and allowed Jezebel to put to death every "prophet of the
Lord" whom she could find [Kg1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004),
readily tolerated the continued worship of the "calves," which had no
doubt tended more and more to lose its symbolic character, and to become
a thoroughly idolatrous image-worship.

Eth-baal - Identified with the Ithobalus of Menander, who reigned in
Tyre, probably over all Phoenicia, within 50 years of the death of
Hiram. This Ithobalus, whose name means "With him is Baal," was
originally priest of the great temple of Astarte, in Tyre. At the age of
36 he conspired against the Tyrian king, Pheles (a usurping fratricide),
killed him, and seized the throne. His reign lasted 32 years, and he
established a dynasty which continued on the throne at least 62 years
longer. The family-tree of the house may be thus exhibited:

Lineage of Eth-Baal Eth-baal Badezor Jezebel Matgen (Belus of Virgil)
Pygmalion Dido (founder of Carthage)

Hence, Jezebel was great-aunt to Pygmalion and his sister Dido.

Served Baal - The worship of Baal by the Phoenicians is illustrated by
such names as IthoBAL, HanniBAL, etc. Abundant traces of it are found in
the Phoenician monuments.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 16:34</span></span>

This seems to be adduced as a proof of the general impiety of Ahab's
time. The curse of Joshua against the man who should rebuild Jericho had
hitherto been believed and respected. But now faith in the old religion
had so decayed, that Joshua's malediction had lost its power. Hiel, a
Bethelite of wealth and station, undertook to restore the long-ruined
fortress. But he suffered for his temerity. In exact accordance with the
words of Joshua's curse, he lost his firstborn son when he began to lay
anew the foundations of the walls, and his youngest when he completed
his work by setting up the gates. We need not suppose that Jericho had
been absolutely uninhabited up to this time. But it was a ruined and
desolate place without the necessary protection of walls, and containing
probably but few houses ([Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013)
note). Hiel re-established it as a city, and it soon became once more a
place of some importance [Ch2 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015).
