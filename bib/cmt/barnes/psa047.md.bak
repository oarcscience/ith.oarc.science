### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 47:0</span></span>

This psalm is entitled, "To the chief Musician, a psalm for (margin, of)
the sons of Korah." On the phrase "To the chief Musician," see the notes
at the title to [Psa 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md). On the
phrase "For the sons of Korah," see the notes at the title to [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md).

The occasion on which the psalm was composed, and the name of the
author, are alike unknown. It is a triumphal psalm, and was composed
apparently on some occasion of "victory" over enemies, with reference to
a triumphal procession. Professor Alexander supposes that it was
composed to commemorate the victory of Jehoshaphat over the Ammonites
and Edomites, recorded in 2 Chr. 20. It is, as he remarks, a coincidence
of some importance, that there is express mention made of the presence
of the "Kohattlites" on that occasion, as among those who "stood up to
praise the Lord," [Ch2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019.md). This is
not, however, decisive, as they might have been present on other similar
occasions, and as it is probable, in fact, that they usually took part
in celebrations of this kind. All that can be expressed with any
certainty in regard to the occasion on which the psalm was composed is,
that it was on an occasion of victory.

The psalm consists of two parts, quite similar in structure and in
design. Each part consists of an exhortation to praise God, followed by
a statement of reasons why, it should be done.

I. The first part comprises the first five verses:

\(1\) An exhortation to praise God - to celebrate the joy of the soul by
a clapping of hands, and by a shout of triumph, [Psa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md).

\(2\) reasons for doing this, [Psa
47:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md). These reasons are that he is
terrible; that he is king over all the earth; that he will subdue the
nations, and make them subject to his own people; and that, in
anticipation of this, and in proof of this, he had now achieved a signal
victory, and had gone up as from that victory to his own abode in
heaven.

II\. The second part embraces the Last four verses of the psalm:

\(1\) An exhortation, as before, to praise God, [Psa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md).

\(2\) reasons for this, [Psa 47:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md).
These reasons are, as before, that God is king over all the earth; that
he now sits upon the throne of his holiness, and that [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md) the princes of the nations - the
subdued kings and rulers - are borne along in triumph to the people of
the God of Abraham; and that in this victory it has been shown that the
shields of the earth belong to God. See the notes at [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md).

The psalm, therefore, is a triumphal ode, and was probably composed to
be sung on occasion of some military triumph - some solemn procession on
a return from battle, with captive princes marching in the procession,
and with a display of the "shields" and other implements of war taken
from the foe. All this is celebrated as indicative of the interposing
power of God in victory, and as evidence of his purpose to protect his
chosen people in time of peril. The psalm may yet be used in a higher
sense by the church at large, when all the foes of God on earth shall be
subdued, and when his kingdom shall be in fact set up over all the
world.

[Psalms 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 47:1</span></span>

O clap your hands, all ye people - A common way of expressing joy, or
indicating applause. Compare the notes at [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md). The "people" here referred to
are probably the Jewish people, and the call on them is to rejoice, with
the customary marks of joy, in view of the great victory which God had
gained over their enemies.

Shout unto God - Make a joyful noise in praise of God; that is, in
acknowledgment that this victory has been gained by his interposition.

With a voice of triumph - With such a shout as is usually raised when a
victory is obtained; such a shout as occurs in a triumphal procession.
Compare [Sa2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015.md); [Ch1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#028.md); [Job
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025.md); [Zac
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md); [Exo
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#018.md); [Isa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006.md); [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md); [Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md); [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md). There are doubtless times when
loud shouts, as expressive of joy, are proper.

[Psalms 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 47:2</span></span>

For the Lord most high - Yahweh, the Most High God; that is, who is
exalted above all other beings. Compare [Exo
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011.md); [Ch1
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#025.md) [Psa
96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md); [Ch2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005.md); [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003.md).

Is terrible - literally, is to be feared; that is, reverenced and
adored. There is an idea in the words "terrible" and "terror" which is
not contained in the original, as if there were something harsh, severe,
stern, in his character. The word in the original does not go beyond the
notion of inspiring reverence or awe, and is the common word by which
the worship of God is designated in the Scriptures. The meaning is, that
he is worthy of profound reverence or adoration.

He is a great king over all the earth - He rules the world. He is a
universal Sovereign. The immediate "occasion" of saying this, when the
psalm was composed, was evidently some victory (which had been achieved
over the enemies of the people of God) so decided, and so immediately by
the divine power, as to prove that he has absolute control over all
nations.

[Psalms 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 47:3</span></span>

He shall subdue the people under us - Compare [Psa
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md), note; [Psa
18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md), note. The word rendered
"subdue" is that which commonly means" to speak." The idea in the use of
this word here is that he has only to speak and it is done (compare [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009).md), or that he could do it by a
word. Compare, however, on the use of the word here, Gesenius (Lexicon),
on the word - דבר dâbar, 2, Hiphil.

And the nations under our feet - That is, they shall be entirely or
effectually subdued. See [Psa 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md),
note; [Psa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005.md), note. As God would
enable them to do this, it was an occasion for thankfulness and triumph.

[Psalms 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 47:4</span></span>

He shall choose our inheritance for us - He has chosen or selected the
land which we inherit. Of all the countries which compose the world, he
has chosen "this" to be the inheritance of his own people, or the place
where they should dwell. The thought in this verse is based on the idea
so common in the writings of the Hebrews, that their country was the
glory of all lands - the place of all on earth most desirable to dwell
in. It is in view of this fact that they are here called on to praise
God, and to rejoice in him.

The excellency of Jacob - literally, "the pride - גאון gâ'ôn - of
Jacob." Septuagint, "beauty" - καλλονὴν kallonēn. So the Vulgate,
"speciem." The meaning is, that it was a land of which Jacob, the
ancestor of the people, might be proud, or which he did boast of. It was
ever regarded as an honor among the Jews that they dwelt in a land which
had been the abode of the prophets; and especially was anything regarded
as of value that could be traced to Jacob; that bad been once in his
possession; or that could be regarded as his gift. Compare [Joh
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md).

Whom he loved - As one of the patriarchs. Perhaps special allusion is
here made to "Jacob" rather than to Abraham and Isaac, because the land
came actually into the possession of the Hebrew people in the time of
Jacob's sons. It was divided among the descendants of his sons, the
twelve tribes, bearing their names; and thus Jacob was most naturally
referred to as having been in possession of the land. Abraham and Isaac
dwelt in the land as strangers and pilgrims [Heb
11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md), [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md), having no possession there, not
even of a burying-place except as they purchased it (compare [Gen
23:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#012).md); and the land actually came
into the possession of the nation only in the family of Jacob.

[Psalms 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 47:5</span></span>

God is gone up with a shout - That is, he has ascended to heaven, his
home and throne, after having secured the victory. He is represented as
having come down to aid his people in the war by the overthrow of their
enemies, and (having accomplished this) as returning to heaven,
accompanied by his hosts, and amidst the shouts of triumph. All this is,
of course, poetical, and is not to be regarded as literal in any sense.
Compare the notes at [Psa 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md).

The Lord with the sound of a trumpet - Yahweh, accompanied with the
notes of victory. All this is designed to denote triumph, and to show
that the victory was to be traced solely to God.

[Psalms 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 47:6</span></span>

Sing praises to God, sing praises - This commences the "second" part of
the psalm. The "repetition" shows that the heart was full, or was
overflowing with joy. It is a call on all to celebrate the praises of
God, especially as he had enabled his people to triumph over their
enemies.

Sing praises unto our King - Unto God, who has shown himself to be the
King of his people - one who rules in their behalf, and who has
interposed for their deliverance in danger.

[Psalms 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 47:7</span></span>

For God is the King of all the earth - He has shown himself to be a
universal sovereign. All nations are subject to him, and he has a claim
to universal praise.

Sing ye praises with understanding - Margin, Every one "that hath
understanding." Neither the text here, however, nor the margin,
expresses the true idea of the original. The Hebrew is, "Sing a Maschil"
- משׂכיל maśkı̂yl; that is, Sing, or play, a didactic psalm or tune; that
is, a song or ode adapted to convey valuable lessons of instruction. See
the word explained in the notes at the title to [Psa
32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md). The idea is, that the
occasion was one on which "such" a psalm or song would be especially
appropriate; an occasion on which great lessons or truths had been
taught by the dealings of God, which it became his people now to set
forth in a becoming manner. Those lessons or truths pertained to the
fact that God is the great King over all the earth, or that he is a
sovereign among the nations: a truth of immense importance to mankind,
and a truth which the occasion on which the psalm was composed was
especially adapted to bring to view.

[Psalms 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 47:8</span></span>

God reigneth over the heathen - Over the "nations;" not over the
"heathen" in the sense in which that term is understood now. It does not
mean that God reigns, or that he has set up his throne over the people
that have not the true religion, but that he is exalted over the
"nations" of the earth as such; or, that he has universal dominion. See
the notes at [Psa 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md).

God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness - Upon his holy throne, The
idea is, that his government is established in holiness or justice.

[Psalms 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 47:9</span></span>

The princes of the people are gathered together - The marginal reading
is, "The voluntary of the people are gathered unto the people of the God
of Abraham." The word rendered "princes" - נדיב nâdı̂yb - means properly,
voluntary, ready, prompt; then, generous, liberal; then, those of noble
birth, princes, nobles. It is evidently used here in this latter sense.
The word "people" here may mean either the people of Israel, or the
people of other lands; but in this place it seems evidently to denote
the latter. The words "are gathered together" may refer either to a
voluntary or an involuntary assembling; meaning either that they came in
chains as prisoners of war, subdued by the arms of the people of God,
and thus rendering an involuntary tribute to their power and their
religion; or that they came in a voluntary manner, and submitted
themselves, acknowledging the God of Israel to be the true God. It seems
to me that the connection requires that we should understand this in the
former sense, as referring to the subjugation of the enemies of of the
people of God, and to their being led along as captives, assembled thus
from distant parts of the world as proof that the God of Israel reigned.

Even the people of the God of Abraham - The word "even" is not in the
original. The meaning is, "to" the people of the God of Abraham; that
is, they come and mingle with the people of the God of Abraham; or, they
come as captives in war "to" that people, and confess in this manner
that their God is the true God. The image is that of the assemblage of
great numbers of foriegn princes and nobles as furnishing either a
voluntary or involuntary acknowledgment of the fact that the God of
Abraham was the true God, and that the people of Israel were his people.

For the shields of the earth belong unto God - Are of right his. This
would seem to have been suggested by the marching in triumph of subdued
and vanquished princes and warriors, their shields or weapons of war
being borne along in the procession, demonstrating that Jehovah was King
among the nations. It was seen in such a march that all those weapons of
war "belonged" to him, or that he had a right to dispose of them, and to
use them as he pleased.

He is greatly exalted - That is, one who can thus subdue nations, and
lead along captive princes and warriors, "must" be a Being greatly
exalted; a Being that has dominion over the nations of the earth. This
completes the imagery in the psalm, and gives occasion for the shouts
and the joys of triumph. God had shown that he was a great King over the
earth. Princes and armies were subdued to his will. They were led along
as captives, and were gathered together to the people of God, as if to
acknowledge their own inferiority; and in this solemn manner the nations
thus subdued owned Yahweh to be the true God. In a higher sense this
will be true when all the earth shall be subdued by the power of truth,
and when kings, and princes, and people everywhere shall come and
acknowledge God, reigning through the Messiah, to be the King of all
nations. Compare Isa. 60.
