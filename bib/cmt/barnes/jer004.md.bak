### [Jeremiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 4:0</span></span>

The conclusion of both sides of the prophecy; to Israel, [Jer
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md); to Judah, [Jer
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md).

[Jeremiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 4:1</span></span>

Return - The repentance of Israel described in [Jer
3:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md) was a hope, and not a reality.
The return, literally, would be their restoration to their land;
spiritually, their abandoning their sins.

[Jer 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md) should be translated as
follows:

If thou wouldst return, O Israel, saith Yahweh.

Unto Me thou shalt return:

And if thou wouldst remove thy abominations from before Me,

And not wander to and fro,

But wouldst swear truly, uprightly; and justly

By the living Yahweh;

Then shall the pagan bless themselves ... -

In him - In Yahweh. Two great truths are taught in this verse;

\(1\) that the Gentiles were to be members of the Church of the Messiah;

\(2\) that Israel's special office was to be God's mediator in this
great work.

Thus, Jeremiah is in exact accord with the evangelical teaching of
Isaiah.

[Jeremiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 4:3</span></span>

To the men - To each man "of Judah." They are summoned individually to
repentance.

Break up - literally, Fallow for you a fallow ground, i. e., do not sow
the seeds of repentance in unfit soil, but just as the farmer prepares
the ground, by clearing it of weeds, and exposing it to the sun and air,
before entrusting to it the seed, so must you regard repentance as a
serious matter, requiring forethought, and anxious labor. To sow in
unfallowed ground was practically to sow on land full of thorns.

[Jeremiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 4:4</span></span>

See the [Deu 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md) note. Nature, such
as it is in itself, unconsecrated to God, is to be removed from our
inner selves, that a new and spiritual nature may take its place.

Lest my fury ... - God is long-suffering, but unless this change take
place, the time of judgment must at length come to all as it came to
Jerusalem - "like fire" (compare [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); [Phi
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).md).

Jer. 4:5-6:30 "God's Judgment upon the Unrepentant"

A group of prophecies now commences, extending to [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md), but broken at the beginning of
Jer. 7 by a new heading. The subject of them all is the same, namely,
the approaching devastation of Judaea by a hostile army in punishment of
its persistence in idolatry. The prophecy of Jer. 7 was probably written
in the first year of Jehoiakim, while as regards the rest they probably
extended over a considerable period of time. This group, which we may
reasonably believe to have come down to us much as it stood in
Jehoiakim's scroll, gives us a general view of the nature of Jeremiah's
efforts during that important period, when under Josiah a national
reformation was still possible, and the exile might have been averted.
The prophecy Jer. 7, spoken in the first year of Jehoiakim, when the
probation of Judah was virtually over, was the solemn closing of the
appeal to the conscience of the people, and a protest, while the new
king was still young upon his throne, against that ruinous course upon
which he so immediately entered.

[Jeremiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 4:5</span></span>

Rather, Make proclamation "in Judah, and in Jerusalem" bid them hear,
"and say, Blow the trumpet" throughout "the land:" cry aloud "and say
etc." The prophecy begins with a loud alarm of war. The verse sets forth
well, in its numerous commands, the excitement and confusion of such a
time.

[Jeremiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 4:6</span></span>

The standard - A flag or signal, to which the people were to
rally.Retire, stay not - Rather, gather your goods together: linger not;
"for I" (emphatic, Yahweh) am bringing at this very time etc.

[Jeremiah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 4:7</span></span>

Rather, A "lion"... a "destroyer" of nations: a metaphor descriptive of
the impending calamity. A lion is just rousing himself from his lair,
but no common one. It is destroyer, not of men, but of nations.

Is on his way - literally, "has broken up his encampment." Jeremiah uses
a military term strictly referring to the striking of tents in
preparation for the march.

Without an inhabitant - The final stage of destruction, actually reached
in the utter depopulation of Judaea consequent upon Gedaliah's murder.

[Jeremiah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 4:8</span></span>

Is not turned ... - As long as their sins are unrepented of, so long
must their punishment continue.

[Jeremiah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 4:10</span></span>

Ah, Lord God! - Alas! my Lord Yahweh: an expression of disapproval on
Jeremiah's part. Jeremiah had constantly to struggle against the
misgivings of his own melancholy nature, but he never let them prevent
him from doing his duty. See the introduction of Jeremiah.

Ye shall have peace - These words are generally referred to the false
prophets; they rather refer to real prophecies of future blessedness
promised to the Jews. Jeremiah could not reconcile the doom he was now
commanded to pronounce, either with his previous prophecy, or with what
he read in the writings of his predecessors. Time only could solve the
difficulty. Upon the struggles of the prophets to understand their own
predictions see [Pe1 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md).

Unto the soul - The sword has reached the life. i. e., has inflicted a
mortal wound.

[Jeremiah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 4:11</span></span>

At that time - See [Jer 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md). Though
the revelation of the certainty of Judah's ruin wrings from Jeremiah a
cry of despair, yet it is but for a moment; he immediately returns to
the delivery of God's message.

A dry wind - literally, A clear wind. The Samum is probably meant, a dry
parching east wind blowing from the Arabian desert, before which
vegetation withers, and human life becomes intolerable.

Not to fan ... - The Syrian farmers make great use of the wind for
separating the chaff from the grain: but when the Samum blows labor
becomes impossible. It is not for use, but for destruction.

[Jeremiah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 4:12</span></span>

Or, as in the margin; i. e., a wind more full, more impetuous than those
winds which serve for fanning and cleansing the grain.

Unto me - Rather, for me: to perform my will.

[Jeremiah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 4:13</span></span>

His troops move on in large masses like dark threatening clouds [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md).

Woe unto us! for we are spoiled - Jeremiah's own cry of grief.

[Jeremiah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 4:14</span></span>

Thy vain thoughts - "Thy" iniquitous "thoughts." "Aven," the word used
here, is especially applied to the sin of idolatry: thus Bethel is
generally called Bethaven by Hosea ([Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008), ....md), because instead of being
the house of God, El, it was the house of an iniquity, Aven, the golden
calf.

[Jeremiah 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 4:15</span></span>

Dan - The border-town of Palestine on the north [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md).

Mount Ephraim - The northern boundary of Judaea itself. The invading
army presses on so rapidly, that scarcely have the news arrived of its
appearance at Dan, before fresh messengers announce that it has
traversed the whole length of Galilee, and is now defiling through the
mountains of Samaria.

Affliction - The same word, aven, occurs in [Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md), and apparently there is a play
upon its double meaning: for from a root signifying worthlessness, it is
used both for wickedness and for misery. Thus, the "iniquity" of Judah
proves also, to be her "affliction," as being the cause of the ruin
inflicted by the enemy.

[Jeremiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 4:16</span></span>

Proclaim ye to the pagan, "Behold!" Cry aloud concerning "Jerusalem,
that watchers" are on their way "from a far country: and" will "give out
their voice against the cities of Judah." The pagan are summoned to
witness the chastisement of Jerusalem, that they may take warning
thereby. By "watchers" are meant besiegers, who will surround the city
with a line of sentinels.

[Jeremiah 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 4:17</span></span>

Jeremiah compares the tents of the besiegers on guard round Jerusalem to
the booths erected by shepherds or farmers for the protection of their
flocks or produce.

[Jeremiah 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 4:18</span></span>

Thy wickedness - This siege is thy wickedness, i. e., in its results; or
better, this is thy wretchedness, this army and thy approaching ruin is
thy misery.

Because - "For." To feel that one's misery is the result of one's own
doings adds bitterness to the anguish, and makes it reach, penetrate to
the heart.

[Jeremiah 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 4:19</span></span>

The verse is best translated as a series of ejaculations, in which the
people express their grief at the ravages committed by the enemy:

"My bowels! My bowels!" I writhe in pain!

The walls of my heart! "My heart" moans for me!

I cannot keep silence!

For "thou hast heard, O my soul," the trumpet's voice!

"The alarm of war!"

[Jeremiah 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 4:20</span></span>

Destruction ... - Or, breaking upon breaking [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md). The news of one breaking, one
violent calamity, follows close upon another.

My curtains - The curtains of the tent, put here for the tents
themselves. tents were the ordinary habitations of the Israelites.

[Jeremiah 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 4:21</span></span>

The standard - See [Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md). The alarm
caused by the invasion is graphically described. The people are
dispersed over the land following their usual pursuits, when tidings
come of the enemy's approach. The only chance of escape is a hasty
flight. Flags stream from the hills to mark the safest route, while the
blasts of the trumpet quicken the steps of the wavering.

[Jeremiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 4:23</span></span>

In four verses each beginning with "I beheld," the prophet sees in
vision the desolate condition of Judaea during the Babylonian captivity.

[Jer 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md)

Without form, and void - Desolate and void (see [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002) note.md). The land has returned to a
state of chaos (marginal reference note).

And the heavens - And upward to the heavens. The imagery is that of the
last day of judgment. To Jeremiah's vision all was as though the day of
the Lord had come, and earth returned to the state in which it was
before the first creative word (see [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md).

[Jer 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#024.md)

Moved lightly - "Reeled to and fro," from the violence of the
earthquake.

[Jer 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#026.md)

The fruitful place - The Carmel [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007.md), where the population had been
most dense, and the labors of the farmer most richly rewarded, has
become the wilderness.

At the presence - i. e., because of, at the command of Yahweh, and
because of His anger.

[Jeremiah 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 4:27</span></span>

Desolate - a waste.

One of the most striking points of prophecy is, that however severe. may
be the judgment pronounced against Judah, there is always the
reservation, that the ruin shall not be complete [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md).

[Jeremiah 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 4:28</span></span>

For ... - Because of this doom upon Judah.

I have purposed it - The Septuagint arrangement restores the
parallelism:

For I have spoken, and will not repent,

I have purposed, and will not turn back from it.

[Jeremiah 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 4:29</span></span>

The whole city ... - Rather, Every city is fleeing. All the inhabitants
of the tokens flee to Jerusalem for protection, or seek refuge in the
woods and rocks.

The horsemen and bowmen - The cavalry [Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md) and bowmen formed the chief
strength of the Assyrian armies.

They shall go - They have gone.

[Jeremiah 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 4:30</span></span>

Translate, And thou, O plundered one, what effectest thou, that "thou
clothest thyself with" scarlet, that "thou deckest" thyself "with
ornaments of gold," that thou enlargest thine eyes with antimony ([Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030) note.md)? "In vain" dost thou
beautify thyself; "thy lovers" despise" thee, they" seek "thy life."
Jerusalem is represented as a woman who puts on her best attire to gain
favor in the eyes of her lovers, but in vain.

[Jeremiah 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 4:31</span></span>

For a cry have I heard as of one writhing in vain:

Anguish as of one that bringeth forth her first-born:

The cry of the daughter of Zion.

She gasps for breath: she stretches out her palms:

Woe is me! for my soul faints before the murderers.
