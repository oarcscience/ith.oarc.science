### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 23:1</span></span>

The pastors - shepherds, i. e., civil rulers [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md).

The sheep of My pasture - literally, of My pasturing, the sheep of whom
I am shepherd. The people do not belong to the rulers but to God.

[Jeremiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 23:2</span></span>

They had scattered them first spiritually by leading them into idolatry;
and secondly, many had literally been taken to Egypt with Jehoahaz, many
in Jehoiakim's time had fled there, while others fell away to the
Chaldaeans: and finally the best of the land had been carried to Babylon
with Jeconiah.

Driven away - i. e., made them outcasts. In the East, shepherds never
drive their flocks, but go ahead of them [Joh
10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md).

Have not visited them - i. e., have not concerned yourselves about their
conduct.

[Jeremiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 23:3</span></span>

While there is no promise of restoration for the kings, there is for the
people (see [Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md), because they
had been led astray by their rulers.

Have driven them - The evil shepherds drove the people into exile by
leading them into sin: and God by inflicting punishment.

Their folds - Or, their pastures.

[Jeremiah 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 23:4</span></span>

Shepherds - Men like Ezra, Nehemiah, and the Maccabees, raised up
especially by God. It is a revocation of the promise made to David [Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md) so far as the earthly throne
was concerned.

They shall fear no more ... - The effect of good government will be
general security.

Neither shall they be lacking - Not one sheep shall be missing or lost.

[Jeremiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 23:5</span></span>

Even with the temporal kingship abolished, David's mercies are still
sure.

A righteous Branch - Or, sprout, germ (see [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002) note.md). The sprout is that in which
the root springs up and grows, and which, if it be destroyed, makes the
root perish also.

And a king shall reign ... - Rather, and he shall reign as king. David's
family is to be dethroned (temporally), that it may reign gloriously
(spiritually). But compare [Jer 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017.md),
note; [Jer 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025.md), note.

[Jeremiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 23:6</span></span>

This is his name whereby he shall be called - From remote antiquity the
person here spoken of has been understood to be "the righteous germ,"
and this alone is in accordance with the grammar and the sense.
Nevertheless, because Jeremiah [Jer
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md) applies the name also to
Jerusalem, some understand it of Israel.

the Lord OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS - Messiah is here called:

\(1\) Yahweh, and

\(2\) our righteousness, because He justifies us by His merits.

Some render, He by whom Yahweh works righteousness. Righteousness is in
that case personal holiness, which is the work of the Spirit after
justification.

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

Because of the prophets - Rather, concerning "the prophets." These words
should come first, as being the title of this portion of the prophecy
Jer. 23:9-40.

[Jeremiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 23:10</span></span>

Because of swearing - Rather, because of the curse denounced against sin
[Jer 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#003.md). The mourning probably
refers to the drought [Jer 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004.md).

The pleasant places - "Pastures."

Their course - Their mode of life.

Their force is not right - "Their heroism," that on which they pride
themselves as mighty men, "is not right," is wrong (see [Jer
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006) note.md).

[Jeremiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 23:11</span></span>

For both prophet and priest are profane - While by their office they are
consecrated to God, they have made themselves common and unholy by their
sins. See [Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md) note.

Yea, in my house - This may refer to sins such as those of the sons of
Eli [Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md), or that they had
defiled the temple by idolatrous rites.

[Jeremiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 23:12</span></span>

Every word denotes the certainty of their fall. "Their path is like
slippery places in darkness:" and on this path "they are pushed with
violence." External circumstances assist in urging on to ruin those who
choose the path of vice.

[Jeremiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 23:13</span></span>

And I have seen folly ... - Rather, "Also I have seen." The prophet
contrasts the prophets of Samaria with those of Jerusalem. In the
conduct of the former God saw folly (literally that which is insipid, as
being unsalted). It was stupidity to prophesy by Baal, an idol.

In Baal - i. e., in the name of Baal.

[Jeremiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 23:14</span></span>

Rather, "But in the prophets of Jerusalem" etc. Their conduct is more
strongly condemned than that of the Baal-priests.

They strengthen ... - First by neglecting to warn and rebuke sinners:
secondly by the direct influence of their bad example.

They are all of them - They have become, "all of them," i. e., the
people of Jerusalem, and not the prophets only.

[Jeremiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 23:15</span></span>

Profaneness - Desecration.

[Jeremiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 23:16</span></span>

How were the people to know the false prophets from the true? The former
bring a message that fills with vain hopes, or "speak a vision" out of
their own invention.

[Jeremiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 23:17</span></span>

Still - "Continually." This verse gives the chief test by which the
false prophet is to be detected, namely, that his predictions violate
the laws of morality.

[Jeremiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 23:18</span></span>

The prophet now applies this test to the circumstances of the times. A
whirlwind has already gone forth [Jer
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md). Had these false prophets stood
in God's secret "Council" (so in [Jer
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022).md), they like Jeremiah would have
labored to avert the danger by turning men from their evil way.

[Jeremiah 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 23:19</span></span>

Rather, "Behold, the tempest of Yahweh, even hot anger hath gone forth
and a whirlwind shall burst upon the head of the wicked."

[Jeremiah 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 23:20</span></span>

The latter days - The proper and final development of any event or
series of events. Thus, the expression is used of the Christian
dispensation as the full development of the Jewish Church. Here it means
the destruction of Jerusalem, as the result of the sins of the Jews.

Consider - Rather, understand. When Jerusalem is destroyed, the exiles -
taught by adversity - will understand that it was sin which brought ruin
upon their country.

[Jeremiah 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 23:21</span></span>

Ran - i. e., hurried to take upon them the responsibilites of the
prophetic office.

[Jeremiah 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 23:22</span></span>

They should have turned them ... - The work of the true prophet, which
is to turn men from evil unto good.

[Jeremiah 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 23:23</span></span>

At hand - Or, near. An appeal to the omnipotence of God in demonstration
of the wickedness of the prophets. His power is not limited, so that He
can notice only things close to Him, but is universal.

[Jeremiah 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 23:25</span></span>

In [Deu 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md) "a dreamer of dreams" is
used in a bad sense, and with reason. God communicating His will by
dreams was a thing too easy to counterfeit for it not to be misused.

[Jeremiah 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 23:26</span></span>

Some translate, "How long? Is it in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies, and prophesy the deceit of their heart - do they purpose
to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they tell one to
another?"

[Jeremiah 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 23:27</span></span>

To his neighbor - i. e., to one another, to the people about him, to
anyone.

As their fathers ... - Rather, "as their fathers forgot My name through
Baal." The superstition which attaches importance to dreams keeps God as
entirely out of men's minds as absolute idolatry.

[Jeremiah 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 23:28</span></span>

A dream ... faithfully - Rather, as "a dream"... as truth. The dream is
but a dream, and is to be told as such, but God's word is to be spoken
as certain and absolute truth.

The dreams are the chaff, worthless, with nothing in them; the wheat,
the pure grain after it is cleansed and winnowed is God's word. What
have these two in common?

[Jeremiah 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 23:29</span></span>

Like as a fire - God's word is the great purifier which destroys all
that is false and aves, only the genuine metal. Compare [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md).

Like a hammer ... - God's word rouses and strengthens the conscience and
crushes within the heart everything that is evil.

[Jeremiah 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 23:30</span></span>

Jeremiah gives in succession the main characteristics of the teaching of
the false prophets. The first is that they steal God's words from one
another. Having no message from God, they try to imitate the true
prophets.

[Jeremiah 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 23:31</span></span>

That use their tongues - literally, that take their tongues. Their
second characteristic. They have no message from God, but they take
their tongues, their only implement, and say, He saith, using the solemn
formula by which Yahweh affirms the truth of His words. Solemn
asseverations seemed to give reality to their emptiness.

[Jeremiah 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 23:32</span></span>

The third characteristic. See [Jer
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md).

Lightness - Vain, empty, talk.

[Jeremiah 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 23:33</span></span>

Burden - Here a prophecy, either

\(1\) as being something weighty: or

\(2\) a something said aloud.

Isaiah brought the word into general use: Jeremiah never used it, though
his predictions were all of impending evil. The false prophets, however,
applied it in derision to Jeremiah's prophecies, playing upon its double
sense, and so turning solemn realities into mockery (see [Jer
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#034).md).

What burden? - Or, according to another reading, Ye are the burden.

I will even forsake you - Rather, and I will cast you away. From the
idea of a burden the thought naturally arises of refusing to bear it,
and throwing it off.

[Jeremiah 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 23:35</span></span>

The proper words for prophecy. It is to be called an answer when the
people have come to inquire of Yahweh: but His word when it is sent
unasked.

[Jeremiah 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 23:36</span></span>

Every man's word ... - Rather, every man's burden shall be his word; i.
e., his mocking use of the word "burden" shall weigh him down and crush
him.

Perverted - i. e., put into a ridiculous light.

[Jeremiah 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 23:38</span></span>

Since - Or, But if ye say.

[Jeremiah 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 23:39</span></span>

Translate, "Therefore, behold, I will even take you up (or will burden
you), and I will cast you, and the city which I gave you and your
fathers, out of my presence."
