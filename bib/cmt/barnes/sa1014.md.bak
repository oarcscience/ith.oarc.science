### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 14:1</span></span>

Now ... - Rather "and," since this verse is in immediate dependence upon
the preceding. When Jonathan saw the garrison come out again and again,
in defiance "of the armies of the living God," at length "upon a day" he
determined to attack them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 14:2</span></span>

Under a pomegranate - Compare [Sa1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006.md); [Jdg
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md). Saul was at the northern
extremity of Gibeah, about an hour's march from Geba, where Jonathan
was.

Migron, if the reading is correct, must be a different place from the
Migron of [Isa 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 14:3</span></span>

Whether "Ahiah" or "Ahijah" is the same person as "Ahimelech the son of
Ahitub" (see the marginal reference), or whether Ahimelech was the
brother or son of Ahijah, and his successor in the priesthood, it is
impossible to say certainly. Most probably "Ahijah" and "Ahimilech" are
variations of the same name; the latter element in each alone being
different, מלך melek (king) being substituted for the divine name יה
yâhh. Compare "Eliakim" and "Jehoiakim" [Kg2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034.md), "Eliab" and "Eliel" [Ch1
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#027.md), [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034.md).

This fragment of a genealogy is a very valuable help to the chronology.
The grandson of Phinehas, the son of Eli, was now High Priest; and
Samuel, who was probably a few years older than Ahitub the son of
Phinehas, was now an old man. All this indicates a period of about 50
years or upward from the taking of the ark by the Philistines.

The Lord's priest in Shiloh - But as Eli was so emphatically known and
described in 1 Sam. 1-4, as God's Priest at Shiloh, and as there is
every reason to believe that Shiloh was no longer the seat of the ark in
Saul's time (see 1 Sam. 22; [Ch1
13:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003).md), it is better to refer these
words to Eli, and not to Ahijah, to whom the next words, "wearing an
ephod," apply. (See [Sa1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#028.md); [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001) note..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 14:4</span></span>

(The southern cliff was called "Seneh," or "the acacia," and the same
name still applies to the modern valley, dotted by acacias. The northern
cliff was named "Bozez" or "Shining." The valley runs nearly due east,
and the northern cliff is of ruddy and tawny tint, crowned with gleaming
white chalk, and in the full glare of the sun almost all the day.
(Conder.))

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 14:6</span></span>

It is remarkable that the epithet "uncircumcised," used as a term of
reproach, is confined almost exclusively to the Philistines. (Compare
[Sa1 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md), [Sa1
17:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#036.md); [Jdg
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#003.md); [Jdg
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#018), etc..md) This is probably an
indication of the long oppression of the Israelites by the Philistines
and of their frequent wars.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 14:10</span></span>

Though it is not expressly said, as in the case of Gideon [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md), Othniel [Jdg
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md), and others, that the Spirit of
the Lord came upon him, yet the whole course of the narrative,
especially [Sa1 14:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013.md), indicates an
extraordinary divine interposition.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 14:12</span></span>

We will show you a thing - Said mockingly.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 14:14</span></span>

Within as it were an half acre ... - The Hebrew text is extremely
obscure. Hence, there is some probability that the true reading is
preserved by the Septuagint which translates the clause "with darts and
stones and flints of the field." Others take the words to mean: "in
about half the time that a yoke of oxen draw a furrow in the field."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 14:15</span></span>

The earth quaked - This naturally increased the panic to the utmost.
Compare [Sa1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md); [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md); [Psa
114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 14:16</span></span>

Multitude - The word is in [Sa1 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md)
(margin) rendered tumult. It must have the same meaning here. The
sentence is obscure and probably corrupt; perhaps it means, "and behold
the tumult! and it went on" (increased) "melting away and beating down."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 14:18</span></span>

For "the ark," some read "the ephod," owing to the improbability of the
ark being with Saul at this time, and from the verb "Bring hither" being
never applied to the ark, but regularly to the ephod [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Sa1
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007.md). Moreover, not the ark, but the
ephod with Urim and Thummim, was the proper instrument for inquiring of
the Lord. If, however, the Hebrew text is correct, they must have
brought the ark into Saul's camp from Kirjath-jearim 1 Sam. 7, possibly
to be safe from the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 14:19</span></span>

Withdraw thine hand - i. e., "Desist from what thou art about." Saul in
his impatience to join the battle would not wait for the answer from
God, which he had desired Ahijah to inquire for; just as later [Sa1
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#035.md) he would not wait to finish the
altar which he had begun to build. Had he now waited he would doubtless
have avoided the error into which he fell.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 14:20</span></span>

Assembled themselves - See marg. Many versions give the sense "shouted,"
which is far preferable, and only requires a different punctuation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 14:25</span></span>

All they of the land - literally, all the land, probably meaning all
those named in [Sa1 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021.md), who now
flocked to the wood as a rendezvous.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 14:26</span></span>

The honey dropped - Rather, "Behold a stream of honey." The same thing
may be seen in Spain, where in woody and rocky ground copious streams of
honey are often found.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 14:27</span></span>

Were enlightened - i. e., he was refreshed, when he was faint.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 14:28</span></span>

And the people were faint - Read, "are faint," the words are part of the
man's complaint.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 14:29</span></span>

Hath troubled - The same word as was applied to Achan [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md), and gave its name to the valley
of Achor. This additional reference to Joshua is remarkable (compare
[Sa1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 14:31</span></span>

Aijalon. - The modern Yalo. It lies upon the side of a hill to the south
of a fine valley which opens from between the two Bethhorons right down
to the western plain of the Philistines, exactly on the route which the
Philistines, when expelled from the high country about Michmash and
Bethel, would take to regain their own country. Aijalon would be 15 or
20 miles from Michmash.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 14:33</span></span>

Sin against the Lord - See the marginal reference "u." But the
prohibition was older than the Law of Moses [Gen
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004.md). Compare [Act
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md), [Act
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 14:35</span></span>

And Saul built ... - i. e., of the great stone which they had rolled to
kill the oxen and sheep upon, he began to build an altar to Yahweh (see
the margin); but he did not finish it (compare [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024).md), in his haste to pursue the
Philistines that night.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 14:36</span></span>

Then said the priest ... - Ahijah, with equal courage and faithfulness,
worthy of his office as "the priest," when every one else yielded to
Saul's humor, proposed that they should draw near to God to inquire of
Him. (Compare [Kg1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#007)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 14:37</span></span>

Asked counsel - The technical phrase for inquiring of God by Urim and
Thummim, and applied also to inquiry of other oracles.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa1 14:39</span></span>

Saul's rashness becomes more and more apparent. He now adds an
additional oath, to bring down yet further guilt in "taking God's name
in vain" The expressions in [Sa1
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md), [Sa1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#040.md), indicate the fear in which the
people stood of Saul. None dared to resist his will.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 14:41</span></span>

Give a perfect lot - The phrase is obscure, but the meaning is probably
as in the margin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 14:47</span></span>

Compare [Sa2 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md). The preceding
narrative shows that before this time Saul had been king in name only,
since his country was occupied by the Philistines, and he could only
muster 600 men, and those but half armed and pent up in a narrow
stronghold. Now, however, on the expulsion of the Philistines from his
country, and the return of the Israelites from their vassalage and from
their hiding places [Sa1 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021.md),
Saul became king in deed as well as in name, and acted the part of a
king through the rest of his reign in defending his people against their
enemies round about. A comprehensive list of these enemies, including
the Ammonite war which had already been described [Sa1
11:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md), and the Amalekite war which
follows in 1 Sam. 15, is given in [Sa1
14:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md). There is not the slightest
indication from the words whether this "taking the kingdom" occurred
soon or really years after Saul's anointing at Gilgal. Hence, some would
place the clause [Sa1 14:47-52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md)
immediately after [Sa1 11:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md), or 1
Sam. 12, as a summary of Saul's reign. The details of the reign, namely,
of the Philistine war in 1 Sam. 13; 14, of the Amalekite war in 1 Sam.
15, and the other events down to the end of [Sa1
31:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md), preceded by the formulary,
[Sa1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md), would then follow according
to the common method of Hebrew historical narrative.

Zobah - This was one of the petty Ara-roman kingdoms flourishing at this
time ([Psa 60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) title.md). It seems to
have been situated between Damascus and the Euphrates.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 14:49</span></span>

This enumeration of Saul's children and chief officers is according to
the analogy of the subsequent annals of David and Solomen's reign. But
the one here called Ishui, is elsewhere (marginal references) called
Abi-nadab; and a fourth son, Esh-baal or Ish-bosheth, is here omitted.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:50](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">sa1 14:50</span></span>

The only other "Ahimaaz" mentioned in Scripture was the son of Zadok the
priest. The word "Ahi" (brother) is frequently found in composition in
names in the High Priest's family, e. g. in Ahijah, Ahimelech. It is not
improbable that Ahimaaz may have been of this family, as marriages
between the reval and priestly houses were not unusual [Kg2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#002.md); [Ch2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011.md), and perhaps it may have been
owing to such a connection that Ahijah was brought into prominence by
Saul. If there be any truth in the above supposition, it would be an
indication that Saul was not married until after his election to the
throne.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">sa1 14:51</span></span>

Read, "And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were
the sons of Abiel." Ner was Saul's uncle.
