### [Esther Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001.md)

[Esther 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 9:1</span></span>

Drew near - Or, "arrived," or "reached the time" specified [Est
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md); [Est
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#012.md).

[Esther 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 9:3</span></span>

All the rulers ... helped the Jews - i. e. the Persians, who formed the
standing army which kept the Empire in subjection, and were at the
disposal of the various governors of provinces, took the Jews' side. The
enemies of the Jews (e. g. [Est 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016).md)
were almost entirely to be found among the idolatrous people of the
subject nations, for whose lives neither the Persians generally, nor
their monarchs, cared greatly.

[Esther 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 9:6</span></span>

By "Shushan the palace (or the fort)," is probably meant the whole of
the upper town, which occupied an area of more than 100 acres, and
contained many residences besides the actual palace. The Jews would not
have ventured to shed blood within the palace-precincts.

[Esther 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 9:7</span></span>

Most of these names are Persian, and readily traceable to Old Persian
roots.

[Est 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010.md)

On the spoil laid they not their hand - As they might have done (see the
margin reference).

[Esther 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 9:15</span></span>

Shushan - Here probably the lower town, which lay east of the upper one,
and was of about the same size (compare the [Est
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006) note.md).

[Esther 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 9:16</span></span>

Seventy and five thousand - The Septuagint gives the number as 15,000;
and this amount seems more in proportion to the 800 slain in Susa.

[Esther 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">est 9:18</span></span>

See [Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md) note.

[Esther 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 9:19</span></span>

The Jews of the villages ... - Rather, "the Jews of the country
districts, that dwelt in the country towns," as distinguished from those
who dwelt in the metropolis.

[Esther 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">est 9:29</span></span>

This second letter of Purim - Mordecai's first letter [Est
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020.md) was to some extent tentative, a
recommendation. The Jews generally having accepted the recommendation
[Est 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#023.md), [Est
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027.md), he and Esther now wrote a second
letter which was mandatory.

[Esther 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">est 9:31</span></span>

The matters of the fastings and their cry - The Jews of the provinces
had added to the form of commemoration proposed by Mordecai certain
observances with respect to fasting and wailing, and Mordecai's second
letter sanctioned these.

[Esther 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">est 9:32</span></span>

As "the book" elsewhere in Esther always means a particular book - "the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia" - [Est
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023.md); [Est
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md); [Est
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002.md) it seems best to give it the same
sense here.
