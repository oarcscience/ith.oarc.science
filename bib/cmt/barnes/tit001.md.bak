*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Titus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

This chapter embraces the following points:

1\. The usual inscription and salutation; [Tit
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md). In this Paul declares himself
to be the author of the epistle, and asserts in the strongest manner his
claims to the apostleship. He alludes to the great cause in which, as an
apostle, he was engaged - as acting under the eternal plan of God for
the salvation of the elect, and appointed to communicate the glorious
truths of that system which had been now revealed to mankind. The object
of this seems to be to impress the mind of Titus with his right to give
him instruction.

2\. A statement of the object for which Titus had been left in Crete,
and the general character of the work which he was to perform there;
[Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md).

3\. The qualifications of those who were to be ordained to the ministry;
[Tit 1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md). The characteristics laid
down are substantially the same as in 1 Tim. 3.

4\. Reasons for great caution and prudence in thus appointing elders
over the churches; [Tit 1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010.md). Those
reasons arose from the character of the Cretans. There were many
deceivers there, and the character of the Cretans was such that there
was great danger that they who professed to be Christians would be
hypocritical, and if put into the eldership that they would do great
injury to the cause.

5\. A solemn charge to Titus to rebuke them faithfully for their
prevailing and characteristic vices, and to avoid giving any countenance
to that for which they were so much distinguished; [Tit
1:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md).

[Titus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 1:1</span></span>

Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ - See notes at
[Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); compare the notes at [Co1
9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md).

According to the faith of God's elect - Compare the [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md) note; [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md) note; [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md) note. The meaning of the word
rendered here, "according to" - κατὰ kata - is, probably, with reference
to; that is, he was appointed to be an apostle with respect to the faith
of those whom God had chosen, or, in order that they might be led to
believe the gospel. God had chosen them to salvation, but he intended
that it should be in connection with their believing, and, in order to
that, he had appointed Paul to be an apostle that he might go and make
known to them the gospel. It is the purpose of God to save His people,
but he does not mean to save them as infidels, or unbelievers. He
intends that they shall be believers first - and hence he sends his
ministers that they may become such.

And the acknowledging of the truth - In order to secure the
acknowledgment or recognition of the truth. The object of the
apostleship, as it is of the ministry in general, is to secure the
proper acknowledgment of the truth among men.

Which is after godliness - Which tends to promote piety towards God. On
the word rendered godliness, see the notes at [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). - The truth, the acknowledgment
of which Paul was appointed to secure, was not scientific, historical,
or political truth: it was that of religion - that which was adapted to
lead men to a holy life, and to prepare them for a holy heaven.

[Titus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 1:2</span></span>

In hope of eternal life - Margin, for. Greek, ἐπ ̓ ἐλπίδι ep' elpidi.
This does not mean that Paul cherished the hope of eternal life, but
that the "faith of the elect," which he aimed to secure, was in order
that people might have the hope of eternal life. The whole system which
he was appointed to preach was designed to secure to man a well-founded
hope of salvation; compare the notes, [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md).

Which God, that cannot lie - On the phrase" cannot lie," see the notes
at [Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md). The fact that God cannot
lie; that it is his nature always to speak the truth; and that no
circumstances can ever occur in which He will depart from it, is the
foundation of all our hopes of salvation.

Promised - The only hope of salvation is in the promise of God. It is
only as we can have evidence that He has assured us that we may be
saved, that we are authorized to cherish any hope of salvation. That
promise is not made to us as individuals, or by name, but it becomes
ours:

\(1\) because He has made a general promise that they who repent and
believe shall be saved; and,

\(2\) because, we may have evidence that we have repented, and do
believe the gospel. If this is so, we fairly come under the promise of
salvation, and may apply it to ourselves.

Before the world began - That is, the purpose was then formed, and the
promise may be considered as in fact then made; - for a purpose in the
mind of God, though it is not as yet made known, is equivalent to a
promise; compare the [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md) note;
[Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md) note.

[Titus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 1:3</span></span>

But hath in due times - At the proper time; the time which he had
intended; the best time: see the notes at [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md); compare the notes at [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md).

Manifested his word through preaching - See the notes at [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md). The meaning here is, that he has
made known his eternal purpose through the preaching of the gospel;
compare the notes at [Rom 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md).

Which is committed unto me - Not exclusively, but in common with others;
see the notes at [Ti2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011.md).

According to the commandment of God our Saviour - Paul always claimed to
be divinely commissioned, and affirmed that he was engaged in the work
of preaching by the authority of God; see [Gal
1:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); [Rom
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md).

[Titus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 1:4</span></span>

To Titus - See the Introduction, Section 1.

Mine own son - Notes, [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md).

After the common faith - The faith of all Christians; - equivalent to
saying "my son in the gospel." That is, Paul had been the means of
converting him by preaching that gospel which was received by all who
were Christians.

Grace, mercy, and peace ... - See the notes at [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).

[Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 1:5</span></span>

For this cause left I thee in Crete - Compare the notes, [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md). On the situation of Crete, see
the Introduction, Section 2.

That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting - Margin,
"left undone." The Greek is: "the things that are left;" that is, those
which were left unfinished; referring, doubtless, to arrangements which
had been commenced, but which for some cause had been left incomplete.
Whether this had occurred because he had been driven away by
persecution, or called away by important duties demanding his attention
elsewhere, cannot now be determined. The word rendered "set in order",
ἐπιδιορθώσῃ epidiorthōsē, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It
means, properly, "to make straight upon, and then to put further to
rights, to arrange further." Robinson, Lexicon - There were things left
unfinished which he was to complete. One of these things, and perhaps
the principal, was to appoint elders in the various cities where the
gospel had been preached.

And ordain - The word "ordain" has now acquired a technical
signification which it cannot be shown that it has in the New Testament.
It means, in common usage, to "invest with a ministerial function or
sacerdotal power; to introduce, and establish, and settle in the
pastoral office with the customary forms and solemnities" (Webster); and
it may be added, with the idea always connected with it, of the
imposition of hands. But the word used here does not necessarily convey
this meaning, or imply that Titus was to go through what would now be
called an ordination service. It means to set, place, or constitute;
then, to set over anything, as a steward or other officer (see [Mat
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045.md); [Luk
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md); [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003).md), though without reference to any
particular mode of investment with an office; see the word, "ordain,"
explained in the notes at [Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md);
[Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). Titus was to appoint or
set them over the churches, though with what ceremony is now unknown.
There is no reason to suppose that he did this except as the result of
the choice of the people; compare the notes at [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md).

Elders - Greek: Presbyters; see the word explained in the notes at [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). These "elders," or
"Presbyters," were also called "bishops" (compare the notes at [Ti1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001).md), for Paul immediately, in
describing their qualifications, calls them bishops: - "ordain elders in
every city - if any be blameless - for a bishop must be blameless," etc.
If the elders and bishops in the times of the apostles were of different
ranks, this direction would be wholly unmeaningful. It would be the same
as if the following direction were given to one who was authorized to
appoint officers over an army: "Appoint captains over each company, who
shall be of good character, and acquainted with military tactics, for a
Brigadier General must be of good character, and acquainted with the
rules of war." - That the same rank is denoted also by the terms
Presbyter and Bishop here, is further apparent because the
qualifications which Paul states as requisite for the "bishop" are not
those which pertain to a prelate or a diocesan bishop, but to one who
was a pastor of a church, or an evangelist. It is clear, from [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md), that those whom Titus was to
appoint were "bishops," and yet it is absurd to suppose that the apostle
meant prelatical bishops, for no one can believe that such bishops were
to be appointed in "every city" of the island. According to all modern
notions of Episcopacy, one such bishop would have been enough for such
an island as Crete, and indeed it has been not infrequently maintained
that Titus himself was in fact the Bishop of that Diocese. But if these
were not prelates who were to be ordained by Titus, then it is clear
that the term "bishop" in the New Testament is given to the Presbyters
or elders; that is, to all ministers of the gospel. That usage should
never have been departed from.

In every city - Crete was anciently celebrated for the number of its
cities. In one passage Homer ascribes to the island 100 cities (Iliad
ii. 649), in another, 90 cities (Odyssey xix. 174). It may be presumed
that many of these cities were towns of not very considerable size, and
yet it would seem probable that each one was large enough to have a
church, and to maintain the gospel. Paul, doubtless, expected that Titus
would travel over the whole island, and endeavor to introduce the gospel
in every important place.

As I had appointed thee - As I commanded thee, or gave thee direction -
διεταξάμην dietaxamēn - This is a different word from the one used in
the former part of the verse - and rendered "ordain" - καθίστημι
kathistēmi. It does not mean that Titus was to ordain elders in the same
manner as Paul had ordained him, but that he was to set them over the
cities as he had directed him to do. He had, doubtless, given him oral
instructions, when he left him, as to the way in which it was to be
done.

[Titus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 1:6</span></span>

If any be blameless, the husband of one wife - See the notes at [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md).

Having faithful children - See the notes at [Ti1
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md). That is, having a family
well-governed, and well-trained in religion. The word here - πιστὰ pista
- applied to the children, and rendered faithful, does not necessarily
mean that they should be truly pious, but it is descriptive of those who
had been well-trained, and were in due subordination. If a man's family
were not of his character - if his children were insubordinate, and
opposed to religion - if they were decided infidels or scoffers, it
would show that there was such a deficiency in the head of the family
that he could not be safely entrusted with the government of the church;
compare the notes at [Ti1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005.md). It is
probably true, also, that the preachers at that time would be selected,
as far as practicable, from those whose families were all Christians.
There might be great impropriety in placing a man over a church, a part
of whose family were Jews or heathens.

Not accused of riot - That is, whose children were not accused of riot.
This explains what is meant by faithful. The word rendered "riot" -
ἀσωτία asōtia - is translated excess in [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md), and riot in [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md); [Pe1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md). It does not elsewhere occur in
the New Testament, though the word riotous is found in [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md); see it explained in the notes
at [Eph 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md). The meaning here is,
that they should not be justly accused of this; this should not be their
character. It would, doubtless, be a good reason now why a man should
not be ordained to the ministry that he had a dissipated and disorderly
family.

Or unruly - Insubordinate; ungoverned; see the notes, [Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md); [Luk
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004.md).

[Titus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 1:7</span></span>

For a bishop must be blameless - [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md).

As the steward of God - See notes, [Co1
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md). A man, in order to perform the
duties of such an office, should be one against whom no accusation could
lie.

Not self-willed - Compare [Pe2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md).
The word - αὐθάδης authadēs - does not elsewhere occur in the New
Testament. It means, properly, self-complacent; and then, assuming,
arrogant, imperious; Robinson, Lexicon - The gist of the offence - the
very "head and front" - is that of being self-complacent; a trait of
character which, of necessity, makes a man imperious, dogmatical,
impatient of contradiction, and unyielding. Such a man, evidently, is
not fit for the office of a minister of the gospel.

Not soon angry - See notes, [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md),
and the margin there.

Not given to wine - Notes, [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md).

No striker - Notes, [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md).

Not given to filthy lucre - In 1 Tim. 3, "Not given of filthy lucre."
The same Greek word is used.

[Titus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 1:8</span></span>

But a lover of hospitality - Notes, [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md).

A lover of good men - Margin, "or things." The Greek (φιλάγαθος
philagathos) means, a lover of good, and may apply to any thing that is
good. It may refer to good men, as included under the general term good;
and there is no more essential qualification of a bishop than this. A
man who sustains the office of a minister of the gospel, should love
every good object, and be ever ready to promote it; and he should love
every good man, no matter in what denomination or country he may be
found - no matter what his complexion, and no matter what his rank in
life; compare the notes at [Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md).

Sober - Notes, [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md).

Just - Upright in his dealings with all. A minister can do little good
who is not; compare the notes at [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md).

Holy - Pious, or devout. Faithful in all his duties to God; Notes, [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md).

Temperate - ἐγκρατῆ egkratē. Having power or control over all his
passions. We apply the term now with reference to abstinence from
intoxicating liquors. In the Scriptures, it includes not only that, but
also much more. It implies control over all our passions and appetites.
See it explained in the notes at [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md); compare [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md); [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md); [Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023.md).

[Titus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 1:9</span></span>

Holding fast the faithful word - That is, the true doctrines of the
gospel. This means that he is to hold this fast, in opposition to one
who would wrest it away, and in opposition to all false teachers, and to
all systems of false philosophy. He must be a man who is firm in his
belief of the doctrines of the Christian faith, and a man who can be
relied on to maintain and defend those doctrines in all circumstances;
compare notes, [Th2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md).

As he hath been taught - Margin, "in teaching." Greek "According to the
teaching." The sense is, according to that doctrine as taught by the
inspired teachers of religion. It does not mean as he had individually
been taught; but he was to hold the faith as it was delivered by those
whom the Saviour had appointed to make it known to mankind. The phrase
"the doctrine," or "the teaching," had a sort of technical meaning,
denoting the gospel as that which had been communicated to mankind, not
by human reason, but by teaching.

That he may be able by sound doctrine - By sound teaching, or
instruction; Notes, [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md). He was not to dictate, or to
denounce; but to seek to convince by the statement of the truth; see the
notes at [Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md).

Both to exhort and to convince - To persuade them, or to bring them over
to your views by kind exhortation, and by the instruction which shall
convince. The former method is to be used where men know the truth, but
need encouragement to follow it; the latter, where they are ignorant, or
are opposed to it. Both exhortation and argument are to be used by the
ministers of religion.

The gainsayers - Opposers Literally, those who speak against; that is,
against the truth; Notes, [Rom 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md).

[Titus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 1:10</span></span>

For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers - There are
many persons who are indisposed to submit to authority (see the word
unruly in [Tit 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006).md); many who are vain
talkers - who are more given to talk than to the duties of practical
religion (see the character of "Talkative," in the Pilgrim's Progress);
and many who live to deceive others under the mask of religion. They
make great pretensions to piety; they are fluent in argument, and they
urge their views in a plausible manner.

Specially they of the circumcision - Jews, spoken of here as "of the
circumcision" particularly, because they urged the necessity of
circumcision in order that men might be saved; Notes, [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md). This proves that there were not
a few Jews in the island of Crete.

[Titus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 1:11</span></span>

Whose mouths must be stopped - The word here rendered stopped -
ἐπιστομιζειν epistomizein - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It
means, properly, to check, or curb, as with a bridle; to restrain, or
bridle in; and then, to put to silence. It is, of course, implied here
that this was to be done in a proper way, and in accordance with the
spirit of the gospel. The apostle gives Timothy no civil power to do it,
nor does he direct him to call in the aid of the civil arm. All the
agency which he specifies as proper for this, is that of argument and
exhortation. These are the proper means of silencing the advocates of
error; and the history of the church shows that the ministers of
religion can be safely entrusted with no other; compare [Psa
32:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md).

Who subvert whole houses - Whole families; compare [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md); [Ti2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006.md). That is, they turn them aside
from the faith.

Teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake - For
gain. That is, they inculcate such doctrines as will make themselves
popular, and as will give them access to the confidence of the people.
They make it their first object to acquire influence as ministers of
religion, and then abuse that in order to obtain money from the people.
This they would doubtless do under many pretences; such as that it was
needful for the support of the gospel, or for the relief of the poor, or
perhaps for the assistance of distant Christians in persecution.
Religion is the most powerful principle that ever governs the mind; and
if a man has the control of that, it is no difficult thing to induce men
to give up their worldly possessions. In all ages, there have been
impostors who have taken advantage of the powerful principle of religion
to obtain money from their deluded followers. No people can be too
vigilant in regard to pretended religious teachers; and while it is
undoubtedly their duty to contribute liberally for the support of the
gospel, and the promotion of every good cause, it is no less their duty
to examine with care every proposed object of benevolence, and to watch
with an eagle eye those who have the disbursement of the charities of
the church. It is very rare that ministers ought to have much to do with
disposing of the funds given for benevolent purposes; and when they do,
they should in all cases be associated with their lay brethren; see
Paley's Horae Paulinae, chap. iv., No. 1, 3, note; compare [Co1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003.md). On the phrase "filthy lucre,"
see the notes at [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md).

[Titus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 1:12</span></span>

One of themselves - That is, one of the Cretans. The quotation here
shows that Paul had his eye not only on the Jewish teachers there, but
on the native Cretans. The meaning is, that, alike in reference to
Jewish teachers and native-born Cretans, there was need of the utmost
vigilance in the selection of persons for the ministry. They all had
well-known traits of character, which made it proper that no one should
be introduced into the ministry without extreme caution. It would seem,
also, from the reasoning of Paul here, that the trait of character here
referred to pertained not only to the native Cretans, but also to the
character of the Jews residing there; for he evidently means that the
caution should extend to all who dwelt on the island,

Even a prophet of their own - Or, a poet; for the word "prophet" -
προφήτης prophētēs - like the Latin word "vates," was often applied to
poets, because they were supposed to be inspired of the muses, or to
write under the influence of inspiration. So Virgil, Ecl. ix. 32: Et me
fecere poetam Pierides ...me quoque dicunt vatem pastores. Varro, Ling.
Lat. vi. 3: Vates poetae dicti sunt. The term "prophet" was also given
by the Greeks to one who was regarded as the interpreter of the gods, or
who explained the obscure responses of the oracles. As such an
interpreter - as one who thus saw future events, he was called a
prophet; and as the poets claimed much of this kind of knowledge, the
name was given to them. It was also given to one who was regarded as
eminently endowed with wisdom, or who had that kind of sagacity by which
the results of present conduct might be foreseen, as if he was under the
influence of a kind of inspiration.

The word might have been applied to the person here referred to -
Epimenides - in this latter sense, because he was eminently endowed with
wisdom. He was one of the seven wise men of Greece. He was a
contemporary of Solon, and was born at Phaestus, in the island of Crete,
b.c. 659, and is said to have reached the age of 157 years. Many
marvelous tales are told of him (see Anthon, Class. Dic) which are
commonly supposed to be fabulous, and which are to be traced to the
invention of the Cretans. The event in his life which is best known is,
that he visited Athens, at the request of the inhabitants, to prepare
the way by sacrifices for the introduction of the laws of Solon. He was
supposed to have contact with the gods, and it was presumed that a
special sacredness would attend the religious services in which he
officiated. On this account, also, as well as because he was a poet, the
name prophet may have been given him. Feuds and animosities prevailed at
Athens, which it was supposed such a man might allay, and thus prepare
them for the reception of the laws of Solon. The Athenians wished to
reward him with wealth and public honors; but he refused to accept of
any remuneration, and only demanded a branch of the sacred olive tree,
and a decree of perpetual friendship between Athens and his native city.
After his death, divine honors were paid to him by the Cretans. He wrote
a poem on the Argonautic expedition, and other poems, which are now
entirely lost. The quotation here is supposed to be made from a treatise
on oracles and responses, which is also lost.

The Cretians are always liars - This character of the Cretans is
abundantly sustained by the examples adduced by Wetstein. To be a
Cretan, became synonymous with being a liar, in the same way as to be a
Corinthian, became synonymous with living a licentious life; compare
Introduction to 1 Corinthians, Section 1. Thus, the scholiast says,
παροιμία ἐστι τὸ κρητίζειν ἐπὶ τοῦ ψεύδεσθαι paroimia esti to krētizein
epi tou pseudesthai - "to act the Cretan, is a proverb for to lie." The
particular reason why they had this character abroad, rather than other
people, is unknown. Bishop Warburton supposes that they acquired it by
claiming to have among them the tomb of Jupiter, and by maintaining that
all the gods, like Jupiter, were only mortals who had been raised to
divine honors. Thus the Greeks maintained that they always proclaimed a
falsehood by asserting this opinion. But their reputation for falsehood
seems to have arisen from some deeper cause than this, and to have
pertained to their general moral character. They were only more eminent
in what was common among the ancient pagan, and what is almost universal
among the pagan now; compare the notes at [Eph
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md).

Evil beasts - In their character, beasts or brutes of a ferocious or
malignant kind. This would imply that there was a great want of
civilization, and that their want of refinement was accompanied with
what commonly exists in that condition - the unrestrained indulgence of
wild and ferocious passions. See examples of the same manner of speaking
of barbarous and malicious men in Wetstein.

Slow bellies - Mere gormandizers. Two vices seem here to be attributed
to them, which indeed commonly go together - gluttony and sloth. An
industrious man will not be likely to be a gormandizer, and a
gormandizer will not often be an industrious man. The mind of the poet,
in this, seems to have conceived of them first as an indolent, worthless
people; and then immediately to have recurred to the cause - that they
were a race of gluttons, a people whose only concern was the stomach;
compare [Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md). On the connection
between gluttony and sloth, see the examples in Wetstein. Seldom have
more undesirable, and, in some respects, incongruous qualities, been
grouped together in describing any people. They were false to a proverb,
which was, indeed, consistent enough with their being ferocious - though
ferocious and wild nations are sometimes faithful to their word; but
they were at the same time ferocious and lazy, fierce and gluttonous -
qualities which are not often found together. In some respects,
therefore, they surpassed the common depravity of human nature, and
blended in themselves ignoble properties which, among the worst people,
are usually found existing alone. To mingle apparently contradictory
qualities of wickedness in the same individual or people, is the height
of depravity; as to blend in the same mind apparently inconsistent
traits of virtuous character, or those which exist commonly, in their
highest perfection, only alone, is the highest virtue.

This witness is true - That is, this testimony long before borne by one
of their own number, was true when the apostle wrote to Titus. The fact
that this was the general Character of the people, was a reason why he
should be on his guard in introducing men into the ministry, and in the
arrangement of affairs pertaining to the church. That it was true, see
proofs in Wetstein.

Wherefore rebuke them - Notes, [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md).

Sharply - ἀποτόμως apotomōs - "cuttingly, severely" - from ἀποτέμνω
apotemnō, "to cut off." The word is used here in the sense of severity,
meaning that the reproof should be such as would be understood, and
would show them plainly the wickedness of such traits of character. He
was not to be mealy-mouthed, but he was to call things by their right
names, and not to spare their faults. When men know that they are doing
wrong, we should tell them so in few words; if they do not know it, it
is necessary to teach them, in order to convince them of their error.

That they may be sound in the faith - That they may not allow the
prevailing vices to corrupt their views of religion.

Not giving heed to Jewish fables ... - See the notes at [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

And commandments of men that turn from the truth - Notes, [Mat
15:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md).

[Titus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 1:15</span></span>

Unto the pure all things are pure - See the notes at [Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md), [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md). There is probably an allusion
here to the distinctions made in respect to meats and drinks among the
Jews. Some articles of food were regarded as "clean," or allowed to be
eaten, and some as "unclean," or forbidden. Paul says that those
distinctions ceased under the Christian dispensation, and that to those
who had a conscience not easily troubled by nice and delicate questions
about ceremonial observances, all kinds of food might be regarded as
lawful and proper; compare the notes at [Ti1
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md). If a man habitually maintains a
good conscience in the sight of God, it will be accepted of him whether
he do or do not abstain from certain kinds of food; compare the notes at
[Col 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md). This passage, therefore,
should not be interpreted as proving that all things are right and
lawful for a Christian, or that whatever he may choose to do will be
regarded as pure, but as primarily referring to distinctions in food,
and meaning that there was no sanctity in eating one kind of food, and
no sin in another, but that the mind was equally pure whatever was
eaten.

The phrase has a proverbial cast, though I know not that it was so
fused. The principle of the declaration is, that a pure mind - a truly
pious mind - will not regard the distinctions of food and drink; of
festivals, rites, ceremonies, and days, as necessary to be observed in
order to promote its purity. The conscience is not to be burdened and
enslaved by these things, but is to be controlled only by the moral laws
which God has ordained. But there may be a somewhat higher application
of the words - that every ordinance of religion, every command of God,
every event that occurs in divine Providence, tends to promote the
holiness of one who is of pure heart. He can see a sanctifying tendency
in everything, and can derive from all that is commanded, and all that
occurs, the means of making the heart more holy. While a depraved mind
will turn every such thing to a pernicious use, and make it the means of
augmenting its malignity and corruption, to the pure mind it will be the
means of increasing its confidence in God, and of making itself more
holy. To such a mind everything may become a means of grace.

But unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure -
Everything is made the means of increasing their depravity. No matter
what ordinances of religion they observe; what distinctions of meats, or
drinks, or days they regard, and what events of Providence occur, all
are the occasion of augmented depravity. Such distinctions in food they
make the means of fostering their pride and producing
self-righteousness; the mercies of God they abuse to pamper their own
lusts, and the afflictive events of Divine Providence they make the
occasion of murmuring and rebellion. Naturally corrupt at heart, no
ordinances of religion, and no events of Providence, make them any
better, but all tend to deepen their depravity. A sentiment similar to
this is found in the classic writers. Thus Seneca, Epis. 98. Malus
animus omnia in malum vertit, etiam quae specie optimi venerunt. So
again (de Beneficiis v. 12), (Quemadmodum stomachus morbo vitiatus, et
colliques bilem, quoscunque acceperit cibos mutat - ita animus caecus,
quicquid fill commiseris, id onus suum et perniciem facited.

But even their mind and conscience is defiled - It is not a mere
external defilement - a thing which they so much dread - but a much
worse kind of pollution, that which extends to the soul and the
conscience. Everything which they do tends to corrupt the inner man more
and more, and to make them really more polluted and abominable in the
sight of God. The wicked, while they remain impenitent, are constantly
becoming worse and worse. They make everything the means of increasing
their depravity, and even these things which seem to pertain only to
outward observances are made the occasion of the deeper corruption of
the heart.

[Titus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">tit 1:16</span></span>

They profess that they know God - That is, the Jewish teachers
particularly, who are referred to in [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md). All those persons were
professors of religion, and claimed that they had a special knowledge of
God.

But in works they deny him - Their conduct is such as to show that they
have no real acquaintance with him.

Being abominable - In their conduct. The word here used - βδελυκτοὶ
bdeluktoi - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means that
which is detestable, or to be held in abhorrence.

And disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate - Margin, "void of
judgment." On the word here used - ἀδοκίμος adokimos - see the [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md) note; [Co2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md) note. It means here that in
reference to everything that was good, their conduct was such that it
could not be approved, or deserved disapprobation. It was for this
reason; from the character of the people of the island of Crete, and of
those who claimed to be teachers there enforcing the obligation of the
Mosaic law, that it was so important for Titus to exercise special care
in introducing men into the ministry, and in completing the arrangements
contemplated in the organization of the churches there. Yet is this
character confined to them? Are there none now who profess that they
know God, but in works deny him; whose conduct is such that it ought to
be abhorred; who are disobedient to the plain commands of God, and whose
character in respect to all that pertains to true piety is to be
disapproved by the truly pious, and will be by God at the last day?
Alas, taking the church at large, there are many such, and the fact that
there are such persons is the grand hindrance to the triumphs of
religion on the earth. "The way to heaven is blocked up by dead
professors of religion."
