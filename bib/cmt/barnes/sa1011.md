### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 11:1</span></span>

Nahash was king of the children of Ammon, as appears from [Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012). He seems to have been connected
with the family of David, since Abigail, David's sister, was "the
daughter (perhaps granddaughter) of Nahash" [Sa2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025); [Ch1
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016); and, perhaps, in consequence
of this connection, he and his family were very friendly to David [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027).

Jabesh-Gilead must have been re-populated after its destruction (see
marginal reference). The Ammonites and Moabites resented the possession
of Gilead by the Israelites [Jdg
10:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006); 11.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 11:3</span></span>

The elders - Observe the universal form of civil government among the
Israelites, by elders ([Jdg 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#014), [Jdg
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#016), etc.).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 11:4</span></span>

They came to Gibeah on account of the connection between the Benjamites
and the people of Jabesh Judg. 21.

In the ears of the people - They did not even inquire for Saul, so
little was he looked upon as king. [Sa1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#005) shows how completely he was still
in a private and humble station.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 11:6</span></span>

This time the Spirit of God came upon him, as upon the Judges before
him, as a Spirit of supernatural energy and power.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 11:7</span></span>

Though not expressly stated, it is doubtless implied that he sent the
portions by the messengers to the twelve tribes, after the analogy, and
probably in imitation, of [Jdg 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029).
He made use of the revered name of Samuel to strengthen his own weak
authority. Samuel accompanied Saul in the expedition [Sa1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#012).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 11:8</span></span>

He numbered them - This was done to see who was absent (compare [Jdg
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#009)).

Bezek has been conjectured to be the name of a district rather than of a
town. Two villages retained the name in the time of Eusebius 17 miles
from Nablous, on the way to Beth-shean.

The children of Israel and the men of Judah - This looks like the
language of later times, times perhaps subsequent to the establishment
of the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Israel here (including
Benjamin) is as ten to one compared with Judah. This is about the true
proportion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 11:9</span></span>

The distance from Bezek to Jabesh-Gilead would perhaps be about twenty
miles.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 11:10</span></span>

Tomorrow - Probably the last of the "seven days' respite" [Sa1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003). Their words were spoken in
guile, to throw the Ammonites off their guard.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 11:11</span></span>

The march from Bezek may have begun the night before. This disposition
of the forces "in three companies" (imitating Gideon's strategy, compare
the marginal reference.) would not have been made until the morning when
they were very near the Ammonitish forces. "The morning watch" was the
last of the three watches, of four hours each, into which the night was
anciently divided by the Hebrews. (See [Jdg
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#019) note.) The time thus indicated
would be between two and six in the morning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 11:13</span></span>

There shall not a man ... - An instance of great moderation, as well as
good policy, on the part of Saul. Compare David's conduct (marginal
reference).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 11:14</span></span>

Let us go to Gilgal - i. e., to Gilgal by Jericho, where was a famous
sanctuary, in the tribe of Benjamin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 11:15</span></span>

Made Saul king - The Septuagint has another reading, "and Samuel
anointed Saul king there." The example of David, who, besides his
original anointing by Samuel [Sa1
16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012), was twice anointed, first as
king of Judah [Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004), and again as
king over all Israel [Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003), makes
it probable that Saul was anointed a second time; but this may be
included in the word "made king" (see [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003), [Sa1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#005)).
