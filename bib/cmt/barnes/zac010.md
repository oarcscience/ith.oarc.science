### [Zechariah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 10:1</span></span>

Ask ye of the Lord rain - "Ask and ye shall receive" our Lord says.
Zechariah had promised in God's name blessings temporal and spiritual:
all was ready on God's part; only, he adds, ask them of the Lord, the
Unchangeable, the Self-same not of Teraphim or of diviner, as Israel had
done aforetime Isa. 2:5-22; [Jer
44:15-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015.md). He had promised, "If ye
shall hearken diligently unto My coramandments, to love the Lord your
God, I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
rain and the latter rain, and I will send grass in thy field for thy
cattle" [Deu 11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013.md). God bids them
ask Him to fulfill His promise. The "latter rain" alone is mentioned, as
completing what God had begun by the former rain, filling the ears
before the harvest. Both had been used as symbols of God's spiritual
gifts, and so the words fit in with the close of the last chapter, both
as to things temporal and eternal. Osorius: "He exhorts all frequently
to ask for the dew of the divine grace, that what had sprung up in the
heart from the seed of the word of God, might attain to full ripeness."

The Lord maketh bright clouds - (Rather) "lightnings, into rain," as
Jeremiah says, "He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the
earth; He maketh lightnings into rain" [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md); [Jer
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016.md); and the Psalmist, "He maketh
lightnings into rain" [Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007.md),
disappearing as it were into the rain which follows on them. "And giveth
them." While man is asking, God is answering. "Showers of rain" , "rain
in torrents," as we should say, or "in floods," or, inverted, "floods of
rain." "To every one grass," rather, "the green herb, in the field," as
the Psalmist says, "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and
green herb for the service of men" ([Psa
104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md), see also [Gen
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030.md); [Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018).md). This He did with individual
care, as each had need, or as should be best for each, as contrariwise
He says in Amos, "I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not
to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon, and the piece,
whereon it rained not, withered" ([Amo
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007); see note.md).

The Rabbis observed these exceptions to God's general law, whereby He
"sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" Matt. 5:49, though
expressing it in their way hyperbolically; , "In the time when Israel
doeth the will of God, He doeth their will; so that if one man alone,
and not the others, wants rain, He will give rain to that one man; and
if a man wants one herb alone in his field or garden, and not another,
He will give rain to that one herb; as one of the saints used to say,
This plot of ground wants rain, and that plot of ground wants not rain"
(Cyril). Spiritually the rain is divine doctrine bedewing the mind and
making it fruitful, as the rain doth the earth. So Moses saith, "My
doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as
the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass"
[Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md). Cyril: "The law of Moses
and the prophets were the former rain."

[Zechariah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 10:2</span></span>

For the teraphim have spoken vanity - Rather, "spake vanity." He appeals
to their former experience. Their father had sought of idols, not of
God; therefore they went into captivity. The "teraphim" were used as
instruments of divination. They are united with the "ephod," as
forbidden, over against the allowed, means of enquiry as to the future,
in Hosea, "without an ephod and without teraphim" [Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md); they were united in the mingled
worship of Micah [Jdg 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005.md); [Jdg
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md), [Jdg
18:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#017.md), [Jdg
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#020.md); Josiah "put" them "away"
together with the "workers with familiar spirits and the wizards" [Kg2
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md), to which are added, "the
idols." It was probably, a superstition of Eastern origin. Rachel
brought them with her from her father's house, and Nebuchadnezzar used
them for divination. [Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md).
Samuel speaks of them, apparently, as things which Saul himself
condemned. "Rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness as
iniquity or idolatry, and teraphim" [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md). For it was probably in those
his better days, that "Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits
and wizards out of the land" [Sa1
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003.md). Samuel then seems to tell him,
that the sins to which he clave were as evil as those which he had, in
an outward zeal, like Jehu, condemned. Anyhow, the "teraphim" stand
united with the "divination" which was expressly condemned by the law
[Deu 18:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#013.md). The use of the teraphim
by Rachel [Gen 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md), [Gen
31:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034.md) and Michal [Sa1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md), [Sa1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#016) (for whatever purpose.md) implies
that it was some less offensive form of false worship, though they were
probably the "strange gods" [Gen 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002.md),
[Gen 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004.md) which Jacob bade his
household to put away, or, anyhow, among them, since Laban calls them,
"my gods" [Gen 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030.md), [Gen
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#032.md).

Zechariah uses anew the words of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, "Hearken ye not
to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to
your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers" [Jer
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md); and, "let not your prophets and
your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken
to your dreams, which ye cause to be dreamed" [Jer
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md); and Ezekiel, "While they see
vanity unto thee, while they divine a lie unto thee" ([Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md); add [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028).md). The words not only joined on
the prophet's warning with the past, but reminded them of the sentence
which followed on their neglect. The echo of the words of the former
prophets came to them, floating, as it were, over the ruins of the
former temple.

Therefore they went their way as a flock - Which, having no shepherd, or
only such as would mislead them, removed, but into captivity. "They were
troubled." The trouble lasted on, though the captivity ended at the
appointed time. Nehemiah speaks of the exactions of former governors,
"The former governors which were before me, laid heavy weights upon the
people, and took from them in bread and wine, after forty shekels of
silver; also their servants used dominion over the people; and I did not
so, because of the fear of God" [Neh
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015.md).

Because there was no shepherd - As Ezekiel said of those times, "They
were scattered, because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to
all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered: My flock was
scattered upon all the face of the earth; and none did search or seek
after them" [Eze 34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005.md).

[Zechariah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 10:3</span></span>

Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds - As Ezekiel continued,
"Thus saith the Lord God; Behold I am against the shepherds, and I will
require My flock at their hand" [Eze
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#010.md).

I punished the he-goats - The evil powerful are called the "he-goats of
the earth: [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md); and in Ezekiel
God says, "I will judge between cattle and cattle, between rams and
he-goats" [Eze 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md); and our Lord
speaks of the reprobate as goats, the saved as sheep [Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md). God "visited upon these in His
displeasure, "because" He "visited His flock, the people of Judah," to
see to their needs and to relieve them.

And hath made them as the goodly horse - As, before, He said, "I made
thee as the sword of a mighty man" [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md) Judah's might was not in himself;
but, in God's hands, he had might like and above the might of this
world; he was fearless, resistless; as Paul says, "the weapons of our
warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
strongholds" [Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md).

[Zechariah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 10:4</span></span>

Out of him came forth - Or rather, "From him is the corner," as
Jeremiah, "Their nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor
shall go forth from the midst of them" [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md). Her strength, though given by
God, was to be inherent in her, though from her too was to come He who
was to be "the head-corned-stone," the sure Foundation and Crowner of
the whole building.

From thee the nail - An emblem of fixedness in itself, (as Isaiah says,
"I will fasten him a nail to a sure place" [Isa
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023).md) and of security given to others
dependent on Him, as Isaiah says further, "And they shall hang upon him
all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, from
the vessels of cups to the vessels of flagons" [Isa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024.md); all, of much or little account,
the least and the greatest. Osorius: "Christ is the cornerstone; Christ
is the nail fixed in the wall, whereby all vessels are supported. The
word of Christ is the bow, whence the arrows rend the king's enemies."

From it every exactor shall go forth together - God had promised [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md) that no "oppressor," or "exactor
[Isa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md), shall pass through them
anymore." He seems to repeat it here. "From thee shall go forth every
oppressor together; go forth," not to return: as lsaiah had said, "Thy
children shall make haste to return; thy destroyers and they that made
thee waste shall go forth of thee" [Isa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017.md). "From it, its cornerstone; from
it, the sure nail; from it, the battle bow; from it," he no longer
unites closely with it, that which should be from it, or of it, but -
"from it shall go forth every oppressor together;" one and all, as we
say; a confused pele-mele body, as Isaiah, "all that are found of thee
are bound together" [Isa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#003.md);
"together shall they all perish" [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md); or, in separate clauses, "they
are all of them put to shame; together they shall go into confusion"
[Isa 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016.md).

[Zechariah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 10:5</span></span>

And they - (the house of Judah , of whom he had said, He hath made them
as the goodly horse in the battle) shall be as mighty men, trampling on
the mire of the streets Micah had said, "she shall be a trampling, as
the mire of the streets" [Mic 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md),
and David, "I did stamp them as the mire of the street" [Sa2
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043.md). Zechariah, by a yet bolder
image, pictures those trampled upon, as what they had become, "the mire
of the streets," as worthless, as foul; as he had said, "they shall
trample on the sling-stones" [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md). And they shall fight, because
the Lord is with them, not in their own strength, he still reminds them;
they shall have power, because God empowers them; strength, because God
strengthens them : in presence of which, the goodly war-horse of God,
human strength, "the riders on horses, shall be ashamed."

[Zechariah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 10:6</span></span>

I will bring them again to place them - Zechariah seems to have
condensed into one word two of Jeremiah, "I will bring them again" unto
this place, and "I will cause them to dwell" safely [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md). Kimchi. It is not a confusion
of forms, but the blending of two words into one. So also Ibn Ezra):
"The two ideas are here both implied, he will cause them to return to
their land, and will cause them to dwell there in peace and security."

For I will have mercy upon them - Dionysius: "For the goodness and
lovingkindness of God, not any merits of our's, is the first and
principal cause of our whole salvation and grace. Therefore the Psalmist
says, 'neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right hand and Thine
arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a favor unto
them' [Psa 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)."

And they shall be, as though I had not cast them off - (Etymologically,
"loathed," "cast off as a thing abhorrent" .) God is ever "the God of
the present." He does not half-forgive. "Their sins and their iniquities
I will remember no more" [Heb 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012.md).
God casts off the sinner, as being what he is, a thing abhorrent, as
penitence confesses of itself that it is "a dead dog, a loathsome worm,
a putrid corpse." God will not clothe with a righteousness, which He
does not impart. He restores to the penitent all his lost graces, as
though he had never forfeited them, and cumulates them with the fresh
grace whereby He converts him (see vol. i. on [Joe
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025), pp. 192, 193.md). It is an entire
re-creation. "They shall be, as though I had not cast them off." "I will
settle you as in your old estates, and will do good, more than at your
beginnings, and ye shall know that I am the Lord" [Eze
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011.md).

For I am the Lord their God, and will hear them - As He says by Malchi,
"I am the Lord; I change not" [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md). His unchangeableness belongs to
His Being; "I Am; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed;" and by
Hosea, "The Lord of hosts, The Lord is His memorial, therefore turn thou
to thy God" ([Hos 12:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005), (6, 7 Heb..md)
See vol. i. pp. 119, 120). Because God was "their God," and as surely as
He was "their God," He would hear them. His Being was the pledge of His
hearing. "I, the Lord, will hear them; I, the God of Israel, will not
forsake them" [Isa 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md).

[Zechariah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 10:7</span></span>

And Ephraim, they shall be like a mighty man - Prophecy, through the
rest of the chapter, turns to Ephraim, which had not yet been restored.
With regard to them, human victory retires out of sight, though
doubtless, when their wide prison was broken at the destruction of the
Persian empire, many were free to return to their native country, as
others spread over the West in Asia Minor, Greece, Rome, and so some may
have taken part in the victories of the Maccabees. Yet not victory, but
strength, gladness beyond natural g adness, as through wine, whereby the
mind is exhilarated above itself; and that, lasting, transmitted to
their children, large increase, holy life in God, are the outlines of
the promise.

Their heart shall rejoice in the Lord - [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md) : "As the principal object, the
first, highest, most worthy Giver of all good, to whom is to be referred
all gladness, which is conceived from created goods, that 'whose
glorieth may glory in the Lord' [Co2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#017.md), in whom alone the rational
creature ought to take delight."

[Zechariah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 10:8</span></span>

I will hiss for them - Formerly God had so spoken of His summoning the
enemies of His people to chastise them. "It shall be in that day, that
the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost part of the
rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria, and
they shall come, and shall rest all of them in. the desolate valleys,
and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns and upon all bushes"
[Isa 7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md). "He will hiss unto them
from the ends of the earth, and behold they shall come with speed
swiftly; none shall be weary or stumble among them" . He would gather
them, like the countless numbers of the insect creation, which, if
united, would irresistibly desolate life. He would summon them, as the
bee-owner, by his shrill call, summons and unites his own swarm. Now,
contrariwise God would summon with the same His own people. The
fulfillment of the chastisement was the earnest of the ease of the
fulfillment of the mercy.

For I have redeemed them - Then they are His, being redeemed at so dear
a price. Dionysius: "For Christ, as far as in Him lay, redeemed all."
God had done this in purpose, as John speaks of "the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world" [Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md).

And they shall increase as they increased - Kimchi: "As they increased
in Egypt, so shall they increase at that time." The marvels of God's
favor in Egypt shall be repeated. The increase there had been promised
beforehand. "Fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of
thee a great nation" [Gen 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003.md). The
fulfillment is recorded, "the children of Israel were fruitful, and
increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
the land was filled with them" [Exo
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007.md). God appointed that this should be
part of their confession at their yearly prosperity, the offering of the
basket of first-fruits; "A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he
went into Egypt and sojourned there with a few, and became there a
nation, great, mighty, and populous" [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md). The Psalmist dwelt upon it. "He
increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies"
[Psa 105:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#024.md). It became then one of the
resemblances between the first deliverance and the last. Dionysius: "For
the Apostles and others converted from Judaism, had more spiritual
children, all those whom they begat in Christ, than the synagogue ever
had after the flesh."

[Zechariah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 10:9</span></span>

And I will sow them among the nations - Such had been the prophecy of
Hosea; "I will sow her unto Me in the earth," as the prelude of
spiritual mercies, "and I will have mercy on her that had not obtained
mercy, and I will say to not-my-people, Thou art My people, and they
shall say, my God" . Hosea's saying, "I will sow her in the earth" that
is, the whole earth and that "to Me," corresponds to, and explains
Zechariah's brief saying, "I will sow them among the nations." The
sowing, which was future to Hosea, had begun; but the purpose of the
sowing, the harvest, was wholly to come; when it should be seen, that
they were indeed sown by God, that "great" should "be the day of
Jezreel" ([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md). See vol. i. p.
25). And Jeremiah said, "Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah, with the seed of
man and with the seed of beast" [Jer
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027.md). The word is used of sowing to
multiply, never of mere scattering .

And they shall remember Me in far countries - So Ezekiel had said, "And
they that escape of you shall remember Me among the nations, whither
they shall be carried captive - and they shall loath themselves for the
evils which they have committed in all their abominations, and they
shall know that I am the Lord" [Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md).

And shall live - As Ezekiel again says, "Ye shall know that I am the
Lord, when I open your graves, and bring you up out of your graves, O My
people, and shall put My Spirit in you, and ye shall live" [Eze
37:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013.md). "With their children." A
continuous gift, as Ezekiel, "they and their children, and their
children's children forever: and My servant David shall be their prince
forever." [Eze 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md).

And turn again - To God, being converted, as Jeremiah had been bidden to
exhort them; "Go and proclaim these words toward the north" [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md), the cities of the Medes whither
they were carried captive, "and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel,
and I will not cause Mine anger to fall upon you;" "Turn, O backsliding
children - and I with take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and
will bring you to Zion, and I will give you pastors according to Mine
heart" [Jer 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md). "Return, ye
backsliding children; I will heal your backslidings." And they answer,
"Behold, we come unto Thee; for Thou art the Lord our God" [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022.md). So Isaiah had said, "A remnant
shall return, the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God" . Dionysius:
"They shall return by recollection of mind and adunation and
simplification of the affections toward God so as ultimately to intend
that one thing, which alone is necessary."

[Zechariah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 10:10</span></span>

I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt - Individuals had
fled to Egypt ; but here probably Egypt and Assyria stand, as of old,
for the two great conflicting empires, between which Israel lay, at
whose hands she had suffered, and who represent the countries which lay
beyond them. Hosea unites ([Hos
11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md); [Isa
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); add [Isa
19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md); [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md); [Isa
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md); [Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012). See ab. p. 96.md), "the West,
Assyria, Egypt," the three then known divisions of the world, Europe,
Asia, Africa (see at [Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md), vol.
i., p. 115). Asshur, after Nineveh perished, stands clearly for the
world-empire of the East at Babylon , and then in Persia [Ezr
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md). Balaam includes under Asshur,
first Babylon, then the third world-empire ([Num

Babylon, which was first subject to Nineveh, then subjected it, was at a
later period known to Greek writers (who probably had their information
from Persian sources) as part of Assyria .

And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon - Their old
dwellings, east and west of Jordan. "And place shall not be found for
them, as Isaiah says, "The children of thy bereaved estate shall yet say
in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place, that I may
dwell" [Isa 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md).

And He - that is, Almighty God, shall pass through the sea, affliction
As He says, "When thou walkest through the waters, I will be with thee;
and through the rivers, they shall not oveflow thee. And shall smite the
waves in the sea" [Isa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md), as in
Isaiah, "The Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea"
[Isa 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md). The image is from the
deliverance of Egypt: yet it is said, that it should not be any exact
repetition of the miracles of Egypt; it would be as the Red Sea [Exo
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md), [Exo
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#012.md), which would as effectually shut
them in, and in presence of which they might again think themselves
lost, through which God would again bring them. But it would not be the
Red sea itself; for "the sea" through which they should be brought,
would be "affliction;" as our own poet speaks of "taking arms against a
sea of troubles." Cyril: "The promise of succor to those who believe in
Christ is under the likeness of the things given to those of old; for as
Israel was conveyed across the Red sea, braving the waves in it; "for
the waters stood upright as an heap" [Exo
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008.md), God bringing this to pass
marvelously; and as "they passed the Jordan on foot" [Jos
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017.md); so he says, those who are called
through Moses to the knowledge of Christ, and have been saved by the
ministries of the holy Apostles, they shall pass the waves of this
present life, like an angrily foaming sea, and, being removed from the
tumult of this life, shall, undisturbed, worship the true God. And they
shall pass through temptations, like sweeping rivers, saying with great
joy, in like way, "Unless the Lord had been for us, may Israel now say,
the waters had drowned us, the stream had gone over our souls" [Psa
124:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md).

He shall smite the waves in the sea. There, where the strength of the
powers of this world is put forth against His people, there He will
bring it down. "All the deeps of the river," that is, of the Nile ,

"Shall be dried up." The Nile as a mighty river is substituted for the
Jordan, symbolizing the greater putting forth of God's power in the
times to come.

And the pride of Asshur shall be brought down - Ribera: "When the good
receive their reward, then their enemies shall have no power over them,
but shall be punished by Me, because they injured My elect. - By the
Assyrians and Egyptians he understands all their enemies."

[Zechariah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#012.md)

I will strengthen them in the Lord - As our Lord said to Paul, "My
strength is made perfect in weakness," and Paul said in turn, "When I am
weak, then am I strong. And in His Name shall they walk up and down,"
have their whole conversation (Dionysius), "in Him according to His
will, and diligent in all things to speak and act in ills grace and
divine hope." Jerome: "Christians walk in the Name of Christ, and there
is written on the new white stone given to them a "new name" [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md), and under the dignity of a name
so great, they walk with God, as "Enoch walked and pleased God and was
translated" [Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md).

Saith the Lord - Dionysius: "Again the Lord God speaks of the Lord God,
as of Another, hinting the plurality of Persons in the Godhead."
