Introduction to Philemon

Section 1. The History of Philemon

On Philemon, to whom this Epistle was addressed, almost nothing more is
known than can be ascertained from the Epistle itself. It is short, and
of a private character; but it is a bright and beautiful gem in the
volume of inspiration.

From [Col 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009.md), it may be inferred that
the person to whom it was addressed was an inhabitant of Colossae, since
Onesimus, concerning whom this Epistle was written, is there mentioned
as "one of them." See the notes on that verse; compare the ingenious
remarks of Paley, Hor. Paul., on Colossians, No. IV. He is said by
Calmet and Michaelis to have been wealthy; but this cannot be determined
with certainty, though it is not improbable. The only circumstances
which seem to indicate this, are, that Onesimus had been his "servant,"
from which it has been inferred that he was an owner of slaves; and that
he appears to have been accustomed to show hospitality to strangers, or,
as Michaelis expresses it, "traveling Christians;" see [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md) of the Epistle. But these
circumstances are not sufficient to determine that he was a man of
property. There is no evidence, as we shall see, that he was a
slave-holder; and Christians in moderate circumstances were accustomed
to show hospitality to their brethren. Besides, it is not said in [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md) that he was accustomed to show
general hospitality; but Paul merely asks him to provide for him a
lodging. It is probable that he had been accustomed to remain with him
when he was in Colossae.

It is quite clear that he had been converted under the ministry of the
apostle himself. This appears from what is said in [Plm
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019.md); "I do not say to thee how thou
owest unto me even thine own self." This cannot be understood otherwise
than as implying that he had been converted under his preaching, unless
the apostle, on some former occasion, had been the means of saving his
life, of which there is no evidence. Indeed, it is manifest, from the
general tone of the Epistle, that Philemon had been converted by the
labors of the author. It is just such a letter as it would be natural
and proper to write on such a supposition; it is not one which the
apostle would have been likely to write to any one who did not sustain
such a relation to him. But where and when he was converted, is unknown.
It is possible that Paul may have met with him at Ephesus; but it is
much more probable that he had himself been at Colossae, and that
Philemon was one of his converts there. See the introduction to the
Epistle to the Colossians.

It is evident from the Epistle that Paul regarded him as a sincere
Christian; as a man of strict integrity; as one who could be depended on
to do right. Thus [Plm 1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005.md), he says
that he had heard of his "love and faith toward the Lord Jesus, and
toward all saints;" thus he confidently asks him to provide for him a
lodging when he should come [Plm 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md);
and thus he expresses the assured belief that he would do what was right
towards one who had been his servant, who, having been formerly
unfaithful, was now converted, and, in the estimation of the apostle,
was worthy of the confidence and affection of his former master.

In regard to his rank in the Christian church, nothing whatever is
known. Paul calls him [Plm 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md) his
"fellow-laborer;" but this appellation is so general, that it determines
nothing in regard to the manner in which be co-operated with him in
promoting religion. It is a term which might be applied to any active
Christian, whether a preacher, an elder, a deacon, or a private member
of the church. It would seem clear, however, that he was not a traveling
preacher, for he had a home in Colossae [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md), [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md); and the presumption is, that he
was an active and benevolent member of the church, who did not sustain
any office. There are many private members of the churches, to whom all
that is said of Philemon in the Epistle would apply. Yet there have been
various conjectures in regard to the office which he held. Hoffmann
(Introduction a.d. Lection. Eph. a.d. Colossenses, 18) supposes that he
was bishop of Colossae; Michaelis supposes that he was a deacon in the
church; but of either of these, there is no evidence whatever.

Nothing is known of his age, his profession, or of the time and
circumstances of his death. Neither is it certainly known what effect
this Epistle had on him, or whether he again received Onesimus under his
roof. It may be presumed, however, that such a letter, addressed to such
a man, would not fail of its object.

Section 2. The Occasion upon which the Epistle was written

This can be learned only from the Epistle itself, and there the
circumstances are so marked as to make a mistake impossible.

\(1\) Philemon had had a servant of the name of Onesimus. Of the
character of this servant, before Paul became acquainted with him,
nothing more is known than that he had been "unprofitable" to Philemon
[Plm 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md), and that he bad probably
done him some wrong, either by taking his property, or by the fact that
he had escaped from him; [Plm 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018.md). It
is not necessary to suppose that he was a slave: for all that is implied
of necessity in the word which is employed to designate his condition in
[Plm 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016) (δοῦλος doulos.md), and all
that is stated of him in the Epistle, would be met by the supposition
that he was bound to Philemon, either by his parents or guardians, or
that he had bound himself to render voluntary service; see the notes at
[Plm 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md).

\(2\) for some cause, this servant had fled from his master, and had
gone to Rome. The cause of his escaping is unknown. It may be that he
had purloined the property of his master, and dreaded detection; or that
he had, by his base conduct in some other way, exposed himself to
punishment; or that he merely desired freedom from oppression; or that
he disregarded the bonds into which he himself, or his parents or
guardians, had entered, and had therefore escaped. Nothing can be
inferred about his condition, or his relation to Philemon, from the fact
that he ran away. It is perhaps quite as common for apprentices to run
away, as it is for slaves; and they who enter into voluntary bonds to
render service to another, do not always regard them.

\(3\) in some way, when at Rome, this servant had found out the apostle
Paul, and had been converted by his instrumentality. Paul says [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md) that he had "begotten him in his
bonds" - ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου en tois desmois mou; which seems to imply
that Onesimus had come to him, and not that Paul had searched him out.
It does not appear that Paul, when a prisoner at Rome, was allowed to go
at large (compare [Act 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030).md), though
he was permitted to receive all who came to him. Why Onesimus came to
the apostle, is not known. It may have been because he was in want, and
Paul was the only one in Rome whom he had ever seen; or it may have been
because his mind had become distressed on account of sin, and he sought
him out to obtain spiritual counsel. Conjecture on these points is
useless, where there is not even a hint that can serve as a clew to find
out the truth.

\(4\) from some cause, equally unknown, Onesimus, when converted, was
desirous of returning to his former master. It is commonly assumed that
his returning again was at the instigation of the apostle, and that this
furnishes an instance of his belief that runaway slaves should be sent
back to their masters. But, besides that there is no certain evidence
that he ever was a slave, there is as little proof that he returned at
the instigation of Paul, or that his return was not wholly voluntary on
his part. For the only expression which the apostle uses on this subject
[Plm 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md), "whom I have sent again" -
ἀνεπέμπσα anapempsa - does not necessarily imply that he even proposed
it to him, still less that he commanded it. It is a word of such general
import, that it would be employed on the supposition that Onesimus
desired to return, and that Paul, who had a strong wish to retain him,
to aid him in the same way that Philemon himself would do if he were
with him (compare [Plm 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013).md), had, on
the whole, concluded to part with him, and to send him again, with a
letter, to his friend Philemon. It is just such language as he would
have used of Timothy, Titus, or Epaphroditus, if employed on an
important embassy at the request of the apostle; compare [Luk
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006.md), [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md), [Luk
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#019.md); [Luk
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#013.md); [Act
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#005.md); [Act
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md); [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md); [Co2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003.md); [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md); [Phi
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), [Phi
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023.md), [Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md), [Phi
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028.md); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md), [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md); [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md), for a similar use of the word
"send" (πέμπω pempō).

There is nothing in the statement which forbids us to suppose that
Onesimus was himself disposed to return to Philemon, and that Paul
"sent" him at his own request. To this, Onesimus might have been
inclined from many causes. He may have repented that he left his master,
and had forsaken the comforts which he had enjoyed under his roof. It is
no uncommon thing for a runaway apprentice, or servant, when he has seen
and felt the misery of being among strangers and in want, to wish
himself well back again in the house of his master. Or he may have felt
that he had wronged his master in some way (compare the notes at [Plm
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018).md), and, being now converted, was
desirous of repairing the wrong. Or he may have had friends and kindred
in Colossae whom he was desirous of seeing again. Since any one of
these, or of many other supposable causes, may have induced him to
desire to return to his master, it should not be assumed that Paul sent
him against his will, and thence be inferred that he was in favor of
sending back runaway slaves to their masters against their will. There
are many points to be proved, which cannot be proved, to make that a
legitimate inference; see the notes at [Plm
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md).

\(5\) whatever were the reasons why Onesimus desired to return to
Philemon, it is clear that he was apprehensive of some trouble if he
went back. What those reasons were, it is impossible now to determine
with absolute certainty, but it is not difficult to conjecture what they
may have been, and any of the following will account for his
apprehensions - either:

\(a\) that he had done his master wrong by the mere act of leaving him,
depriving him of valuable services which he was bound to render; or

\(b\) that he may have felt that the mere act of running away had
injured the character of his master, for such an act always implies that
there is something in the dealings of a master which makes it desirable
to leave him; or

\(c\) that he had in some way injured him in respect to property, by
taking that which did not belong to him, [Plm
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018.md); or

\(d\) that he owed his master, and he may have inferred from his leaving
him that he meant to defraud him, [Plm
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018.md); or

\(e\) that the laws of Phrygia were such that Onesimus apprehended that
if he returned, even penitent, it would be judged by his master
necessary to punish him, in order to deter others from committing a
similar offence.

The laws of Phrygia, it is said, allowed the master to punish a slave
without applying to a magistrate. See Macknight. It should be said also
that the Phrygians were a severe people (Curtius, Lib. v. c. 1), and it
is not improbable that, from the customs there, Onesimus may have
apprehended harsh treatment if he returned. - It is not proper to assume
that any one of these was certainly the reason why he feared to return,
for this cannot be absolutely determined. We should not take it for
granted that he had defrauded his master - for that is not necessarily
implied in what is said in [Plm 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018.md),
and we should not impute crimes to men without proof; nor should we take
it for granted that he feared to be punished as a runaway slave - for
that cannot be proved; but someone or more of these reasons doubtless
operated to make him apprehensive that if he returned he would meet
with, at least, a cold reception.

\(6\) to induce his master to receive him kindly again, was the main
object of this courteous and kind Epistle. For a view of the arguments
upon which he urges this, see the Analysis of the Epistle. The arguments
are such, that we should suppose they could not be resisted, and we may
presume, without impropriety, that they had the desired effect upon the
mind of Philemon - but of that we have no certain evidence.

Section 3. The Time and Place of Writing the Epistle

There can be no doubt that this letter was written from Rome about the
time when the Epistle to the Colossians was written; compare the
introduction to that Epistle. The circumstances which conduct to this
conclusion are such as the following:

\(1\) Paul at the time when it was written was a prisoner; [Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md). "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ;" [Plm 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md). "Whom I have
begotten in my bonds;" compare [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023.md). "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in
Christ Jesus."

\(2\) it was written when he had hopes of obtaining his liberty, or when
he had such a prospect of it that he could ask Philemon, with
confidence, to "prepare him a lodging;" [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md).

\(3\) Timothy was with him at the time when it was written [Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md), and we know that Paul desired him
to come to him to Rome when he was a prisoner there as soon as possible;
[Ti2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md). "Do thy diligence to come
shortly unto me."

\(4\) we know that Onesimus was actually sent by Paul to Colossae while
he was a prisoner at Rome, and it would be morally certain that, under
the circumstances of the case, he would send the letter to his master at
that time. No other instance is mentioned in which he sent him to
Colossae, and the evidence is as certain as the nature of the case
admits, that that was the time when the Epistle was written; see [Col
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009.md).

\(5\) the same persons are mentioned in the salutations in the two
Epistles, at least they are so far the same as to make it probable that
the Epistles were written at the same time, for it is not very probable
that the same persons would in another place, and on another occasion,
have been with the apostle. Thus, Aristarchus, Mark, Epaphras, Luke, and
Demas, join in the salutations both to the church at Colossae and to
Philemon. Probably at no other time in the life of Paul were all these
persons with him, than when he was a prisoner at Rome. These
considerations make it clear that the Epistle was written while Paul was
a prisoner at Rome and at about the same time with the Epistle to the
Colossians. If so, it was about a.d. 62.

Section 4. The Character of this Epistle

This letter is almost wholly of a private character, and yet there is
scarcely any portion of the New Testament of equal length which is of
more value. It is exquisitely beautiful and delicate. It is a model of
courtesy and politeness. It presents the character of the author in a
most amiable light, and shows what true religion will produce in causing
genuine refinement of thought and language. It is gentle and persuasive,
and yet the argument is one that we should suppose would have been, and
probably was, irresistible. It is very easy to conceive that the task
which the apostle undertook to perform was one which it would be
difficult to accomplish - that of reconciling an offended master to a
runaway servant. And yet it is done with so much kindness,
persuasiveness, gentleness, and true affection, that, as the letter was
read, it is easy to imagine that all the hostility of the master was
disarmed, and we can almost see him desiring to embrace him who bore it,
not now as a servant, but as a Christian brother; [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md) "It is impossible," says
Doddridge, "to read over this admirable Epistle without being touched
with the delicacy of sentiment, and the masterly address, that appear in
every part of it. We see here, in a most striking light, how perfectly
consistent true politeness is, - not only with all the warmth and
sincerity of a friend, but even with the dignity of the Christian and
the Apostle. And if this letter were to be considered in no other view
than as a mere human composition, it must be allowed to be a
master-piece in its kind.

As an illustration of this remark, it may not be improper to compare it
with an epistle of Pliny, that seems to have been written on a similar
occasion (Lib. ix. Let. 21); which, though penned by one that was
reckoned to excel in the epistolary style, though it has undoubtedly
many beauties, yet must be acknowledged by every impartial reader vastly
inferior to this animated composition of the apostle." As a specimen of
the courtesy and politeness which the Christian ought to practice at all
times, as well as furnishing many valuable lessons on Christian duty
(see the remarks at the close), it deserves a place in the volume of
inspiration; and a material chasm would be produced in the instructions
which are needful for us, if it were withdrawn from the sacred canon.
