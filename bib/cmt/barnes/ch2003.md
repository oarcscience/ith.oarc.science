### [2 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 3:1</span></span>

Where the Lord appeared unto David - The marginal rendering, or "which
was shown to David," is preferred by some; and the expression is
understood to point out to David the proper site for the temple by the
appearance of the Angels and the command to build an altar [Sa2
24:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017.md); [Ch1
21:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md).

In the place that David had prepared - This seems to be the true meaning
of the passage, though the order of the words in the original has been
accidentally deranged.

[2 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 3:3</span></span>

The marginal "founded" gives a clue to another meaning of this passage,
which may be translated: "Now this is the ground-plan of Solomon for the
building, etc."

Cubits after the first measure - i. e., cubits according to the ancient
standard. The Jews, it is probable, adopted the Babylonian measures
during the captivity, and carried them back into their own country. The
writer notes that the cubit of which he here speaks is the old (Mosaic)
cubit.

[2 Chronicles 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 3:4</span></span>

The height was an hundred and twenty cubits - This height, which so much
exceeds that of the main building [Kg1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md), is probably to be corrected by
the reading of the Arabic Version and the Alexandrian Septuagint,
"twenty cubits." But see [Ch2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009.md).

[2 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 3:5</span></span>

The greater house - i. e., the holy place, or main chamber of the
temple, intervening between the porch and the holy of holies (so in [Ch2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#007).md).

He cieled with fir tree - Rather, "he covered," or "lined." The
reference is not to the ceiling, which was entirely of wood, but to the
walls and floor, which were of stone, with a covering of planks
(marginal reference). The word translated "fir" bears probably in this
place, not the narrow meaning which it has in [Ch2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008.md), where it is opposed to cedar, but
a wider one, in which cedar is included.

Palm trees and chains - See [Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md).
The "chains" are supposed to be garlands or festoons.

[2 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 3:6</span></span>

Precious stones for beauty - Not marbles but gems (compare [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002).md). The phrase translated "for
beauty" means "for its beautification," "to beautify it."

Parvaim is probably the name of a place, but what is quite uncertain.

[2 Chronicles 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 3:8</span></span>

The most holy house - i. e., the sanctuary, or holy of holies. On the
probable value of the gold, see [Kg1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 3:9</span></span>

The upper chambers - Compare [Ch1
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011.md). Their position is uncertain.
Some place them above the holy of holies, which was ten cubits, or
fifteen feet lower than the main building (compare [Kg1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md), [Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020).md); others, accepting the height of
the porch 120 cubits [Ch2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md), regard
the "upper chambers" or "chamber" ὑπερῷον huperōon, Septuagint), as
having been a lofty building erected over the entrance to the temple;
others suggest that the chambers intended are simply the uppermost of
the three sets of chambers which on three sides surrounded the temple
(see [Kg1 6:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md). This would seem to
be the simplest and best explanation, though we cannot see any reason
for the rich ornamentation of these apartments, or for David's special
directions concerning them.

[2 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 3:10</span></span>

The word translated "image work," or, in the margin, "moveable work,"
occurs only in this passage, and has not even a Hebrew derivation.
Modern Hebraists find an Arabic derivation, and explain the word to mean
"carved work."

[2 Chronicles 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 3:11</span></span>

The wings of the cherubims - Compare [Kg1
6:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#024.md).

[2 Chronicles 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 3:13</span></span>

Their faces were inward - literally, as in the margin. Instead of
looking toward one another, with heads bent downward over the mercy
Seat, like the cherubim of Moses [Exo
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#009.md), these of Solomon looked out from
the sanctuary into the great chamber ("the house"). The cherubim thus
stood upright on either side of the ark, like two sentinels guarding it.

[2 Chronicles 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 3:14</span></span>

This is an important addition to the description in Kings, where the
veil is not mentioned. It was made of exactly the same colors as the
veil of the tabernacle [Exo 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md).

[2 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 3:15</span></span>

Of thirty and five cubits - See [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md) note. Some suppose that there has
been a corruption of the number in the present passage.

[2 Chronicles 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 3:16</span></span>

As in the oracle - This passage is probably corrupt. Our translators
supposing that a single letter had fallen out at the beginning of the
word translated "in the oracle," supplied "as." But we have no reason to
suppose there were any "chains" or "festoons" in the "oracle" or most
holy place.
