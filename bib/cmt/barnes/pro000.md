Introduction to Proverbs

1\. The opening words of the book [Pro
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md) give us its current Hebrew title,
of which the first word has been adopted by translators, and "Proverbs"
has become the common heading of the book in the Septuagint, the
Vulgate, and the King James Version. At one time a title of honor, the
Book of Wisdom, or the "all-excellent wisdom," was applied by both Jews
and Christians to this book, indicating that the book took its place, as
the representative of the Wisdom of which the Hebrews thought so much,
at the head of the whole class of books, canonical or apocryphal, which
were known as Sapiential.

The Hebrew word for "proverb" (משׁל mâshâl) has a much more definite
significance than the Greek παροιμία paroimia, and the Latin
"proverbium." Its root-meaning is that of comparison, the putting of
this and that together, noting likeness in things unlike; it corresponds
to the Greek παραβολή parabolē rather than παροιμία paroimia. That it
was applied also to moral apophthegms of varying length, pointed and
pithy in their form, even though there might be no similitude, is
evident enough throughout the book.

Proverbs are characteristic of a comparatively early stage in the mental
growth of most nations. A single startling or humorous fact serving as
the type of all similar facts (e. g., [Sa1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#012).md); the mere result of an
induction to which other instances may be referred (e. g., [Sa1
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#013).md); a law, with or without a
similitude, or explaining in this manner the course of events in the
lives of men or in the history of their nation [Jer
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md); [Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md) : these things furnish proverbs
found in the history of all nations, generally in its earlier stages.
There is little or no record of their birth. No one knows their author.
They find acceptance with people from their inherent truth or semblance
of truth. Afterward, commonly at a much later period, people make
collections of them.

2\. The Book of Proverbs, however, is not such a collection. So far as
it includes what had previously been current in familiar sayings, there
was a process of selection, guided by a distinct didactic aim -
excluding all that were local, personal, or simply humorous, and
receiving those which fell in with the ethical purpose of the teacher.
As in the history of other nations, so among the Hebrews (compare [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031).md), there rose up, at a certain
stage of culture, those to whom the proverb was the most natural mode of
utterance, who embodied in it all that they had observed or thought out
as to the phenomena of nature or of human life. So pre-eminently was the
sage to whose authorship the Book of Proverbs is assigned - Solomon, the
son of David.

The definite precision of [Kg1 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032.md)
leads to the inference that there was at the time when that book was
written a known collection of sayings ascribed to Solomon far longer
than the present book, and of songs which are almost, or altogether,
lost to us. The scope of that collection may probably have included a
far wider range of subjects (such as trees, creatures, etc.), than the
present book, which is from first to last ethical in its scope, deals
but sparingly, through the larger portion of its contents, with the
world of animals and plants, and has nothing that takes the form of
fable.

3\. The structure of the book shows, however, that it is a compilation
from different sources as well as a selection from the sayings of one
man only; and a compilation which, in its present form, was made some
three centuries after the time of Solomon. One considerable section of
the book consists of proverbs that were first arranged and written out
under Hezekiah [Pro 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md). Agur [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) and Lemuel [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md) are named as the authors of the
last two chapters. The book is, therefore, analogous in its composition
to the Psalms; it is an anthology from the sayings of the sages of
Israel, taking its name from him who was the chiefest of them, just as
the Book of Psalms is an anthology from the hymns not only of David, but
also of the sons of Korah and others.

The question as to how far the book gives us the teaching of Solomon
himself, what portions of it may be assigned to him, and what may be
attributed to some later writers, has been answered very differently.
However, certain landmarks present themselves, dividing the book into
sections, each of which is a complete whole.

\(a\) [Pro 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md) is the title and
introduction to the book, describing its contents and aim. There seems
good reason for believing that, though [Pro
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md) gave the original title of the
book, the other verses were added by the last compiler, in whose hands
it took its present shape.

\(b\) [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) is something of a
motto, laying down the principle which is the basis of the whole book.
This may be assigned to the same compiler.

\(c\) Prov. 1:8-9:18; one long exhortation, addressed by the teacher to
his scholar, and each sub-section opening with the words, "my son" or
"my children." In Prov. 8 there is a change to a higher strain. Wisdom
herself speaks, and not to the individual seeker, but to the sons of men
at large [Pro 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md). This
personification of Wisdom as a living power, and the stress laid upon
her greatness and beauty, contrasted with the "strange woman," the
"foreigner," i. e., the harlot or adulteress, whose fascination is most
perilous to the soul entering on its time of trial, are the
characteristic features of this portion.

The whole of this section has been ascribed by some commentators to a
later author than Solomon, on the grounds which are, to say the least,
very uncertain.

Arguments, in favor of the identity of authorship, are not lacking.

\(d\) Prov. 10:1-22:16. The title indicates that the section had an
independent origin. The continuous teaching is replaced by a series of
isolated maxims, short, pithy, antithetic, the true type of the Hebrew
proverbs, hardly ever carried beyond the limits of a single verse,
dealing with the common facts of life, and viewing them from the point
of prudence. This is the kernel of the whole book, representing the
wisdom which made Solomon famous among men. Containing about 400 of
these maxims, it may be thought of as probably a selection from the
larger number referred to in [Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032.md), made possibly under the
direction of the king himself, and prefaced by the more homiletic
teachings of Prov. 1-9. Though there is no systematic order, here and
there two or more verses in succession deal with the same topic in a way
which throws some light on the process by which the selection had been
made, as though there had been something like a commonplace book, in
which, though there was no systematic arrangement, there was a certain
degree of grouping under different heads or catch-words.

Certain phrases too are characteristic of this section. As regards the
substance of the teaching; stress is laid on the thought that Yahweh,
the "Lord," is the supreme Giver of all good, the Judge and Ruler of
mankind, all-knowing, and ordering all things; that the king, thought of
in the ideal greatness which was natural in the time of Solomon, and
hardly so at a later period, was as the counterpart and representative
of Yahweh, an earthly Providence [Pro
16:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md); [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md), [Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md); [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), [Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md), [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md); [Pro
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md).

\(e\) Prov. 22:17-24:22: a section containing the more continuous
teaching, the personal address, of the teacher to his "son" [Pro
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#015.md), [Pro
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#019.md), [Pro
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#026.md); [Pro
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#013.md), [Pro
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#021.md), the same warnings against sins
of impurity [Pro 23:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#027.md), the same
declaration of the end which the teacher has in view [Pro
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017.md), as are met with in Prov.
1-9. It may seem a natural hypothesis that the same writer, having made
the selection which forms the central portion of the book, wrote both
prologue and epilogue to it, and that this, with the short section (f),
was the form in which the book was current until it received its last
additions in the reign of Hezekiah.

\(f\) [Pro 24:23-34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#023.md) : a section with a
new title. "These things also belong to the wise," i. e., are spoken by
them, fulfill the promise of the title [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md) that it would include the "words
of the wise," wherever the compiler found them. Short as the section is,
it presents in the parable of the field of the slothful [Pro
24:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#030.md) some characteristic features
not to be found in the other portions of the book. What had been spoken
before barely and briefly [Pro 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009.md) is
now reproduced with pictorial vividness. What was before a general
maxim, becomes sharper and more pointed as a lesson of experience.

\(g\) Prov. 25-29:27. The superscription of this section presupposes the
existence of a previous collection, known as the Proverbs of Solomon,
and recognized as at once authentic and authoritative. It shows that
there were also current, orally, or in writing, other proverbs not
included in that collection. It brings before us a marked instance of
the activity of that period in collecting, arranging, and editing the
writings of an earlier age. It is a distinct statement, that both the
collection that precedes, and that which follows, were at that time,
after careful inquiry, recognized to be by Solomon himself. The chapters
to which it is prefixed present a general resemblance to the portion
Prov. 10-22:16 which all critics have regarded as the oldest portion of
the book. There is the same stress laid on the ideal excellence of the
kingly office (compare [Pro 25:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002.md)
with [Pro 16:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010).md), the same
half-grouping under special words and thoughts. , of the "righteous" in
[Pro 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#002.md), [Pro
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007.md),[Pro
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#016.md). The average length of the
proverbs is about the same, in most there is the same general
parallelism of the clauses. There is a freer use of direct similitudes.
In one passage [Pro 27:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md) there is,
as an exceptional case, instruction which seems to be economic rather
than ethical in its character, designed, it may be, to upheld the older
agricultural life of the Israelites as contrasted with the growing
tendency to seek wealth by commerce, and so fall into the luxury and
profligacy of the Phoenicians.

\(h\) Prov. 30-31: These two chapters present problems of greater
difficulty, and open a wider field for conjecture. The word translated
"prophecy" ([Pro 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md); [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001); משׂא maśśâ' .md) is elsewhere, with
scarcely an exception, rendered "burden," either in its literal sense,
or, as denoting a solemn speech or oracle, uttered by a prophet (compare
the titles of Isa. 13-23.) If this meaning be received here, it
indicates a marked difference between these chapters and the hortative
addresses, or the collections of apophthegms of which, up to this time,
the book had been composed.

The "prophecy" is addressed to two disciples, Ithiel (compare [Neh
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007).md) and Ucal. Some take these names
to be two ideal names, the first meaning "God is with me," and the
second "I am strong," both names of the same ideal person, the
representative of a divine wisdom, meeting [Pro
30:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md) the confession of ignorance and
blindness. By others the words are treated as not being names at all,
but part of the opening words of Agur himself, the introduction to the
strange complaint, or confession, which opens so abruptly [Pro
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md).

The leading features of the section are less didactic, more enigmatic in
character, as though it corresponded specifically to the "dark sayings"
of [Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md). The phenomena are grouped
into quaternions, and show a strange intermingling of facts belonging to
the brute and to the human world; in this, whensoever and by whomsoever
written, showing the influence of the Book of Job as clearly as the
earlier sections did. Probably, the section is a fragment of a work
written by one belonging originally to the country to which many critics
have been led to refer the Book of Job itself, a proselyte to the faith
which the occurrence of the name Yahweh [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md) proves that the writer had
received. The reign of Hezekiah was conspicuous for the re-opening of
contact with these neighboring nations [Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md), for the admission of converts
from them among the citizens of Zion [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md), and for the zeal shown in
collecting and adding to the canon whatever bore upon it the stamp of a
lofty and heavenly wisdom.

\(i\) [Pro 31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md). Most Jewish and
some Patristic commentators have conjectured that Lemuel is a name for
Solomon, and that the words of his mother's reproof were spoken when the
first promise of his reign was beginning to pass into sensuality and
excess. Others have suggested that Lemuel is simply an ideal name, he
who is "for God," the true king who leads a life consecrated to the
service of Yahweh. We must be content to confess our ignorance as to who
Lemuel was, and what was the occasion of the "prophecy." It probably
belongs to the same period as Prov. 30 and was added to the book not
earlier than the time of Hezekiah.

\(j\) Prov. 31:10-31. The last portion of the book forms, more
distinctly, perhaps, than any other, a complete whole in itself. From
beginning to end, there is but one subject, the delineation of a perfect
wife. The section is alphabetic in its structure. The form may have been
adopted, as in the case of the alphabetic Psalms, partly as a help to
memory, partly from the delight which, in certain stages, generally
comparatively late in the history of literature, is felt in choosing a
structure which presents difficulties and requires ingenuity to overcome
them. The absence of any historical allusions makes it impossible to fix
any precise date for it.

4\. The ethical teaching of the Book of Proverbs rests upon principles
which have their application to the varying circumstances of life.

The book belongs to a period when people had been taught to see more
clearly than before the relative importance of the moral and the
ceremonial precepts which seemed, in the Law of Moses, to stand on the
same level as enjoined by divine authority. The language of Samuel [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md), of Asaph [Psa
50:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013.md), of David [Psa
51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md), had impressed itself on the
minds of the people at large, and on one who, like the writer of the
Book of Proverbs, had grown up under the immediate influence of the
teacher (Nathan) who, after the death of Samuel, stood at the head of
the prophetic order. The tendency to discriminate between moral and
positive obligations thus originated, would be fostered by contact with
other Semitic nations, such as Edom and Sheba, standing on the same
footing as regards the fundamental principles of ethics, but not led, as
Israel had been, through the discipline of typical or symbolic
ordinances. If the Book of Job was already known to the Israelite
seekers after wisdom, the grandeur of its thoughts and the absence in it
of any reference to the Law as such, would strengthen the conviction
that instruction might be given, leading to a life of true wisdom and
holiness and yet not including any direct reference to ceremonial or
ritual precepts. These would be preserved in the traditions of household
life, the example of parents, the teaching of priests and Levites; while
a teacher such as the writer of the Book of Proverbs could aim at laying
the foundation of a godly life independently of them, and exhibit that
life in its completeness.

This accounts for the absence from the Proverbs of all mention of
obligations on which devout Israelites at all times must have laid
stress, and to which Pharisaism in its later developments gave an
exaggerated prominence.

It was this negative characteristic which fitted the book to do a work
which could not otherwise have been done so well, both for the education
of Israel, and for that of mankind at large. The Jew was to be taught to
recognize a common ground upon which he and they alike stood [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md). The Greek, when the sacred
books of Israel were brought before him in his own language, could find
in such a book as Proverbs, that which he could understand and
sympathize with - teaching as to life and its duties, vices and their
penalties, not unlike that which he found in his own literature. It was
significant of the attractive power which this book exercised on the
minds of men during the period between the Old and New Testaments, when
there was no "open vision," and the gift of prophecy was for a time
withdrawn, that the two most prominent books in the collection which we
know as the Apocrypha, the only two, indeed, that have a marked didactic
character, the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus, were based upon its
model, and to a large extent reproduced its precepts.

The teaching of the Book of Proverbs was, however, in its essence,
identical with that which formed the basis of the faith of Israel. Its
morality was not merely the result of a wide observation of the
consequences of good and evil conduct, but was essentially religious.
The constant occurrence of the divine name in the form (יהוה Yahweh),
which was the characteristic inheritance of Israel, and which is more
frequently used than that of God (אלהים 'Elohiym), is in itself a
sufficient proof that there was no surrender of the truth of which that
name was the symbol. The reverence of Yahweh [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) stood in the very front of its
teaching as the beginning of wisdom. The temper thus indicated, that of
awe and reverence, rooted in the consciousness of man's littleness and
weakness in the presence of the Eternal and the Infinite, was at once
the motive and the crown [Pro 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md) of
the life of obedience to the laws of duty which the teaching of the book
enjoins.

If outward prosperity, "length of days," and "riches and honor" [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md); [Pro
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027.md), attach to those who keep His
commandments, men are taught also that He educates and trains them by
"chastening" and "correction" [Pro
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md). All powers of intellect and
speech, all efforts after holiness, are thought of as His gifts [Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001.md), [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009.md), even as people are taught to
recognize His bounty in all the outward blessings of their lives, and in
the family relationships which make up the happiness of home [Pro
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014.md). When people are told to seek
wisdom, they are led on to think of it as clothed with a personal life,
in closest fellowship with the Eternal, inseparably one with Him [Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md), [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md). And, since the wisdom which the
book inculcates is thus raised far above the level of earthly prudence,
so also the reward is more than outward prosperity. "Righteousness
delivereth from death" [Pro 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md),
turns, i. e., the inevitable end of life into a euthanasia. In contrast
with the wicked, of whom it is true that "when he dieth his expectation
shall perish" [Pro 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007.md), it is written
of the righteous that he "hath hope in his death" [Pro
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#032.md).

5\. The application of these principles to practical and social life
presupposes a state of society in which the simplicity of village life
is giving way to the sudden development of the wealth and luxury which
belong to cities. The dangers against which the young are warned with
oft-repeated earnestness are those of extravagance, indebtedness,
drunkenness, impurity leading to open lawlessness, and the life of the
freebooter. Other faults incident to different temperaments are each, in
their turn, held up to reprobation.

With the practical wisdom which is characteristic of the book,
appealing, as it does, to those that are halting between two opinions,
and inclining to the worse, stress is laid not chiefly on the sin but on
the folly of the vice, not on its eternal, but its temporal
consequences. People are urged to act first from secondary, prudential
motives, to shun the poverty, wretchedness, ignominy, which are the
consequences of self-indulgence, that so they may learn the habits of
self-restraint which will make them capable of higher thoughts, and
obedient to the divine law, as finding in that obedience itself their
exceeding great reward. The remedies for these evils the writer or
writers of the Book of Proverbs saw were to be found in education.
Individuals and nations alike needed discipline and restraint.
Individuals would find this in the training of home, in the counsels,
warnings, and, if necessary, the chastisements also, by which the unruly
will is checked and guided; nations, in the stern, inflexible,
incorruptible administration of justice controlled by a wise and
righteous king [Pro 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md), [Pro
16:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012.md); [Pro
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md), [Pro
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md), [Pro
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#028.md). Hence, kings are counseled no
less than subjects [Pro 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016.md); [Pro
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012.md); [Pro
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#004.md) : the king is advised not to rely
too much on his own unaided judgment, but to surround himself with wise
and prudent counselors [Pro 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006.md), and
to refer all to that wisdom, which is the gift of God [Pro
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015.md).

No ethical manual would be complete, unless it assigned to woman, as
well as man, her right position in the social order. From her folly [Pro
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md) and degradation [Pro
2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md); [Pro
5:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md); 7:6-27 spring the worst evils;
in her excellence is the crown and glory of a man's life [Pro
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016.md); [Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md). No picture of ideal happiness is
brighter than that of a home which is thus made perfect with the clear
brightness of true union [Pro 5:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md).
The "prudent wife" is thought of as one of God's best gifts [Pro
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014.md), "building her house" [Pro
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001.md) on the only true foundation. Her
influence on her children is as great as that of their father, if not
greater [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md); [Pro
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md). They owe what they have of
goodness to her loving persuasion. Their sins and follies are a
heaviness and reproach to her [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md); [Pro
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md). They are bound to render to her
a true and loving obedience [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008.md);
[Pro 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020.md). The teaching on this
subject culminates in Prov. 31, consisting as it does:

\(1\) of prophecy or oracular speech as to the office of a king and the
special temptations incident to it, which comes from one who was herself
the mother of a king, and

\(2\) of the picture of a perfect wife, wise, active, liberal,
large-hearted, the ideal which the young man, seeking for the true
blessedness of life, was to keep in view.

6\. The Septuagint, or Greek Version of the Book of Proverbs, presents
several points of interest. What was true of the Septuagint translation
as a whole, that it seemed to bridge over the chasm that had divided the
Jew from the Greek, holds good in a special degree of this part of it.
In making that translation, the Jew would have to familiarize himself
with the terminology of Greek ethical writers, and to note the precise
equivalents for the attributes, moral and intellectual, of which the
book treats so fully. In reading it, the Greek would find himself, far
more than he would in reading law or psalm or prophet, on common ground
on which he and the Jew could meet. The very words with which the Greek
version of the book abounds, such as σοφία sophia, φρόνησις phronēsis,
σύνεσις sunesis, δικαιοσύνη dikaiosunē, were those which were echoing in
every lecture-room in Alexandria. Since the book itself, according to
its traditional authorship, was the first-fruits of that largeness of
heart which admitted contact with other nations and familiarity with
their modes of thought and speech, so the translation tended to give
prominence to that side of Judaism in which it presented itself to
people, not as prophetic, typical, ceremonial, but wholly or chiefly as
a monotheistic system of pure ethics.

Hence, this book, almost alone of the books of the Old Testament, served
as a model for the Hellenistic writers of the two centuries b.c. The
Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach or the son of Sirach (compare
the prologue), probably also other lost books of the same kind,
confessed in their very titles, yet more in their whole structure and
tone, that the Proverbs of Solomon (especially Prov. 8) had left their
stamp upon them.

Philo's language, descriptive of the Logos, is a reflection of the Greek
words in which Wisdom is personified. in the teaching of John, may be
traced, in the highest aspects of Christian theology, the influence of
the vivid portraiture of the personified Sophia of the Proverbs.

It lay in the nature of the case, both as to the thoughts of Philo, and
yet more as to the higher teaching of John, that, so far as the Divine
Wisdom was personified, the masculine, not the feminine, word should
gain the ascendancy. A system in which σοφία sophia had been the
dominant word might have led to an earlier development of that
attractive power of the "ever-feminine," of which Mariolatry was a later
growth; or might have become one in which, as in the rabbinic exegesis
of Prov. 8, Wisdom was identified with the Law given by Moses, and yet
existing before the world was.

An instance, hardly less striking, of the influence exercised by the
teaching of the Greek Version is seen in [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md). If our Lord was speaking of
Himself as ἡ σοφία τοῦ θεοῦ hē sophia tou Theou that sent its prophets
and Apostles into the world and sent them in vain, then we have a direct
indication that He sought to lead His disciples to identify Him with the
personal Wisdom of whom such great things are said in Prov. 8, and who
utters a like complaint [Pro 1:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md).
If, however, the Wisdom of God be taken as the title of some lost book,
the inference is that the teaching of the Book of Proverbs had impressed
itself so deeply on the minds of the Jews of Palestine no less than on
those of Alexandria as to give rise there also to a "Sapiential"
literature in which Wisdom appeared as the sender of those Apostles and
prophets, on whom, as its foundation, the Church was to be built. If,
further, we take in the thought that our Lord's representations of His
work, as they were determined, on one side, by the Messianic language of
Isaiah, were influenced, on another, by the teaching of Prov. 8; 9; the
invitation in [Pro 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md) may be the
source from whence flowed the deeper parable of John 6 and of the Last
Supper; the "house" which Wisdom built, with its στῦλοι ἑπτὰ stuloi
hepta [Pro 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md), the starting-point of
the thought that the Church is the "house of God" [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md), "built" upon the rock [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md) of the Apostles as the στύλοι
stuloi of that house [Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); and the feast which she prepared
[Pro 9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md) the origin of the parable
of the Wedding Feast.

Thus, also, may be explained the stress which Paul lays on the fact that
Christ Jesus ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν σοφία ἀπὸ θεοῦ egenēthē hēmin sophia apo Theou
[Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md), that He is θεοῦ σοφία Theou
sophia [Co1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024.md), that in Him are hid
"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md). Its influence on Patristic
theology is shown by the prominence given to [Pro
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022) (see the note.md) throughout the
Arian controversy; and more remote after-growths of the Greek version of
this book, may be noted in the Achamoth, or Σοφία Sophia, of the Gnostic
systems of Basilides and Valentinus, in the church dedicated by
Constantine to the Divine Wisdom, in the retention of that name by
Justinian when he built the temple which, as the Mosque of Santa Sophia,
still attracts the admiration of Christendom, and lastly, in the
commonness of the personal name Sophia, the only one of its class that
has become popular, while others, such as Irene, Agape, Pistis,
Dikaiosyne, have fallen almost or altogether into oblivion.

The direct use of the Book of Proverbs in the New Testament presents
some special features. Quotations from it are not very numerous, and are
brought in, not with such words as γέγραπται, ἡ γραφὴ λέγει gegraptai,
hē graphē legei, or as coupled with the name of Solomon, but as current
and familiar sayings, as if the book had been used generally in
education and its maxims impressed upon the memory. In almost all cases
the quotations are from the Septuagint Version, in some instances even
where it differs widely from the Hebrew. It will be worth while, as the
circumstances just mentioned often hinder the quotations or allusive
references from attracting the attention of the English reader, to refer
to some, at least, of the more striking examples in parallel columns.

The familiarity of the New Testament writers with the Greek version of
the book is, however, shown in other ways. Over and above their use of
the same ethical terminology (σοφία sophia, σύνεσις sunesis, φρόνησις
phronēsis, ἐπίγνωσις θεοῦ epignōsis Theou, αἴσθησις aisthēsis), its
influence is to be traced in their choice of a word which occupies a
prominent position in the vocabulary of Christendom. In Proverbs,
prophetic stress is laid upon the φόβος θεοῦ phobos Theou as the ἀρχή
σοφίας archē sophias, the groundwork of all virtues: the word occurs
thirteen times, to say nothing of the parallel passages in [Psa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md); [Psa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md); [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md). It might have been expected
that it would be found not less prominent in the teaching of the New
Testament. There, however, it is found but seldom [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md); [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md). It is not difficult to see why
the old phrase was felt to be no longer adequate.

In proportion as Κύριος Kurios came to be identified in men's minds with
the Lord Jesus, and love in return for His love the one constraining
motive, would there seem something harsh and jarring in a phrase which
would come to them as equivalent to "the fear of Christ." Happily, the
Septuagint version of the Book of Proverbs supplied also the synonym
that was needed. In [Pro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md) there is
an alternative rendering, standing in juxtaposition to the other,
namely, εὐσέβεια eusebeia; εὐσέβεια εἰς θεὸν ἀρχὴ αἰσθήσεως eusebeia eis
Theon archē aisthēseōs. The word occurs also in [Pro
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011.md), and in [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md), where also it stands together
with an alternative rendering πνεῦμα φόβου θεοῦ pneuma phobou Theou. The
substantive, and yet more the adjective εὐσεβής eusebēs, occurs with
greater frequency in the Apocryphal books, especially in Ecclesiasticus.
The way was thus prepared for the prominence which the word gains, just
as the necessity was beginning to be felt, in the latest Epistles of the
New Testament. It occurs ten times in the Pastoral Epistles of Paul, and
four times in Second Peter; [Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)
(where the King James Version gives "holiness"), being the only other
passage. The temper of devoutness, reverence, godliness, had thus taken
the place in Christian terminology of the older "fear of the Lord."

For the most part, the choice of the Greek equivalents for the more
prominent ethical or philosophical terms of the Proverbs is singularly
felicitous. The history of the dominant word of the book (חכמה chokmâh),
or more commonly in the plural, חכמות chokmôth, wisdom) is indeed almost
an exact parallel to that of the σοφία sophia by which it was rendered.
As used in the earlier books of the Old Testament [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003.md); [Exo
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#010.md), [Exo
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#031.md), [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md); [Exo
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001.md) it, or its cognate adjective, is
applied to the wisdom of those who had the skill or art which was
required for the ornamentation of the tabernacle. We have traces of a
higher application in [Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md); [Deu
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009.md). As used of the wisdom of Solomon
in 1 Kings, and throughout Job and the Psalms, as in the Proverbs, the
higher prevails exclusively. So, in like manner, Aristotle describes the
gradual elevation of the Greek σοφός sophos, how it was first applied to
sculptors like Pheidias and Polycleitos, how σοφία sophia thus came to
be known as ἀρετὴ τέχνης aretē technēs, then became equivalent to the
highest accuracy in all things, and finally was thought of as οὐδεμίας
γενέσεως oudemias geneseōs, separated altogether from the idea of
art-production. So too, the use of φρόνησις phronēsis for a Hebrew word
indicating the power which divides, discerns, distinguishes, is
appropriate if the chief office of φρόνησις phronēsis be τὰ καθ ̓ ἕκαστα
γνωρίζειν ta kath' hekasta gnōrizein. The general choice of αἴσθησις
aisthēsis rather than ἐπιστήμη epistēmē for the rendering of the
equivalent Hebrew word showed that they recognized the essentially
practical character of the knowledge of which the Proverbs spoke, as
perceiving the right thing to be done, and the right word to be said, in
each detail of life.

Lastly, may be noted here some salient features of this Greek Version.

\(a\) In not a few places it adds to the existing Hebrew; the addition
sometimes having the character of an alternative rendering, sometimes
consisting of entirely new matter.

\(b\) Sometimes the insertions or variations have the character of an
exegetical gloss, toning down or making more explicit what might seem
doubtful or misleading in the original.

The arrangement of the closing chapters in the Greek Version also
presents striking peculiarities, the whole of Prov. 30 and [Pro
31:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md) being inserted after [Pro
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#022.md), as part of the same chapter,
and the acrostic description of the true wife ending the book as Prov.
29. The most probable explanation of the transposition is that it
originated in some accidental dislocation in the manuscript from which
the translation was made.
