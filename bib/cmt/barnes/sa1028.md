### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 28:2</span></span>

Thou shalt know ... - David dissembled (compare also [Sa1
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008)), hoping, no doubt, that
something would happen to prevent his fighting against his king and
country.

Keeper of mine head - Captain of his bodyguard.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 28:3</span></span>

It does not appear when Saul had suppressed witchcraft; it was probably
in the early part of his reign.

Familiar spirits ... wizards - i. e. ventriloquists ... wise or cunning
men. See [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031) note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 28:4</span></span>

Gilboa - Now called Jebel Fukuak. But the ancient name is preserved in
the village of Jelbon, situated on the south side of the mountain. It
was separated from Shunem (see the marginal reference) by the deep
valley of Jezreel. The Philistines either advanced along the seacoast,
and then entered the valley of Jezreel from the west, or they came by
the present road right through Samaria, starting from Aphek [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 28:6</span></span>

When Saul inquired of the Lord ... - It is said [Ch1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#014) that one reason why the Lord
killed Saul, and gave his kingdom to David, was because he inquired not
of the Lord. The explanation of this apparent discrepancy is to be found
in the fact that inquiring of the familiar spirit was positively
antagonistic to inquiring of the Lord. That Saul received no answer -
when he "inquired of the Lord" by dreams, which was an immediate
revelation to himself; by Urim, which was an answer through the high
priest clothed in the ephod; or by prophets, which was an answer
conveyed through some seer speaking by the Word of the Lord [Sa1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005) - was a reason for self-abasement
and self-examination, to find out and, if possible, remove the cause,
but was no justification whatever of his sin in asking counsel of
familiar spirits.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 28:7</span></span>

Enquire - A different word from that in [Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006), though nearly synonymous with
it. It is more frequently applied to inquiry of a false god, as e. g.
[Kg2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002); [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019); [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003).

En-dor (see [Jos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002) note) was seven
or eight miles from the slopes of Gilboa, on the north of little Hermon,
where the Philistines were encamped; so that Saul must have run great
risks in going there.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 28:8</span></span>

Divine - Compare to [Sa1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#002), note;
[Num 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023), note.

Bring me him up - The art of the ventriloquist seems to have been always
connected with necromancy. The Greeks had necromancers who called up
departed spirits to give answers to those who consulted them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 28:11</span></span>

Bring me up Samuel - Dr. Trench observes, "All human history has failed
to record a despair deeper or more tragic than his, who, having forsaken
God and being of God forsaken, is now seeking to move hell; and
infinitely guilty as he is, assuredly there is something unutterably
pathetic in that yearning of the disanointed king to change words with
the friend and counselor of his youth, and if he must hear his doom, to
hear it from no other lips but his" ('Shipwrecks of Faith, ' p. 47).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 28:12</span></span>

It is manifest both that the apparition of Samuel was real, and also
that the woman was utterly unprepared for it.

Why hast thou deceived me ... - She perhaps inferred that Samuel would
have answered the call of none inferior to the king. Or it may be the
presence of an inhabitant of the world of spirits brought a sudden
illumination to her mind.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 28:13</span></span>

Gods - אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym is here used in a general sense of a supernatural
appearance, either angel or spirit. Hell, or the place of the departed
(compare [Sa1 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#019); [Sa2
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#023)) is represented as under the
earth [Isa 14:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009); [Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 28:17</span></span>

To him - Better, "for Himself," as in the margin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 28:19</span></span>

Rather, "will deliver Israel also." Saul had not only brought ruin upon
his own house but upon Israel also; and when Saul and Jonathan fell the
camp (not "host") would be plundered by the conquerors [Sa1
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008); [Sa2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 28:23</span></span>

The bed - Rather, "the bench" or divan, such as in the East still runs
along the wall, furnished with cushions, for those who sit at meals [Est
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006); [Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041).
