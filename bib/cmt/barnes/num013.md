### [Numbers Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md)

And the Lord spake - The mission of the spies was first suggested by the
Israelites themselves. See [Deu 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022.md).

[Numbers 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 13:2</span></span>

A ruler - A comparison of the list with that of [Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001.md) :5 following shows that they were
not the princes of the tribes, but heads of houses or families [Num
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md).

Of the names here given those of Joshua and Caleb alone are otherwise
known to us.

[Numbers 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 13:16</span></span>

Oshea, Hoshea, or Hosea, the name also of the last king of Israel and
the first minor prophet, means "deliverance" or and by the hand of him
who bore the title of "God's salvation." Jehoshua was contracted
(compare [Neh 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017).md) into Jeshua.

[Numbers 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 13:17</span></span>

Southward - Rather, "by the Negeb," or south-country; a well-defined
tract of territory forming the southernmost and least fertile portion of
the land of Canaan and of the subsequent inheritance of Judah. It
extended northward from Kadesh to within a few miles of Hebron, and from
the Dead Sea westward to the Mediterranean (see especially [Jos
15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021).md).

Into the mountain - The hill-country of southern and central Canaan,
mostly within the borders of Judah and Ephraim. It commences a few miles
south of Hebron, and extending northward to the plain of Jezreel, runs
out eventually northwest-ward into the sea in the headland of Carmel.

[Numbers 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 13:19</span></span>

In tents - i. e. in open unwalled villages.

[Numbers 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 13:20</span></span>

The time ... of the firstripe grapes - The first grapes ripen in
Palestine in July and August: the vintage is gathered in September and
October. This indication of date tallies with what we should have
inferred from the previous narrative. For the Israelite host had quitted
Sinai on the 20th day of the second month [Num
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#010.md), [Num
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#011.md), or about the middle of May:
since then they had spent a month at Kibroth-hattaavah and a week at
Hazeroth, and had accomplished, in all, from 150 to 200 miles of march:
it therefore must have been at least the beginning of July, and may have
been a month later, when the spies were despatched into the land of
promise.

[Numbers 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 13:21</span></span>

The wilderness of Zin was the northeastern portion of the wilderness of
Paran.

Rehob ("mod." Khurbeh) was probably the Beth-rehob of [Jdg
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md), near Dan-Laish; and apparently
to the north of it, since it gave its name to a Syrian kingdom [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md). The southern approach to Hamath
from the plain of Coele-Syria, lay between those two ranges of Lebanon
called Libanus and Antilibanus. A low screen of hills connects the
northernmost points of these two ranges; and through this screen the
Orontes bursts from the upper Coele-Syrian hollow into the open plain of
Hamath.

[Numbers 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 13:22</span></span>

The progenitor of the Anakim was Arba "the father of Anak" [Jos
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md), from whom the city of Hebron
took its name of Kirjath-Arba. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai were probably
not individual warriors, but names of three tribes of the Anakim. Hence,
we find them still in existence half a century later, when Caleb, who
now brought tidings of them, became their eventual destroyer [Jos
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md).

Now Hebron ... - This parenthesis explains that these two cities had a
common founder, and were built, or perhaps, at least in the case of Zoan
(Tanis, see [Exo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md), note; [Exo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005), note.md) rebuilt, by the Hyksos, to
which nations, once the conquerors of Egypt, the Anakim perhaps
belonged. The Hyksos fortified and garrisoned Zoan as a defense of their
Eastern frontier.

[Numbers 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 13:23</span></span>

The brook of Eshcol is by some identified with the rich valley
immediately to the north of Hebron; (but by others with Wady Hanein to
the south of Hebron). The valley was, in all likelihood, originally
named after one of the three chiefs who were confederate with Abraham
[Gen 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md); but, as often came to
pass, the Israelites, wittingly or unwittingly, took up in a new and
significant sense the name which they found; and to them the valley thus
became the Valley of the Cluster. Bunches of grapes are found in
Palestine of many pounds weight.

[Numbers 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 13:25</span></span>

After forty days - They had no doubt in this time explored the whole
land. However, it was with the southern part that the Israelites
expected to have to deal immediately: and accordingly it is that which
is particularly referred to in the following verses, Hebron and its
vicinity above all.

[Numbers 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 13:26</span></span>

Kadesh is usually identified with Ain-el-Weibeh, which lies in the
Arabah, about 10 miles north of the place in which Mount Hor abuts on
that valley, (or with Ain-Gadis in Jebel Magrah).

[Numbers 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 13:29</span></span>

The Amalekites - See [Num 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md) note.

The Canaanites - i. e. those of the Phoenician race: the word is here
used in its narrow sense: compare [Gen
10:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015.md) note.

[Numbers 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 13:32</span></span>

A land that eateth up ... - i. e. it is a land which from its position
is exposed to incessant attacks from one quarter and another, and so its
occupants must be always armed and watchful.
