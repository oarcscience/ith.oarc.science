### [Numbers Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 35:2</span></span>

Suburbs - Rather, "pasture-grounds," required for their large cattle,
for their sheep and goats, and for all their beasts whatever they might
be [Num 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#003.md).

[Numbers 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 35:5</span></span>

From without the city - Omit "from." The demarcation here intended would
run parallel to the wall of the city, outside which it was made. To
guard against any restrictions of area, due to such causes as the
irregular forms of the cities or the physical obstacles of the ground,
it was ordained that the suburb should, alike on north, south, east, and
west, present, at a distance of one thousand cubits (or, nearly
one-third of a mile) from the wall, a front not less than two thousand
cubits in length; and, by joining the extremities of these measured
fronts according to the nature of the ground, a sufficient space for the
Levites would be secured.

[Numbers 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 35:6</span></span>

The Levitical cities were in an special manner the Lord's; and therefore
the places of refuge, where the manslayer might remain under the
protection of a special institution devised by divine mercy, were
appropriately selected from among them. No doubt also the Priests and
Levites would be the fittest persons to administer the law in the
doubtful cases which would be sure to occur: compare [Num
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md) note.

[Numbers 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 35:8</span></span>

Nine cities were eventually given to the Levites from the large joint
inheritance of Judah and Simeon; three were taken from the territory of
Naphtali, and the other tribes gave each four apiece.

[Numbers 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 35:12</span></span>

The avenger - Hebrew גאל gā'al, a term of which the original import is
uncertain. The very obscurity of its etymology testifies to the
antiquity of the office which it denotes. That office rested on the
principle of [Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md), "whoso sheddeth
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." The unwritten code of the
East conceded to the nearest kinsman of a murdered man the right of
avenging the blood that had been shed. Such rude justice necessarily
involved grave evils. It gave no opportunity to the person charged with
crime of establishing is innocence; it recognized no distinction between
murder, manslaughter, and accidental homicide; it perpetuated family
blood-feuds, the avenger of blood being liable to be treated in his turn
as a murderer by the kinsman of the man whom he had slain. These
grievances could not be removed as long as there was no central
government, but they might be mitigated; and to do this was the object
of the institution in the text (compare [Exo
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013).md).

Among the Arab tribes, who are under the control of no central
authority, the practice of blood-revenge subsists in full force to the
present day.

The congregation - i. e. local court, consisting of the elders of the
city [Jos 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004.md).

[Numbers 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 35:16</span></span>

The sense is: Inasmuch as to take another man's life by any means
whatsoever is murder, and exposes the murderer to the penalty of
retaliation; so, if the deed is done in hostility, it is in truth actual
murder, and the murderer shall be slain; but if it be not done in
hostility, then the congregation shall interpose to stop the avenger's
hand.

[Num 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#019.md)

When he meeteth him - Provided, of course, it were without a city of
refuge.

[Num 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024.md)

The case of the innocent slayer is here contemplated. In a doubtful case
there would necessarily have to be a judicial decision as to the guilt
or innocence of the person who claimed the right of asylum.

[Num 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025.md)

The homicide was safe only within the walls of his city of refuge. He
became a virtual exile from his home. The provisions here made serve to
mark the gravity of the act of manslaughter, even when not premeditated;
and the inconveniences attending on them fell, as is right and fair,
upon him who committed the deed.

Unto the death of the high priest - The atoning death of the Saviour
cast its shadow before on the statute-book of the Law and on the annals
of Jewish history. The high priest, as the head and representative of
the whole chosen family of sacerdotal mediators, as exclusively
entrusted with some of the chief priestly functions, as alone privileged
to make yearly atonement within the holy of holies, and to gain, from
the mysterious Urim and Thummim, special revelations of the will of God,
was, preeminently, a type of Christ. And thus the death of each
successive high priest presignified that death of Christ by which the
captives were to be freed, and the remembrance of transgressions made to
cease.

[Numbers 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 35:30</span></span>

By the mouth of witnesses - i. e. two witnesses, at the least (compare
the marginal references). The provisions of this and the following
verses protect the enactments of this chapter from abuse. The cities of
refuge were not intended to exempt a criminal from deserved punishment.

[Numbers 35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 35:31</span></span>

No satisfaction - Rather, ransom (see [Exo
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030).md). The permission to demand
pecuniary compensation for murders (expressly sanctioned by the Koran)
undoubtedly mitigates, in practice, the system of private retaliation;
but it does so by sacrificing the principle named in [Num
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md), [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md).

[Numbers 35:34](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 35:34</span></span>

For I the Lord dwell ... - An emphatic protest against all enactment or
relaxation of laws by men for their own private convenience.
