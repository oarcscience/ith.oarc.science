### [Isaiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 3:1</span></span>

For - This is a continuation of the previous chapter. The same prophecy
is continued, and the force of the argument of the prophet will not be
seen unless the chapters are read together; see the Analysis prefixed to
Isa. 2. In the close of the second chapter [Isa
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md), the prophet had cautioned his
countrymen against confiding in man. In this chapter, a reason is given
here why they should cease to do it - to wit, that God would soon take
away their kings and princes.

The Lord - האדון hā'âdôn; see the note at [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md).

The Lord of hosts - see the note at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md). The prophet calls the attention
of the Jews particularly to the fact that this was about to be done by
Yahweh "of hosts" - a title which he gives to God when he designs to
indicate that that which is to be done implies special strength, power,
and majesty. As the work which was now to be done was the removal of the
mighty men on which the nation was depending, it is implied that it was
a work of power which belonged especially to the God of armies - the
Almighty.

Doth take away - Is about to remove. In the Hebrew, the word here is a
"participle," and does not mark the precise time. It has reference here,
however, to the future.

From Jerusalem ... - Note [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md).

The stay - In the Hebrew, the words translated "stay" and "staff" are
the same, with the exception that the former is in the masculine, and
the latter in the feminine gender. The meaning is, that God would remove
"all kinds of support," or "everything" on which they relied. The
reference is undoubtedly to the princes and mighty men on whose counsels
and aid the nation was resting for defense; see [Isa
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md).

The whole stay of bread - We use a similar expression when we say that
"bread is the staff of life." The Hebrews often expressed the same idea,
representing the "heart" in man as being "supported or upheld" by bread,
[Gen 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005) (margin.md); [Jdg
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#005) (margin.md); [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016.md).

Stay of water - He would reduce them from their luxuries introduced by
commerce Isa. 2 to absolute want. This often occurred in the sieges and
wars of the nation; and in the famines which were the consequence of the
wars. The reference here is probably to the invasion of the land by
Nebuchadnezzar. The famine consequent on that invasion is described in
[Jer 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#021.md); [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md); [Lam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md) : "The tongue of the sucking child
cleaveth to the roof of his month for thirst; the young children ask
bread, and no man breaketh it unto them."

[Isaiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 3:2</span></span>

The mighty man - The hero, The idea expressed is not simply that of
personal strength and prowess, but the higher one of military eminence
or heroism. "Prof. Alexander." This was fully accomplished in the time
of Nebuchadnezzar; [Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md).

And the prudent - This word in the original - קסם qosēm - means properly
"a diviner," or a "soothsayer." But it is sometimes used in a good
sense; see [Pro 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010.md), "margin." The
Chaldee understands it of a man "who is consulted," or whose opinion is
asked, in times of perplexity or danger. The word was originally applied
to false prophets, diviners, and soothsayers, who claimed the power of
looking into futurity. It came, however, to denote also the man of
sagacity, the statesman, the experienced counselor, who from the records
of the past could judge of the future, and to whom, therefore, the
nation could look in times of perplexity and danger. Vitringa supposes
that it may refer here to the false prophets on whose advice the nation
might be relying.

The ancient - The old man. Such men, especially among the Hebrews, were
deemed particularly qualified to give advice. They had experience; they
kept the traditions of their fathers; they had conversed with the wise
of the preceding generation; and in a land where there were few books,
and knowledge was to be gained mainly by conversation and experience,
great respect was shown them; see [Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032.md); [Ch2
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md); [Kg1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#006.md), [Kg1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 3:3</span></span>

The captain of fifty - By this was probably denoted an officer in the
army. The idea is, that the commanders of the various divisions of the
army should be taken away.

The honourable man - Hebrew פנים נשׂוּא nes'û' pânı̂ym. "The man of
elevated countenance." That is, the man high in office. He was so called
from the aspect of dignity which a man in office would assume. In the
previous chapter, the phrase is used to denote rather the "pride" which
attended such officers, than the dignity of the office itself.

And the counselor - Note, [Isa 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026.md).

The cunning artificer - Hebrew, The man wise in mechanic arts: skilled
in architecture, etc.

And the eloquent orator - לחשׁ נבון nebôn lâchash. literally, skilled or
learned in whispering, in conjuration, in persuasion. The word לחשׁ
lachash denotes properly a whispering, sighing, or calling for help;
([Isa 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md), 'they have poured out a
prayer,' לחשׁ lachash - a secret speech, a feeble sigh for aid.) It is
applied to the charm of the serpents - the secret breathing or gentle
noise by which the charm is supposed to be effected; [Psa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006.md); [Jer
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017.md); [Ecc
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md). In [Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md) of this chapter it denotes a
charm or amulet worn by females; see the note at that verse. It is also
applied to magic, or conjuration - because this was usually done by
gentle whispering, or incantation; see the note at [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md). From this use of the word, it
comes to denote one that influences another; one who persuades him in
any way, as an orator does by argument and entreaty. Ancient orators
also probably sometimes used a species of recitative, or measured
cadence, not unlike that employed by those who practiced incantations.
Jerome says that it means here, 'a man who is learned, and acquainted
with the law, and the prophets.' Chaldee, 'The prudent in council.' It
"may" be used in a good sense here; but if so, it is probably the only
place where the word is so used in the Old Testament. A prophecy similar
to this occurs in [Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md) : 'For the
children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a
prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an
ephod, and without teraphim.'

[Isaiah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 3:4</span></span>

And I will give children - Not children in respect to age so much as in
regard to talent for governing. I will commit the land to the government
of weak and imbecile princes. This would naturally occur when the wise
and great were removed; compare [Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md) : 'Wo to thee, O land, when thy
king is a child;' compare [Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md).

And babes shall rule ... - That is, babes in experience and knowledge.
This was fully accomplished in the succession of weak and wicked princes
that succeeded Isaiah, until the time of Zedekiah, the last of them,
when the temple was taken by Nebuchadnezzar. - "Lowth."

[Isaiah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 3:5</span></span>

And the people shall be oppressed - This describes the state of anarchy
and confusion which would exist under the reign of children and babes
[Isa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#004.md), when all law would be
powerless, and all rights violated, and when the feeble would be
oppressed and borne down by the strong. The word used here, properly
denotes that "unjust exactions or demands" would be made, or that the
people would be "urged" to fulfill them.

Every one by another - In turn they shall oppress and vex one another.
Hebrew 'man by man; and man by his neighbor' - a strong mode of
expression, denoting that there would be a state of mutual strife, and
violation of rights; compare [Kg1
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#020.md).

The child ... - All ranks of society shall be broken up. All respect due
from one rank in life to another shall be violated.

Shall behave himself proudly - The word used here means rather to
"urge," or "press on." The child shall "crowd on" the old man. This was
particularly descriptive of a state of anarchy and disorder, from the
fact that the Jews inculcated so much respect and deference for age; see
the note at [Isa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002.md).

The ancient - The old man.

And the base - The man of low rank in life. The word properly means the
man that is despised, the vile, the ignoble; [Sa1
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md); [Pro
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009.md).

The honorable - All the forms of respect in life would be broken up; all
the proper rules of deference between man and man would be violated.
Neither dignity, age, nor honor would be respected.

[Isaiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 3:6</span></span>

When a man shall take hold ... - In this verse, and the following
verses, the prophet continues to describe the calamitous and ruined
state that would come upon the Jews; when there would be such a want of
wealth and people, that they would seize upon anyone that they thought
able to defend them. The act of "taking hold" here denotes
"supplication" and "entreaty," as when one in danger or distress clings
to that which is near, or which may be likely to aid him; compare [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md); [Sa1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#027.md),

His brother - His kinsman, or one of the same tribe and family -
claiming protection because they belonged to the same family.

Of the house of his father - Descended from the same paternal ancestors
as himself. Probably this refers to one of an ancient and opulent family
- a man who had kept himself from the civil broils and tumults of the
nation, and who had retained his property safe in the midst of the
surrounding desolation. In the previous verse, the prophet had said that
one characteristic of the times would be a want of respect for "the
aged" and "the honorable." He here says that such would be the distress,
that a man would be "compelled" to show respect to rank; he would look
to the ancient and wealthy families for protection.

Thou hast clothing - In ancient times wealth consisted very much in
changes of garments; and the expression, 'thou hast clothing,' is the
same as 'you are rich, you are able to assist us;' see [Exo
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034.md); [Exo
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026.md); [Gen
45:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#022.md); [Kg2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005.md).

And let this ruin ... - This is an expression of entreaty. 'Give us
assistance, or defense. We commit our ruined and dilapidated affairs to
thee, and implore thy help.' The Septuagint reads this, 'and let my
food,' that is, my support, 'be under thee' - do thou furnish me food.
There are some other unimportant variations in the ancient versions, but
the sense is substantially given in our translation. It is expressive of
great distress and anarchy - when there would be no ruler, and every man
would seek one for himself. The whole deportment evinced here by the
suppliant is one of submission, distress, and humility.

[Isaiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 3:7</span></span>

In that day shall he swear - Hebrew, ישׁא yı̂shā' 'Shall he lift up' -
that is, the voice, or the hand. To lift up the hand was one of the
modes of taking an oath. Perhaps it means only that he should lift up
"the voice" - that is, "should answer;" compare [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md). The Vulgate, the Septuagint, and
the Chaldee, read it simply 'he shall answer.'

I will not be an healer - Hebrew, 'a binder up,' [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md). The Vulgate renders it, 'I am not
a physician.' The Septuagint and the Chaldee, 'I am not sufficient to be
a leader.' The meaning is, that the state of affairs was so ruinous and
calamitous that he would not attempt to restore them; as if, in the
body, disease should have so far progressed that he would not undertake
to restore the person, and have him "die" under his hands, so as to
expose himself to the reproach of being an unsuccessfill and unskillful
physician.

Is neither bread nor clothing - I am not rich. I have not the means of
providing for the needs of the people, or to maintain the rank of a
ruler. 'It is customary,' says Sir John Chardin, 'to gather together an
immense quantity of clothes, for their fashions never alter.' 'The kings
of Persia have great wardrobes, where they have always many hundreds of
habits ready, designed for presents, and sorted.' - "Lowth." The
description here is one of very great calamity and anarchy. So great
would be the ruin and danger, that men would be unwilling to be chosen
to the office of princes and rulers, and none could be found who would
desire to possess the highest honors of the nation. Generally men
"aspire" to office; here they were unwilling, on account of the
disordered and ruined state of affairs, even to accept of it.

[Isaiah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 3:8</span></span>

For Jerusalem ... - The prophet proceeds to show the cause of this state
of things. 'These are the words of the prophet, and not of him who was
chosen leader.' - "Jerome."

Is ruined - It would be so ruined, and the prospect of preserving it
would be so completely taken away, that no one could be induced to
undertake to defend and protect it.

Judah - The kingdom of Judah, of which Jerusalem was the capital; Note
[Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md).

Is fallen - Hebrew, "falls;" that is, is about to fall - as a tower or a
tree falls to ruin. If the "capital" fell and was ruined, the kingdom
would also fall as a matter of course.

Because their tongue ... - This is the "reason" why Judah was ruined. By
word and deed - that is, in every way they opposed God. The "tongue"
here represents their "language," their manner of speaking. It was
proud, haughty, rebellious, perhaps blasphemous.

To provoke - To irritate; to offend.

The eyes of his glory - This is a Hebrew expression to denote "his
glorious eyes." The eye quickly expresses anger or indignation. We
perceive these passions in the flashing of the eye sooner than in any
other part of the countenance. Hence, to "provoke the eyes," is an
expression signifying simply to excite to anger, or to excite him to
punish them. Lowth proposes to render this 'to provoke the cloud of his
glory' - referring to the Shekinah or cloud that rested over the ark in
the temple. By a slight variation of the Hebrew text, reading ענן ‛ânân
instead of עני ‛ēnēy, it may be so read, and the Syriac so translates
it: but the change in the Hebrew text does not seem to be authorized.

[Isaiah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 3:9</span></span>

The show of their countenance - The word rendered "the show" is probably
derived from a word signifying "to know," or "to recognize," and here
denotes "impudence" or "pride." Septuagint, 'The shame of their face.'

Doth witness against them - "Answers" to them; or "responds" to them
(ענתה ‛ânetâh). There is a correspondence between the feeling of the
heart and the looks, an "answering" of the countenance to the purposes
of the soul that shows their true character, and betrays their plans.
The prophet refers here to the great law in physiology that the emotions
of the heart will be usually "expressed" in the countenance; and that by
the marks of pride, vanity, and malice there depicted, we may judge of
the heart; or as it is expressed in our translation, that the expression
of the face will "witness" against a wicked man.

They declare ... - By their deeds. Their crimes are open and bold. There
is no attempt at concealment.

As Sodom - see [Gen 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005.md); compare the
note at [Isa 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md).

Wo unto their soul - They shall bring woe upon themselves; they deserve
punishment. This is an expression denoting the highest abhorrence of
their crimes.

They have rewarded evil ... - They have brought the punishment upon
themselves by their own sins.

[Isaiah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 3:10</span></span>

Say ye to the righteous - The meaning of this verse and the following is
sufficiently plain, though expositors have given some variety of
interpretation. They declare a great principle of the divine
administration similar to what is stated in [Isa
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019.md). Lowth reads it, 'Pronounce ye
a blessing on the just; verily good (shall be to him).'

That it shall be well ... - The word rendered 'well,' means 'good.' The
sense evidently is, that in the divine administration it shall be well
to be righteous. The Septuagint has rendered this in a remarkable
manner, connecting it with the previous verse: 'Wo unto their soul, for
they take evil counsel among themselves, saying, 'Let us bind the
righteous, for he is troublesome unto us:' therefore, they shall eat the
fruit of their doings.'

They shall eat ... - That is, they shall receive the appropriate
"reward" of their works, and that reward shall be happiness. As a farmer
who sows his field and cultivates his farm, eats the fruit of his labor,
so shall it be with the righteous. A similar expression is found in [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md) :

Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,

And be filled with their own devices.

Also [Jer 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019.md) : 'I will bring evil
upon this people, even the fruit of their thought;' compare [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 3:11</span></span>

Wo unto the wicked - To all the wicked - but here having particular
reference to the Jews whom Isaiah was addressing.

It shall be ill with him - The word "ill" is the only word here in the
original. It is an emphatic mode of speaking - expressing deep
abhorrence and suddenness of denunciation. 'Woe to the impious! Ill!'

For the reward of his hands - Of his conduct. The hands are the
instruments by which we accomplish anything, and hence, they are put for
the whole man.

Shall be given him - That is, shall be repaid to him; or he shall be
justly recompensed for his crimes. This is the principle on which God
rules the world. It shall be well here and hereafter, with those who
obey God; it shall be ill here and forever, with those who disobey him.

[Isaiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 3:12</span></span>

As for my people, children are their oppressors - This refers,
doubtless, to their civil rulers. They who "ought" to have been their
"protectors," oppressed them by grievous taxes and burdens. But whether
this means that the rulers of the people were "literally" minors, or
that they were so in "disposition and character," has been a question.
The original word is in the singular number (מעולל me‛ôlēl), and means a
"child," or an infant. It may, however, be taken collectively as a noun
of multitude, or as denoting more than one. To whom reference is made
here cannot easily be determined, but possibly to "Ahaz," who began to
reign when he was twenty years old; [Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002.md). Or it may mean that the
"character" of the princes and rulers was that of inexperienced
children, unqualified for government.

Are their oppressors - literally, 'are their exactors,' or their
"taxers" - the collectors of the revenue.

And women rule over them - This is not to be taken literally, but it
means either that the rulers were under the influence of the "harem," or
the females of the court; or that they were effeminate and destitute of
vigor and manliness in counsel. The Septuagint and the Chaldee render
this verse substantially alike: 'Thy exactors strip my people as they
who gather the grapes strip the vineyard.'

They which lead thee - Hebrew "They who bless thee, or call thee
blessed." (See the margin.) This refers, doubtless, to the public
teachers, and the false prophets, who "blessed" or flattered the people,
and who promised them safety in their sins.

Cause thee to err - Lead you astray; or lead you into sin and danger.

And destroy - Hebrew "Swallow up."

[Isaiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 3:13</span></span>

The Lord standeth up - To "stand up" may mean the same as to "arise."
God would not sit in silence and see their wicked conduct; but he would
come forth to inflict on them exemplary and deserved chastisement.

To plead - To "litigate," to contend with, that is, to condemn, to
inflict punishment.

[Isaiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 3:14</span></span>

With the ancients ... - With the old men, the counselors.

Ye have eaten up the vineyard - Hebrew 'Ye have burnt up' - that is, you
have oonsumed or destroyed it. By the vineyard is represented the Jewish
republic or people; [Psa 80:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md);
compare the notes at [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). The
princes and rulers had, by their exactions and oppressions, ruined the
people, and destroyed the country.

The spoil of the poor - The "plunder" of the poor; or that which you
have taken from the poor by exactions and oppressions. The word "spoil"
commonly means the plunder or booty which is obtained in war.

[Isaiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 3:15</span></span>

What mean ye - What is your object? Or, What advantage is it to you? Or,
By what right or pretence do you do this?

Beat my people to pieces - That is, that you trample on them; or cruelly
oppress them; [Psa 94:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#005.md).

And grind the faces of the poor - This is an expression also denoting
great oppression. It is taken from the act of grinding a substance on a
stone until it is worn away and nothing is left. So, by their cruel
exactions, by their injustice to the poor, they exhausted their little
property until nothing was left. The word "faces" here is synonymous
with "persons" - or with the poor themselves. The word "face" is often
used in the sense of "person;" [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); [Sa2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011.md). A similar description, though
in still stronger language, is found in [Mic
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md) :

Who pluck off their skin from off them,

And their flesh from off their bones;

Who also eat the flesh of my people,

And flay their skin from off them;

And they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,

As for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

[Isaiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 3:16</span></span>

Moreover, the Lord saith - In the previous parts of this prophecy, the
prophet had rebuked the princes, magistrates, and the people generally.
In the remainder of this chapter, he reproves with great severity the
pride, luxury, and effeminacy of the female part of the Jewish
community. Some interpreters have understood this as designed to reprove
the pride and luxury of the "cities" and "towns" of Judah, regarded as
"daughters of Zion;" see the note at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md). But this interpretation is
far-fetched and absurd. On this principle everything in the Bible might
be turned into allegory.

The daughters of Zion - Jewish females; they who dwelt in "Zion."
Perhaps he means particularly those who dwelt in Zion, the capital - or
the females connected with the court. It is probable that the prophet
here refers to the prosperous reign of Uzziah ([Ch2
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005), ....md), when by successful
commerce luxury would naturally abound.

Are haughty - Are proud.

And walk with stretched-forth necks - Displaying the neck
ostentatiously; elevating or extending it as far as possible.
Septuagint, ὑψηλῷ τραχήλῳ hupsēlō trachēlō, with elevated or exalted
neck; that is, with that indication of pride and haughtiness which is
evinced by a lofty demeanour. 'When the females dance (in India), they
stretch forth their necks, and hold them away, as if their heads were
about to fall from their shoulders.' - "Roberts."

And wanton eyes - עינים וּמשׁקרות ûmeshaqerôth ‛ēynāyı̂m. The word שׁקר
shâqar usually means "to lie, to deceive," and may here refer to the art
of alluring by a wanton or fascinating glance of the eye. There has been
great diversity of opinion about the meaning of this expression. Lowth
proposes to read it, 'and falsely setting off their eyes with paint,' in
allusion to a custom known to prevail in the East, of coloring the
eye-lids with stibium, or the powder of lead ore. This was done the
better to exhibit the white of the eye, and was supposed by many to
contribute to the healthful action of the eye itself. This practice is
known to prevail extensively now; but it is not clear that the prophet
here has reference to it. The expression is usually interpreted to mean
'deceiving with the eyes,' that is, "alluring" or "enticing" by the
motion of the eyes. The "motion" of the eyes is mentioned [Pro
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013.md) as one mode of "deceiving" a
person:

He winketh with his eyes,

He speaketh with his feet,

He teacheth with his fingers;

Frowardness is in his heart,

He deviseth mischief continually.

Compare the notes at [Job 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#014.md). The
meaning here, doubtless, is, that they attempted to entice by the
"motion" or "glance" of the eye. The Chaldee seems to have understood
this of staining the eyes with stibium.

Mincing as they go - Margin, 'Tripping nicely;' that is, walking with an
affected gait - a mode which, unhappily, is too well known in all ages
to need a more particular description. Roberts, speaking of the dance in
India, says, 'Some parts of the dance consist of a tripping or mincing
step, which they call tatte-tatee. The left foot is put first, and the
inside of the right keeps following the heel of the former.'

And making a tinkling with their feet - That is, they adorn themselves
with "ankle rings," and make a tinkling or noise with them to attract
attention. The custom of wearing rings on the fingers and wrists has
been common every where. In addition to this, Oriental females often
wore them on the "ankles" - a custom in itself not more unreasonable or
absurd. The custom is mentioned by travelers in Eastern countries in
more modern times. Thus, Michaelis says, 'In Syria and the neighboring
provinces, the more opulent females bind ligaments around their feet,
like chains, or bracelets, united by small chains of silver and gold,
and exhibit them by their sound as they walk.' And Pliny ("Nat. Hist.,"
lib. xxiii., ch. 12) says, 'Silver has succeeded to gold in the luxury
of the females who form bracelets for their feet of that, since an
ancient custom forbids them to wear gold.' Frequent mention is made of
these ornaments, says Rosenmuller, in the Arabic and Persian poems.
Roberts, speaking of the ornaments on the feet of females in India,
says, 'The first is a large silver curb like that which is attached to a
bridle; the second is of the same kind, but surrounded by a great number
of small bells; the third resembles a bracelet; and the fourth is a
convex hoop, about two inches deep.'

[Isaiah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 3:17</span></span>

Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab - There is some diversity of
rendering to this expression. The Septuagint reads it: 'The Lord will
humble the principal daughters of Zion' - those who belong to the court,
or to the families of the princes. The Chaldee, 'The Lord will prostrate
the glory of the daughters of Zion.' The Syriac is the same. The Hebrew
word שׂפח s'ı̂phach, translated 'will smite with a scab,' means to "make
bald," particularly to make the hair fall off by sickness. Our
translation conveys the idea essentially, that is, that God would visit
them with disease that would remove the hair which they regarded as so
great an ornament, and on which they so much prided themselves. Few
things would be so degrading and humiliating as being thus made bald.
The description in this verse means, that God would humble and punish
them; that they who so adorned themselves, and who were so proud of
their ornaments, would be divested of their joyful attire, and be borne
naked into captivity in a foreign land.

[Isaiah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 3:18</span></span>

In that day - That is, in the time when he would inflict this exemplary
punishment on them - probably the calamitous times of the Babylonian
captivity.

The Lord will take away - By the agents that he shall choose to employ
in this work. - The prophet proceeds to specify the various ornaments
that composed the female apparel in his time. It is not easy to describe
them particularly, nor is it necessary. The "general" meaning of the
passage is plain: and it is clear from this, that they greatly abounded
in ornaments.

The bravery - This word "we" apply to valor or courage. The word here
used, however, meaus "ornament, adorning," or "glory."

Of their tinkling ornaments - This is the same word which is used in
[Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md), and refers to the chains or
clasps with which they ornamented their feet and ankles, and which made
a tinkling noise as they walked.

And their cauls - Margin, 'net-works.' The Septuagint is the same. It is
commonly supposed to mean "caps of net-work" worn on the head. According
to others, the word refers to small "suns" or "spangles" worn on the
hair, answering to the following word "moons." 'The caul is a strap, or
girdle, about four inches long, which is placed on the top of the head,
and which extends to the brow, in a line with the nose. The one I have
examined is made of gold, and has many joints; it contains forty-five
rubies, and nine pearls, which give it a net-work appearance.' -
"Roberts."

Their round tires like the moon - Hebrew "moons." This refers to small
ornaments in the shape of crescents, or half-moons, commonly worn on the
neck. They were also sometimes worn by men, and even by camels; [Jdg
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021) (margin.md), [Jdg
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md). It is probable that these
ornaments might originally have had some reference to the moon as an
object of worship, but it does not appear that they were so worn by the
females of Judea - They are still worn by the females of Arabia. -
"Rosenmuller." Roberts says of such ornaments in India, 'The crescent is
worn by Parvati and Siva, from whom proceed the lingam, and the
principal impurities of the system. No dancing girl is in full dress
without her round tires like the moon.' This ornament is still found
under the name of "chumarah." 'The chumarah, which signifies moon, is a
splendid ornament worn by the women of western Asia in front of their
head-dresses. It is usually made of gold, set with precious stones and
pearls. They are sometimes made of the crescent form, but the most
common are such as the engraving represents. They often have Arabic
characters inscribed upon them, and sometimes a sentence from the Koran
is used by the Mahometan women of Arabia Felix.'

[Isaiah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 3:19</span></span>

The chains - Margin, "sweet balls." The word used here is derived from
the verb נטף nâṭaph, to drop, to fall in drops, or to distil," as juice
from a plant. Hence, it means that which "resembles drops" - as pearls,
or precious stones, used as ornaments for the neck or ears. We retain a
similar word as applicable to the ornaments of the ears, by calling them
"drops." The Chaldee renders this "chains," and so also the Vulgate. The
Septuagint understands it of a "hanging" or "pendant" ornament - and
this is its undoubted meaning - an ornament pendant like gum distilling
from a plant. 'These consist, first, of one most beautifully worked,
with a pendant ornament for the neck; there is also a profusion of
others which go round the same part, and rest on the bosom. In making
curious chains, the goldsmiths of England do not surpass those of the
East.' - "Roberts."

And the bracelets - For the wrists. The Chaldee translates it,
'bracelets for the hands.' These ornaments were very ancient; see [Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md); [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050.md). - Mahomet promises to those who
shall follow him, gold and silver bracelets. 'The bracelets are large
ornaments for the wrists, in which are sometimes enclosed small bells.'
- "Roberts."

Mufflers - Margin, "spangled ornaments." The word used here is derived
from a verb, "to tremble, to shake" - רעל râ‛al - and the name is given
to the ornament, whatever it was, probably from its "tremulous" motion.
Perhaps it means a "light, thin veil;" or possibly, as in the margin,
spangled ornaments, producing a tremulous, changing aspect. In [Zac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md), the word is used to denote
'trembling' - giddiness, or intoxication. It was early customary, and is
still common in Oriental countries, for the females to wear veils. No
female ventures abroad without her veil. That which is supposed to be
intended here, is described by the Arabian scholiast Safieri, quoted by
Gesenius. It is drawn tight over the upper part of the head, but the
part around the eyes is open, and a space left to see through, and the
lower part is left loose and flowing, and thus produces the "tremulous"
appearance indicated in this place; see the notes and illustrations at
[Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md).

[Isaiah 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 3:20</span></span>

The bonnets - The "tiara, head-dress, or turban." The word comes from
the verb "to adorn." The "turban" is almost universally worn in the
East. It was worn by the priests, [Exo
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#028.md); by the bridegroom, [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md); and by women. Its form is well
known.

And the ornaments for the legs - The word used here is derived from a
verb signifying "to walk, to go," particularly to walk in a stately and
formal manner - with a measured step, הצעדות hatse‛ādôth, from צעד
tsâ‛ad; and thus refers to a proud and lofty gait. The "ornament" which
is here referred to is supposed to have been a short chain extending
from one foot to the other, worn by the Eastern women to give them a
measured and stately gait. - "Gesenius." This "chain" is supposed to
have been attached by hooks or clasps to the 'tinkling ornaments'
mentioned in [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md). Safieri
mentions these ornaments, and thus describes them: 'The word denotes a
small chain, with which females, when they walk, connect their feet, in
order to make their steps equal.' Happily these ornaments are unknown in
modern times, at least in Western countries. They are still retained in
the East.

And the head-bands - This word means "girdles" of any kind, still
commonly worn on the head. A picture in the book illustrates one of the
usual forms of the head-band.

And the tablets - The Hebrew is, as in the margin, 'the houses of the
soul.' The word translated "soul" means also the "breath;" and hence, as
one of its meanings, that which is "breathed," "or which is smelled;
"scent; fragrancy, odor." The word "houses" here may denote also "boxes"
- as boxes of perfumes. The phrase here means, undoubtedly, "smelling
boxes" or "bottles," containing perfumes or fragrant odors. The word
"tablets" has no meaning here.

And the ear-rings - It is by no means certain that the original means
ear-rings. The word לחשׁים lechāshı̂ym is derived from the verb לחשׁ
lâchash signifying "to whisper," and then "to conjure, to charm" (see
the note at [Isa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003).md); and here
probably denotes precious stones worn by the females as "amulets" or
"charms." The word is often used to denote charming "serpents" - from
their "hissing" and it has been supposed probable that these amulets
were small images of serpents. There is no doubt that such ornaments
were worn by Oriental females. 'These ornaments seem to have been
amulets, often gems and precious stones, or plates of gold and silver,
on which certain magic formulas were inscribed, which were worn
suspended from the neck or ears by Oriental females.' - "Gesenius." The
following extract will furnish an explanation of these ornaments:
'Besides ornamental rings in the nose and the ears, they (Oriental
females) wore others round the legs, which made a tinkling as they went.

This custom has also descended to the present times, for Rauwolf met
with a number of Arabian women on the Euphrates, whose ankles and wrists
were adorned with rings, sometimes a good many together, which, moving
up and down as they walked, made a great noise. Chardin attests the
existence of the same custom in Persia, in Arabia, and in very hot
countries, where they commonly go without stockings, but ascribes the
tinkling sound to little bells fastened to those rings. In the East
Indies, golden bells adorned the feet and ankles of the ladies from the
earliest times; they placed them in the flowing tresses of their hair;
they suspended them round their necks, and to the golden rings which
they wore on their fingers, to announce their superior rank, and extort
the homage which they had a right to expect from the lower orders; and
from the banks of the Indus, it is probable the custom was introduced
into the other countries of Asia. The Arabian females in Palestine and
Syria delight in the same ornaments, and, according to the statements of
Dr. Clarke, seem to claim the honor of leading the fashion.' - 'Their
bodies are covered with a long blue tunic; upon their heads they wear
two handkerchiefs, one as a hood, and the other bound over it, as a
fillet across the temples.

Just above the right nostril, they place a small button, sometimes
studded with pearl, a piece of glass, or any other glittering substance;
this is fastened by a plug, thrust through the cartilage of the nose.
Sometimes they have the cartilaginous separation between the nostrils
bored for a ring, as large as those ordinarily used in Europe for
hanging curtains; and this pendant in the upperlip covers the mouth; so
that, in order to eat, it is necessary to raise it. Their faces, hands,
and arms are tatooed, and covered with hideous scars; their eyelashes
and eyes being always painted, or rather dirtied, with some dingy black
or blue powder. Their lips are dyed of a deep and dusky blue, as if they
had been eating blackberries. Their teeth are jet black; their nails and
fingers brick red; their wrists, as well as their ankles, are laden with
large metal cinctures, studded with sharp pyramidical knobs and bits of
glass. Very ponderous rings are also placed in their ears.' - "Paxton."

[Isaiah 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 3:21</span></span>

The rings - Usually worn on the fingers.

And nose-jewels - The custom of wearing jewels in the "nose" has
generally prevailed in savage tribes, and was common, and is still, in
Eastern nations - among the Arabians, Persians, etc. Sir John Chardin
says, 'It is the custom in almost all the East for the women to wear
rings in their noses, in the left nostril, which is bored low down in
the middle. These rings are of gold, and have commonly two pearls and
one ruby between, placed in the ring. I never saw a girl or young woman
in Arabia, or in all Persia, who did not wear a ring in this manner in
her nostrils.' - Harmer's "Obs.," iv., p. 318. The picture in the book
illustrates the usual form of this ornament in the East.

[Isaiah 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 3:22</span></span>

The articles which are mentioned in the remaining part of this
description, are entire articles of apparel; those which had preceded
were chiefly single ornaments.

The changeable suits of apparel - The word which is used here in the
original comes from a verb signifying "to pull of" as a shoe; to
unclothe one's-self; and it here denotes the more "costly" or "valuable"
garments, which are not worn on common occasions, and which are "laid
aside" in ordinary employments. This does not refer to any "particular"
article of dress, but to splendid and costly articles in general. 'The
Eastern ladies take great pride in having many changes of apparel,
because their fashions never alter. Thus the net brocades worn by their
grandmothers are equally fashionable for themselves.' - "Roberts."

And the mantles - From the verb "to cover," or "to clothe." The word
"mantle" does not quite express the force of the original. It means the
fuller "tunic" which was worn over the common one, with sleeves, and
which reached down to the feet. 'A loose robe,' says Roberts, 'which is
gracefully crossed on the bosom.'

And the wimples - Our word "wimple" means a "hood," or "veil," but this
is not the meaning of the Hebrew word in this place. It means a wide,
broad garment, which could be thrown over the whole, and in which the
individual usually slept. 'Probably the fine muslin which is sometimes
thrown over the head and body.' - "Roberts."

And the crisping-pins - This phrase with us would denote
"curling-irons." But the Hebrew here denotes a very different article.
It means "money-bags," or "purses." These were often made very large,
and were highly ornamented; compare [Kg2
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023.md). Frequently they were attached to
the girdle.

[Isaiah 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 3:23</span></span>

The glasses - There is a great variety of opinion about the expression
used here. That ancient Jews had "looking-glasses," or mirrors, is
manifest from the account in [Exo
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md). These "mirrors" were made of
polished plates of brass. The Vulgate and Chaldee understand this of
"mirrors." The Septuagint understands by it a "thin, transparent
covering like gauze," perhaps like silk. The word is derived from the
verb "to reveal, to make apparent," etc., and applies either to mirrors
or to a splendid shining garment. It is probable that their excessive
vanity was evinced by carrying small mirrors in their hands - that they
might examine and adjust their dress as might be necessary. This is now
done by females of Eastern nations. Shaw informs us that, 'In the
Levant, looking-glasses are a part of female dress. The Moorish women in
Barabary are so fond of their ornaments, and particularly of their
looking-glasses, which they hang upon their breasts, that they will not
lay them aside, even when, after the drudgery of the day, they are
obliged to go two or three miles with a pitcher or a goat-skin to fetch
water.' - "Burder." In Egypt, the mirror was made of mixed metal,
chiefly of copper, and this metal was so highly polished, that in some
of the mirrors discovered at Thebes, the luster has been partially
restored, though they have been buried in the earth for many centuries.
The mirror was nearly round, inserted in a handle of wood, stone, or
metal, whose form varied according to the taste of the owner. The
picture in the book will give you an idea of the ancient form of the
mirror, and will show that they might be easily carried abroad as an
ornament in public; compare Wilkinson's "Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii., pp. 384-386.

And the fine linen - Anciently, the most delicate and fine garments were
made from linen which was obtained chiefly from Egypt; see the note at
[Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

And the hoods - Or, "turbans."

And the veils - This does not differ probably from the veils worn now,
except that those worn by Eastern females are "large," and made so as to
cover the head and the shoulders, so that they may be drawn closely
round the body, and effectually conceal the person; compare [Gen
24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065.md).

[Isaiah 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 3:24</span></span>

And it shall come to pass - The prophet proceeds to denounce the
"judgment" or "punishment" that would come upon them for their pride and
vanity. In the calamities that would befall the nation, all their
ornaments of pride and vainglory would be stripped off; and instead of
them, they would exhibit the marks, and wear the badges of calamity and
grief.

Instead of sweet smell - Hebrew בשׂם bôs'em, aromatics, perfumes, spicy
fragrance; such as they used on their garments and persons. 'No one ever
enters a company without being well perfumed; and in addition to various
scents and oils, they are adorned with numerous garlands, made of the
most odoriferous flowers.' - "Roberts." 'The persons of the Assyrian
ladies are elegantly clothed and scented with the richest oils and
perfumes. When a queen was to be chosen to the king of Persia, instead
of Vashti, the virgins collected at Susana, the capital, underwent a
purification of twelve months' duration, to wit: "six months with oil of
myrrh, and six months with sweet odors." The general use of such
precious oil and fragrant perfumes among the ancient Roamns,
particularly among the ladies of rank and fashion, may be inferred from
these words of Virgil:

Arabrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem Spiravere:

AEn. i. 403.

"From her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance."

Paxton.

A stink - This word properly means the fetor or offensive smell which
attends the decomposition of a deceased body. It means that the bodies
which they so carefully adorned, and which they so assiduously
endeavored to preserve in beauty by unguents and perfumes, would die and
turn to corruption.

And instead of a girdle - Girdles were an indispensable part of an
Oriental dress. Their garments were loose and flowing, and it became
necessary to gird them up when they ran, or danced, or labored.

A rent - There has been a great variety of opinion about the meaning of
this word. The most probable signification is that which is derived from
a verb meaning "to go around, encompass;" and hence, that it denotes "a
cord." Instead of the beautiful girdle with which they girded
themselves, there shall be "a cord" - an emblem of poverty, as the poor
had nothing else with which to gird up their clothes; a humiliating
description of the calamities which were to come upon proud and vain
females of the court.

And instead of well-set hair - Hair that was curiously braided and
adorned. 'No ladies pay more attention to the dressing of the hair than
these (the dancing girls of India), for as they never wear caps, they
take great delight in this their natural ornament.' - "Roberts." Miss
Pardoe, in 'The City of the Sultan,' says, that after taking a bath, the
slaves who attended her spent an hour and a half in dressing and
adorning her hair; compare [Pe1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md).

Instead of a stomacher - It is not certainly known what is meant by
this, but it probably means some sort of "girdle," or a platted or
stiffened ornament worn on the breast. 'I once saw a dress beautifully
plaited and stiffened for the front, but I do not think it common.' -
"Roberts."

A girding of sackcloth - This is a coarse cloth that was commonly worn
in times of affliction, as emblematic of grief; [Sa2
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md); [Kg1
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031.md); [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015.md); [Isa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011.md).

And burning - The word used here does not occur elsewhere. It seems to
denote "a brand, a mark burnt in, a stigma;" perhaps a sun-burned
countenance, indicating exposure in the long and wearisome journey of a
captivity over burning sands and beneath a scorching sun.

Instead of beauty - Instead of a fair and delicate complexion, cherished
and nourished with care. Some of the articles of dress shown in the book
exhibit several varieties of the costume of an Oriental female. To what
"particular" time the prophet refers in this chapter is not known,
perhaps, however, to the captivity at Babylon. To whatever he refers, it
is one of the most striking reproofs of vanity and pride, especially the
pride of female ornament, any where to be found. And although he had
"particular" reference to the Jewish females, yet there is no
impropriety in regarding it as applicable to all such ornaments wherever
they may be found. They indicate the same state of the heart, and they
must meet substantially the same rebuke from God. The body, however
delicately pampered and adorned, must become the prey of corruption.
'The worm shall feed sweetly on it, and the earth-worm shall be its
covering;' compare [Isa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md); [Job
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#020.md). The single thought that the
body must die - that it must lie and moulder in the grave - should check
the love of frivolous adorning, and turn the mind to a far more
important matter - the salvation of the soul, which cannot die; to 'the
ornament of a weak and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of
great price;' [Pe1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 3:25</span></span>

Thy men - This is an address to Jerusalem itself, by a change not
uncommon in the writings of Isaiah. In the calamities coming on them,
their strong men should be overcome, and fall in battle.

[Isaiah 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 3:26</span></span>

And her gates - Cities were surrounded with walls, and were entered
through gates opening into the principal streets. Those gates became, of
course, the places of chief confluence and of business; and the
expression here means, that in all the places of confluence, or amidst
the assembled people, there should be lamentation on account of the
slain in battle, and the loss of their mighty men in war.

And she - Jerusalem is often represented as a female distinguished for
beauty. It is here represented as a female sitting in a posture of
grief.

Being desolate, shall sit upon the ground - To sit on the ground, or in
the dust, was the usual posture of grief and mourning, denoting great
depression and humiliation; [Lam 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md);
[Lam 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028.md); [Jer
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017.md); [Job
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013.md); [Ezr
9:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003.md). It is a remarkable coincidence,
that in the medals which were made by the Romans to commemorate the
captivity of Judea and Jerusalem, Judea is represented under the figure
of a female sitting in a posture of grief, under a palm tree, with this
inscription - judea capta. The passage here, however, refers not to the
captivity by the Romans, but to the first destruction by Nebuchadnezzar.
It is a tender and most affecting image of desolation. During the
captivity at Babylon, it was completely fulfilled; and for ages since,
Judea might be appropriately represented by a captive female sitting
pensively on the ground.
