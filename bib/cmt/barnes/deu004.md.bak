### [Deuteronomy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 4:1</span></span>

The general entreaty contained in this chapter is pointed by special
mention and enforcement of the fundamental principles of the whole
covenant Deut. 4:9-40, the spiritual nature of the Deity, His exclusive
right to their allegiance, His abhorrence of idolatry in every form, His
choice of them for His elect people. Compare further Moses' third and
last address, Deut. 27-30.

[Deuteronomy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 4:9</span></span>

A full stop should end [Deu 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md); and
[Deu 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md) begin, At the time that thou
stoodest, etc. [Deu 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md) then ye came
near, etc. Moses, exhorting to heedful observance of the Law, strives to
renew the impressions of that tremendous scene which attended its
promulgation at Sinai.

[Deuteronomy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 4:12</span></span>

Hero worship exhibited itself in the practice of setting up images of
human form as household gods (Penates, compare [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md); [Gen
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002).md), or as local and civic
divinities: a practice forbidden by [Deu
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#016.md). Nature worship in its baser
shapes is seen in the Egyptian idolatry of animals and animal figures,
and is condemned in [Deu 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#017.md) :
while its less ignoble flight, the worship of the sun, moon, and stars,
is forbidden in [Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md). The great
legislator may be regarded as taking in the passage before us a complete
and comprehensive survey of the various forms of idolatrous and corrupt
worship practiced by the surrounding Oriental nations, and as
particularly and successively forbidding them every one.

[Deuteronomy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 4:19</span></span>

Divided - i. e., "whose light God has distributed to the nations for
their use and benefit, and which therefore being creatures ministering
to man's convenience must not be worshipped as man's lords."

[Deuteronomy 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 4:25</span></span>

Compare with these verses [Lev
26:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md), and [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md) ff.

[Deuteronomy 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 4:29</span></span>

Unwilling, as it might seem, to close his discourse with words of
terror, Moses makes a last appeal to them in these verses in a different
strain.

[Deu 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md)

Temptations - Compare [Deu 7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#018.md);
[Deu 29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002.md); not, "i. e." the
tribulations and persecutions undergone by the Israelites, out the
plagues miraculously inflicted on the Egyptians.

[Deu 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md)

He chose their seed after them - literally, "his seed after him."
Speaking of the love of God to their fathers in general, Moses has more
especially in mind that one of them who was called "the Friend of God"
[Jam 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md).

Brought thee out in his sight - literally, "by His face:" "i. e." by the
might of His personal presence. Compare [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); where God promises "My presence
(literally 'My face') shall go with thee."

[Deuteronomy 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">deu 4:41</span></span>

These verses are inserted between two distinct and complete discourses
for the reason to which they themselves call attention ("Then Moses
severed three cities," etc.); i. e., the fact narrated took place
historically after Moses spoke the one discourse and before he delivered
the other. In thus severing the three cities of refuge Moses carried out
a previous command of God (see the marginal references); and so followed
up his exhortations to obedience by setting a punctual example of it, as
far as opportunity was given him.

[Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md)

In the plain country - literally, "in the land of the Mishor." The word
means a level tract of land; but when used ([Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md); [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009), etc..md) with the article, seems to
be the proper name for the smooth downs of Moab, which reach from the
Jordan eastward of Jericho far into the Desert of Arabia, and which form
a striking contrast alike to the rugged country west of the river, and
to the higher and remarkable districts belonging to Bashan northward.

Bezer is, with little certainty, identified with Bostra, or (1 Macc.
5:36) Bosor. Golan gave the name of Gaulonitis to a district of some
extent east of the sea of Galilee and north of the Hieromax; but the
exact site of the city if uncertain.

[Deuteronomy 4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 4:44</span></span>

These verses would be more properly assigned to the next chapter. They
are intended to serve as the announcement and introduction of the
address now to be commenced. [Deu 4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044.md)
gives a kind of general title to the whole of the weighty address,
including in fact the central part and substance of the book, which now
follows in 22 chapters, divided into two groups:

\(a\) Deut. 5-11,

\(b\) Deut. 12-26.

The address was delivered when they had already received the
first-fruits of those promises [Deu
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#046.md), the full fruition of which was
to be consequent on their fulfillment of that covenant now again about
to be rehearsed to them in its leading features.

[Deu 4:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048.md)

Sion must not be confounded with Zion (compare [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002)..md).
