### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

See this explained in [Mat 12:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md).

[Mar 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004.md)

Or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? - It seems to have been a maxim
with the Jews that not to do good when we have an opportunity is to do
evil; not to save life is to kill or to be guilty of murder. If a man
has an opportunity of saving a man's life when he is in danger, and does
not do it, he is evidently guilty of his death. On this principle our
Saviour puts this question to the Jews - whether it was better for him,
having the power to heal this man, to do it, or to suffer him to remain
in this suffering condition; and he illustrates it by an example,
showing that in a manner of much less importance - that respecting their
cattle - they would do on the Sabbath just as "he" would if he should
heal this man. The same remark may apply to all opportunities of doing
good. "The ability to do good imposes an obligation to do it" (Cotton
Mather) He that has the means of feeding the hungry, and clothing the
naked, and instructing the ignorant, and sending the gospel to the
destitute, and that does it not, is guilty, for he is practically doing
evil; he is suffering evils to exist which he might remove. So the
wicked will be condemned in the day of judgment because "they did it
not," [Mat 25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045.md). If this is true,
what an obligation rests upon the rich to do good!

[Mar 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md)

With anger - With a severe and stern countenance; with indignation at
their hypocrisy and hardness of heart. This was not, however, a spiteful
or revengeful passion; it was caused by excessive "grief" at their
state: "being grieved for the hardness of their hearts." It was not
hatred of the "men" whose hearts were so hard; it was hatred of the sin
which they exhibited, joined with the extreme grief that neither his
teaching nor the law of God, nor any means which could be used, overcame
their confirmed wickedness. Such anger is not unlawful, [Eph
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md). However, in this instance, our
Lord has taught us that anger is never lawful except when it is tempered
with grief or compassion for those who have offended.

Hardness of their hearts - The heart, figuratively the seat of feeling
or affection, is said to be tender when it is easily affected by the
sufferings of others - by our own sin and danger - by the love and
commands of God; when we are easily made to feel on the great subjects
pertaining to our interest, [Eze
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md). It is hard when nothing
moves it; when a man is alike insensible to the sufferings of others, to
the dangers of his own condition, and to the commands, the love, and the
threatenings of God. It is most tender in youth, or when we have
committed fewest crimes. It is made hard by indulgence in sin, by long
resisting the offers of salvation, or by opposing any great and
affecting appeals which God may make to us by his Spirit or providence,
by affliction, or by a revival of religion. Hence, it is that the most
favorable period for securing an interest in Christ, or for becoming a
Christian, is in youth the first, the tenderest, and the best days of
life. Nay, in the days of childhood, in the Sabbath-school, God may be
found, and the soul prepared to die.

[Mark 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 3:6</span></span>

Straightway - Immediately, or as soon as possible.

Took counsel - Laid a plan. Consulted with them. Literally, "made a
consultation."

The Harridans - See the notes at [Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md).

How they might destroy him - They hated him, he was so holy; because he
reproved them; because he laid open their hypocrisy; and because he won
the hearts of the people and lessened their influence. They therefore
determined to remove him, if possible, and thus avoid his reproofs.
Sinners would often rather put to death the man that reproves them than
forsake their sins. The Pharisees had rather commit any crime, even to
the murder of the Messiah, than forsake the sins for which he rebuked
them.

[Mark 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 3:7</span></span>

To the sea - The Sea of Galilee, or to the lonely regions which
surrounded the sea, where he might be in obscurity, and avoid their
designs against his life. His time had not yet come, and he prudently
took care of his life, thus showing that we are not needlessly to throw
ourselves into danger.

Galilee - See the notes at [Mat 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md).

Judea - The southern division of the land of Palestine.

Jerusalem - Jerusalem was "in" Judea. It is mentioned particularly to
show that not only the people of the surrounding country came, but also
many from the capital, the place of wealth, and honor, and power.

Idumea - The country formerly inhabited by the "Edomites." In the time
of the Saviour it was embraced in the country belonging to the Jews. It
was south of Judea proper. The word "Idumea" is a Greek word made from
the Hebrew "Edom." It signifies the land of Edom, a name given to Esau,
one of the sons of Isaac, [Gen 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030.md).
The word signifies "red," and the name was given to him because he
sought of Jacob red pottage as the price of his birthright. He settled
in Mount Seir [Deu 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md), on the south
of the land of Canaan, and the country of Idumea was bounded by
Palestine on the north. During the Babylonian captivity the Edomites
spread themselves into the country of Judea, and occupied a considerable
part of the south of Palestine. They had, however, submitted to the rite
of circumcision, and were incorporated with the Jews. From them sprang
Herod the Great.

From beyond Jordan - From the region lying east of the river Jordan. The
sacred writers lived on the west side of Jordan, and by the country
"beyond Jordan" they meant that on the east side.

Tyre and Sidon - See the notes at [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md).

[Mark 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 3:9</span></span>

A small ship - Rather a "boat." There were properly speaking, no "ships"
on the Sea of Tiberias. This was probably a small boat that belonged to
the disciples, in which he could draw off from the shore, and teach the
people without being pressed by them.

Lest they should throng him - They pressed upon him in great numbers. He
had healed many, and those who were still diseased pressed or crowded on
him, so that his labors were interrupted and embarrassed. He therefore
withdrew from the multitude, and sought a situation where he might
address them to greater advantage.

[Mark 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 3:10</span></span>

As many as had plagues - As many as had diseases or maladies of body or
mind. The word plague, now confined to the pestilence, does not express
the meaning of the original, and tends to mislead.

[Mark 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 3:11</span></span>

Unclean spirits - Persons who were possessed of evil spirits.

Thou art the Son of God - The Son of God, by way of eminence. In this
place it is equivalent to the Messiah, who was, among the Jews, called
the Son of God. Hence, they were charged not to make him known, because
he was not desirous that it should be blazoned abroad that he claimed to
be the Messiah. He had not yet done what he wished in order to establish
his claims to the Messiahship. He was poor and unhonored, and the claim
would be treated as that of an impostor. "For the present," therefore,
he did not wish that it should be proclaimed abroad that he was the
Messiah. The circumstance here referred to demonstrates the existence of
evil spirits. If these were merely diseased or deranged persons, then it
is strange that they should be endowed with knowledge so much superior
to those in health. If they were under the influence of an order of
spirits superior to man - whose appropriate habitation was in another
world - then it is not strange that they should know him, even in the
midst of his poverty, to be the Messiah, the Son of God.

[Mark 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 3:13</span></span>

For an account of the appointment of the apostles, see the notes at [Mat
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md).

And calleth unto him whom he would - Those whom he chose; whom he was
about to appoint to the apostleship. See the notes at [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md).

[Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md)

He ordained twelve - The word rendered "ordained" here does not express
our notion of ordination to the ministry. It means, literally, "he made"
- that is, he "appointed" twelve to be with him.

Twelve - The reason why "twelve" were chosen was, probably, that such a
number would be deemed competent witnesses of what they saw; that they
could not be easily charged with being excited by sympathy, or being
deluded, as a multitude might; and that, being destined to go into all
the world, a considerable number seemed indispensable. Perhaps, also,
there was some reference to the fact that "twelve" was the number of the
twelve tribes of Israel.

[Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md)

Boanerges - This word is made up of two Hebrew words signifying "sons of
thunder," meaning that they, on some accounts, "resembled" thunder. See
the notes at [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). It is not known
why this name was given to James and John. They are nowhere else called
by it. Some suppose it was because they wished to call down fire from
heaven and consume a certain village of the Samaritans, [Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md). It is, however, more probable
that it was on account of something fervid, and glowing, and powerful in
their genius and eloquence.

[Mark 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 3:20</span></span>

They could not so much as eat bread - Their time and attention were so
occupied that they were obliged to forego their regular meals. The
affairs of religion may so occupy the attention of ministers and others
as to prevent their engaging in their customary pursuits. Religion is
all-important - far more important than the ordinary business of this
life; and there is nothing unreasonable if our temporal affairs
sometimes give way to the higher interests of our own souls and the
souls of others. At the same time, it is true that religion is
ordinarily consistent with a close attention to worldly business. It
promotes industry, economy, order, neatness, and punctuality - all
indispensable to worldly prosperity. Of these there has been no more
illustrious example than that of our Saviour himself.

[Mark 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 3:21</span></span>

When his friends - Greek, "they who were of him." Not the apostles, but
his relatives, his friends, who were in the place of his nativity.

Heard of it - Heard of his conduct: his preaching; his appointing the
apostles; his drawing such a multitude to his preaching. This shows that
by "his friends" were not meant the apostles, but his neighbors and
others who "heard" of his conduct.

They went out to lay hold on him - To take him away from the multitude,
and to remove him to his home, that he might be treated as a maniac, so
that, by absence from the "causes" of excitement, he might be restored
to his right mind.

They said - That is, common report said; or his friends and relatives
said, for they did not believe on him, [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md). Probably the enemies of Jesus
raised the report, and his relatives were persuaded to believe it to be
true.

He is beside himself - He is delirious or deranged. The reason why this
report gained any belief was, probably, that he had lived among them as
a carpenter; that he was poor and unknown; and that now, at 30 years of
age, he broke off from his occupations, abandoned his common employment,
spent much time in the deserts, denied himself the common comforts of
life, and set up his claims to be the Messiah who was expected by all
the people to come with great pomp and splendor. The charge of
"derangement" on account of attention to religion has not been confined
to the Saviour. Let a man be made deeply sensible of his sins, and spend
much of his time in prayer, and have no relish for the ordinary
amusements or business of life; or let a Christian be much impressed
with his obligation to devote himself to God, and "act" as if he
believed there was an "eternity," and warn his neighbors of their
danger; or let a minister show uncommon zeal and spend his strength in
the service of his Master, and the world is not slow to call it
derangement. And none will be more ready to originate or believe the
charge than an ungodly and infidel parent or brother, a self-righteous
Pharisee or professor in the church. At the same time, men may endanger
themselves on the bosom of the deep or in the bowels of the earth for
wealth; or may plunge into the vortex of fashion, folly, and vice, and
break in upon the hours of repose, and neglect their duties to their
family and the demands of business, and in the view of the world it is
wisdom and proof of a sane mind! Such is the consistency of boasted
reason; such the wisdom and prudence of worldly men!

[Mark 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 3:22</span></span>

And the scribes ... - See the notes at [Mat
12:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md). The occasion of their saying
this was, that he had healed a man possessed with a devil. The scribes,
who came from Jerusalem to watch his conduct, charged him with having
made a compact or agreement with the prince of the devils.

[Mark 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 3:31</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md).
