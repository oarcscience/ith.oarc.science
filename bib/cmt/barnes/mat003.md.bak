### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

In those days - The days here referred to cannot be those mentioned in
the preceding chapter, for John was but six months older than Christ.
Perhaps Matthew intended to embrace in his narrative the whole time that
Jesus lived at Nazareth; and the meaning is, "in those days while Jesus
still dwelt at Nazareth," John began to preach. It is not probable that
John began to baptize or preach long before the Saviour entered on his
ministry; and, consequently, from the time that is mentioned in the
close of the second chapter to that mentioned in the beginning of the
third, an interval of twenty-five years or more elapsed.

John the Baptist - Or John the baptizer - so called from his principal
office, that of baptizing. Baptism, or the application of water, was a
rite well known to the Jews, and practiced when they admitted proselytes
to their religion from paganism. - Lightfoot.

Preaching - The word rendered "preach" means to proclaim in the manner
of a public crier; to make proclamation. The discourses recorded in the
New Testament are mostly brief, sometimes consisting only of a single
sentence. They were public proclamations of some great truth. Such
appear to have been the discourses of John, calling people to
repentance.

In the wilderness of Judea - This country was situated along the Jordan
and the Dead Sea, to the east of Jerusalem. The word translated
"wilderness" does not denote, as with us, a place of boundless forests,
entirely destitute of inhabitants; but a mountainous, rough, and thinly
settled country, covered to some considerable extent with forests and
rocks, and better suited for pasture than for tilling. There were
inhabitants in those places, and even villages, but they were the
comparatively unsettled portions of the country, [Sa1
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md). In the time of Joshua there
were six cities in what was then called a wilderness, [Jos
15:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061.md).

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

Repent ye - Repentance implies sorrow for past offences [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md); a deep sense of the evil of sin
as committed against God [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md);
and a full purpose to turn from transgression and to lead a holy life. A
true penitent has sorrow for sin, not only because it is ruinous to his
soul, but chiefly because it is an offence against God, and is that
abominable thing which he hates, [Jer
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md). It is produced by seeing the
great danger and misery to which it exposes us; by seeing the justice
and holiness of God [Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md); and by
seeing that our sins have been committed against Christ, and were the
cause of his death, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Luk
22:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061.md). There are two words in the
New Testament translated "repentance," one of which denotes a change of
mind, or a reformation of life; and the other, sorrow or regret that sin
has been committed. The word used here is the former, calling the Jews
to a change of life, or a reformation of conduct. In the time of John,
the nation had become extremely wicked and corrupt, perhaps more so than
at any preceding period. Hence, both he and Christ began their ministry
by calling the nation to repentance.

The kingdom of heaven is at hand - The phrases kingdom of heaven,
kingdom of Christ, kingdom of God, are of frequent occurrence in the
Bible. They all refer to the same thing. The expectation of such a
kingdom was taken from the Old Testament, and especially from Daniel,
[Dan 7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md). The prophets had told of
a successor to David that should sit on his throne [Kg1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md); [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md); [Jer
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017.md). The Jews expected a great
national deliverer. They supposed that when the Messiah should appear,
all the dead would be raised; that the judgment would take place; and
that the enemies of the Jews would be destroyed, and that they
themselves would be advanced to great national dignity and honor.

The language in which they were accustomed to describe this event was
retained by our Saviour and his apostles. Yet they early attempted to
correct the common notions respecting his reign. This was one design,
doubtless, of John in preaching repentance. Instead of summoning them to
military exercises, and collecting an army, which would have been in
accordance with the expectations of the nation, he called them to a
change of life; to the doctrine of repentance - a state of things far
more accordant with the approach of a kingdom of purity.

The phrases "kingdom of God" and "kingdom of heaven" have been supposed
to have a considerable variety of meaning. Some have supposed that they
refer to the state of things in heaven; others, to the personal reign of
Christ on earth; others, that they mean the church, or the reign of
Christ in the hearts of his people. There can be no doubt that there is
reference in the words to the condition of things in heaven after this
life. But the church of God is a preparatory state to that beyond the
grave - a state in which Christ pre-eminently rules and reigns and there
is no doubt that the phrases sometimes refer to the state of things in
the church; and that they may refer, therefore, to the state of things
which the Messiah was to set up his spiritual reign begun in the church
on earth and completed in heaven.

The expression "the kingdom of heaven is at hand" would be best
translated, "the reign of God draws near." We do not say commonly of a
kingdom that it is movable, or that it approaches. A reign may be said
to be at hand; and it may be said with propriety that the time when
Christ would reign was at hand. In this sense it is meant that the time
when Christ should reign, or set up his kingdom, or begin his dominion
on earth, under the Christian economy, was about to commence. The
phrase, then, should not be confined to any period of that reign, but
includes his whole dominion over his people on earth and in heaven.

In the passage here it clearly means that the coming of the Messiah was
near, or that the time of the reign of God which the Jews had expected
was coming.

The word "heaven," or "heavens," as it is in the original, means
sometimes the place so called; and sometimes it is, by a figure of
speech, put for the Great Being whose residence is there, as in [Dan
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026.md); "the Heavens do rule." See also
[Mar 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#030.md); [Luk
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018.md). As that kingdom was one of
purity, it was proper that the people should prepare themselves for it
by turning from their sins, and by bringing their hearts into a state
suitable to his reign.

[Matthew 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 3:3</span></span>

The prophet Esaias - The prophet Isaiah. Esaias is the Greek mode of
writing the name. This passage is taken from [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md). It is here said to have been
spoken in reference to John, the forerunner of Christ. The language is
such as was familiar to the Jews. and such as they would understand. It
was spoken at first with reference to the return from the captivity at
Babylon. In ancient times, it was customary in the march of armies to
send messengers, or pioneers, before them to proclaim their approach; to
provide for them; to remove obstructions; to make roads, level hills,
fill up valleys, etc. Isaiah, describing the return from Babylon, uses
language taken from that custom. A crier, or herald, is introduced. In
the vast deserts that lay between Babylon and Judea he is represented as
lifting up his voice, and, with authority, commanding a public road to
be made for the return of the captive Jews, with the Lord as their
deliverer. "Prepare his ways, make them straight," says he. The meaning
in Isaiah is, "Let the valleys be exalted, or filled up, and the hills
be levelled, and a straight, level highway be prepared, that they may
march with ease and safety." See the notes at [Isa
40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md). The custom here referred to is
continued in the East at the present time. "When Ibrahim Pasha proposed
to visit certain places on Lebanon, the emeers and sheiks sent forth a
general proclamation, somewhat in the style of Isaiah's exhortation, to
all the inhabitants, to assemble along the proposed route and prepare
the way before him. The same was done in 1845, on a grand scale, when
the present sultan visited Brousa. The stones were gathered out, the
crooked places straightened, and the rough ones made level and smooth."
- The Land and the Book, Vol i. pp. 105, 106.

As applied to John, the passage means that he was sent to remove
obstructions, and to prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah,
like a herald going before an army on the march, to make preparations
for its coming.

[Matthew 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 3:4</span></span>

His raiment of camel's hair - His clothing. This is not the fine hair of
the camel from which our elegant cloth is made called camlet, nor the
more elegant stuff brought from the East Indies under the name of
"camel's hair," but the long shaggy hair of the camel, from which a
coarse cheap cloth is made, still worn by the poorer classes in the
East, and by monks. This dress of the camel's hair, and a leather belt,
it seems, was the common dress of the prophets, [Kg2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md); [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md).

His meat was locusts - His food. These constituted the food of the
common people. Among the Greeks the vilest of the people used to eat
them; and the fact that John made his food of them is significant of his
great poverty and humble life. The Jews were allowed to eat them, [Lev
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022.md). Locusts are flying insects, and
are of various kinds. The green locusts are about 2 inches in length and
about the thickness of a man's finger. The common brown locust is about
3 inches long. The general form and appearance of the locust is not
unlike the grasshopper. They were one of the plagues of Egypt Exo. 10.
In Eastern countries they are very numerous. They appear in such
quantities as to darken the sky, and devour in a short time every green
thing. The whole earth is sometimes covered with them for many leagues,
[Joe 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md); [Isa
33:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004.md). "Some species of the locust
are eaten until this day in Eastern countries, and are even esteemed as
a delicacy when properly cooked. After tearing off the legs and wings,
and taking out the entrails, they stick them in long rows upon wooden
spits, roast them at the fire, and then proceed to devour them with
great zest. There are also other ways of preparing them. For example:
they cook them and dress them in oil; or, having dried them, they
pulverize them, and, when other food is scarce, make bread of the meal.
The Bedouins pack them with salt in close masses, which they carry in
their leather sacks. From these they cut slices as they may need them.
It is singular that even learned men have suffered themselves to
hesitate about understanding these passages of the literal locust, when
the fact that these are eaten by the Orientals is so abundantly proved
by the concurrent testimony of travelers.

One of them says they are brought to market on strings in all the cities
of Arabia, and that he saw an Arab on Mount Sumara who had collected a
sackful of them. They are prepared in different ways. An Arab in Egypt,
of whom he requested that he would immediately eat locusts in his
presence, threw them upon the glowing coals; and after he supposed they
were roasted enough, he took them by the legs and head, and devoured the
remainder at one mouthful. When the Arabs have them in quantities they
roast or dry them in an oven, or boil them and eat them with salt. The
Arabs in the kingdom of Morocco boil the locusts; and the Bedouins eat
locusts, which are collected in great quantities in the beginning of
April, when they are easily caught. After having been roasted a little
upon the iron plate on which bread is baked, they are dried in the sun,
and then put into large sacks, with the mixture of a little salt.

They are never served up as a dish, but every one takes a handful of
them when hungry" (Un. Bib. Dic.). Burckhardt, one of the most
trustworthy of travelers, says: "All the Bedouins of Arabia and the
inhabitants of towns in Nejd and Hedjaz are accustomed to eat locusts."
"I have seen at Medina and Tayf locust-shops, where these animals were
sold by measure. In Egypt and Nubia they are only eaten by the poorest
beggars The Land and the Book, ii. 107). "Locusts," says Dr. Thomson
(The Land and the Book, ii. 108), "are not eaten in Syria by any but the
Bedouin on the extreme frontiers, and it is always spoken of as an
inferior article of food, and regarded by most with disgust and loathing
tolerated only by the very poorest people. John the Baptist, however,
was of this class either from necessity or election." It is remarkable
that not only in respect to his food, but also in other respects, the
peculiarities in John's mode of life have their counterparts in the
present habits of the same class of persons. "The coat or mantle of
camel's hair is seen still on the shoulders of the Arab who escorts the
traveler through the desert, or of the shepherd who tends his flocks on
the hills of Judea or in the valley of the Jordan. It is made of the
thin, coarse hair of the camel, and not of the fine hair, which is
manufactured into a species of rich cloth. I was told that both kinds of
raiment are made on a large scale at Nablus, the ancient Shechem. The
'leathern girdle' may be seen around the body of the common laborer,
when fully dressed, almost anywhere; whereas men of wealth take special
pride in displaying a rich sash of silk or some other costly fabric"
(Hackett's Illustrations of Scripture, p. 104).

Wild honey - This was probably the honey that he found in the rocks of
the wilderness. Palestine was often called the land flowing with milk
and honey, [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Exo
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005.md). Bees were kept with great care,
and great numbers of them abounded in the fissures of trees and the
clefts of rocks. "Bees abound there still, not only wild, but hived, as
with us. I saw a great number of hives in the old castle near the Pools
of Solomon; several, also, at Deburieh, at the foot of Tabor: and again
at Mejdel, the Magdala of the New Testament, on the Lake of Tiberias.
Maundrell says that he saw 'bees very industrious about the blossoms'
between Jericho and the Dead Sea, which must have been within the limits
of the very 'desert' in which John 'did eat locusts and wild honey'"
(Hackett's Illustrations of Scripture, p. 104). There is also a species
of honey called wild honey, or wood honey ([Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027), margin.md), or honeydew, produced
by certain little insects, and deposited on the leaves of trees, and
flowing from them in great quantities to the ground. See [Sa1
14:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md). This is said to be produced
still in Arabia, and perhaps it was this which John lived upon.

[Matthew 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 3:5</span></span>

Jerusalem - The people of Jerusalem.

All Judea - Many people from Judea. It does not mean that literally all
the people went, but that great multitudes went. It was general.
Jerusalem was in the part of the country called Judea. Judea was
situated on the west side of the Jordan. See the notes at [Mat
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md).

Region about Jordan - On the east and west side of the river. Near to
Jordan.

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

Were baptized - The word "baptize" βαπτίζω baptizo signifies originally
to tinge, to dye, to stain, as those who dye clothes. It here means to
cleanse or wash anything by the application of water. See the notes at
[Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004.md). Washing, or ablution, was
much in use among the Jews, as one of the rites of their religion, [Num
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#007.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). It was not customary, however,
among them to baptize those who were converted to the Jewish religion
until after the Babylonian captivity. At the time of John, and for some
time previous, they had been accustomed to administer a rite of baptism,
or washing, to those who became proselytes to their religion; that is,
to those who were converted from being Gentiles. This was done to
signify that they renounced the errors and worship of the pagans, and as
significant of their becoming pure by embracing a new religion.

It was a solemn rite of washing, significant of cleansing from their
former sins, and purifying them for the special service of Yahweh. John
found this custom in use; and as he was calling the Jews to a new
dispensation - to a change in their form of religion - he administered
this rite of baptism (washing), to signify the cleansing from sin, the
adopting of the new dispensation, or the fitness for the pure reign of
the Messiah. He applied an old ordinance to a new purpose. As it was
used by him it was a significant rite, or ceremony, intended to denote
the putting away of impurity, and a purpose to be pure in heart and
life. The Hebrew word טבל Tabal which is rendered by the word "baptize,"
occurs in the Old Testament in the following places, namely: [Lev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md); [Lev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#006.md), [Lev
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#051.md); [Num
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#018.md); [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014.md); [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md); [Deu
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md); [Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md); [Job
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031.md); [Lev
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#009.md); [Sa1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027) (twice.md); [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md); [Kg2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md); [Gen
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031.md); [Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md).

It occurs in no other places; and from a careful examination of these
passages its meaning among the Jews is to be derived. From these
passages it will be seen that its radical meaning is neither to sprinkle
nor to immerse. It is to dip, commonly for the purpose of sprinkling, or
for some other purpose.

Thus, to dip the finger, i. e., a part of the finger, in blood enough to
sprinkle with, [Lev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md). To dip a
living bird, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop, in the blood of
the bird that was killed, for the purpose of sprinkling; where it could
not be that all these would be immersed the blood of a single bird, [Lev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#006.md). To dip hyssop in the water, to
sprinkle with, [Num 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#018.md). To dip a
portion of bread in vinegar, [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014.md). To dip the feet in oil - an
emblem of plenty, [Deu 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md). To dye,
or stain, [Eze 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#015.md). To plunge into a
ditch, so as to defile the clothes, [Job
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031.md). To dip the end of a staff in
honey, [Sa1 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md). To dip in Jordan -
a declaration respecting Naaman the Syrian, [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014.md). The direction of the prophet was
to wash himself [Kg2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010.md), and this
shows that he understood washing and baptizing to mean the same thing.
To dip a towel, or quilt, so as to spread it on the face of a man to
smother him, [Kg2 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md).

In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is
to immerse entirely But in nearly all the cases the notion of applying
the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by
dipping, is necessarily to be supposed.

In the New Testament the word βαπτίζω baptizo, in various forms, occurs
80 times; 57 with reference to persons. Of these 57 times, it is
followed by "in" ἐν en 18 times, as in water, in the desert, in Jordan;
9 times by "into" εἰς eis, as into the name, etc., into Christ; once it
is followed by ἐπί epi [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), and
twice by "for" ὑπέρ huper, [Co1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029.md).

The following remarks may be made in view of the investigation of the
meaning of this word:

1\. That in baptism it is possible, perhaps probable, that the notion of
dipping would be the one that would occur to a Jew.

2\. It would not occur to him that the word meant of necessity to dip
entirely, or to immerse completely.

3\. The notion of washing would be the one which would most readily
occur, as connected with a religious rite. See the cases of Naaman, and
[Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004) (Greek.md).

4\. It cannot be proved from an examination of the passages in the Old
and New Testaments that the idea of a complete immersion was ever
connected with the word, or that it ever occurred in any case. If those
who were baptized went into the water, it is still not proved by that,
that the only mode of baptism was by immersion, since it might have been
by pouring, though they were in the water.

5\. It is not positively enjoined anywhere in the New Testament that the
only mode of baptism shall be by an entire submersion of the body under
water. Without such a precept it cannot be made obligatory on people of
all ages, nations, and climes, even if it were probable that in the mild
climate of Judea it was the usual mode.

In Jordan - The River Jordan is the eastern boundary of Palestine or
Judea. It rises in Mount Lebanon, on the north of Palestine, and runs in
a southerly direction, underground, for 13 miles, and then bursts forth
with a great noise at Cesarea Philippi. It then unites with two small
streams, and runs some miles farther, and empties into the Lake Merom.
From this small lake it flows 13 miles, and then falls into the Lake
Gennesareth, otherwise called the Sea of Tiberias or the Sea of Galilee.
Through the middle of this lake, which is 15 miles long and from 6 miles
to 9 miles wide, it flows undisturbed, and preserves a southerly
direction for about 70 miles, and then falls into the Dead Sea. The
Jordan, at its entrance into the Dead Sea, is about 90 feet wide. It
flows in many places with great rapidity, and when swollen by rains
pours like an impetuous torrent. It formerly regularly overflowed its
banks in time of harvest, that is, in March, in some places 600 paces,
[Jos 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md); [Ch1
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015.md). These banks are covered with
small trees and shrubs, and afford a convenient dwelling for wild
beasts. Allusion is often made to these thickets in the sacred
Scriptures, [Jer 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md); [Jer
50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044.md). On the reason why a river, or a
place abounding in water, was selected for administering baptism, see
the notes at [Joh 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023.md).

[Matthew 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

Pharisees and Sadducees - The Jews were divided into three great sects -
the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. In addition to these,
some smaller sects are mentioned in the New Testament and by Josephus:
the Herodians, probably political friends of Herod; the Galileans, a
branch of the Pharisees; and the Therapeutae, a branch of the Essenes,
but converts from the Greeks. The three principal sects are supposed to
have originated about 150 years before Christ, as they are mentioned by
Josephus at that time in his history. Of course nothing is said of them
in the Old Testament, as that was finished about 400 years before the
Christian era.

I. The Pharisees were the most numerous and wealthy sect of the Jews.
They derived their name from the Hebrew word Pharash, which signifies to
set apart, or to separate, because they separated themselves from the
rest of their countrymen, and professedly devoted themselves to special
strictness in religion. Their leading tenets were the following: that
the world was governed by fate, or by a fixed decree of God; that the
souls of men were immortal, and were either eternally happy or miserable
beyond the grave; that the dead would be raised; that there were angels,
good and bad; that God was under obligation to bestow special favor on
the Jews; and that they were justified by their own conformity to the
law. They were proud, haughty, self-righteous, and held the common
people in great disrespect, [Joh 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049.md).
They sought the offices of the state, and affected great dignity. They
were ostentatious in their religious worship, praying in the corners of
the streets, and seeking publicity in the bestowment of alms. They
sought principally external cleanliness, and dealt much in ceremonial
ablutions and washing.

They maintained some of the laws of Moses very strictly. In addition to
the written laws, they held to a multitude which they maintained had
come down from Moses by tradition. These they felt themselves as much
bound to observe as the written Law. Under the influence of these laws
they washed themselves before meals with great scrupulousness; they
fasted twice a week - on Thursday, when they supposed that Moses
ascended Mount Sinai, and on Monday, when he descended; they wore broad
phylacteries, and enlarged the fringe or borders of their garments; they
loved the chief rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues.
In general, they were a corrupt, hypocritical, office-seeking, haughty
class of men. There are, however, some honorable exceptions recorded,
[Act 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md); perhaps, also, [Mar
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043.md); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md); [Luk
23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md); [Joh
19:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038.md); [Joh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001.md); [Joh
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050.md).

II\. The Sadducees are supposed to have taken their name from Sadok, who
flourished about 260 years before the Christian era. He was a pupil of
Antigonus Sochaeus, president of the sanhedrin, or great council of the
nation. He had taught the duty of serving God disinterestedly, without
the hope of reward or the fear of punishment. Sadok, not properly
understanding the doctrine of his master, drew the inference that there
was no future state of rewards or punishments, and on this belief he
founded the sect. The other notions which they held, all to be traced to
this leading doctrine, were:

1\. That there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit [Mat
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md); [Act
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008.md); and that the soul of man
perishes with the body.

2\. They rejected the doctrine of fate or decrees.

3\. They rejected all traditions, and professed to receive only the
books of the Old Testament. They were far less numerous than the
Pharisees, but their want of numbers was compensated, in some degree, by
their wealth and standing in society. Though they did not generally seek
office, yet several of them were advanced to the high priesthood.

III\. The Essenes, a third sect of the Jews, are not mentioned in the
New Testament. They differed from both the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
They were Jewish monks or hermits, passing their time little in society,
but mostly in places of obscurity and retirement. It is not probable,
therefore, that our Saviour often, if ever, encountered them; and this,
it is supposed, is the reason why they are not mentioned in the New
Testament. They were a contemplative sect, having little to do with the
common business of life. The property which they possessed they held in
common. They denied themselves, in a great measure, the usual comforts
of life, and were exceedingly strict in the observance of the duties of
religion. They were generally more pure than the rest of the Jews, and
appear to have been an unambitious, a modest, and retiring sort of
people. The two sexes were not in company except on the Sabbath, when
they partook of their coarse fare (only bread and salt) together. They
practiced dancing in their worship. Few of them were married; they were
opposed to oaths, and they asserted that slavery was repugnant to
nature. In regard to doctrine, they did not differ materially from the
Pharisees, except that they objected to the sacrifices of slain animals,
and of course did not visit the temple, and were not, therefore, likely
to come into public contact with the Saviour. They perpetuated their
sect by proselytes, and by taking orphan children to train up.

The other sects of the Jews were too insignificant to demand any
particular notice here. It may be said of the Jews generally that they
possessed little of the spirit of religion; that they had corrupted some
of the most important doctrines of the Bible; and that they were an
ignorant, proud, ambitious, and sensual people. There as great
propriety, therefore, in John's proclaiming to them the necessity of
repentance.

Generation of vipers - Vipers are a species of serpents, from 2 to 5
feet in length and about an inch thick, with a flat head. They are of an
ash or yellowish color, speckled with long brown spots. There is no
serpent that is more poisonous. The person bitten by them swells up
almost immediately, and falls down dead. See [Act
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#006.md). The word "serpent," or "viper,"
is used to denote both cunning and malignancy. In the phrase "be ye wise
as serpents" [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md) it means be
prudent, or wise, referring to the account in [Gen
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md). Among the Jews the serpent was
regarded as the symbol of cunning, circumspection, and prudence. It was
so regarded in the Egyptian hieroglyphics. In the phrase "generation of
vipers" [Mat 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md), the viper is the
symbol of wickedness, of envenomed malice - a symbol drawn from the
venom of the serpent. It is not quite certain in which of these senses
the phrase is used in this place. Probably it is used to denote their
malignancy and wickedness.

Wrath to come - John expresses his astonishment that sinners so hardened
and so hypocritical as they were should have been induced to flee from
coming wrath. The wrath to come means the divine indignation, or the
punishment that will come on the guilty. See [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md); [Th2
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md).

[Matthew 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 3:8</span></span>

Bring forth therefore fruits ... - That is, the proper fruits of
reformation; the proper evidence that you are sincere. Do not bring your
cunning and dissimulation to this work; do not carry your hypocrisy into
your professed repentance, but evince your sincerity by forsaking sin,
and thus give evidence that this coming to Jordan to be baptized is not
an act of dissimulation. No discourse could have been more appropriate
or more cutting.

Fruits - Conduct. See [Mat 7:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016.md).

Meet for repentance - Fit for repentance; appropriate to it the proper
expression of repentance.

[Matthew 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 3:9</span></span>

And think not to say ... - They regarded it as sufficient righteousness
that they were descended from so holy a man as Abraham. Compare [Joh
8:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md), [Joh
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#053.md). John assured them that this was
a matter of small consequence in the sight of God. Of the very stones of
the Jordan he could raise up children to Abraham. The meaning seems to
be this: God, from these stones, could more easily raise up those who
should be worthy children of Abraham, or be like him, than simply,
because you are descendants of Abraham, make you, who are proud and
hypocritical, subjects of the Messiah's kingdom. Or, in other words,
mere nativity, or the privileges of birth, avail nothing where there is
not righteousness of life. Some have supposed, however, that by these
stones he meant the Roman soldiers, or the pagan, who might also have
attended on his ministry; and that God could "of them" raise up children
to Abraham.

[Matthew 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 3:10</span></span>

The axe is laid at the root of the tree - Laying the axe at the root of
a tree is intended to denote that the tree is to be cut down. It was not
merely to be trimmed, or to be cut about the limbs, but the very tree
itself was to be struck. That is, a searching, trying kind of preaching
has been commenced. A kingdom of justice is to be set up. Principles and
conduct are to be investigated. No art, no dissimulation, will be
successful: People are to be tried by their lives, not by birth or
profession. They who are not found to bear this test are to be rejected.
The very root shall feel the blow, and the fruitless tree shall fall.
This is a beautiful and very striking figure of speech, and a very
direct threatening of future wrath. John regarded them as making a fair
and promising profession, as trees in blossom do. But he told them,
also, that they should bear fruit as well as flowers. Their professions
of repentance were not enough. They should show, by a holy life, that
their profession was genuine.

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear - The word translated here as
"shoes" has a signification different from what it has in our language.
At first, in order to keep the feet from the sharp stones or the burning
sand, small pieces of wood were fastened to the soles of the feet,
called "sandals." Leather, or skins of beasts dressed, afterward were
used. The foot was not covered at all, but the sandal, or piece of
leather or wood, was bound by thongs. The people put off these when they
enter a house, and put them on when they leave it. To unloose and bind
on sandals, on such occasions, was formerly the business of the lowest
servants. The expression in this place, therefore, denotes great
humility, and John says that he was nor worthy to be the servant of him
who should come after him.

Shall baptize you - Shall send upon you the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of
God is frequently represented as being poured out upon his people, [Pro
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md); [Joe
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Act
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md). The baptism of the Holy
Spirit is the same, therefore, as the sending of his influences to
convert, purify, and guide the soul.

The Holy Ghost - The third person of the adorable Trinity, whose office
it is to enlighten, renew, sanctify, and comfort the soul He was
promised by the Saviour to convince of sin, [Joh
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md); to enlighten or teach the
disciples, [Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md); to comfort them in the absence
of the Savior, [Joh 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018.md); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md); to change the heart. [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). To be baptized with the Holy
Spirit means that the Messiah would send upon the world a far more
powerful and mighty influence than had attended the preaching of John.
Many more would be converted. A mighty change would take place. His
ministry would not affect the external life only, but the heart. the
motives, the soul; and would produce rapid and permanent changes in the
lives of people. See [Act 2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md).

With fire - This expression has been variously understood. Some have
supposed that John refers to the afflictions and persecutions with which
men would be tried under the Gospel; others, that the word "fire" means
judgment or wrath. According to this latter interpretation, the meaning
is that he would baptize a portion of mankind - those who were willing
to be his followers - with the Holy Spirit, but the rest of mankind -
the wicked - with fire; that is, with judgment and wrath. Fire is a
symbol of vengeance. See [Isa 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md);
[Isa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md). If this is the meaning, as
seems to be probable, then John says that the ministry of the Messiah
would be far more powerful than his was. It would be more searching and
testing; and they who were not suited to abide the test would be cast
into eternal fire. Others have supposed, however, that by fire, here,
John intends to express the idea that the preaching of the Messiah would
be refining, powerful, purifying, as fire is sometimes an emblem of
purity, [Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md). It is difficult to
ascertain the precise meaning further than that his ministry would be
very trying, purifying, searching. Multitudes would be converted; and
those who were not true penitents would not be able to abide the trial,
and would be driven away.

[Matthew 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

His fan - The word used here and rendered "fan" means a winnowing shovel
instead. It was used for throwing the grain, after it was threshed, into
the air, so that the chaff might be driven away by the wind. This mode
of separating the grain from the chaff is still practiced in the East.
It is not probable that the fan, as the term is now used, was known to
the Orientals as an instrument for cleaning grain. See the notes at [Isa
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#024.md).

His floor - The threshing-floor was an open space, or area, in the
field, usually on an elevated part of the land, [Gen
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#010.md). It had no covering or walls. It
was a space of ground 30 or 40 paces in diameter, and made smooth by
rolling it or treading it hard. A high place was selected for the
purpose of keeping it dry, and for the convenience of winnowing the
grain by the wind. The grain was usually trodden out by oxen. Sometimes
it was beaten with flails, as with us; and sometimes with a sharp
threshing instrument, made to roll over the grain and to cut the straw
at the same time. See the notes at [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015.md).

Shall purge - Shall cleanse or purify. Shall remove the chaff, etc.

The garner - The granary, or place to deposit the wheat.

Unquenchable fire - Fire that shall not be extinguished, that will
utterly consume it. By the floor, here, is represented the Jewish
people. By the wheat, the righteous, or the people of God. By the chaff,
the wicked. They are often represented as being driven away like chaff
before the wind, [Job 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md); [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md); [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md). They are also represented as
chaff which the fire consumes, [Isa
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md). This image is often used to
express judgments, [Isa 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015.md); "Thou
shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shalt make the hills
as chaff." By the unquenchable fire is meant the eternal suffering of
the wicked in hell, [Th2 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md); [Mar
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md); [Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md).

[Matthew 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 3:13</span></span>

Then cometh Jesus - The Saviour is now introduced as about to enter on
his work, or as about to be solemnly set apart to his great office of
Messiah and Redeemer. The expression "cometh" implies that the act was
voluntary on his part; that he went for that purpose and for no other.
He left the part of Galilee - Nazareth - where he had lived for nearly
30 years, and went to the vicinity of the Jordan, where John was
baptizing the people in great numbers, that he might be set apart to his
work. The occasion was doubtless chosen in order that it might be as
public and solemn as possible. It is to be remembered, also, that it was
the main purpose of John's appointment to introduce the Messiah to the
world, [Mat 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md).

To be baptized of him - By him. Baptism was not in his case a symbol of
personal reformation and repentance, for he was sinless; but it was a
solemn rite by which he was set apart to his great office. It is true,
also, that although he was personally holy, and that the baptism in his
case had a different signification, in this respect, from that which is
implied when it is administered now, yet that even in his case the great
idea always implied in the ordinance of baptism had a place; for it was
a symbol of holiness or purity in that great system of religion which he
was about to set up in the world.

[Matthew 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 3:14</span></span>

John forbade him - Refused him.

I have need - It is more suitable that I should be baptized with thy
baptism, the Holy Spirit, than that thou shouldest be baptized in water
by me. I am a sinner, and unworthy to administer this to the Messiah.

[Matthew 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 3:15</span></span>

Thus it becometh us - It is suitable and proper. And though you may feel
yourself unworthy, yet it is proper it should be done.

All righteousness - There was no particular precept in the Old Testament
requiring this, but he chose to give the sanction of his example to the
baptism of John, as to a divine ordinance. The phrase "all
righteousness," here, is the same as a righteous institution or
appointment. Jesus had no sin. But he was about to enter on his great
work. It was proper that he should be set apart by his forerunner, and
show his connection with him, and give his approbation to what John had
done. He submitted to the ordinance of baptism, also, in order that
occasion might be taken, at the commencement of his work, for God
publicly to declare his approbation of him, and his solemn appointment
to the office of the Messiah.

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

Out of the water - This shows that he had descended to the river. It
literally means, "he went up directly from the water." The original does
not imply that they had descended into the river, and it cannot be
proved, therefore, from this passage, that his baptism was by immersion;
nor can it be proved that even, if his baptism was by immersion, that
therefore the same mode is binding on people now. In order to
demonstrate from this passage that immersion is essential, it is
necessary to demonstrate:

\(a\) that he went into the river;

\(b\) that, being there, he was wholly immersed;

\(c\) that the fact that he was immersed, if he was, proves that all
others must be, in order that there could be a valid baptism.

Neither of these three things has ever been demonstrated from this
passage, nor can they be.

The heavens were opened unto him - This was done while he was praying,
[Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md). The ordinances of religion
will be commonly ineffectual without prayer. If in those ordinances we
look to God, we may expect that he will bless us; the heavens will be
opened, light will shine upon our path, and we shall meet with the
approbation of God. The expression, "the heavens were opened," is one
that commonly denotes the appearance of the clouds when it lightens. The
heavens appear to open or give way. Something of this kind probably
appeared to John at this time. The same appearance took place at
Stephen's death, [Act 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md). The
expression means that he was permitted to see far into the heavens
beyond what the natural vision would allow.

To him - Some have referred this to Jesus, others to John. It probably
refers to John. See [Joh 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md). It was
a testimony given to John that this was the Messiah.

He saw - John saw.

The Spirit of God - See [Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).
This was the third person of the Trinity, descending upon him in the
form of a dove, [Luk 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md). The dove,
among the Jews, was the symbol of purity of heart, harmlessness, and
gentleness, [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md); compare [Psa
55:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006.md). The form chosen here was
doubtless an emblem of the innocence, meekness, and tenderness of the
Saviour. The gift of the Holy Spirit, in this manner, was the public
approbation of Jesus [Joh 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md), and a
sign of his being set apart to the office of the Messiah. We are not to
suppose that there was any change done in the moral character of Jesus,
but only that he was publicly set apart to his work, and solemnly
approved by God in the office to which he was appointed.

[Matthew 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 3:17</span></span>

A voice from heaven - A voice from God. This was probably heard by all
who were present. This voice, or sound, was repeated on the mount of
transfiguration, [Mat 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md); [Luk
9:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#035.md); [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md). It was also heard just before
his death, and was then supposed by many to be thunder, [Joh
12:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#025.md). It was a public declaration
that Jesus was the Messiah.

My beloved Son - This is the title which God himself gave to Jesus. It
denotes the nearness of his relation to God, and the love of God for
him, [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). It implies that he was
equal with God, [Heb 1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); [Joh
10:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md); [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md). The term "Son" is expressive of
love of the nearness of his relation to God, and of his dignity and
equality with God.

I am well pleased - or, I am ever delighted. The language implies that
he was constantly or uniformly well pleased with him; and in this solemn
and public manner he expressed his approbation of him as the Redeemer of
the world.

The baptism of Jesus has usually been regarded as a striking
manifestation of the doctrine of the Trinity, or the doctrine that there
are three Persons in the divine nature:

\(1\) there is the Person of "Jesus Christ," the Son of God, baptized in
Jordan, elsewhere declared to be equal with God, [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md).

\(2\) the Holy Spirit descending in a bodily form upon the Saviour. The
Holy Spirit is also equal with the Father, or is also God, [Act
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md).

\(3\) the Father, addressing the Son, and declaring that He was well
pleased with him.

It is impossible to explain this transaction consistently in any other
way than by supposing that there are three equal Persons in the divine
nature or essence, and that each of these sustains an important part in
the work of redeeming people.

In the preaching of John the Baptist we are presented with an example of
a faithful minister of God. Neither the wealth, the dignity, nor the
power of his auditors deterred him from fearlessly declaring the truth
respecting their character. He called things by their right names. He
did not apologize for their sins. He set their transgressions fairly
before them, and showed them faithfully and fearlessly what must be the
consequence of a life of sin. So should all ministers of the Gospel
preach. Rank, riches, and power should have nothing to do in shaping and
gauging their ministry. In respectful terms, but without shrinking, all
the truth of the Gospel must be spoken, or woe will follow the
ambassador of Christ, [Co1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md).

In John we also have an example of humility. Blessed with great success,
attended by the great and noble, and with nothing but principle to keep
him from turning it to his advantage, he still kept himself out of view,
and pointed to a far greater Personage at hand. So should every minister
of Jesus, however successful, keep the Lamb of God in his eye, and be
willing - nay, rejoice - to lay all his success and honors at Jesus'
feet.

Everything about the work of Jesus was wonderful. No person had before
come into the world under such circumstances. God would not have
attended the commencement of his life with such wonderful events if it
had not been of the greatest moment to our race, and if he had not
possessed a dignity above all prophets, kings, and priests. His "name"
was to be called "Wonderful, Councillor, The mighty God, The everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace;" "of the increase of his government and
peace" there was to be "no end;" "upon the throne of David and of his
kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice
forever" [Isa 9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); and it was proper
that a voice from heaven should declare that he was the long-promised
prince and Saviour; that the angels should attend him, and the Holy
Spirit signalize his baptism by his personal presence. And it is proper
that we, for whom he came, should give to him our undivided affections,
our time, our influence, our hearts, and our lives.
