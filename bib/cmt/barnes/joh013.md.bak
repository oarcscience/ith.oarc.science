### [John Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

[John 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 13:1</span></span>

The feast of the passover - See the notes at [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md), [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md).

His hour was come - The hour appointed in the purpose of God for him to
die, [Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md).

Having loved his own - Having given to them decisive and constant proofs
of his love. This was done by his calling them to follow him; by
patiently teaching them; by bearing with their errors and weaknesses;
and by making them the heralds of his truth and the heirs of eternal
life.

He loved them unto the end - That is, he continued the proofs of his
love until he was taken away from them by death. Instances of that love
John proceeds immediately to record in his washing their feet and in the
institution of the Lord's Supper. We may remark that Jesus is the same
yesterday, today, and forever. He does not change; he always loves the
same traits of character; nor does he withdraw his love from the soul.
If his people walk in darkness and wander from him, the fault is theirs,
not his. His is the character of a friend that never leaves or forsakes
us; a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. [Psa
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#028.md); "the Lord ...forsaketh not his
saints." [Isa 49:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014.md); [Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024.md).

[John 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 13:2</span></span>

Supper being ended - This translation expresses too much. The original
means while they were at supper; and that this is the meaning is clear
from the fact that we find them still eating after this. The Arabic and
Persic translations give it this meaning. The Latin Vulgate renders it
like the English.

The devil - The leader or prince of evil spirits.

Having now put it into the heart - Literally, having cast it into the
heart. Compare [Eph 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md); "The fiery
darts of the wicked." See [Act 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md);
[Luk 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003.md). The meaning of this passage
is that Satan inclined the mind of Judas to do this, or he tempted him
to betray his Master. We know not precisely how this was done, but we
know that it was by means of his avarice. Satan could tempt no one
unless there was some inclination of the mind, some natural or depraved
propensity that he could make use of. He presents objects in alluring
forms fitted to that propensity, and under the influence of a strong or
a corrupt inclination the soul yields to sin. In the case of Judas it
was the love of money; and it was necessary to present to him only the
possibility of obtaining money, and it found him ready for any crime.

[John 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 13:3</span></span>

Jesus knowing ... - With the full understanding of his dignity and
elevation of character, he yet condescended to wash their feet. The
evangelist introduces his washing their feet by saying that he was fully
conscious of his elevation above them, as being intrusted with all
things, and this made his humiliation the more striking and remarkable.
Had he been a mere human teacher or a prophet, it would have been
remarkable; but when we remember the dignity of his nature, it shows how
low he would stoop to teach and save his people.

Had given all things ... - See the notes at [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md).

Was come from God - See the notes at [Joh
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042.md).

Went to God - Was about to return to heaven. See [Joh
6:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md).

[John 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 13:4</span></span>

He riseth from supper - Evidently while they were eating. See [Joh
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md).

Laid aside his garments - His outer garment. See the notes at [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md). This was his mantle or robe,
which is said to have been without seam. It was customary to lay this
aside when they worked or ran, or in the heat of summer.

Took a towel and girded himself - This was the manner of a servant or
slave. See the notes at [Luk 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#008.md).

[John 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 13:5</span></span>

Began to wash ... - It was uniformly the office of a servant to wash the
feet of guests, [Sa1 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#041.md). It became
a matter of necessity where they traveled without shoes, and where they
reclined on couches at meals. It should be remembered here that the
disciples were not sitting at the table, as we do, but were lying with
their feet extended from the table, so that Jesus could easily have
access to them. See the notes at [Mat
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md).

[John 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 13:6</span></span>

Dost thou wash my feet? - Every word here is emphatic. Dost thou - the
Son of God, the Messiah - perform the humble office of a servant -
toward me, a sinner? This was an expression of Peter's humility, of his
reverence for Jesus, and also a refusal to allow him to do it. It is
possible, though not certain from the text, that he came to Simon Peter
first.

[John 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 13:7</span></span>

Thou knowest not now - Though he saw the action of Jesus, yet he did not
fully understand the design of it. It was a symbolical action,
inculcating a lesson of humility, and intended to teach it to them in
such a manner that it would be impossible for them ever to forget it.
Had he simply commanded them to be humble, it would have been far less
forcible and impressive than when they saw him actually performing the
office of a servant.

Shalt know hereafter - Jesus at that time partially explained it [Joh
13:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md); but he was teaching them by
this expressive act a lesson which they would continue to learn all
their lives. Every day they would see more and more the necessity of
humility and of kindness to each other, and would see that they were the
servants of Christ and of the church, and ought not to aspire to honors
and offices, but to be willing to perform the humblest service to
benefit the world. And we may remark here that God often does things
which we do not fully understand now, but which we may hereafter. He
often afflicts us; he disappoints us; he frustrates our plans. Why it is
we do not know now, but we yet shall learn that it was for our good, and
designed to teach us some important lesson of humility and piety. So he
will, in heaven, scatter all doubts, remove all difficulties, and show
us the reason of the whole of his mysterious dealings in his leading us
in the way to our future rest. We ought also, in view of this, to submit
ourselves to him; to hush every murmur, and to believe that he does all
things well. It is one evidence of piety when we are willing to receive
affliction at the hand of God, the reason of which we cannot see,
content with the belief that we may see it hereafter; or, even if we
never do, still having so much confidence in God as to believe that what
He does is right.

[John 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 13:8</span></span>

Thou shalt never wash my feet - This was a decided and firm expression
of his reverence for his Master, and yet it was improper. Jesus had just
declared that it had a meaning, and that he ought to submit to it. We
should yield to all the plain and positive requirements of God, even if
we cannot now see how obedience would promote his glory.

If I wash thee not - This had immediate reference to the act of washing
his feet; and it denotes that if Peter had not so much confidence in him
as to believe that an act which he performed was proper, though he could
not see its propriety - if he was not willing to submit his will to that
of Christ and implicitly obey him, he had no evidence of piety. As
Christ, however, was accustomed to pass from temporal and sensible
objects to those which were spiritual, and to draw instruction from
whatever was before him, some have supposed that he here took occasion
to state to Peter that if his soul was not made pure by him he could not
be his follower. Washing is often thus put as an emblem of moral
purification, [Co1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md); [Tit
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). This is the meaning, also, of
baptism. If this was the sense in which Jesus used these words, it
denotes that unless Christ should purify Peter, he could have no
evidence that he was his disciple. "Unless by my doctrine and spirit I
shall purify you, and remove your pride [Mat
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#033.md), your lack of constant
watchfulness [Mat 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040.md), your anger
[Mat 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051.md), your timidity and fear
[Mat 26:70](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070.md), [Mat
26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074.md), you can have no part in me"
(Grotius).

Hast no part with me - Nothing in common with me. No evidence of
possessing my spirit, of being interested in my work, and no
participation in my glory.

[John 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 13:9</span></span>

Not my feet only ... - Peter, with characteristic readiness and ardor,
saw now that everything depended on this. His whole salvation, the
entire question of his attachment to his Master, was involved. If to
refuse to have his feet washed was to be regarded as evidence that he
had no part with Jesus, he was not only willing, but desirous that it
should be done; not only anxious that his feet should be cleansed, but
his hands and his head - that is, that he should be cleansed entirely,
thoroughly. Perhaps he saw the spiritual meaning of the Saviour, and
expressed his ardent wish that his whole soul might be made pure by the
work of Christ. A true Christian is desirous of being cleansed from all
sin. He has no reserve. He wishes not merely that one evil propensity
should be removed, but all; that every thought should be brought into
captivity to the obedience of Christ [Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md); and that his whole body, soul,
and spirit should be sanctified wholly and be preserved blameless unto
the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md). His intellect, his will, his
affections, his fancy, memory, judgment, he desires should be all
brought under the influence of the gospel, and every power of the body
and mind be consecrated unto God.

[John 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 13:10</span></span>

He that is washed - This is a difficult passage, and interpreters have
been divided about its meaning. Some have supposed that it was customary
to bathe before eating the paschal supper, and that the apostles did it;
Jesus having said, "he that hath bathed his body is clean except in
regard to his feet - to the dirt contracted in returning from the bath,
and that there was need only that the feet should be washed in order to
prepare them properly to receive the supper." They suppose, also, that
the lesson which Jesus meant to teach was that they were really pure
[Joh 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md); that they were qualified to
partake of the ordinances of religion, and needed only to be purified
from occasional blemishes and impurities (Grotius). Others say that
there is not evidence that the Jews bathed before partaking of the
Paschal Supper, but that reference is made to the custom of washing
their hands and their face. It is known that this was practiced. See the
[Mat 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md) note; [Mar
7:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md) notes. Peter had requested him
to wash his hands and his head. Jesus told him that as that had been
done, it was unnecessary to repeat it; but to wash the feet was an act
of hospitality, the office of a servant, and that all that was needed
now was for him to show this condescension and humility. Probably
reference is had here to internal purity, as Jesus was fond of drawing
illustrations from every quarter to teach them spiritual doctrine; as if
he had said, "You are clean by my word and ministry [Joh
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md); you are my followers, and are
prepared for the scene before you. But one thing remains. And as, when
we come to this rite, having washed, there remains no need of washing
except to wash the feet, so there is now nothing remaining but for me to
show you an example that you will always remember, and that shall
complete my public instructions to you."

Is clean - This word may apply to the body or the soul.

Every whit - Altogether, wholly.

Ye are clean - Here the word has doubtless reference to the mind and
heart.

But not all - You are not all my true followers, and fitted for the
ordinance before us.

[John 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 13:11</span></span>

Who should betray him - Greek: "He knew him who was about to betray
him."

[John 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 13:12</span></span>

Know ye what ... - Do you know the meaning or design of what I have done
unto you?

[John 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 13:13</span></span>

Ye call me Master - Teacher.

And Lord - This word is applied to one who rules, and is often given to
God as being the Proprietor and Ruler of all things. It is given to
Christ many hundred times in the New Testament.

Ye say well ... - [Mat 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md), [Mat
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md).

So I am - That is, he was their Teacher and Instructor, and he was their
Sovereign and King.

[John 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 13:14</span></span>

Ye also ought to wash ... - Some have understood this literally as
instituting a religious rite which we ought to observe; but this was
evidently not the design; because:

1\. There is no evidence that Jesus intended it as a religious
observance, like the Lord's Supper or the ordinance of baptism.

2\. It was not observed by the apostles or the primitive Christians as a
religious rite.

3\. It was a rite of hospitality among the Jews, a common, well-known
thing, and performed by servants.

4\. It is the manifest design of Jesus here to inculcate a lesson of
humility; to teach them by his example that they ought to condescend to
the most humble offices for the benefit of others. They ought not to be
proud, and vain, and unwilling to occupy a low place, but to regard
themselves as the servants of each other, and as willing to befriend
each other in every way. And especially as they were to be founders of
the church, and to be greatly honored, he took this occasion of warning
them against the dangers of ambition, and of teaching them, by an
example that they could not forget, the duty of humility.

[John 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 13:16</span></span>

The servant is not ... - This was universally true, and this they were
to remember always, that they were to manifest the same spirit that he
did, and that they were to expect the same treatment from the world. See
the notes at [Mat 10:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md).

[John 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 13:18</span></span>

I speak not of you all - That is, in addressing you as clean, I do not
mean to say that you all possess this character.

I know whom I have chosen - He here means evidently to say that he had
not chosen them all, implying that Judas had not been chosen. As,
however, this word is applied to Judas in one place [Joh
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md), "Have not I chosen you twelve,
and one of you is a devil?" it must have a different meaning here from
that which it has there. There it evidently refers to the apostleship.
Jesus had chosen him to be an apostle, and had treated him as such. Here
it refers to purity of heart, and Jesus implies that, though Judas had
been chosen to the office of apostleship, yet he had not been chosen to
purity of heart and life. The remaining eleven had been, and would be
saved. It was not, however, the fault of Jesus that Judas was not saved,
for he was admitted to the same teaching, the same familiarity, and the
same office; but his execrable love of gold gained the ascendency, and
rendered vain all the means used for his conversion.

But that the scripture ... - These things have occurred in order that
the prophecies may receive their completion. It does not mean that Judas
was compelled to this course in order that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, but that this was foretold, and that by this the prophecy did
receive a completion. "The scripture." This is written in [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md). It is commonly understood of
Ahithophel, and of the enemies of David who had been admitted to his
friendship, and who had now proved ungrateful to him.

May be fulfilled - See the notes at [Mat
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md). It is difficult to tell whether
this prophecy had a primary reference to Judas, or whether it be meant
that it received a more complete fulfillment in his case than in the
time of David. The cases were similar; the same words would describe
both events, for there was an exhibition of similar ingratitude and
baseness in both cases, so that the same words would fitly describe both
events.

He that eateth bread with me - To eat with one was a proof of
friendship. See [Sa2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#011.md); [Mat
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011.md); [Gen
43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032.md). This means that Judas had been
admitted to all the privileges of friendship, and had partaken of the
usual evidences of affection. It was this which greatly aggravated his
offence. It was base ingratitude as well as murder.

Hath lifted up his heel - Suidas says that this figure is taken from
those who are running in a race, when one attempts to trip the other up
and make him fall. It was a base and ungrateful return for kindness to
which the Lord Jesus referred, and it means that he who had been
admitted to the intimacies of friendship had ungratefully and
maliciously injured him. Some suppose the expression means to lay snares
for one others, to kick or injure a man after he is cast down (Calvin on
[Psa 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009).md). It is clear that it
denotes great injury, and injury aggravated by the fact of professed
friendship. It was not merely the common people, the open enemies, the
Jewish nation that did it, but one who had received all the usual proofs
of kindness. It was this which greatly aggravated our Saviour's
sufferings.

[John 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 13:19</span></span>

Now I tell you before it come ... - They would see by that that he had a
knowledge of the heart and the power of foretelling future events, and
must therefore have been sent by God. This does not imply that they had
no faith before this, but that their faith would be increased and
strengthened by it.

[John 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 13:20</span></span>

He that receiveth ... - This sentiment is found in the instructions
which Jesus gave to his disciples in [Mat
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md). Why he repeats it at this time
cannot now be known. It is certain that it is not closely connected with
the subject of his conversation. Perhaps, however, it was to show how
intimately united he, his Father, his apostles, and all who received
them were. They who received them received him, and they who received
him received God. So he who betrayed him, betrayed, for the same reason,
God. Hence Judas, who was about to betray him, was also about to betray
the cause of religion in the world, and to betray God and his cause.
Everything pertaining to religion is connected together. A man cannot do
dishonor to one of the institutions of religion without injuring all; he
cannot dishonor its ministers or the Saviour without dishonoring God.
And this shows that one prominent ground of the Saviour's solicitude was
that his Father might be honored, and one source of his deep grief at
the treason of Judas was that it would bring injury upon the whole cause
of religion in the world.

[John 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 13:21</span></span>

Troubled in spirit - See [Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md).
The reason of his trouble here was that Judas, a professed friend, was
about to betray him. He doubtless foresaw the deep and dreadful sorrows
of his approaching death, and was also deeply affected with the
ingratitude and wickedness of a professed friend. Jesus was man as well
as God, and he felt like other men. His human nature shrank from
suffering, and his tender sensibilities were affected not less deeply
than would be those of other men by baseness and treason.

Testified - He bore witness to the truth; openly declared what he had
before intimated - that one of them would betray him.

[John 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 13:22</span></span>

Doubting of whom ... - The word translated "doubting" denotes that kind
of anxiety which a man feels when he is in perplexity, and knows not
what to say or do. We should say they were at a loss. See the notes at
[Mat 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022.md).

[John 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 13:23</span></span>

Leaning on Jesus' bosom - This does not mean that he was at that time
actually lying on his bosom, but that he occupied a situation next to
him at the table, so that his head naturally fell back on his bosom when
he spoke to him. See the notes at [Mat
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md).

Whom Jesus loved - This was doubtless John himself. The evangelists are
not accustomed to mention their own names when any mark of favor or any
good deed is recorded. They did not seek publicity or notoriety. In this
case the appellation is more tender and honorable than any mere name.
John was admitted to special friendship, perhaps, because the natural
disposition of our Saviour was more nearly like the amiableness and
mildness of John than any of the other disciples (Robert Hall). The
highest honor that can be conferred on any man is to say that Jesus
loved him. Yet this is an honor which all may possess, but which none
can inherit without his spirit and without loving him. It is an honor
which cannot be won by wealth or learning, by beauty or accomplishments,
by rank or earthly honors, but only by the possession of a meek and
quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price, [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md); compare [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md).

[John 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 13:25</span></span>

He then lying on Jesus' breast - This is a different word from the one
rendered [Joh 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023.md) leaning. It means
falling back or reclining on the bosom of Jesus. When Peter spake, John
laid his head back on the bosom of Jesus, so that he could speak to him
privately without being heard by others.

[John 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 13:26</span></span>

Jesus answered - That is, he answered John. It does not appear that
either Judas or the other apostles heard him.

Shall give a sop - The word translated "sop" means a morsel, a piece of
bread, or anything else eaten - as much as we are accustomed to take at
a mouthful. Jesus was about to dip it in the sauce which was used at the
Passover. The word "dip," in the original, is that from which is derived
the word "baptize." It means here that Jesus would dip it into the sauce
as we do a piece of bread. It is probable that it was not an unusual
thing for the master of a feast to help others in this way, as it does
not appear to have attracted the attention of the others as at all
remarkable. It was an indication to John who the betrayer was, and a
hint which Judas also probably understood.

[John 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 13:27</span></span>

After the sop - After he had taken and probably eaten it. By this Judas
saw that Jesus knew his design, and that he could not conceal his plan.
He saw, also, that the other disciples would be acquainted with it; and,
aroused by sudden anger, or with the apprehension that he should lose
his reward, or that Jesus might escape, he resolved on executing his
plan at once.

Satan entered into him - The devil had before this put it into his heart
to betray Jesus [Joh 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md), but he now
excited him to a more decided purpose. See [Luk
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003.md); also [Act
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md); "Why hath Satan filled thine
heart," etc.

What thou doest, do quickly - This showed to Judas that Jesus was
acquainted with his design. He did not command him to betray him, but he
left him to his own purpose. He had used means enough to reclaim him and
lead him to a holy life, and now he brought him to a decision. He gave
him to understand that he was acquainted with his plan, and submitted it
to the conscience of Judas to do quickly what he would do. If he
relented, he called on him to do it at once. If he could still pursue
his wicked plan, could go forward when he was conscious that the Saviour
knew his design, he was to do it at once. God adopts all means to bring
men to a decision. He calls upon them to act decisively, firmly,
immediately. He does not allow them the privilege to deliberate about
wicked deeds, but calls on them to act at once, and to show whether they
will obey or disobey him; whether they will serve him, or whether they
will betray fits cause. He knows all their plans, as Jesus did that of
Judas, and he calls on men to act under the full conviction that he
knows all their soul. Sin thus is a vast evil. When men can sin knowing
that God sees it all, it shows that the heart is fully set in them to do
evil, and that there is nothing that will restrain them.

No man at the table knew - This shows that Jesus had signified to John
only who it was that should betray him.

The bag - The traveling-bag in which they put their common property. See
the notes at [Joh 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md).

Have need of against the feast - The feast of the Passover. This feast
continued seven days, and they supposed that Jesus had directed him to
make preparation for their needs on those days.

[John 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 13:30</span></span>

It was night - It was in the evening, or early part of the night. What
is recorded in the following chapters took place the same night.

[John 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 13:31</span></span>

Now is the Son of man glorified - The last deed is done that was
necessary to secure the death of the Son of man, the glory that shall
result to him from that death, the wonderful success of the gospel, the
exaltation of the Messiah, and the public and striking attestation of
God to him in the view of the universe. See the notes at [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md).

[John 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 13:32</span></span>

If God be glorified in him - If God is honored by him. If the life and
death of the Messiah be such as to lead to the honor of God, such as
shall manifest its perfections, and show his goodness, truth, and
justice, then he will show that he thus approves his work.

God shall also glorify him - He will honor the Messiah. He will not
suffer him to go without a proper attestation of his acceptance, and of
the honor that God puts on him. Jesus here confidently anticipated that
the Father would show that he was pleased with what he had done. He did
it in the miracles that attended his death, in his resurrection,
ascension, exaltation, and in the success of the gospel. We may remark
that God will always, in the proper time and way, manifest his
approbation of those who live so as to promote the honor of his name.

In himself - Or by himself; by a direct and public expression of his
approbation. Not by the ministry of angels or by any other subordinate
attestation, but by an expression that shall be direct from him. This
was done by his direct interposition in his resurrection and ascension
to heaven.

Shall straightway - Immediately, or without delay. This refers to the
fact that the time when God would put this honor on him was at hand. His
death, resurrection, and ascension were near.

[John 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 13:33</span></span>

Little children - An expression of great tenderness, denoting his deep
interest in their welfare. As he was about to leave them, he endeavors
to mitigate their grief by the most tender expressions of attachment,
showing that he felt for them the deep interest in their welfare which a
parent feels for his children. The word "children" is often given to
Christians as implying:

1\. that God is their Father, and that they sustain toward him that
endearing relation, [Rom 8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md).

2\. as denoting their need of teaching and guidance, as children need
the aid and counsel of a father. See the corresponding term "babes" used
in [Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md).

3\. It is used, as it is here, as an expression of tenderness and
affection. See [Gal 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md), [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028.md); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md), [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md).

Yet a little while I am with you - He did not conceal the fact that he
was soon to leave them. There is something exceedingly tender in this
address. It shows that he loved them to the end; that as their friend
and guide, as a man, he felt deeply at the thoughts of parting from
them, and leaving them to a cold and unfeeling world. A parting scene at
death is always one of tenderness; and it is well when, like this, there
is the presence of the Savior to break the agony of the parting pang,
and to console us with the words of his grace.

As I said unto the Jews - See [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md).

So now I say to you - That is, they could not follow him then, [Joh
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md); [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md). He was about to die and return
to God, and for a time they must be willing to be separated from him.
But he consoled them [Joh 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md) with
the assurance that the separation would be only temporary, and that they
should afterward follow him.

[John 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 13:34</span></span>

A new commandment - This command he gave them as he was about to leave
them, to be a badge of discipleship, by which they might be known as his
friends and followers, and by which they might be distinguished from all
others. It is called new, not because there was no command before which
required people to love their fellow-man, for one great precept of the
law was that they should love their neighbor as themselves [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md); but it was new because it had
never before been made that by which any class or body of people had
been known and distinguished. The Jew was known by his external rites,
by his uniqueness of dress, etc.; the philosopher by some other mark of
distinction; the military man by another, etc. In none of these cases
had love for each other been the distinguishing and special badge by
which they were known. But in the case of Christians they were not to be
known by distinctions of wealth, or learning, or fame; they were not to
aspire to earthly honors; they were not to adopt any special style of
dress or badge, but they were to be distinguished by tender and constant
attachment to each other.

This was to surmount all distinction of country, of color, of rank, of
office, of sect. Here they were to feel that they were on a level, that
they had common wants, were redeemed by the same sacred blood, and were
going to the same heaven. They were to befriend each other in trials; be
careful of each other's feelings and reputation; deny themselves to
promote each other's welfare. See [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md); [Th1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md); [Th2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md); [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md); [Pe2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#007.md). In all these places the command
of Jesus is repeated or referred to, and it shows that the first
disciples considered this indeed as the special law of Christ. This
command or law was, moreover, new in regard to the extent to which this
love was to be carried; for he immediately adds, "As I have loved you,
that ye also love one another." His love for them was strong, continued,
unremitting, and he was now about to show his love for them in death.
[Joh 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013.md); "greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." So in [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md) it is said that "we ought also to
lay down our lives for the brethren." This was a new expression of love;
and it showed the strength of attachment which we ought to have for
Christians, and how ready we should be to endure hardships, to encounter
dangers, and to practice self-denial, to benefit those for whom the Son
of God laid down his life.

[John 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 13:35</span></span>

By this shall all men ... - That is, your love for each other shall be
so decisive evidence that you are like the Saviour, that all people
shall see and know it. It shall be the thing by which you shall be known
among all men. You shall not be known by special rites or habits; not by
a special form of dress or manner of speech; not by special austerities
and unusual customs, like the Pharisees, the Essenes, or the scribes,
but by deep, genuine, and tender affection. And it is well known it was
this which eminently distinguished the first Christians, and was the
subject of remark by the surrounding pagans. "See," said the pagan, "see
how they love one another! They are ready to lay down their lives for
each other." Alas! how changed is the spirit of the Christian world
since then! Perhaps, of all the commands of Jesus, the observance of
this is that which is least apparent to a surrounding world. It is not
so much that they are divided into different sects, for this may be
consistent with love for each other; but it is the want of deep-felt,
genuine love toward Christians even of our own denomination; the absence
of genuine self-denial; the pride of rank and wealth; and the fact that
professed Christians are often known by anything else rather than by
true attachment to those who bear the same Christian name and image. The
true Christian loves religion wherever it is found equally in a prince
or in a slave, in the mansion of wealth or in the cottage of poverty, on
the throne or in the hut of want. He overlooks the distinction of sect,
of color, and of nations; and wherever he finds a man who bears the
Christian name and manifests the Christian spirit, he loves him. And
this, more and more as the millennium draws near, will be the special
badge of the professed children of God. Christians will love their own
denominations less than they love the spirit and temper of the
Christian, wherever it may be found.
