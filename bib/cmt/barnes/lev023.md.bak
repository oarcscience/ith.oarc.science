### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 23:1</span></span>

The specified times for public worship according to the Law were;

\(1\) The daily morning and evening sacrifices, sometimes called "the
continual burnt-offering."

\(2\) The weekly Sabbath.

\(3\) the day of the new moon.

\(4\) the "set feasts" [Num 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md) or
appointed times of annual observance, of which there were five, the
Passover, the Day of Pentecost, the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of
Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles. For each of these occasions
special sacrifices were appointed Num. 28; 29.

[Leviticus 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 23:2</span></span>

The feasts - literally, the appointed times. So in [Lev
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md), [Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md), etc. This section Lev. 23:1-38
sets forth for practical guidance the relation in which the appointed
times of the Lord, weekly as well as annual, stood to the ordinary
occupations of the people.

Holy convocations - Days of sabbatical rest for the whole people; they
owed their name to gatherings for religious edification, which, in later
times, were probably held in every town and village in the holy land.
There were in the course of the year, besides the weekly Sabbaths, seven
days of holy convocation [Exo 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016.md);
[Num 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#018.md), [Num
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#025.md); [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md), [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md), [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md), with a distinction between them
as regards strictness of observance (compare [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003.md), [Lev
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028.md) with [Lev
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007).md).

[Leviticus 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 23:3</span></span>

The seventh day had been consecrated as the Sabbath of Yahweh, figuring
His own rest; it was the acknowledged sign of the covenant between God
and His people. See the [Exo 20:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)
notes. As such it properly held its place at the head of the days of
holy convocation.

[Leviticus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 23:4</span></span>

The recurrence of the sabbatical number in the five annual days of holy
convocation should be noticed.

[Leviticus 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 23:5</span></span>

In these verses, the Passover, or Paschal Supper, and the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, are plainly spoken of as distinct feasts. See [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006.md), [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md), [Exo
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017.md); [Num
28:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016.md).

[Lev 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005.md)

See [Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006.md). According to the Hebrew
mode of reckoning, the 15th day of the month began on the evening of the
14th. The day of holy convocation with which the Feast of Unleavened
Bread commenced [Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md) was the
15th, and that with which it terminated was the 21st. Compare [Num
28:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016.md).

[Lev 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006.md)

Feast - The three festivals (often called the Great Festivals),
Passover, Pentecost and tabernacles, to which the name חג chag, i. e. a
feast or rejoicing properly belongs [Lev
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006.md), [Lev
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md), [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), [Lev
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#041.md), were distinguished by the
attendance of the male Israelites at the national sanctuary (compare
[Exo 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md); [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md); [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md). In later times they were
called by the rabbins "pilgrimage feasts." It is worthy of note that the
Hebrew word is identical with the Arabic "haj", the name of the
pilgrimage to Mecca, from which comes the well-known word for a pilgrim,
"haji".

[Lev 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md)

No servile work - literally, no work of labor, no work that belongs to
one's worldly calling, such as labor in agriculture or handicraft. The
preparation of food was permitted [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016.md), a licence not granted on the
weekly Sabbath, or on the day of atonement [Lev
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028.md), [Lev
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#030.md); [Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010.md); [Exo
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#003.md).

[Lev 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008.md)

The sacrifices here meant are named in [Num
28:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019.md).

[Leviticus 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 23:9</span></span>

These verses contain a distinct command regarding the religious services
immediately connected with the grain harvest, given by anticipation
against the time when the people were to possess the promised land.

[Lev 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md)

Sheaf - The original word, "omer", means either a sheaf [Deu
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019.md); [Rut
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#007.md), or a measure [Exo
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016.md). Our version is probably right
in this place. The offering which was waved [Lev
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030.md) was most likely a small sheaf of
barley, the grain which is first ripe. The first fruits of the wheat
harvest were offered seven weeks later in the loaves of Pentecost. See
[Lev 23:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md). The two offerings thus
figure the very commencement and the completion of the grain harvest;
compare [Rut 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#022.md); [Rut
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#023.md).

[Lev 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md)

On the morrow after the sabbath - It is most probable that these words
denote the 16th of Abib, the day after the first day of holy convocation
(see [Lev 23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005) note.md), and that this
was called "the Sabbath of the Passover", or, "the Sabbath of unleavened
bread".

[Lev 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013.md)

Two tenth deals - Two omers, or tenth parts of an ephah, about a gallon
and three quarters. See [Lev 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md)
note. The double quantity (contrast [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md); [Num
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md); [Num
28:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019).md), implying greater
liberality, was appropriate in a harvest feast.

Drink offering - This and [Lev 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md),
[Lev 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md) are the only places in the
book of Leviticus in which drink-offerings are mentioned. See the [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md) note.

[Lev 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014.md)

Bread ... parched corn ... green ears - These are the three forms in
which grain was commonly eaten. The old name, Abib, signified "the month
of green ears." See [Jos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011.md).

[Lev 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md)

The morrow after the sabbath - See [Lev
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md) note.

Seven sabbaths - More properly, seven weeks (compare [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md). The word Sabbath, in the
language of the New Testament as well as the Old, is used for "week"
([Lev 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md); [Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md); [Luk
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012), etc..md).

[Lev 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016.md)

The morrow after the seventh week was the 50th day after the conclusion
of a week of weeks. The day is called in the Old Testament, "the feast
of harvest" [Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md), "the feast of
weeks," "the feast of the first fruits of wheat harvest" [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md); [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010.md), and "the day of the first
fruits" [Num 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md). The word
"Pentecost" used in the heading of this chapter in English Bibles is
found only in the Apocrypha and the New Testament, Tobit 2:1; 2 Macc.
12:32; [Act 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md); [Act
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016.md); [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md).

[Lev 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017.md)

Habitations - Not strictly houses, but places of abode in a general
sense. It seems here to denote the land in which the Israelites were to
dwell so as to express that the flour was to be of home growth. The two
loaves were to be merely waved before Yahweh and then to become the
property of the priests. No bread containing leaven could be offered on
the altar (see the [Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011) note.md).
The object of this offering seems to have been to present to the Lord
the best produce of the earth in the actual condition in which it is
most useful for the support of human life. It thus represented in the
fittest manner the thanksgiving which was proper for the season. The
loaves appear to be distinctively called "the first fruits for Yahweh,"
and references to them are found in [Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md); [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md), etc. As these loaves offered
before Yahweh sanctified the harvest of the year, so has "Christ the
firstfruits" sanctified the Church, which, in its union with Him as the
firstfruits, becomes also the Sanctifier of the world. See the services
for Whitsuntide.

[Lev 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md)

More properly, seven sheep of a year old (to be distinguished from the
lamb in [Lev 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#012).md), and a young bull
which might be from one to three years old. Compare [Num
28:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md).

[Lev 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019.md)

Properly, a shaggy he-goat [Lev 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md)
and two sheep of a year old.

[Lev 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020.md)

When living creatures were "waved" [Lev
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030.md) before Yahweh, it is said that
they were led to and fro before the tabernacle according to an
established form.

[Lev 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021.md)

The self-same day - The Feast of Weeks was distinguished from the two
other great annual feasts by its consisting, according to the Law, of
only a single day. But in later times it is said that during the
following six days the Israelites used to bring their offerings to the
temple, and to give the week something of a festal character in the
suspension of mourning for the dead.

[Lev 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022.md)

The repetition of the Law (see the margin reference) is appropriately
connected with the thanksgiving for the completed grain harvest.

[Leviticus 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 23:24</span></span>

A sabbath - Here and in [Lev 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md) a
word which should rather be rendered a sabbatical rest.

Blowing of trumpets - Here and in [Num
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md), literally "shouting". There is
no mention of trumpets in the Hebrew text of the Law in connection with
the day. However, there is no reason to doubt the tradition that the day
was distinguished by a general blowing of trumpets throughout the land,
and that the kind of trumpet generally used for the purpose was the
curved horn of an animal or a cornet of metal, such as was used at Sinai
[Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md), and on the Day of Jubilee
[Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009.md). It must have differed in
this respect from the ordinary festival of the New moon when the long
straight trumpet of the temple alone was blown ([Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md); [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023); see cut.md).

Seventh month - Called by the Jews in later times it was called Tisri,
but in the Old Testament Ethanim, [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md). According to the uniform voice of
tradition "the first day" of this month was the first day of the Civil
year in use before the Exodus, and was observed as the festival of the
New year. Some have viewed it as a commemoration of the Creation of the
world [Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007.md) : others, as the
anniversary of the giving of the Law.

[Leviticus 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 23:27</span></span>

Also - Surely. On the special rites of the day, the tenth of Tisri, that
is from the evening of the ninth day of the month to that of the tenth
[Lev 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#032.md), see Lev. 16.

[Leviticus 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 23:34</span></span>

Seven days - Like the Passover, the feast of tabernacles commenced at
the full moon, on the fifteenth day of the month, and lasted for seven
days. The week of the feast was followed by an eighth day, forming
strictly no part of it [Lev 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md),
[Num 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md); [Neh
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#018.md), which was a day of holy
convocation, and appears to have been generally distinguished by the
word translated "solemn assembly" [Deu
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#008.md); [Kg2
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#020.md); [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md); [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md). From its derivation the word in
the original appears strictly to denote a closing festival, and this
rendering would apply with the most perfect fitness to the day after the
week of the Feast of tabernacles, as the conclusion of the series of
yearly festivals.

[Leviticus 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 23:36</span></span>

An offering made by fire - See [Lev
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008.md). The succession of sacrifices
prescribed in Num. 29:12-38, which forms such a marked feature in the
Feast of Tabernacles, tends to show the distinctness of the "solemn
assembly" from the festal week.

[Leviticus 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 23:37</span></span>

The meaning appears to be; "these are the yearly appointed times on
which ye shall hold holy convocations and offer to Yahweh sacrifices, in
addition to the Sabbath offerings [Num
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009.md) and to all your voluntary
offerings." Compare [Num 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md).

[Leviticus 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lev 23:39</span></span>

Also - Surely. The mode in which the Feast of Tabernacles is here
reintroduced, after the mention of it in [Lev
23:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md), may suggest that this
passage originally formed a distinct document.

The fruit of the land - i. e. the produce, including the grain, the
olives, the vintage and the fruits of all kinds. The time of year so
indicated would answer in the holy land to the beginning of October. See
[Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md) note.

[Leviticus 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 23:40</span></span>

The boughs of goodly trees - Or, the fruit (see the margin) of the
citron trees. It is said that every Israelite at the Feast of
tabernacles carried in one hand a bundle of branches and in the other a
citron. The branches seem to have comprised the boughs of palm-trees,
"thick trees" and willows here named. See the note to [Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md); [Neh
8:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015.md).

[Leviticus 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 23:42</span></span>

Booths - According to Jewish tradition, what were used at the Feast of
Tabernacles were strictly "tabernacula," structures of boards, with a
covering of boughs.

The "booth" in which the Israelite kept the Feast, and the "tent" which
was his ordinary abode in the wilderness, had this in common - they were
temporary places of sojourn, they belonged to camp-life. The seven days
of abode in the booths of the festival was thus a fair symbol of the
forty years of abode in tents in the wilderness. The Feast might well
become the appointed memorial of this period of their history for the
ages to come.

All that are Israelites born - The omission of the foreigners in this
command is remarkable. Perhaps the intention was that on this joyous
occasion they were to be hospitably entertained as guests. Compare [Deu
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014.md).

[Leviticus 23:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lev 23:44</span></span>

Feasts - Appointed times. See [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md) note.
