Heritage

### [Deuteronomy Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 20:1</span></span>

Horses, and chariots - The most formidable elements of an Oriental host,
which the Canaanites possessed in great numbers; compare [Jos
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md); [Jdg
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#003.md); [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md). Israel could not match these
with corresponding forces (compare [Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016) note and references.md), but,
having the God of battles on its side, was not to be dismayed by them;
the assumption being that the war had the sanction of God, and was
consequently just.

[Deuteronomy 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 20:2</span></span>

The priest - Not the high priest, but one appointed for the purpose, and
called, according to the rabbis, "the anointed of the war": hence,
perhaps the expression of [Jer 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md),
etc. "prepare ye" (literally consecrate) "war." Thus, Phinehas went with
the warriors to fight against Midian ([Num
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006.md); compare [Sa1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004.md), [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011.md); [Ch2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012).md).

[Deuteronomy 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 20:5</span></span>

The officers dedicated it - See [Exo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006.md) note.

Compare the marginal references. The expression is appropriate, because
various ceremonies of a religious kind were customary among the Jews on
taking possession of a new house. The immunity conferred in this verse
lasted, like that in [Deu 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007.md)
(compare [Deu 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005).md), for one year.

[Deuteronomy 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 20:6</span></span>

See the margin and references. The fruit of newly-planted trees was set
apart from common uses for four years.

[Deuteronomy 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 20:9</span></span>

The meaning is that the "officers" should then subdivide the levies, and
appoint leaders of the smaller divisions thus constituted.

[Deuteronomy 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 20:10</span></span>

Directions intended to prevent wanton destruction of life and property
in sieges.

[Deu 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md)

Forbearance, however, was not to be shown toward the Canaanite nations,
which were to be utterly exterminated (compare [Deu
7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001).md). The command did not apply to
beasts as well as men (compare [Jos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#011.md), [Jos
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#014).md).

[Deu 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md)

The parenthesis may he more literally rendered "for man is a tree of the
field," i. e., has his life from the tree of the field, is supported in
life by it (compare [Deu 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006).md). The
Egyptians seem invariably to have cut down the fruit-trees in war.
