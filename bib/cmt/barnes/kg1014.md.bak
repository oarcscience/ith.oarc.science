### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 14:1</span></span>

At that time - The phrase here connects the narrative which follows with
Jeroboam's persistence in his evil courses. The event related is the
first judgment upon him for his obduracy, the beginning of the cutting
off of his house from the face of the earth.

Abijah - We see by this name that Jeroboam did not intend to desert the
worship of Yahweh, since its signification is "Yahweh is my father," or
"Yahweh is my desire" [Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 14:2</span></span>

Disguise thyself - Jeroboam fears that even Ahijah the Shilonite, who in
some sort made him king, will scarcely give his queen a favorable
answer. The king's conscience tells him that he has not performed the
conditions on which he was promised "a sure house" [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 14:3</span></span>

See the marginal reference The presents here were selected for the
purpose of deception, being such as a poor country person would have
been likely to bring. Jeroboam counted also on Ahijah's blindness [Kg1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004.md) as favoring his plan of deception
(compare [Gen 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md), [Gen
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022).md).

Cracknels - See the margin. The Hebrew word is thought to mean a kind of
cake which crumbled easily.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 14:5</span></span>

Feign herself to be another woman - literally, "she shall make herself
strange," i. e., "she shall come in disguised." So [Kg1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 14:6</span></span>

For I am sent to thee - Rather, "I also am sent to thee." As thou hast a
message to me from thy husband, so have I a message to thee from the
Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 14:7</span></span>

As Jeroboam's appointment to the kingdom had been formally announced to
him by the prophet Ahijah, so the same prophet is commissioned to
acquaint him with his forfeiture of it. Compare [Sa1
15:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 14:9</span></span>

Above all that were before thee - i. e., above all previous rulers of
the people, whether Judges or kings. Hereto none of the rulers of Israel
had set up the idolatrous worship of ephod, teraphim, and the like [Jdg
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#017.md), as a substitute for the true
religion, or sought to impose an idolatrous system on the nation.
Gideon's ephod "became a snare" contrary to his intention [Jdg
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027.md). Solomon's high places were
private - built for the use of his wives, and not designed to attract
the people. Jeroboam was the first ruler who set himself to turn the
Israelites away from the true worship, and established a poor
counterfeit of it, which he strove to make, and succeeded in making, the
religion of the great mass of his subjects.

And hast cast me behind thy back - A very strong and very rare
expression, occurring again only in [Eze
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#035.md); where it is said of the Jews
generally, shortly before the captivity. The expressions in the marginal
references are similar but less fearful.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 14:10</span></span>

All the males of the family of Jeroboam were put to death by Baasha [Kg1
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028.md). The phrase "will cut off,"
etc., appears to have been a common expression among the Jews from the
time of David [Sa1 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022.md) to that of
Jehu [Kg2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#008.md), but scarcely either
before or after. We may suspect that, where the author of Kings uses it,
he found it in the documents which he consulted.

Him that is shut up and left in Israel - See the marginal reference
note.

And will take away the remnant ... - The idea is, that the whole family
is to be cleared away at once, as men clear away ordure or any vile
refuse.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 14:11</span></span>

The dogs are the chief scavengers of Oriental cities (compare [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md), [Psa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014).md). And the vulture is the chief
scavenger in the country districts, assisted sometimes by kites and
crows (see [Job 39:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027.md), where the
vulture, not the eagle, is intended). Vultures are very abundant in
Palestine.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 14:13</span></span>

The child was evidently a prince of some promise. It is probable that he
was heir to the throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 14:14</span></span>

The Hebrew text of this verse appears to be defective in this place. No
satisfactory sense can be obtained from it. The true meaning of the
original passage is possibly: "Yahweh shall raise up a king who will
destroy the house of Jeroboam on the day that he is raised up. What do I
say? He will destroy it even now."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 14:15</span></span>

The general prophecy of Moses [Deu
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#028.md), that the disobedient Israelites
would be rooted up out of their land, and cast into another land, is
here for the first time repeated, and is definitively applied to the ten
tribes, which are to be removed "beyond the river" (the Euphrates, [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md), [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024).md), and "scattered." On the
fulfillment of this prophecy, and especially on the "scattering" of the
ten tribes, see [Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md) note.

Groves - See [Exo 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md) note. The
grove or, "asherah"-) worship, adopted from the Canaanite nations,
appears to have died away after the fierce onslaught which Gideon made
upon it [Jdg 6:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025.md). It now revived,
and became one of the most popular of the idolatries both in Israel and
Judah ([Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023.md), and compare the
marginal references).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 14:17</span></span>

Jeroboam had by this time removed from Shechem, and established a new
capital in Tirzah, one of the old Canaanite towns [Jos
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024.md) - a town of great reputation for
beauty, counted in that respect on a par with Jerusalem [Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md). Tirzah is perhaps to be
identified with "Telluzah," a place in the mountains about 9 miles
distant from Shechem (Nablous) (or with Teiasir - Conder). It may have
been the palatial residence of the kings rather than the actual capital
of the country. It remained the capital until Omri built Samaria [Kg1
16:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md). Toward the close of the
kingdom it appears again as the city of Menahem, who murdered Shallum
and succeeded him [Kg2 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md).

The threshold of the door - literally," the threshold of the house."
Compare the prophecy [Kg1 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#012.md). The
child actually died as she crossed the threshold of the palace. Probably
the palace, like that of Sargon at Khorsabad, lay at the outer edge of
the town.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 14:19</span></span>

The wars of Jeroboam may be divided into:

\(1\) his wars with Rehoboam (see [Kg1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md), [Kg1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030).md); and

\(2\) his war with Abijam (see the marginal reference).

The book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel - (of Judah, [Kg1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029).md). See the Introduction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 14:21</span></span>

On the age of Rehoboam at his accession, see [Kg1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008.md) note. The 17 years of his reign
must have been complete, or a little more than complete, if Abijam
ascended the throne in the "eighteenth" year of Jeroboam [Kg1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 14:22</span></span>

This defection of Judah did not take place until Rehoboam's fourth year
(marginal reference).

They provoked him to jealousy - Compare [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); and on the force of the metaphor
involved in the word, see [Exo 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015.md)
note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 14:23</span></span>

The words "they also" are emphatic. Not only did the Israelites make
themselves high places [Kg1 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md);
[Kg1 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#032.md), but the people of Judah
also. The "high places," which are said to have been "built," were
probably small shrines or tabernacles hung with bright-colored tapestry
[Eze 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016.md), like the "sacred tent" of
the Carthaginians.

The "images" were rather "pillars" ([Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018) note.md).

Groves - See [Kg1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md), note. The
"groves," it will be observed, were "built" on high hills and "under
green trees."

Under every green tree - i. e., under all those remarkable trees which,
standing singly about the land, were landmarks to their respective
neighborhoods, and places of resort to travelers, who gladly rested
under their shade [Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 14:24</span></span>

Sodomites - literally, " (men) consecrated." The men in question were in
fact "consecrated" to the mother of the gods, the famous "Dea Syra,"
whose priests, or rather devotees, they were considered to be. The
nature of the ancient idolatries is best understood by recollecting that
persons of this degraded class practiced their abominable trade under a
religious sanction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 14:25</span></span>

The examination of the famous inscription of Shishak at Karnak has
resulted in the proof that the expedition commemorated was directed
against Palestine, and has further thrown a good deal of light on the
relations of the two kingdoms at the period. Of the fifteen fenced
cities fortified by Rehoboam in the early part of his reign [Ch2
11:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md), three, Shoco, Adoraim, and
Aijalon are distinctly mentioned among Shishak's conquests. Other towns
of Judah or Benjamin also occur. Further, a considerable number of the
captured cities are in the territory of Jeroboam: these cities "are
either Canaanite or Levitical." Hence, we gather, that, during the four
years which immediately followed the separation of the kingdoms,
Rehoboam retained a powerful hold on the dominions of his rival, many
Canaanite and Levitical towns acknowledging his sovereignty, and
maintaining themselves against Jeroboam, who probably called in Shishak
mainly to assist him in compelling these cities to submission. The
campaign was completely successful.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 14:26</span></span>

The circumstances of Shishak's invasion, related here with extreme
brevity, are given with some fulness by the author of Chronicles
(marginal reference). It is still a question whether the submission of
the Jewish king is or is not expressly recorded in the Karnak
inscription. Midway in the list of cities and tribes occurs the entry
"YUDeH-MALK" which it has been proposed to translate "Judah, king."
Others regard it as the name of a Palestinian town not otherwise known
to us.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 14:28</span></span>

It appears from this verse that Rehoboam, notwithstanding that he
encouraged, and perhaps secretly practiced, idolatry ([Kg1
14:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022.md), compare [Kg1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003.md), [Kg1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012.md); [Ch2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001).md), maintained a public profession
of faith in Yahweh, and attended in state the temple services. Compare
the conduct of Solomon, [Kg1 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 14:31</span></span>

Slept with his fathers and was buried ... - Compare [Kg1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md). The expression is a sort of
formula, and is used with respect to all the kings of Judah, except two
or three. The writer probably regards the fact, which he records so
carefully, as a continuation of God's mercy to David.

His mother's name ... - The mention of the queen-mother so regularly in
the account of the kings of Judah is thought to indicate that she had an
important position in the state. There are, however, only two instances
where such a person seems to have exercised any power [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); 2 Kings 11:1-20.

Abijam - Abijah (see the marginal reference) was probably his real name,
while Abijam is a form due to the religious feeling of the Jews, who
would not allow the word JAH to be retained as an element in the name of
so bad a king. Instances of a similar feeling are the change of Bethel"
into Beth-aven in Hosea [Kg1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#015.md), and
perhaps of Jehoahaz into Ahaz ([Kg2
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#038) note.md).
