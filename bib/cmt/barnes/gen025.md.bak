### [Genesis Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md)

\- The Death of Abraham

1\. קטוּרה qeṭûrâh, "Qeturah, incense."

2\. זמרן zı̂mrān, "Zimran, celebrated in song." יקשׁן yāqshān, "Joqshan,
fowler." מדן medān, "Medan, judge." מדין mı̂dyān, "Midian, one who
measures." לאבק yı̂shbāq, "Jishbaq, he leaves." שׁוּח shûach, "Shuach,
pit."

3\. לטוּשׁם leṭûshı̂ym, "Letushim, hammered, sharpened." לאמים le'umı̂ym,
"Leummim, peoples."

4\. עיפה ‛êypâh, "'Ephah, darkness." עפר ‛êper, "'Epher, dust." אבידע
'ǎbı̂ydā‛, "Abida', father of knowledge." אלדעה 'eldā‛âh, "Elda'ah,
knowing?"

Another family is born to Abraham by Keturah, and portioned off, after
which he dies and is buried.

[Gen 25:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md)

Added and took a wife. - According to the laws of Hebrew composition,
this event may have taken place before that recorded in the close of the
previous chapter. Of this law we have several examples in this very
chapter. And there is nothing contrary to the customs of that period in
adding wife to wife. We cannot say that Abraham was hindered from taking
Keturah in the lifetime of Sarah by any moral feeling which would not
also have hindered him from taking Hagar. It has been also noticed that
Keturah is called a concubine, which is thought to imply that the proper
wife was still living; and that Abraham was a very old man at the death
of Sarah. But, on the other hand, it is to be remembered that these sons
were in any case born after the birth of Isaac, and therefore after
Abraham was renewed in vital powers. If this renewal of vigor remained
after the birth of Isaac, it may have continued some time after the
death of Sarah, whom he survived thirty-eight years. His abstinence from
any concubine until Sarah gave him Hagar is against his taking any other
during Sarah's lifetime. His loneliness on the death of Sarah may have
prompted him to seek a companion of his old age. And if this step was
delayed until Isaac was married, and therefore separated from him, an
additional motive would impel him in the same direction. He was not
bound to raise this wife to the full rights of a proper wife, even
though Sarah were dead. And six sons might be born to him twenty-five
years before his death. And if Hagar and Ishmael were dismissed when he
was about fifteen years old, so might Keturah when her youngest was
twenty or twenty-five. We are not warranted, then, still less compelled,
to place Abraham's second marriage before the death of Sarah, or even
the marriage of Isaac. It seems to appear in the narrative in the order
of time.

[Gen 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md)

The endeavors to ascertain the tribes that descended from these six sons
of Keturah have not been very successful. Zimran has been compared with
Ζαβράμ Zabram (Ptol. vi. 7, 5), situated west of Mecca on the Red Sea.
Jokshan with the Κασσανῖται Kassanitai (Ptol. vi. 7, 6), and with the
tribe Jakish among the Himyarites in South Arabia. Medan with Μοδιάνα
Modiana on the east coast of the Aelanitic Gulf. Midian is found in two
localities west of the Aelanitic Gulf and east of the Salt Sea. Among
the former, Moses afterward found refuge. The latter are probably east
of Abraham's residence. Ishbak is compared with Shobek, a place in
Idumaea. Shuah probably belongs to the same region. He may be the
ancestor of Bildad the Shuhite [Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md). Of these, Midian alone appears
to be ascertained. The others may have been absorbed in that congeries
of tribes, the Arabs.

[Gen 25:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md)

Sheba, Dedan, and Asshurim are recurring names [Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md), [Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md), [Gen
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#028.md), describing other tribes of
Arabs equally unknown. The three sons of Dedan may be traced in the
tribe Asir of the south of Hejaz, the Beni Leits of Hejaz, and the Beni
Lam of the borders of Mesopotamia. Of the sons of Midian, Epha is
mentioned in [Isa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md) along with
Midian. Epher is compared with Beni Ghifar in Hejaz, Henok with Hanakye
north of Medinah, Abida with the Abide, and Eldaah with the Wadaa. These
conjectures of Burckhardt are chiefly useful in showing that similar
names are still existing in the country. There are here six sons of
Abraham, seven grandsons, and three great-grandsons, making sixteen
descendants by Keturah. If there were any daughters, they are not
noticed. It is not customary to mention females, unless they are
connected with leading historical characters. These descendants of
Abraham and Keturah are the third contribution of Palgites to the
Joktanites, who constituted the original element of the Arabs, the
descendants of Lot and Ishmael having preceded them. All these branches
of the Arab nation are descended from Heber.

[Gen 25:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#005.md)

Abraham makes Isaac his heir [Gen
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#036.md). He gives portions to the sons
of the concubines during his lifetime, and sends them away to the East.
Ishmael had been portioned off long before [Gen
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md). The East is a general name for
Arabia, which stretched away to the southeast and east of the point
where Abraham resided in the south of Palestine. The northern part of
Arabia, which lay due east of Palestine, was formerly more fertile and
populous than now. The sons of Keturah were probably dismissed before
they had any children. Their notable descendants, according to custom,
are added here before they are dismissed from the main line of the
narrative.

[Gen 25:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007.md)

The death of Abraham. His years were a hundred and seventy-five. He
survived Sarah thirty-eight years, and Isaac's marriage thirty-five. His
grandfather lived a hundred and forty-eight years, his father two
hundred and five, his son Isaac a hundred and eighty, and his grandson
Jacob a hundred and forty-seven; so that his years were the full average
of that period. "Expired" - breathed his last. "In a happy old age," in
external and internal blessedness [Gen
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md). "Old and full" - having
attained to the standard length of life in his days, and being satisfied
with this life, so that he was ready and willing to depart. "Gathered to
his peoples" [Gen 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md). To be
gathered is not to cease to exist, but to continue existing in another
sphere. His peoples, the departed families, from whom he is descended,
are still in being in another not less real world. This, and the like
expression in the passage quoted, give the first fact in the history of
the soul after death, as the burial is the first step in that of the
body.

[Gen 25:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009.md)

Isaac and Ishmael, - in brotherly cooperation. Ishmael was the oldest
son, dwelt in the presence of all his brethren, and had a special
blessing. The sons of Keturah were far away in the East, very young, and
had no particular blessing. Ishmael is therefore properly associated
with Isaac in paying the last offices to their deceased father. The
burying-place had been prepared before. Its purchase is here rehearsed
with great precision as a testimony of the fact. This burial-ground is
an earnest of the promised possession.

[Gen 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#011.md)

This verse is an appendix to the history of Abraham, stating that the
blessing of God, which he had enjoyed until his death, now descended
upon his son Isaac, who abode at Beer-lahai-roi. The general name "God"
is here employed, because the blessing of God denotes the material and
temporal prosperity which had attended Abraham, in comparison with other
men of his day. Of the spiritual and eternal blessings connected with
Yahweh, the proper name of the Author of being and blessing, we shall
hear in due time.

The section now completed contains the seventh of the documents
commencing with the formula, "these are the generations." It begins in
the eleventh chapter and ends in the twenty-fifth, and therefore
contains a greater number of chapters and amount of matter than the
whole of the preceding narrative. This is as it should be in a record of
the ways of God with man. In the former sections, things anterior and
external to man come out into the foreground; they lie at the basis of
his being, his mental and moral birth. In the present section, things
internal to man and flowing from him are brought into view. These are
coincident with the growth of his spiritual nature. The latter are no
less momentous than the former for the true and full development of his
faculties and capacities.

In the former sections the absolute being of God is assumed; the
beginning of the heavens and the earth asserted. The reconstruction of
skies and land and the creation of a new series of plants and animals
are recorded. This new creation is completed by the creating of man in
the image of God and after his likeness. The placing of man in a garden
of fruit trees prepared for his sustenance and gratification; the
primeval command, with its first lessons in language, physics, ethics,
and theology; the second lesson in speaking when the animals are named;
and the separation of man into the male and the female, are followed by
the institutions of wedlock and the Sabbath, the fountain-heads of
sociality with man and God, the foreshadows of the second and first
tables of the law. The fall of man in the second lesson of ethics; the
sentence of the Judge, containing in its very bosom the intimation of
mercy; the act of fratricide, followed by the general corruption of the
whole race; the notices of Sheth, of calling on the name of Yahweh begun
at the birth of Enosh, of Henok who walked with God, and of Noah who
found grace in his sight; the flood sweeping away the corruption of man
while saving righteous Noah; and the confusion of tongues, defeating the
ambition of man, while preparing for the replenishing of the earth and
the liberties of men - these complete the chain of prominent facts that
are to be seen standing in the background of man's history. These are
all moments, potent elements in the memory of man, foundation-stones of
his history and philosophy. They cannot be surmounted or ignored without
absurdity or criminality.

In the section now completed the sacred writer descends from the general
to the special, from the distant to the near, from the class to the
individual. He dissects the soul of a man, and discloses to our view the
whole process of the spiritual life from the newborn babe to the perfect
man. Out of the womb of that restless selfish race, from whom nothing is
willingly restrained which they have imagined to do, comes forth Abram,
with all the lineaments of their moral image upon him. The Lord calls
him to himself, his mercy, his blessing, and his service. He obeys the
call. That is the moment of his new birth. The acceptance of the divine
call is the tangible fact that evinces a new nature. Henceforth he is a
disciple, having yet much to learn before he becomes a master, in the
school of heaven. From this time forward the spiritual predominates in
Abram; very little of the carnal appears.

Two sides of his mental character present themselves in alternate
passages, which may be called the physical and the metaphysical, or the
things of the body and the things of the soul. In the former only the
carnal or old corrupt nature sometimes appears; in the latter, the new
nature advances from stage to stage of spiritual growth unto perfection.
His entrance into the land of promise is followed by his descent into
Egypt, his generous forbearance in parting with Lot, his valorous
conduct in rescuing him, and his dignified demeanor toward Melkizedec
and the king of Sodom. The second stage of its spiritual development now
presents itself to our view; on receiving the promise, Fear not, Abram:
I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward, he believes in the Lord,
who counts it to him for righteousness, and enters into covenant with
him. This is the first fruit of the new birth, and it is followed by the
birth of Ishmael. On hearing the authoritative announcement, I am God
Almighty; walk before me and be perfect, he performs the first act of
that obedience which is the keystone of repentance, by receiving the
sign of covenant, and proceeds to the high functions of holding
communion and making intercession with God. These spiritual acts are
followed by the destruction of the cities of the Jordan vale, with the
preservation of Lot, the sojourning in Gerar, the birth of Isaac, and
the league with Abimelek. The last great act of the spiritual life of
Abraham is the surrender of his only son to the will of God, and this
again is followed by the death and burial of Sarah, the marriage of
Isaac, and the second marriage of Abraham.

It is manifest that every movement in the physical and ethical history
of Abraham is fraught with instruction of the deepest interest for the
heirs of immortality. The leading points in spiritual experience are
here laid before us. The susceptibilities and activities of a soul born
of the Spirit are unfolded to our view. These are lessons for eternity.
Every descendant of Abraham, every collateral branch of his family,
every contemporary eye or ear-witness, might have profited in the things
of eternity by all this precious treasury of spiritual knowledge. Many
of the Gentiles still had, and all might have had, a knowledge of the
covenant with Noah, and a share in its promised blessings. This would
not have precluded, but only promoted, the mission of Abraham to be the
father of the seed in whom all the families of man should effectually be
blessed. And in the meantime it would have caused to be circulated to
the ends of the earth that new revelation of spiritual experience which
was displayed in the life of Abraham for the perfecting of the saints.

\- Section XI. - Isaac

\- LII. History of Ishmael

13\. נבית nebāyot, Nebajoth, "heights." קדר qēdār, Qedar, "black." אדבאל

14\. משׁמע mı̂shma‛, Mishma', "hearing." דוּמה dûmâh, Dumah, "silence."
משׂא maśā', Massa, "burden."

15\. חדר chădar, Chadar, "chamber;" or חדד chădad, Chadad, "sharpness;"

קדמה qēdemâh, Qedemah, "before, eastward."

16\. חצר chātsēr, "court, village, town."

According to custom, before the history of the principal line is taken
up, that of the collateral branch is briefly given. Thus, Cain's history
is closed before Sheth's is commenced; Japheth and Ham are before Shem;
Haran and Nahor before Abram. And so the sons of Keturah are first
dismissed from the pages of history, and then Ishmael.

[Gen 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#012.md)

The present passage begins with the formula, "and these are the
generations," and forms the eighth document so commencing. The
appearance of a document consisting of seven verses is clearly against
the supposition that each of these documents is due to a different
author. The phrase points to a change of subject, not of author.

[Gen 25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013.md)

Nebaioth - [Isa 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md) is preserved in
the Nabataei inhabiting Arabia Petraea, and extending far toward the
East. "Kedar" [Isa 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md) appears in
the Cedrei of Pliny (H. N. 5, 12) who dwell east of Petraea. "Adbeel
Mibsam," and "Mishma are otherwise unknown. The last is connected with
the Μαισαιμενεῖς Maisaimeneis of Ptol. (v. 7, 21). "Dumah" [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md) is probably Δούμεθα Doumetha
(Ptol. vi. 19, 7) and Domata (Plin. H. N. 6, 32) and Dumat el-Jendel in
Nejd and the Syrian desert. "Massa" may be preserved in the Μασανοὶ
Masanoi of Ptolemy (v. 19, 2), northeast of Duma. "Hadar" is Hadad in
[Ch1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md), the Samaritan Pentateuch,
Onkelos, perhaps the Septuagint, and many codices. It is supposed to be
Χαττηνία Chatteenia (Polyb.), Attene, and to lie between Oman and
Bahrein. "Tema" [Job 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md); [Isa
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md); [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md) lay on the borders of Nejd and
the Syrian desert. "Jetur" remains in Ituraea, Jedur, northeast of the
sea of Galilee. Some suppose the Druses descended from him. "Naphish"
[Ch1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#019.md), [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md) lay in the same quarter.
"Kedemah" is otherwise unknown. "In their towns and in their castles."
The former are unwalled collections of houses or perhaps tents; the
latter, fortified keeps or encampments. "Twelve princes," one for each
tribe, descended from his twelve sons.

[Gen 25:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#017.md)

Ishmael dies at the age of a hundred and thirty-seven. "From Havilah,"
on the borders of Arabia Petraea and Felix. "Unto Shur," on the borders
of Arabia and Egypt. This was the original seat of the Ishmaelites, from
which they wandered far into Arabia. "In the presence of all his
brethren" - the descendants of Abraham by Sarah and Keturah, those of
Lot, and the Egyptians who were his brethren or near kindred by his
mother and wife. "He had fallen" into the lot of his inheritance. Thus
was fulfilled the prediction uttered before his birth [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md).

[Genesis 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md)

\- LIII. Birth of Esau and Jacob

20\. פדן padān, Paddan, "plowed field;" related: "cut, plow."

25\. עשׂי ‛êśâv, 'Esaw, "hairy, or made."

26\. יעקב ya‛ăqôb, Ja'aqob, "he shall take the heel."

27\. תם tām, "perfect, peaceful, plain." The epithet refers to
disposition, and contrasts the comparatively civilized character of
Jacob with the rude temper of Esau.

30\. אדים 'ědôm, Edom, "red."

The ninth document here begins with the usual phrase, and continues to
the end of the thirty-fifth chapter. It contains the history of the
second of the three patriarchs, or rather, indeed, as the opening phrase
intimates, of the generations of Isaac; that is, of his son Jacob. Isaac
himself makes little figure in the sacred history. Born when his mother
was ninety, and his father a hundred years of age, he is of a sedate,
contemplative, and yielding disposition. Consenting to be laid on the
altar as a sacrifice to God, he had the stamp of submission early and
deeply impressed on his soul. His life corresponds with these
antecedents. Hence, in the spiritual aspect of his character he was the
man of patience, of acquiescence, of susceptibility, of obedience. His
qualities were those of the son, as Abraham's were those of the father.
He carried out, but did not initiate; he followed, but did not lead; he
continued, but did not commence. Accordingly, the docile and patient
side of the saintly character is now to be presented to our view.

[Gen 25:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md)

The birth of Esau and Jacob. "The son of forty years." Hence, we learn
that Isaac was married the third year after his mother's death, when
Abraham was in his hundred and fortieth year. "Bethuel the Aramaean." As
Bethuel was a descendant of Arpakshad, not of Aram, he is here
designated, not by his descent, but by his adopted country Aram. By
descent he was a Kasdi or Kaldee. Sarah was barren for at least thirty
years; Rebekah for nineteen years. This drew forth the prayer of Isaac
in regard to his wife. The heir of promise was to be a child of prayer,
and accordingly when the prayer ascended the fruit of the womb was
given. Rebekah had unwonted sensations connected with her pregnancy. She
said to herself, "If it be so," if I have conceived seed, "why am I
thus," why this strange struggle within me? In the artlessness of her
faith she goes to the Lord for an explanation. We are not informed in
what way she consulted God, or how he replied. The expression, "she went
to inquire of the Lord," implies that there was some place of worship
and communion with God by prayer. We are not to suppose that she went to
Abraham, or any other prophet, if such were then at hand, when we have
no intimation of this in the text. Her communication with the Lord seems
to have been direct. This passage conveys to us the intimation that
there was now a fixed mode and perhaps place of inquiring at the Lord.
The Lord answers the mother of the promised seed. Two children are in
her womb, the parents of two nations, differing in their dispositions
and destinies. The one is to be stronger than the other. The order of
nature is to be reversed in them; for the older will serve the younger.
Their struggles in the womb are a prelude to their future history.

[Gen 25:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#024.md)

The twins are born in due time. The difference is manifest in the
outward appearance. The first is red and hairy. These qualities indicate
a passionate and precocious nature. He is called "Esau the hairy," or
"the made up," the prematurely developed. His brother is like other
children. An act takes place in the very birth foreshadowing their
future history. The second has a hold of his brother's heel, as if he
would trip him up from his very birth. Hence, he is called "Jacob the
wrestler," who takes hold by the heel.

[Gen 25:27-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md)

The brothers prove to be different in disposition and habit. The rough
fiery Esau takes to the field, and becomes skilled in all modes of
catching game. Jacob is of a homely, peaceful, orderly turn, dwelling in
tents and gathering round him the means and appliances of a quiet social
life. The children please their parents according as they supply what is
lacking in themselves. Isaac, himself so sedate, loves the wild,
wandering hunter, because he supplies him with pleasures which his own
quiet habits do not reach. Rebekah becomes attached to the gentle,
industrious shepherd, who satisfies those social and spiritual
tendencies in which she is more dependent than Isaac. Esau is
destructive of game; Jacob is constructive of cattle.

[Gen 25:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#029.md)

A characteristic incident in their early life is attended with very
important consequences. "Jacob sod pottage." He has become a sage in the
practical comforts of life. Esau leaves the field for the tent,
exhausted with fatigue. The sight and smell of Jacob's savory dish of
lentile soup are very tempting to a hungry man. "Let me feed now on that
red, red broth." He does not know how to name it. The lentile is common
in the country, and forms a cheap and palatable dish of a reddish brown
color, with which bread seems to have been eaten. The two brothers were
not congenial. They would therefore act each independently of the other,
and provide each for himself. Esau was no doubt occasionally rude and
hasty. Hence, a selfish habit would grow up and gather strength. He was
probably accustomed to supply himself with such fare as suited his
palate, and might have done so on this occasion without any delay. But
the free flavor and high color of the mess, which Jacob was preparing
for himself, takes his fancy, and nothing will do but the red red. Jacob
obviously regarded this as a rude and selfish intrusion on his privacy
and property, in keeping with similar encounters that may have taken
place between the brothers.

It is here added, "therefore was his name called Edom," that is, "Red."
The origin of surnames, or second names for the same person or place, is
a matter of some moment in the fair interpretation of an ancient
document. It is sometimes hastily assumed that the same name can only
owe its application to one occasion; and hence a record of a second
occasion on which it was applied is regarded as a discrepancy. But the
error lies in the interpreter, not in the author. The propriety of a
particular name may be marked by two or more totally different
circumstances, and its application renewed on each of these occasions.
Even an imaginary cause may be assigned for a name, and may serve to
originate or renew its application. The two brothers now before us
afford very striking illustrations of the general principle. It is
pretty certain that Esau would receive the secondary name of Edom, which
ultimately became primary in point of use, from the red complexion of
skin, even from his birth. But the exclamation "that red red," uttered
on the occasion of a very important crisis in his history, renewed the
name, and perhaps tended to make it take the place of Esau in the
history of his race. Jacob, too, the holder of the heel, received this
name from a circumstance occurring at his birth. But the buying of the
birthright and the gaining of the blessing, were two occasions in his
subsequent life on which he merited the title of the supplanter or the
holder by the heel [Gen 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md). These
instances prepare us to expect other examples of the same name being
applied to the same object, for different reasons on different
occasions.

"Sell me this day thy birthright." This brings to light a new cause of
variance between the brothers. Jacob was no doubt aware of the
prediction communicated to his mother, that the older should serve the
younger. A quiet man like him would not otherwise have thought of
reversing the order of nature and custom. In after times the right of
primogeniture consisted in a double portion of the father's goods [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md), and a certain rank as the
patriarch and priest of the house on the death of the father. But in the
case of Isaac there was the far higher dignity of chief of the chosen
family and heir of the promised blessing, with all the immediate and
ultimate temporal and eternal benefits therein included. Knowing all
this, Jacob is willing to purchase the birthright, as the most peaceful
way of bringing about that supremacy which was destined for him. He is
therefore cautious and prudent, even conciliating in his proposal.

He availed himself of a weak moment to accomplish by consent what was to
come. Yet he lays no necessity on Esau, but leaves him to his own free
choice. We must therefore beware of blaming him for endeavoring to win
his brother's concurrence in a thing that was already settled in the
purpose of God. His chief error lay in attempting to anticipate the
arrangements of Providence. Esau is strangely ready to dispose of his
birthright for a trivial present gratification. He might have obtained
other means of recruiting nature equally suitable, but he will sacrifice
anything for the desire of the moment. Any higher import of the right he
was prepared to sell so cheap seems to have escaped his view, if it had
ever occurred to his mind. Jacob, however, is deeply in earnest. He will
bring this matter within the range of heavenly influence. He will have
God solemnly invoked as a witness of the transfer. Even this does not
startle Esau. There is not a word about the price. It is plain that
Esau's thoughts were altogether on "the morsel of meat." He swears unto
Jacob. He then ate and drank, and rose up and went his way, as the
sacred writer graphically describes his reckless course. Most truly did
he despise his birthright. His mind did not rise to higher or further
things. Such was the boyhood of these wondrous twins.
