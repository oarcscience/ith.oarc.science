### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 4:1</span></span>

With this chapter begins the series of miracles which resulted in the
deliverance of Israel. The first miracle was performed to remove the
first obstacle, namely, the reluctance of Moses, conscious of his own
weakness, and of the enormous power with which he would have to contend.

[Exodus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 4:2</span></span>

A rod - The word seems to denote the long staff which on Egyptian
monuments is borne by men in positions of authority. It was usually made
of acacia wood.

[Exodus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 4:3</span></span>

A serpent - This miracle had a meaning which Moses could not mistake.
The serpent was probably the basilisk or Uraeus, the Cobra. This was the
symbol of royal and divine power on the diadem of every Pharaoh. The
conversion of the rod was not merely a portent, it was a sign, at once a
pledge and representation of victory over the king and gods of Egypt!

[Exodus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 4:6</span></span>

Leprous - The instantaneous production and cure of the most malignant
and subtle disease known to the Israelites was a sign of their danger if
they resisted the command, and of their deliverance if they obeyed it.
The infliction and cure were always regarded as special proofs of a
divine intervention.

[Exodus 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 4:10</span></span>

Eloquent - See the margin. The double expression "slow of speech ([Eze
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#005) margin.md) and of a slow tongue"
seems to imply a difficulty both in finding words and in giving them
utterance, a very natural result of so long a period of a shepherd's
life, passed in a foreign land.

Since thou hast spoken - This expression seems to imply that some short
time had intervened between this address and the first communication of
the divine purpose to Moses.

[Exodus 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 4:12</span></span>

Compare with this our Lord's promise to His Apostles; [Mat
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md); [Mar
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md).

[Exodus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 4:13</span></span>

And he said - The reluctance of Moses is in accordance with the inner
law of man's spiritual development, and specially with his own
character; but, under the circumstances, it indicated a weakness of
faith.

[Exodus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 4:14</span></span>

Anger - The words of Moses [Exo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013.md)
indicated more than a consciousness of infirmity; somewhat of vehemence
and stubbornness.

Aaron - This is the first mention of Aaron. The words "he can speak
well," probably imply that Aaron had both the power and will to speak.
Aaron is here called "the Levite," with reference, it may be, to the
future consecration of this tribe.

He cometh forth - i. e. is on the eve of setting forth. Not that Aaron
was already on the way, but that he had the intention of going to his
brother, probably because the enemies of Moses were now dead. See [Exo
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 4:15</span></span>

Thou shalt speak - Moses thus retains his position as "mediator;" the
word comes to him first, he transmits it to his brother.

[Exodus 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 4:16</span></span>

Instead of a mouth - We may bear in mind Aaron's unbroken habitude of
speaking Hebrew and his probable familiarity with Egyptian.

Instead of God - The word "God" is used of persons who represent the
Deity, as kings or judges, and it is understood in this sense here:
"Thou shalt be to him a master."

[Exodus 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 4:20</span></span>

An ass - Literally, "the ass," which, according to Hebrew idiom, means
that he set them upon asses. This is the first notice of other sons
besides Gershom.

The rod of God - The staff of Moses was consecrated by the miracle [Exo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002.md) and became "the rod of God."

[Exodus 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 4:21</span></span>

I will harden - Calamities which do not subdue the heart harden it. In
the case of Pharaoh, the hardening was at once a righteous judgment, and
a natural result of a long series of oppressions and cruelties.

[Exodus 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 4:22</span></span>

My firstborn - The expression would be perfectly intelligible to
Pharaoh, whose official designation was "son of Ra." In numberless
inscriptions the Pharaohs are styled "own sons" or "beloved sons" of the
deity. It is here applied for the first time to Israel; and as we learn
from [Exo 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023.md), emphatically in
antithesis to Pharaoh's own firstborn.

[Exodus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 4:24</span></span>

In the inn - Or "resting place." See [Gen
42:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#027.md) note.

Met him, and sought to kill him - Moses was attacked by a sudden and
dangerous illness, which he knew was inflicted by God. The word "sought
to kill" implies that the sickness, whatever might be its nature, was
one which threatened death had it not been averted by a timely act.
Zipporah believed that the illness of Moses was due to his having
neglected the duty of an Israelite, and to his not having circumcised
his own son; the delay was probably owing to her own not unnatural
repugnance to a rite, which though practiced by the Egyptians, was not
adopted generally in the East, even by the descendants of Abraham and
Keturah. Moses appears to have been utterly prostrate and unable to
perform the rite himself.

[Exodus 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 4:25</span></span>

Sharp stone - Not "knife," as in the margin. Zipporah used a piece of
flint, in accordance with the usage of the patriarchs. The Egyptians
never used bronze or steel in the preparation of mummies because stone
was regarded as a purer and more sacred material than metal.

Cast it at his feet - Showing at once her abhorrence of the rite, and
her feeling that by it she had saved her husband's life.

A bloody husband - Literally, "a husband of blood," or "bloods." The
meaning is: The marriage bond between us is now sealed by blood. By
performing the rite, Zipporah had recovered her husband; his life was
purchased for her by the blood of her child.

[Exodus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 4:26</span></span>

So he let him go - i. e. God withdrew His visitation from Moses.

Moses sent Zipporah and her children back to Jethro before he went to
Egypt, [Exo 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#002.md). The journey would
have been delayed had he waited for the healing of the child.

[Exodus 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 4:29</span></span>

All the elders - The Israelites retained their own national
organization; their affairs were administered by their own elders, who
called a public assembly [Exo 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031.md) to
hear the message brought by Moses and Aaron.
