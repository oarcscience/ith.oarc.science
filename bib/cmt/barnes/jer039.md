### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 39:1</span></span>

"The Capture of Jerusalem" - The majority of the particulars given in
[Jer 39:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001) occur again (marginal
reference); and are by some regarded as an interpolation. The external
evidence (that of the versions) is, however, in favor of their
authenticity. [Jer 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014) is to be
reconciled with [Jer 40:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001) by
remembering that Gedaliah had left Jerusalem and gone to Mizpah [Jer
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#006), a city in the immediate
neighborhood; and as he was not at home to protect the prophet, nothing
is more probable than that Jeremiah in company with the main body of
captives was brought to Ramah in chains.

[Jeremiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 39:3</span></span>

These princes were four:

\(1\) Nergal, Sharezer, i. e., Nirgal-sar-usur (May Nergal protect the
king);

\(2\) Samgar-Nebo (Be gracious, O Nebo);

\(3\) Sarsechim. No explanation is given at present of this name. He was
Rab-saris, i. e., chief of the eunuchs ([Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017) note).

\(4\) another Nergal-sharezer, who was Rab-mag, i. e., chief of the
Magians. He is known in history as Neriglissar, the son-in-law of
Nebuchadnezzar, and probably his vicegerent during his seven years of
madness. Two years after his death Neriglissar murdered Evil-Merodach,
Nebuchadnezzars son, and seized the crown, but after a reign of four
years was slain in battle against Cyrus, when disputing with him the
crown of Media. See [Dan 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001) note.

The middle gate - Probably that which separated the city of Zion from
the lower town.

[Jeremiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 39:4</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. The differences between the two accounts
are slight.

[Jeremiah 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 39:13</span></span>

Nebuzar-adan is in the inscriptions Nabu-zir-iddina (Nebo has given
offspring); and Nebushasban, Nabu-sizibanni (Nebo save me), whom some
identify with Sarsechim [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003).

[Jeremiah 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 39:14</span></span>

Jeremiah was to be taken out of the court of the watch, and placed in
the palace close by.

He dwelt among the people - i. e., he was no longer in custody, but
master of his own actions.

[Jeremiah 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 39:15</span></span>

This prophecy probably came to Jeremiah after his interview with
Zedekiah [Jer 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014), but is added here
as a supplement in order not to break the sequence of events.

[Jeremiah 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 39:17</span></span>

Of whom thou art afraid - The Chaldaeans. Ebed-melech apparently looked
forward with much alarm to the b oodshed sure to take place at the
storming of the city.

[Jeremiah 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 39:18</span></span>

A prey unto thee - An unexpected and unlooked-for gain. He had given
proof of faith in courageously delivering God's prophet.
