### [Judges Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001.md)

[Judges 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 5:1</span></span>

Deborah, as "a prophetess," both composed and sang this noble ode,
which, for poetic spirit and lyric fire, is not surpassed by any of the
sacred songs in the Bible. And, as Miriam took up the first verse of the
song of Moses [Exo 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021.md), and sang it
as an antiphony, so Barak, with the chorus of men, answered the song of
Deborah by singing [Jdg 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002.md), which is
also exactly suited for an antiphon, summing up as it does the subject
matter of the whole ode. Compare David's example [Sa2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015.md).

[Judges 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 5:2</span></span>

Render "For the leading of the leaders in Israel (the princes), for the
willingness of the people (to follow them) bless ye the Lord." See [Deu
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042.md) note, and compare [Jdg
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md) and [Jdg
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#013.md), where the nobles and the people
are again contrasted.

[Judges 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 5:4</span></span>

Compare [Psa 68:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md), and [Hab
3:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md). The three passages relate to
the same events, and mutually explain each other. The subject of them is
the triumphant march of Israel, with the Lord at their head, to take
possession of Canaan, and the overthrow of Sihon, Og, and the
Midianites. This march commenced from Kadesh, in the immediate
neighborhood of Self, and the victories which followed were an exact
parallel to the victory of Deborah and Barak, accompanied as it had been
with the storm which made Kishon to overflow his banks.

[Judges 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 5:6</span></span>

Words dcscriptive of a state of weakness and fear, so that Israel could
not frequent the highways. It is a graphic description of a country
occupied by an enemy.

[Judges 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 5:7</span></span>

Render the word "villages" (here and in [Jdg
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011).md) judgment, rule, or judges,
rulers. The sense is "The princes (or magistrates) ceased in Israel," i.
e. there was no one to do justice in the gate, or defend men from their
oppressors.

[Judges 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 5:8</span></span>

The "war in the gates" describes the hostile attacks of the Canaanites,
which were the punishment of the idolatry of the Israelites (compare the
marginal references), and the reduction of Israel to an unarmed and
unresisting state under the Philistine dominion. See [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md) note.

[Judges 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 5:9</span></span>

My heart ... - In this deplorable weakness of Israel how noble was the
conduct of the governors who volunteered to lead the people against
their oppressors. Deborah's heart was filled with admiration as she
thought of their patriotic devotion, and broke out into thanksgiving to
Yahweh.

[Judges 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 5:10</span></span>

Ye that ride on white donkeys ... - i. e. nobles or magistrates. Deborah
appeals to the classes mentioned in [Jdg
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006.md), to bear witness to the happy
change that had followed the overthrow of Jabin.

That sit in judgment - Rather "that sit on saddles, or horse-cloths," a
further description of those who ride on asses.

[Judges 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 5:11</span></span>

The sense of the King James Version is that, whereas formerly they could
not go in safety to draw water from their wells, but were shot at by the
archers of the enemy, now they were delivered from such tumults; and
standing round the wells in security rehearsed the righteous acts of the
Lord in delivering them, and "the righteous acts of His government in
Israel." (See [Jdg 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#007).md).

Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates - Israelites, who
had hid themselves in caves and deserts, could return in security to the
gates of their own cities for justice, or commerce, or to dwell there,
now that the Canaanite was subdued.

[Judges 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 5:12</span></span>

Deborah incites Barak to carry off as his prey the captive Canaanites
and their sheep and cattle (their "captivity").

[Judges 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 5:13</span></span>

This verse is otherwise rendered: "then a remnant of the nobles came
down; the people of the Lord came down for me against the mighty." The
following verses mention in detail who this "remnant" were.

[Judges 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 5:14</span></span>

Render "Of Ephraim (Deborah's own tribe) came down those whose root is
in Mount Amalek [Jdg 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#015.md); after thee
(O Ephraim) came Benjamin among thy people; of Machir (the west-Jordanic
milies of Manasseh. See [Jos 17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001).md)
there came down the chiefs, and of Zebulon they that handle the staff of
the officer" the military scribe, whose duty it was, like that of the
Roman tribunes, to keep the muster roll, and superintend the recruiting
of the army. (See [Kg2 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019)..md)

[Judges 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 5:15</span></span>

Even Issachar ... - i. e. "and, as well as Issachar, Barak also with the
tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, rushed down on foot from Mount Tabor
into the valley to attack the iron chariots of Sisera."

For the divisions - Better: "among the brooks." Reuben ought to have
followed in this catalogue of patriots, but with that abruptness for
which this poem is so conspicuous, Deborah adverts to his absence
instead.

[Judges 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 5:16</span></span>

Great searchings - (thoughts, [Jdg
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#015).md) of heart Deborah means to say
that at first the Reubenites made magnanimous resolutions to help their
brethren against Jabin. But they stayed at home, and let the opportunity
slip.

[Judges 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 5:17</span></span>

The land of Gilead, on the east of Jordan, was divided between Gad and
the half tribe of Manasseh, who are both comprehended here. Joppa was in
the territory of Dan [Jos 19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046.md), and
was in later times the sea-port for Jerusalem.

His breaches - Rather havens; i. e. the creeks and bays and river-months
by which their coast was broken. [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md).

[Judges 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 5:18</span></span>

In contrast with the selfishness of the tribes just named, Deborah
reverts with enthusiasm to the heroic prowess of Zebulun and Naphtali.

[Judges 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 5:19</span></span>

The Canaanite hosts are now described, led to battle by their numerous
kings. (Compare [Jos 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021)..md)

They took no gain of money - i. e. either they got no booty, as they
expected, or, they did not fight for plunder, but for life and victory
(compare [Jdg 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016.md) and [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030).md).

[Judges 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 5:20</span></span>

God fought on the side of Israel, and gave them the victory. Josephus
relates that, just as the battle began, a violent tempest came on with a
great downfall of rain; and a hailstorm, which, driving full in the
faces of the Canaanites, so blinded and benumbed them with cold, that
they could neither use their bows with effect nor even hold their
swords.

[Judges 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 5:21</span></span>

The word translated ancient occurs only here. The phrase probably means
that Kishon was celebrated from ancient times on account of the battles
fought on its banks.

[Judges 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 5:22</span></span>

Probably an allusion to the frantic efforts of the chariot-horses to
disengage themselves from the morass ([Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015) note.md).

Mighty ones - Applied to bulls [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md) and horses [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md); [Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md); [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md); elsewhere, as probably here, to
men.

[Judges 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 5:23</span></span>

The inhabitants of Meroz (a village 12 miles from Samaria) hung back,
and gave no help in the day of battle, although it was Yahweh who called
them. Hence, the curse pronounced by the Angel of the Lord.

[Judges 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 5:24</span></span>

The blessing here pronounced is in strong contrast with the curse of
Meroz. Deborah speaks of Jael's deed by the light of her own age, which
did not make manifest the evil of guile and bloodshed; the light in ours
does.

[Judges 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 5:25</span></span>

Butter - Rather curdled milk, probably a fermented and intoxicating
drink. All these marks of respect and friendship would lull Sisera into
security.

[Judges 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 5:26</span></span>

Rather "she smote his head, and she struck and pierced through his
temple."

[Judges 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 5:28</span></span>

The scene is changed to the palace of Sisera.

[Judges 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 5:30</span></span>

Render the latter part of the verse "a booty of dyed garments for
Sisera, a booty of dyed garments and of party-colored cloth, a dyed
garment and two party-colored clothes for the necks of the booty," the
spoil or booty being either captive damsels, or captive cattle on whose
necks these clothes are to be placed (either as ornament or as a burden;
compare [Jdg 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021.md), [Jdg
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026).md). But possibly "the necks of the
booty" may mean the backs or shoulders (of men or beasts) laden with
booty.

[Judges 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 5:31</span></span>

A most striking conclusion, in which the spiritual truth, which the
whole narrative is intended to convey, comes out. The enemies of the
Lord will perish like the host of Sisera, and all their hopes will end,
like those of Sisera's mother, in bitter disappointment and shame; but
all that love our Lord Jesus Christ shall shine forth as the sun in the
kingdom of their Father. Compare [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043.md); [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md).
