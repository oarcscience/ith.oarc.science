### [Job Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md)

[Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 41:1</span></span>

Canst thou draw out - As a fish is drawn out of the water. The usual
method by which fish were taken was with a hook; and the meaning here
is, that it was not possible to take the leviathan in this manner. The
whole description here is of an animal that lived in the water.

Leviathan - Much has been written respecting this animal, and the
opinions which have been entertained have been very various. Schultens
enumerates the following classes of opinions in regard to the animal
intended here.

1\. The opinion that the word leviathan is to be retained, without
attempting to explain it - implying that there was uncertainty as to the
meaning. Under this head he refers to the Chaldee and the Vulgate, to
Aquila and Symmacbus, where the word is retained, and to the Septuagint,
where the word Δράκοντα Drakonta, "dragon," is used, and also the Syriac
and Arabic, where the same word is used.

2\. The fable of the Jews, who mention a serpent so large that it
encompassed the whole earth. A belief of the existence of such a marine
serpent or monster still prevails among the Nestorians.

3\. The opinion that the whale is intended.

4\. The opinion that a large fish called "Mular," or "Musar," which is
found in the Mediterranean, is denoted. This is the opinion of Grotius.

5\. The opinion that the crocodile of the Nile is denoted.

6\. The opinion of Hasaeus, that not the whale is intended, but the
"Orca," a sea-monster armed with teeth, and the enemy of the whale.

7\. Others have understood the whole description as allegorical, as
representing monsters of iniquity; and among these, some have regarded
it as descriptive of the devil! See Schultens. To these may be added the
description of Milton:

\- That sea-beast

Leviathan, which God of all his works

Created hug'st that swim the ocean-stream,

Him, haply, slumb'ring on the Norway foam,

The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff

Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,

With fixed anchor in his scaly rind

Moors by his side under the lee, while night

Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.

Paradise Lost, B. i.

For a full investigation of the subject, Bochart may be consulted,
"Hieroz." P. ii. Lib. v. c. xvi - xviii. The conclusion to which he
comes is, that the crocodile of the Nile is denoted; and in this opinion
critics have generally, since his time, acquiesced. The opinions which
are entitled to most attention are those which regard the animal here
described as either the whale or the crocodile. The objections to the
supposition that the whale is intended are such as the following:

\(1\) That the whale tribes do not inhabit the Mediterranean, much less
the rivers which empty into it - with which alone it is supposed Job
could have been acquainted.

\(2\) That the animal here described differs from the whale in many
essential particulars. "This family of marine monsters have neither
proper snout nor nostrils, nor proper teeth. Instead of a snout, they
have a mere spiracle, or blowing-hole, with a double opening on the top
of the head; and for teeth, a hard expanse of horny laminae, which we
call whalebone, in the upper jaw. The eyes of the common whale,
moreover, instead of answering the description here given, are most
disproportionately small, and do not exceed in size those of the ox. Nor
can this monster be regarded as of fierce habits or unconquerable
courage; for instead of attacking the larger sea-animals for plunder it
feeds chiefly on crabs and medusas, and is often itself attacked by the
ork or grampus, though less than half its size." "Dr. Good." These
considerations seem to be decisive in regard to the supposition that the
animal here referred to is the whale. In fact, there is almost nothing
in the description that corresponds with the whale, except the size.

The whole account, on the contrary, agrees well with the crocodile; and
there are several considerations which may be suggested, before we
proceed with the exposition, which correspond I with the supposition
that this is the animal intended. They are such as these:

\(1\) The crocodile is a natural inhabitant of the Nile and of other
Asiatic and African rivers, and it is reasonable to suppose that an
animal is referred to that was well known to one who lived in the
country of Job. Though the Almighty is the speaker, and could describe
an animal wholly unknown to Job, yet it is not reasonable to suppose
that such an unknown animal would be selected. The appeal was to what he
knew of the works of God.

\(2\) The general description agrees with this animal. The leviathan is
represented as wild, fierce, and ungovernable; as of vast extent, and as
terrible in his aspect; as having a mouth of vast size, and armed with a
formidable array of teeth; as covered with scales set near together like
a coat of mail, as distinguished by the fierceness of his eyes, and by
the frightful aspect of his mouth; as endowed with great strength, and
incapable of being taken in any of the ordinary methods of securing wild
beasts. This general description agrees well with the crocodile. These
animals are found in the rivers of Africa, and also in the southern
rivers of America, and are usually called the alligator. In the Amazon,
the Niger, and the Nile, they occur in great numbers, and are usually
from eighteen to twenty-seven feet long; and sometimes lying as close to
each other as a raft of timber. "Goldsmith."

The crocodile grows to a great length, being sometimes found thirty feet
long from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail; though its most
usual length is about eighteen or twenty feet. "The armor, with which
the upper part of the body is covered, may be numbered among the most
elaborate pieces of Nature's mechanism. In the full-grown animal it is
so strong and thick as easily to repel a musket-ball. The whole animal
appears as if covered with the most regular and curious carved work. The
mouth is of vast width, the gape having a somewhat flexuous outline, and
both jaws being furnished with very numerous, sharp-pointed teeth. The
number of teeth in each jaw is thirty or more, and they are so disposed
as to alternate with each other when the mouth is closed. The legs are
short, but strong and muscular. In the glowing regions of Africa, where
it arrives at its full strength and power, it is justly regarded as the
most formidable inhabitant of the rivers." Shaw's "Zoology," vol. iii.
p. 184. The crocodile seldom, except pressed with hunger, or for the
purpose of depositing its eggs, leaves the water. Its usual method is to
float along the surface, and seize whatever animals come within its
reach; but when this method fails, it then goes nearer the bank. There
it waits, among the sedges, for any animal that may come down to drink,
and seizes upon it, and drags it into the water. The tiger is thus often
seized by the crocodile, and dragged into the river and drowned.

\(3\) A third reason for supposing that the crocodile is here intended,
arises from the former conclusion concerning the "behemoth," [Job
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md), following. The description of
the leviathan immediately follows that, and the presumption is that they
were animals that were usually found inhabiting the same district of
country. If, therefore, the behemoth be the hippopotamus, there is a
presumption that the leviathan is the crocodile - an inhabitant of the
same river, equally amphibious, and even more terrible. "And this
consideration," says the Editor of the Pictorial Bible, "is
strengthened, when we consider that the two animals were so associated
by the ancients. Some of the paintings at Herculaneum represent Egyptian
landscapes, in which we see the crocodile lying among the reeds, and the
hippopotamus browsing upon the plants on an island. So also in the
famous Mosaic pavement at Praeneste, representing the plants and animals
of Egypt and Ethiopia, the river-horse and the crocodile are associated
in the same group, in the river Nile." The crocodile was formerly found
in abundance in Lower Egypt and the Delta, but it now limits the extent
of its visits northward to the districts about Manfaloot, and the
hippopotamus is no longer seen in Lower Ethiopia. Neither the
hippopotamus nor the crocodile appear to have been eaten by the ancient
Egyptians. Pliny mentions the medicinal properties of both of them
(xxviii. 8). and Plutarch affirms that the people of Apollinopolis used
to eat the crocodile ("de Isid." s. 50); but this does not appear to
have been a usual custom.

Herodotus says that "some of the Egyptians consider the crocodile
sacred, while others make war upon it; and those who live about Thebes
and the lake Moeris (in the Arsinoite "nome"), hold it in great
veneration," ii. 69. In some cases the crocodile was treated with the
greatest respect, and kept up at considerable expense; it was fed and
attended with the most scrupulous care; geese, fish, and various meats
were dressed purposely for it; they ornamented its head with earrings
and its feet with bracelets and necklaces of gold and artificial stones;
it was rendered tame by kind treatment, and after death the body was
embalmed in a sumptuous manner. This was particularly the case in the
Theban, Ombite, and Arsinoite nomes, and at a place now called Maabdeh,
opposite the modern town of Manfaloot, are extensive grottoes cut far
into the limestone mountain, where numerous crocodile mummies have been
found, perfectly preserved and evidently embalmed with great care.

In other parts of Egypt, however, the animal was held in the greatest
abhorrence, and so they lost no opportunity of destroying it. See
Wilkinson's "Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," vol. iii.
pp. 75ff. The engraving opposite represents Egyptian crocodiles
("Crocodilus vulgaris") disporting themselves on the banks of the Nile,
or basking in the sun - one of their favorite practices. The figures
were drawn from living animals. The word here rendered "leviathan"
(לויתן livyâthân) occurs only in this place and in [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md); [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md); [Psa
104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md). In all these places it is
rendered leviathan, except in [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md), where it is rendered in the text,
"their mourning," in the margin, "leviathan;" see the notes at that
verse, and compare the notes at [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md). The connection of the word with
the root is not certainly known. Gesenius regards it as derived from לוה
lâvâh, to join oneself to anyone, and then to wreathe, to fold, to
curve; and in Arabic "to weave, to twist," as a wreath or garland; and
that the word is appiled to an animal that is "wreathed," or that
gathers itself "in folds" - a "twisted animal."

In [Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md), the word is used to
denote some huge, untamable, and fierce monster, and will agree there
with the supposition that the crocodile is intended; see the notes at
that place. In [Psa 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md). the
allusion is to Pharaoh, compared with the leviathan, and the passage
would agree best with the supposition that the allusion was to the
crocodile. The crocodile was an inhabitant of the Nile, and it was
natural to allude to that in describing a fierce tyrant of Egypt. In
[Psa 104:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#026.md), the allusion is to some
huge animal of the deep, particularly of the Mediterranean, and the
language would apply to any sea-monster. In [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md). the allusion is to the king and
tyrant that ruled in Babylon, as compared with a dragon or fierce
animal; compare the notes on that passage, and Rev. 12. Any of these
passages will accord well with the supposition that the crocodile is
denoted by the word, or that some fierce, strong, and violent animal
that could involve itself, or that had the appearance of an extended
serpent, is referred to. The resemblance between the animal here
described and the crocodile, will be further indicated by the notes at
the particular descriptions in the chapter.

With an hook - Implying that the animal here referred to was aquatic,
and that it could not be taken in the way in which fish were usually
caught. It is known now that the crocodile is occasionally taken with a
hook, but this is not the usual method, and there is no evidence that it
was practiced in the time of Job. Herodotus says that it was one of the
methods which were used in his time. "Among the various methods," says
he, "that are used to take the crocodile, I shall relate only one which
deserves most attention; they fix a hook (ἄγκιστρον agkistron) on a
piece of swine's flesh, and suffer it to float into the middle of the
stream. On the banks they have a live hog, which they beat until it
cries out. The crocodile, hearing the noise, makes toward it, and in the
way encounters and devours the bait. They thus draw it on shore, and the
first thing they do is to fill its eyes with clay; it is thus easily
manageable, which it otherwise would not be."

B. ii. 70. "The manner of taking it in Siam is by throwing three or four
strong nets across a river at proper distances from each other, so that
if the animal breaks through the first, it may be caught by one of the
rest. When it is first taken it employs the tail, which is the grand
instrument of its strength, with great force; but after many
unsuccessful struggles, the animal's strength is at length exhausted.
Then the natives approach their prisoner in boats, and pierce him with
their weapons in the most tender parts, until he is weakened with the
loss of blood." "Goldsmith." From ancient sculptures in Egypt, it
appears that the common method of attacking the crocodile was with a
spear, transfixing it as it passed beneath the boat in shallow water,
See Wilkinson's "Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," vol.
iii. pp. 75ff The most common method of taking the crocodile now is by
shooting it. "Pococke." it is quite clear, therefore, that, agreeably to
what is said in the passage before us, the common method of taking it
was not by a hook, and it is probable that in the time of Job this
method was not practiced.

Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down - Or rather, "Canst
thou sink his tongue with a cord?" - that is, Canst thou tame him by a
thong or bit thrust into his mouth? "Gesenius." The idea is that of
"pressing down" the tongue with a cord, so that he would be tractable.

[Job 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 41:2</span></span>

Canst thou put a hook into his nose - Or rather, a "rope," or "cord."
The word used here (אגמון 'agmôn) means "a caldron," or "kettle" [Job
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#020.md), also a reed, or bulrush,
growing in marshy places, and thus a rope made of reeds, a rush-cord.
The idea is, that he could not be led about by a cord, as tame animals
may be. Mr. Vansittart, however, supposes that the words here are
expressive of ornaments, and that the allusion is to the fact mentioned
by Herodotus, that the crocodile was led about by the Egyptians as a
divinity, and that in this state it was adorned with rings and various
stately trappings. There can be no doubt that such a fact existed, but
this does not accord well with the scope of the passage here. The object
is to impress the mind of Job with a sense of the strength and
untamableness of the animal, not to describe the honors which were paid
to it.

Or bore his jaw through with a thorn - Or with a ring. The word here
properly means a thorn, or thorn-bush, [Job
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#040.md); [Pro
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#009.md); and then also a ring that was
put through the nose of an animal, in order to secure it. The instrument
was probably made sharp like a thorn or spike, and then bent so as to
become a ring; compare [Isa 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029.md). Mr.
Bruce, speaking of the manner of fishing in the Nile, says that when a
fisherman has caught a fish, he draws it to the shore, and puts a strong
iron ring into its jaw. To this ring is fastened a rope by which the
fish is attached to the shore, which he then throws again into the
water. "Rosenmuller."

[Job 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 41:3</span></span>

Will he make many supplications unto thee? - In the manner of a captive
begging for his life. That is, will he quietly submit to you? Prof. Lee
supposes that there is an allusion here to the well-known cries of the
dolphin when taken; but it is not necessary to suppose such an allusion.
The idea is, that the animal here referred to would not tamely submit to
his captor.

Will he speak soft words unto thee? - Pleading for his life in tones of
tender and plaintive supplication.

[Job 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 41:4</span></span>

Will he make a covenant with thee? - That is, will he submit himself to
thee, and enter into a compact to serve thee? Such a compact was made by
those who agreed to serve another; and the idea here is, that the animal
here referred to could not be reduced to such service - that is, could
not be tamed.

Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? - Canst thou so subdue him
that he will be a perpetual slave? The meaning of all this is, that he
was an untamable animal, and could not be reduced, as many others could,
to domestic use.

[Job 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 41:5</span></span>

Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? - A bird that is tamed. The art
of taming birds was doubtless early practiced, and they were kept for
amusement. But the leviathan could not thus be tamed.

Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? - For their amusement. For such
purposes doubtless, birds were caught and caged. There is great force in
this question, on the supposition that the crocodile is intended.
Nothing could be more incongruous than the idea of securing so rough and
unsightly a monster for the amusement of tender and delicate females.

[Job 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 41:6</span></span>

Shall thy companions make a banquet of him? - This is one of the "vexed
passages" about which there has been much difference of opinion.
Gesenius renders it, "Do the companions ("i. e." the fishermen in
company) lay snares for him?" So Noyes renders it. Dr. Harris translates
it, "Shall thy partners spread a banquet for him?" The Septuagint
renders it, "Do the nations feed upon him?" The Vulgate, "Will friends
cut him up?" that is, for a banquet. Rosenmuller renders it, "Will
friends feast upon him?" The word rendered "thy companions" (חברים
chabbâriym) means properly those joined or associated together for any
purpose, whether for friendship or for business. It may refer here
either to those associated for the purpose of fishing or feasting. The
word "thy" is improperly introduced by our translators, and there is no
evidence that the reference is to the companions or friends of Job, as
that would seem to suppose. The word rendered "make a banquet" (יכרוּ
yikârû) is from כרה kârâh, "to dig," and then to make a plot or device
against one - derived from the fact that a "pitfall" was dug to take
animals ([Psa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md); [Psa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006.md); compare [Job
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#027).md); and according to this it means,
"Do the companions, "i. e." the fishermen in company, lay snares for
him?" The word, however, has another signification, meaning to buy, to
purchase, and also to give a feast, to make a banquet, perhaps from the
idea of "purchasing" the provisions necessary for a banquet. According
to this, the meaning is, "Do the companions, "i. e." those associated
for the purpose of feasting, make a banquet of him?" Which is the true
sense here it is not easy to determine. The majority of versions incline
to the idea that it refers to a feast, and means that those associated
for eating do not make a part of their entertainment of him. This
interpretation is the most simple and obvious.

Shall they part him among the merchants? - That is, Shall they cut him
up and expose him for sale? The word rendered "merchants" (כנענים
kena‛anı̂ym) means properly "Canaanites." It is used in the sense of
"merchants, or traffickers," because the Canaanites were commonly
engaged in this employment; see the notes at [Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md). The crocodile is never made a
part of a banquet, or an article of traffic.

[Job 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 41:7</span></span>

Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? - Referring to its thickness
and impenetrability. A common method of taking fish is by the spear; but
it is here said that the leviathan could not be caught in this manner.
The common method of taking the crocodile now is by shooting him; see
the notes at [Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md). Nothing is
more remarkable in the crocodile than the thick and impenetrable skin
with which it is covered; and the description here will agree better
with this animal than with any other.

Or his head with fish spears - The word here rendered "fish-spears"
(צלצל tselâtsal) means properly a "tinkling, clanging," as of metal or
arms, and then any tinkling instrument. Here it evidently refers to some
metal spear, or harpoon, and the name was given to the instrument on
account of its clanging noise. The Septuagint renders this strangely,
referring it to the "Phenicians," or merchants mentioned in the previous
verse - "With their whole fleet they could not carry the first skin of
his tail, nor his head in their fishing-barks."

[Job 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 41:8</span></span>

Lay thine hand upon him - Prof. Lee renders this, very improperly, as it
seems to me, "Lay thine hand on thy mouth respecting him," supposing it
means that he should be awed into silence by dread of the animal
referred to. But the meaning of the passage evidently is, "Endeavor to
seize him by laying the hand on him, and you will soon desist from the
fearful conflict, and will not renew it."

Remember the battle - Remember what a fearful conflict will ensue.
Perhaps there is an allusion to some fact fresh in the mind of Job,
where such an attempt had been made to secure the leviathan, attended
with fearful disaster to those who had made the attempt.

Do no more - Or, rather, "Thou wilt not do it again." That is, he would
be deterred from ever renewing the attempt, or the conflict would be
fatal to him.

[Job 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 41:9</span></span>

Behold, the hope of him is in vain - That is, the hope of taking him is
vain.

Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? - So formidable is
his appearance, that the courage of him who would attack him is daunted,
and his resolution fails. This agrees well also with the crocodile.
There is perhaps scarcely any animal whose appearance would be more
likely to deter one from attacking him.

[Job 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 41:10</span></span>

None is so fierce that dare stir him up - No one has courage to rouse
and provoke him.

Who then is able to stand before me? - The meaning of this is plain. It
is, "If one of my creatures is so formidable that man dare not attack
it, how can he contend with the great Creator? This may perhaps be
designed as a reproof of Job. He had expressed a desire to carry his
cause before God, and to urge argument before him in vindication of
himself. God here shows him how hopeless must be a contest with the
Almighty. Man trembles and is disarmed of his courage by even the sight
of one of the creatures of God. Overpowered with fear, he retires from
the contemplated contest, and flees away. How then could he presume to
contend with God? What hope could he have in a contest with him?

[Job 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 41:11</span></span>

Who hath prevented me? - As this verse is here rendered, its meaning,
and the reason why it is introduced, are not very apparent. It almost
looks, indeed, as if it were an interpolation, or had been introduced
from some other place, and torn from its proper connection. Dr. Harris
proposes to remove the principal difficulty by translating it,

"Who will stand before me, yea, presumptuously?

Whatsoever is beneath the whole heaven is mine.

I cannot be confounded at his limbs and violence,

Nor at his power, or the strength of his frame."

It may be doubted, however, whether the original will admit of this
translation. Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Noyes, unite in supposing the
meaning to be, "Who has done me a favor, that I must repay him?" But
perhaps the true idea of the passage may be arrived at by adverting to
the meaning of the word rendered "prevented" - קדם qâdam. It properly
means in the Piel, to go before; to precede; to anticipate, [Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md); [Psa
119:148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#148.md). Then it means to rush upon
suddenly; to seize; to go to meet anyone either for succor, [Psa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md), or for a different purpose.
[Isa 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033.md), "no shield shall come up
against her." יקדמנה yaqâdamenâh "i. e." against the city. So [Job
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027.md), "The days of affliction
prevented me." A similar meaning occurs in the Hiphil form in [Amo
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010.md), "The evil shall not overtake us
nor prevent us;" that is, shall not rush upon us as if by anticipation,
or when we are off our guard.

If some idea of this kind be supposed to be conveyed by the word here,
it will probably express the true sense. "Who is able to seize upon me
suddenly, or when I am off my guard; to anticipate my watchfulness and
my power of resistance so as to compel me to recompense him, or so to
overmaster me as to lay me under obligation to confer on him the favors
which he demands?" There may be an allusion to the manner in which wild
beasts are taken, when the hunter springs his gin suddenly, anticipates
the power of the animal, rushes unexpectedly upon him, and compels him
to yield. God says that no one could thus surprise and overpower him.
Thus explained, the sentiment agrees with the argument which the
Almighty is presenting. He is showing his right to reign and do all his
pleasure. He appeals, in proof of this, to his great and mighty works,
and especially to those specimens of the animal creation which "man"
could not tame or overcome. The argument is this: "If man cannot
surprise and subdue these creatures of the Almighty, and compel "them"
to render him service, how can he expect to constrain the Creator
himself to be tributary to him, or to grant him the favors which he
demands?"

Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine - That is, "All belong to
me; all are subject to me; all are mine, to be conferred on whom I
please. No one can claim them as his own: no one can wrest them from
me." This claim to the proprietorship of all created things, is designed
"here" to show to Job that over a Being thus supreme man could exert no
control. It is his duty, therefore, to submit to him without a
complaint, and to receive with gratitude what he chooses to confer.

[Job 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 41:12</span></span>

I will not conceal his parts - This is the commencement of a more
particular description of the animal than had been before given. In the
previous part of the chapter, the remarks are general, speaking of it
merely as one of great power, and not to be taken by any of the ordinary
methods. A description follows of the various parts of the animal, all
tending to confirm this general impression, and to fill the hearer with
a deep conviction of his formidable character. The words rendered, "I
will not conceal," mean, "I will not be silent;" that is, he would speak
of them. The description which follows of the "parts" of the animal
refers particularly to his mouth, his teeth, his scales, his eyelids,
his nostrils, his neck, and his heart.

Nor his comely proportion - The crocodile is not an object of beauty,
and the animal described here is not spoken of as one of beauty, but as
one of great power and fierceness. The phrase used here (ערכוּ חין chı̂yn
‛êrekô) means properly "the grace of his armature," or the beauty of his
armor. It does not refer to the beauty of the animal as such, but to the
armor or defense which it had. Though there might be no beauty in an
animal like the one here described, yet there might be a "grace" or
fitness in its means of defense which could not fail to attract
admiration. This is the idea in the passage. So Gesenius, Umbreit, and
Noyes render it.

[Job 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 41:13</span></span>

Who can discern the face of his garment? - literally, "Who can reveal
the face, that is, the appearance, of his garment?" This "garment" is
undoubtedly his skin. The meaning seems to be, "His hard and rough skin
is his defense, and no one can so strip off that as to have access to
him." The word rendered "discover" (גלה gâlâh) means "to make naked";
then "to reveal"; and the idea is, that he cannot be made naked of that
covering, or deprived of it so that one could attack him.

Or who can come to him with his double bridle? - Margin, "within"
Gesenius renders this, "The doubling of his jaws;" that is. his double
row of teeth. Umbreit, "His double bit." Noyes, "Who will approach his
jaws?" So Rosenmuller. Schultens and Prof. Lee, however, suppose it
means that no one can come near to him and "double the bit" upon him,
"i. e." cast the bit or noose over his nose, so as to secure him by
doubling it, or passing it around him. The former seems to me to be the
true meaning. "Into the doubling of his jaws, who can enter?" That is,
Who will dare approach a double row of teeth so formidable?" The word
rendered "bridle" (רסן resen) means properly a curb or halter, which
goes over a horse's nose, and hence, a bit or bridle. But it may be used
to denote the interior of the mouth, the jaws, where the bit is placed,
and then the phrase denotes the double row of teeth of the animal. Thus,
the description of the "parts of defense" of the animal is kept up.

[Job 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 41:14</span></span>

Who can open the doors of his face? - His mouth. The same term is sti 1
used to denote the mouth - from its resemblance to a door. The idea is,
that no one would dare to force open his mouth. This agrees better with
the crocodile than almost any other animal. It would not apply to the
whale. The crocodile is armed with a more formidable set of teeth than
almost any other animal; see the description in the notes at [Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md). Bochart says that it has sixty
teeth, and those much larger than in proportion to the size of the body.
Some of them, he says, stand out; some of them are serrated, or like a
saw, fitting into each other when the mouth is closed; and some come
together in the manner of a comb, so that the grasp of the animal is
very tenacious and fearful; see a full description in Bochart.

[Job 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 41:15</span></span>

His scales are his pride - Margin, "strong pieces of shields." The
literal translation of this would be, "Pride, the strong of shields;"
that is, the strong shields. There can be no doubt that there is
reference to the scales of the animal, as having a resemblance to strong
shields laid close to each other. But there is considerable variety of
opinion as to its meaning. Umbreit and Prof. Lee take the word here
rendered "pride" (גאוה gê'voh) to be the same as (גוה gêvâh), "back,"
and then the meaning would be that his back was armed as with a shield -
referring, as Prof. Lee supposes, to the dorsal fin of the whale. But
there is no necessity for this supposition, and it cannot be denied that
it is somewhat forced. The "connection" requires that we should
understand it, not of the dorsal fin, but of the scales; for a
description immediately follows in continuation of this, which will by
no means apply to the fin. The obvious and proper meaning is, that the
pride or glory of the animal - that on which his safety depended, and
which was the most remarkable thing about him - was his "scales," which
were laid together like firm and compact shields, so that nothing could
penetrate them. This description accords better with the crocodile than
with any other animal. It is covered with scales, "which are so hard as
to resist a musket-ball." "Ed. Ency." The description cannot be applied
to a whale, which has no scales; and accordingly Prof. Lee supposes that
the reference in this verse and the two following is not to the
"scales," but to the "teeth," and to "the setting in of the dorsal fin!"

Shut up together - Made close or compact.

As with a close seal - As if they had been sealed with wax, so that no
air could come between them.

[Job 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 41:17</span></span>

They are joined one to another - literally, "A man with his brother;"
that is, each one is connected with another. There is no natural
fastening of one scale with another, but they lie so close and compact
that they seem thus to be fastened down on one another; see Bochart on
this verse. It is this which makes the crocodile so difficult to be
killed. A musket-ball will penetrate the skin under the belly, which is
there less firmly protected; and accordingly the efforts of those who
attempt to secure them are directed to that part of the body. A ball in
the eye or throat will also destroy it, but the body is impervious to a
spear or a bullet.

[Job 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 41:18</span></span>

By his neesings a light doth shine - The word rendered "neesings" means
properly sneezing, and the literal sense here would be, "His sneezings,
light shines." Coverdale renders it, "His nesinge is like a glisteringe
fyre." Bochart says that the meaning is, "that when the crocodile
sneezes, the breath is driven through the nostrils with such force that
it seems to scintillate, or emit fire." Probably the meaning is, that
when the animal emits a sudden sound, like sneezing, the fire seems to
flash from the eye. There is some quick and rapid motion of the eyes,
which in the rays of the sun seem to flash fire. The sneezing of the
crocodile is mentioned by Aristotle. Prof. Lee. Amphibious animals, the
longer they hold their breath under water, respire so much the more
violently when they emerge, and the breath is expelled suddenly and with
violence. Schultens. This is the action here referred to - the strong
effort of the animal to recover breath when he rises to the surface, and
when in the effort the eyes seem to scintillate, or emit light.

And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning - The "eyelids of the
morning" is a beautiful poetic phrase quite common in Hebrew poetry. The
eyes of the crocodile are small, but they are remarkable. When he lifts
his head above water, his staring eyes are the first things that strike
the beholder, and may then with great beauty be compared with the
morning light. There is a remarkable coincidence here, in the fact that
when the Egyptians would represent the morning by a hieroglyphic, they
painted a crocodile's eye. The reason assigned for this was, that before
the whole body of the animal appeared, the eyes seemed to rise from the
deep; see Bochart on the passage, "Hierez.," and also Herapollo,
"Hieroglyph." i. c. 65.

[Job 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 41:19</span></span>

Out of his mouth go burning lamps - The word "lamps" here is probably
used to denote torches, or fire-brands. The animal is here described as
in pursuit of his prey on land; and the description is exceedingly
graphic and powerful. His mouth is then open; his jaws are distended;
his breath is thrown out with great violence; his blood is inflamed, and
the animal seems to vomit forth flames. The description is of course to
be regarded as figurative. It is such as one would be likely to give who
should see a fierce animal pressing on in pursuit of its prey.

And sparks of fire leap out - There is an appearance like sparks of
fire. The animal, with an open throat highly inflamed, seems to breathe
forth flames. The figure is a common one applied to a war-horse. Thus,
Ovid:

"From their full racks the generous steeds retire,

Dropping ambrosial foam and snorting fire."

Dr. Good

The same thing is remarked by Achilles Tatius, of the hippopotamus,
"With open nostrils, and breathing smoke like fire (πυρώδη καπνόν purōdē
kapnon) as from a fountain of fire." And in Eustathius it is said, "They
have an open nostril, breathing forth smoke like fire from a furnace " -
πυρώδη καπνόν, ὠς ἐκ καμίνου πνέοντα purōdē kapnon, hōs ek kaminou
pneonta. See Bochart.

Out of his nostrils goeth smoke - See the quotations on [Job
41:19](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#019.md). This appearance of the
crocodile, or alligator, has been often noticed. Bertram, in his
"Travels in North and South Carolina," p. 116, says, "While I was
seeking a place of rest, I encountered an alligator that in the
neighboring lake rushed through the canes that grew on its banks. He
inflated his enormous body, and swung his tail high in the air. A thick
smoke streamed from his wide-open nostrils, with a sound that made the
earth tremble." Rosenmuller, "Alte u. neue Morgenland," No. 778.

As out of a seething-pot - A pot that is boiling. Literally, "a blown
pot;" that is, a pot under which the fire is blown, or kindled.

Or caldron - Any kettle. The same word is used to denote a reed or
bulrush, or a rope made of reeds, [Isa
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md); [Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 41:21</span></span>

His breath kindleth coals - It seems to be a flame, and to set on fire
all around it. So Hesiod, "Theog." i. 319, describing the creation of
the Chimera, speaks of it as

πνέουσαν ἀμαισάκετον πῦρ

pneousan amaimaketon pur.

"Breathing unquenchable fire," So Virgil, "Georg." ii. 140:

Haec loca non tauri spirantes naribus ignem Invertere.

"Bulls breathing fire these furrows ne'er have known."

Warton

A similar phrase is found in a sublime description of the anger of the
Almighty, in [Psa 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md) :

There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,

And fire out of his mouth devoured:

Coals were kindled by it.

[Job 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 41:22</span></span>

In his neck remaineth strength - That is, strength is "permanently
residing" there. It is not assumed for the moment, but his neck is so
constructed as to be the abode of strength. The word here rendered
"remaineth" (ילין yālı̂yn), means properly to pass the night; then to
abide or dwell; and there is a designed contrast here with what is said
of "sorrow" in this verse. This description of strength residing in the
neck, agrees well with the crocodile; see the figure of the animal on p.
255. It is not easy, however, to see how this is applicable to the
whale, as Prof. Lee supposes. The whale is endowed, indeed, with great
strength, as Prof. Lee has shown, but that strength is manifested mainly
by the stroke of the tail.

And sorrow is turned into joy before him - Margin, "rejoiceth." The
proper meaning of the word used here (תדוץ tādûts) is "to dance, to
leap, to skip;" and the sense is, that "terror dances before him." It
does not refer to the motion of the animal, as if he were brisk and
rapid. but it is a poetic expression, as if terror played or pranced
along wherever he came. Strength "resided" in his neck, but his approach
made terror and alarm play before him wherever he went; that is,
produced terror and dread. In his neck is permanent, calm strength;
before him, everything trembles and is agitated. The beauty of the
passage lies in this contrast between the strength and firmness which
repose calmly in the neck of the animal, and the consternation which he
everywhere produces, causing all to tremble as he approaches. Bochart
has well illustrated this from the Classical writers.

[Job 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 41:23</span></span>

The flakes of his flesh are joined together - Margin, "fallings." The
Hebrew word used here means anything "falling," or "pendulous," and the
reference here is, probably, to the pendulous parts of the flesh of the
animal; the flabby parts; the dew-laps. In animals commonly these parts
about the neck and belly are soft, pendulous, and contribute little to
their strength. The meaning here is, that in the leviathan, instead of
being thus flabby and pendulous, they were compact and firm. This is
strikingly true of the crocodile. The belly is, indeed, more soft and
penetrable than the other parts of the body, but there is nothing like
the soft and pendulous dew-laps of most animals.

[Job 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 41:24</span></span>

His heart is as firm as a stone - As hard; as solid. Bochart remarks
that the word "heart" here is not to be regarded as denoting the
"courage" of the animal, as it sometimes does, but the heart literally.
The statement occurs in the description of the various parts of the
animal, and the object is to show that there was special firmness or
solidity in every one of his members. There is special firmness or
strength needed in the "hearts" of all animals, to enable them to propel
the blood through the arteries of the body; and in an animal of the size
of the crocodile, it is easy to see that the heart must be made capable
of exerting vast force. But there is no reason to suppose that the
affirmation here is made on the supposition that there is need of
extraordinary strength in the heart to propel the blood. The doctrine of
the circulation of the blood was not then known to mankind, and it is to
be presumed that the argument here would be based on what "was" known,
or what might be easily observed. The presumption therefore is, that the
statement here is based on what had been "seen" of the remarkable
compactness and firmness of the heart of the animal here referred to.
Probably there was nothing so unique in the heart of the crocodile that
this description would be applicable to that animal alone, but it is
such doubtless as would apply to the heart of any animal of
extraordinary size and strength.

Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone - The mills commonly
used in ancient times were hand-mills; see a description of them in the
notes at [Mat 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041.md). Why the lower
stone was the hardest, is not quite apparent. Perhaps a more solid stone
might have been chosen for this, because it was supposed that there was
more wear on the lower than the upper stone, or because its weight would
make the machine more solid and steady.

When he raiseth up himself - When he rouses himself for an attack or in
self-defense.

The mighty are afraid - The Vulgate renders this "anqels." The meaning
is, that he produces alarm on those who are unaccustomed to fear.

By reason of breakings they purify themselves - This, though a literal
translation, conveys no very clear idea, and this rendering is not
necessary. The word rendered "breakings" (שׁבר sheber) means properly "a
breaking, breach, puncture"; "a breaking down, destruction"; and then it
may mean "a breaking down of the mind, that is, terror." This is
evidently the meaning here. "By reason of the prostration of their
courage, or the crushing of the mind by alarm." The word rendered
"purify themselves" (חטא châṭâ') means in the Qal, "to miss," as a mark;
"to sin; to err." In the form of Hithpael, which occurs here, it means
to miss one's way; "to lose oneself;" and it may refer to the
astonishment and terror by which one is led to miss his way in
precipitate flight. "Gesenius." The meaning then is, "They lose
themselves from terror." They know not where to turn themselves; they
flee away with alarm; see Rosenmuller in loc.

The sword of him that layeth at him - The word "sword" here (חרב chereb)
means undoubtedly "harpoon," or a sharp instrument by which an attempt
is made to pierce the skin of the monster.

Cannot hold - That is, in the hard skin. It does not penetrate it.

The spear, the dart - These were doubtless often used in the attempt to
take the animal. The meaning is, that "they" would not hold or stick to
the animal. They flew off when hurled at him.

Nor the habergeon - Margin, "breastplate." Noyes, "javelin." Prof. Lee,
"lance." Vulgate, "thorax, breastplate." So the Septuagint, θώρακα
thōraka. The word used here (שׁריה shiryâh), the same as שׁריון shiryôn
[Sa1 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md), [Sa1
17:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#038.md); [Neh
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md); [Ch2
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#014.md), means properly a "coat of
mail," and is so called from its shining - from שׁרה shârâh, "to shine."
It is not used in the sense of spear or javelin elsewhere, though
perhaps it may have that meaning here - denoting a "bright" or "shining"
weapon. This agrees best with the connection.

He esteemeth iron as straw - He regards instruments made of iron and
brass as if they were straw or rotten wood. That is, they make no
impression on him. This will agree better with the crocodile than any
other animal. So hard is his skin, that a musket-ball will not penetrate
it; see numerous quotations proving the hardness of the skin of the
crooodile, in Bochart.

The arrow - Hebrew "the son of the bow." So [Lam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#013.md), margin. This use of the word son
is common in the Scriptures and in all Oriental poetry.

Sling-stones - The sling was early used in war and in hunting, and by
skill and practice it could be so employed as to be a formidable weapon;
see [Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md); [Sa1
17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md), [Sa1
17:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#049.md). As one of the weapons of attack
on a foe it is mentioned here, though there is no evidence that the
sling was ever actually used in endeavoring to destroy the crocodile.
The meaning is, that all the common weapons used by men in attacking an
enemy had no effect on him.

Are turned with him into stubble - Produce no more effect on him than it
would to throw stubble at him.

Darts are counted as stubble - The word rendered "darts" (תותח tôthâch)
occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It is from יתח, obsolete root,
"to beat with a club." The word here probably means clubs. Darts and
spears are mentioned before, and the object seems to be to enumerate all
the usual, instruments of attack. The singular is used here with a
plural verb in a collective sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 41:30</span></span>

Sharp stones are under him - Margin, as in Hebrew, "pieces of pot
sherd." The Hebrew word (חדוד chaddûd), means "sharp, pointed"; and the
phrase used here means "the sharp points of a potsherd," or broken
pieces of earthenware. The reference is, undoubtedly, to the scales of
the animal, which were rough and pointed, like the broken pieces of
earthenware. This description would not agree with the whale, and indeed
will accord with no other animal so well as with the crocodile. The
meaning is, that the under parts of his body, with which he rests upon
the mire, are made up of sharp, pointed things, like broken pottery.

He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire - That is, when he rests
or stretches himself on the mud or slime of the bank of the river. The
word used here and rendered "sharp pointed things" (חרוץ chârûts) means
properly something "cut in;" then something sharpened or pointed; and is
used to denote "a threshing sledge;" see this instrument described in
[Isa 28:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md), note; [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015.md), note. It is not certain,
however, that there is any allusion here to that instrument. It is
rather to anything that is rough or pointed, and refers to the lower
part of the animal as having this character. The Vulgate renders this,
"Beneath him are the rays of the sun, and he reposeth on gold as on
clay." Dr. Harris, Dr. Good, and Prof. Lee, suppose it refers to what
the animal lies on, meaning that he lies on splinters of rock and broken
stone with as much readiness and ease as if it were clay. But the above
seems to me to be the true interpretation. It is that of Gesenius,
Rosenmuller, and Umbreit. Grotius understands it as meaning that the
weapons thrown at him lie around him like broken pieces of pottery.

He maketh the deep to boil like a pot - In his rapid motion through it.
The word "deep" (מצולה metsôlâh) may refer to any deep place - either of
the sea, of a river, or of mire, [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md). It is applied to the depths of
the sea, [Jon 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#003.md); [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md); but there is nothing in the word
that will prevent its application to a large river like the Nile - the
usual abode of the crocodile.

He maketh the sea - The word "sea" (ים yâm) is often applied to a large
river, like the Nile or the Euphrates; see the notes at [Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md).

Like a pot of ointment - When it is mixed, or stirred together. Bochart
supposes that there is an allusion here to the smell of musk, which it
is said the crocodile has, and by which the waters through which he
passes seem to be perfumed. But the allusion seems rather to be merely
to the fact that the deep is agitated by him when he passes through it,
as if it were stirred from the bottom like a pot of ointment.

[Job 41:32](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 41:32</span></span>

He maketh a path to shine after him - This refers doubtless to the white
foam of the waters through which he passes. If this were spoken of some
monster that commonly resides in the ocean, it would not be unnatural to
suppose that it refers to the phosphoric light such as is observed when
the waters are agitated, or when a vessel passes rapidly through them.
If it refers, however, to the crocodile, the allusion must be understood
of the hoary appearance of the Nile or the lake where he is found.

One would think the deep to be hoary - Homer often speaks of the sea as
πολιὴν θάλασσαν poliēn thalassan - "the hoary sea." So Apollonius,
speaking of the Argonauts, Lib. i. 545:

\- μακραὶ δ ̓ αἰὲν ἐλευκαίνοντο κέλευθοι -

\- makrai d' aien eleukainonto keleuthoi -

"The long paths were always white"

So Catullus, in Epith. Pelei:

Totaque remigio spumis incanuit unda.

And Ovid, Epis. Oeno:

\- remis eruta canet aqua.

The rapid motion of an aquatic animal through the water will produce the
effect here referred to.

Upon earth there is not his like - Hebrew, "Upon the dust." The meaning
is, that no other animal can be compared with him; or the land does not
produce such a monster as this. For size, strength, ferocity, courage,
and formidableness, no animal will hear a comparison with him. This can
be true only of some such fierce creature as the crocodile.

Who is made without fear - Margin, "Or, behave themselves with fear."
The meaning is, that he is created not to be afraid; he has no dread of
others In this respect he is unlike other animals. The Septuagint
renders this, "He is made to be sported with by my angels."

He beholdeth all high things - That is, he looks down on everything as
inferior to him.

He is a king over all the children of pride - Referring, by "the
children of pride," to the animals that are bold, proud, courageous - as
the lion, the panther, etc. The lion is often spoken of as "the king of
the forest," or "the king of beasts," and in a similar sense the
leviathan is here spoken of as at the head of the animal creation. He is
afraid of none of them; he is subdued by none of them; he is the prey of
none of them. The whole argument, therefore, closes with this statement,
that he is at the head of the animal creation; and it was by this
magnificent description of the power of the creatures which God had
made, that it was intended to impress the mind of Job with a sense of
the majesty and power of the Creator. It had the effect. He was overawed
with a conviction of the greatness of God, and he saw how wrong it had
been for him to presume to call in question the justice, or sit in
judgment on the doings, of such a Being. God did not, indeed, go into an
examination of the various points which had been the subject of
controversy; he did not explain the nature of his moral administration
so as to relieve the mind from perplexity; but he evidently meant to
leave the impression that he was vast and incomprehensible in his
government, infinite in power, and had a right to dispose of his
creation as he pleased. No one can doubt that God could with infinite
ease have so explained the nature of his administration as to free the
mind from perplexity, and so as to have resolved the difficulties which
hung over the various subjects which had come into debate between Job
and his friends. "Why" he did not do this, is nowhere stated, and can
only be the subject of conjecture. It is possible, however, that the
following suggestions may do something to show the reasons why this was
not done:

\(1\) We are to remember the early period of the world when these
transactions occurred, and when this book was composed. It was in the
infancy of society, and when little light had gleamed on the human mind
in regard to questions of morals and religion.

\(2\) In that state of things, it is not probable that either Job or his
friends would have been able to comprehend the principles in accordance
with which the wicked are permitted to flourish and the righteous are so
much afflicted, if they had been stated. Much higher knowledge than they
then possessed about the future world was necessary to understand the
subject which then agitated their minds. It could not have been done
without a very decided reference to the future state, where all these
inequalities are to be removed.

\(3\) It has been the general plan of God to communicate knowledge by
degrees; to impart it when people have had full demonstration of their
own imbecility, and when they feel their need of divine teaching; and to
reserve the great truths of religion for an advanced period of the
world. In accordance with this arrangement, God bas been pleased to keep
in reserve, from age to age, certain great and momentous truths, and
such as were particularly adapted to throw light on the subjects of
discussion between Job and his friends. They are the truths pertaining
to the resurrection of the body; the retributions of the day of
judgment; the glories of heaven and the woes of hell, where all the
inequalities of the present state may receive their final and equal
adjustment. These great truths were reserved for the triumph and glory
of Christianity; and to have stated them in the time of Job, would have
been to have anticipated the most important revelations of that system.
The truths of which we are now in possession would have relieved much of
the perplexity then felt, and solved most of those questions; but the
world was not then in the proper state for their revelation.

\(4\) It was a very important lesson to be taught to people, to bow with
submission to a sovereign God, without knowing the reason of his doings.
No lesson, perhaps, could be learned of higher value than this. To a
proud, self-confident, philosophic mind, a mind prone to rely on its own
resources, and trust to its own deductions, it was of the highest
importance to inculcate the duty of submission to "will" and to
"sovereignty." This is a lesson which we often have to learn in life,
and which almost all the trying dispensations of Providence are fitted
to teach us. It is not because God has no reason for what he does; it is
not because he intends we shall never know the reason; but it is because
it is our "duty" to bow with submission to his will, and to acquiesce in
his right to reign, even when we cannot see the reason of his doings.
Could we "reason it out," and then submit "because" we saw the reason,
our submission would not be to our Maker's pleasure, but to the
deductions of our own minds.

Hence, all along, he so deals with man, by concealing the reason of his
doings, as to bring him to submission to his authority, and to humble
all human pride. To this termination all the reasonings of the Almighty
in this book are conducted; and after the exhibition of his power in the
tempest, after his sublime description of his own works, after his
appeal to the numerous things which are in fact incomprehensible by man,
we feel that God is great - that it is presumptuous in man to sit in
judgment on his works - and that the mind, no matter what he does,
should bow before him with profound veneration and silence. These are
the great lessons which we are every day called to learn in the actual
dispensations of his providence; and the "arguments" for these lessons
were never elsewhere stated with so much power and sublimity as in the
closing chapters of the book of Job. We have the light of the Christian
religion; we can look into eternity, and see how the inequalities of the
present order of things can be adjusted there; and we have sources of
consolation which neither Job nor his friends enjoyed; but still, with
all this light, there are numerous cases where we are required to bow,
not because we see the reason of the divine dealings, but because such
is the will of God. To us, in such circumstances, this argument of the
Almighty is adapted to teach the most salutary lessons.
