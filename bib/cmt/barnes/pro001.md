### [Proverbs Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

[Proverbs 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 1:1</span></span>

The long exhortation Proverbs 1-9, characterized by the frequent
recurrence of the words "my son," is of the nature of a preface to the
collection of the "Proverbs of Solomon" [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001). On [Pro
1:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001), see the introduction to
Proverbs.

[Proverbs 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 1:2</span></span>

The writer's purpose is to educate. He is writing what might be called
an ethical handbook for the young, though not for the young only. Of all
books in the Old Testament, this is the one which we may think of as
most distinctively educational. A comparison of it with a similar
manual, the "sayings of the fathers," in the Mishna, would help the
student to measure the difference between Scriptural and rabbinical
teaching.

Wisdom - The power by which human personality reaches its highest
spiritual perfection, by which all lower elements are brought into
harmony with the highest, is presently personified as life-giving and
creative. Compare the notes of [Job
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023), etc.

Instruction - i. e., discipline or training, the practical complement of
the more speculative wisdom.

Understanding - The power of distinguishing right from wrong, truth from
its counterfeit. The three words σοφία sophia, παιδεία paideia, φρόνησις
phronēsis (Septuagint), express very happily the relation of the words
in the Hebrew.

[Proverbs 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 1:3</span></span>

Wisdom - Not the same word as in [Pro
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002); better, perhaps, thoughtfulness.

Justice - Rather, righteousness. The word in the Hebrew includes the
ideas of truth and beneficence as well as "justice."

Judgment - The teaching of the Proverbs is to lead us to pass a right
sentence upon human actions, whether our own or another's.

Equity - In the Hebrew (see the margin) the plural is used, and
expresses the many varying forms and phases of the one pervading
principle.

[Proverbs 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 1:4</span></span>

This verse points out the two classes for which the book will be useful:

\(1\) the "simple," literally the "open," the open-hearted, the minds
ready to receive impressions for good or evil [Pro
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022); and

\(2\) the "young," who need both knowledge and discipline.

To these the teacher offers the "subtilty," which may turn to evil [Exo
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014) and become as the wisdom of the
serpent [Gen 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001), but which also takes
its place, as that wisdom does, among the highest moral gifts [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016); the "knowledge" of good and
evil; and the "discretion," or discernment, which sets a man on his
guard, and keeps him from being duped by false advisers. The Septuagint
renderings, πανουργία panourgia for "subtilty," αἴσθησις aisthēsis for
"knowledge," ἔννοια ennoia for "discretion," are interesting as showing
the endeavor to find exact parallels for the Hebrew in the terminology
of Greek ethics.

[Proverbs 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 1:5</span></span>

But it is not for the young only that he writes. The "man of
understanding" may gain "wise counsels," literally, the power to "steer"
his course rightly on the dangerous seas of life. This "steersmanship,"
it may be noted, is a word almost unique to Proverbs (compare "counsel"
in [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014); [Pro
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005); [Pro
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006)).

[Proverbs 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 1:6</span></span>

The book has yet a further scope; these proverbs are to form a habit of
mind. To gain through them the power of entering into the deeper meaning
of other proverbs, is the end kept in view. Compare Matt. 13.

The rendering "interpretation" spoils the parallelism of the two
clauses, and fails to express the Hebrew. In [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006), it is rendered "taunting
proverb." Here "riddle" or "enigma" would better express the meaning.

[Proverbs 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 1:7</span></span>

The beginning of wisdom is found in the temper of reverence and awe. The
fear of the finite in the presence of the Infinite, of the sinful in the
presence of the Holy (compare [Job
42:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005)), this for the Israelite was
the starting-point of all true wisdom. In the Book of [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028) it appears as an oracle
accompanied by the noblest poetry. In [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010) it comes as the choral close of
a temple hymn. Here it is the watchword of a true ethical education.
This fear has no torment, and is compatible with child-like love. But
this and not love is the "beginning of wisdom." Through successive
stages and by the discipline of life, love blends with it and makes it
perfect.

[Proverbs 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 1:9</span></span>

To the Israelite's mind no signs or badges of joy or glory were higher
in worth than the garland around the head, the gold chain around the
neck, worn by kings and the favorites of kings [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042); [Dan
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029).

[Proverbs 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 1:10</span></span>

The first great danger which besets the simple and the young is that of
evil companionship. The only safety is to be found in the power of
saying "No," to all such invitations.

[Proverbs 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 1:11</span></span>

The temptation against which the teacher seeks to guard his disciple is
that of joining a band of highway robbers. The "vain men" who gathered
around Jephthah [Jdg 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003), the lawless
or discontented who came to David in Adullam [Sa1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002), the bands of robbers who
infested every part of the country in the period of the New Testament,
and against whom every Roman governor had to wage incessant war, show
how deeply rooted the evil was in Palestine. Compare the [Psa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007), note; [Psa
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010) note.

Without cause - Better, in vain; most modern commentators join the words
with "innocent," and interpret them after [Job
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009). The evil-doers deride their
victims as being righteous "in vain." They get nothing by it. It does
them no good.

[Proverbs 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 1:12</span></span>

i\. e., "We will be as all-devouring as Sheol. The destruction of those
we attack shall be as sudden as that of those who go down quickly into
the pit." Some render the latter clause, and upright men as those that
go down to the pit. "Pit" here is a synonym for Sheol, the great
cavernous depth, the shadow-world of the dead.

[Proverbs 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 1:13</span></span>

The second form of temptation (see [Pro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010) note) appeals to the main
attraction of the robber-life, its wild communism, the sense of equal
hazards and equal hopes.

[Proverbs 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 1:17</span></span>

Strictly speaking, this is the first proverb (i. e., similitude) in the
book; a proverb which has received a variety of interpretations. The
true meaning seems to be as follows: "For in vain, to no purpose, is the
net spread out openly. Clear as the warning is, it is in vain. The birds
still fly in. The great net of God's judgments is spread out, open to
the eyes of all, and yet the doers of evil, willfully blind, still rush
into it." Others take the words as pointing to the failure of the plans
of the evil-doers against the innocent (the "bird"): others, again,
interpret the proverb of the young man who thinks that he at least shall
not fall into the snares laid for him, and so goes blindly into them.

[Proverbs 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 1:19</span></span>

Not robbery only, but all forms of covetousness are destructive of true
life.

[Proverbs 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 1:20</span></span>

Wisdom is personified. In the Hebrew the noun is a feminine plural, as
though this Wisdom were the queen of all wisdoms, uniting in herself all
their excellences. She lifts up her voice, not in solitude, but in the
haunts of men "without," i. e., outside the walls, in the streets, at
the highest point of all places of concourse, in the open space of the
gates where the elders meet and the king sits in judgment, in the heart
of the city itself [Pro 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#021); through
sages, lawgivers, teachers, and yet more through life and its
experiences, she preaches to mankind. Socrates said that the fields and
the trees taught him nothing, but that he found the wisdom he was
seeking in his converse with the men whom he met as he walked in the
streets and agora of Athens.

[Proverbs 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 1:22</span></span>

Compare the [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001) note.

\(1\) The "simple," literally, "open," i. e. fatally open to evil;

\(2\) the "scorners," mocking at all good;

\(3\) lastly, the "fools" in the sense of being hardened, obstinate,
perverse, hating the knowledge they have rejected.

[Proverbs 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 1:23</span></span>

The teaching of Divine Wisdom is essentially the same as that of the
Divine Word [Joh 7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038). "Turning,"
repentance and conversion, this is what she calls the simple to. The
promise of the Spirit is also like His [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026). And with the spirit there are
to be also the "words" of Wisdom. Not the "spirit" alone, nor "words"
alone, but both together, each doing its appointed work - this is the
divine instrumentality for the education of such as will receive it.

[Proverbs 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 1:24</span></span>

The threats and warnings of Wisdom are also foreshadowings of the
teaching of Jesus. There will come a time when "too late" shall be
written on all efforts, on all remorse. Compare [Mat
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#010), [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030).

[Proverbs 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 1:26</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. The scorn and derision with which men
look on pride and malice, baffled and put to shame, has something that
answers to it in the Divine Judgment. It is, however, significant that
in the fuller revelation of the mind and will of the Father in the
person of the Son no such language meets us. Sadness, sternness,
severity, there may be, but, from first to last, no word of mere
derision.

[Proverbs 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 1:27</span></span>

Desolation - Better, tempest. The rapid gathering of the clouds, the
rushing of the mighty winds, are the fittest types of the suddenness
with which in the end the judgment of God shall fall on those who look
not for it. Compare [Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029) etc.;
[Luk 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024).

[Proverbs 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 1:29</span></span>

This is no arbitrary sentence. The fault was all along their own. The
fruit of their own ways is death.

[Proverbs 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 1:32</span></span>

Turning - Wisdom had called the simple to "turn," and they had turned,
but it was "away" from her. For "prosperity" read carelessness. Not
outward prosperity, but the temper which it too often produces, the
easy-going indifference to higher truths, is that which destroys.
