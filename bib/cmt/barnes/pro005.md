Heritage

### [Proverbs Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001)

[Proverbs 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 5:1</span></span>

The formula of a new counsel, introducing another warning against the
besetting sin of youth [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016).

[Proverbs 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 5:2</span></span>

And that thy lips may keep - literally, "and thy lips shall keep."

[Proverbs 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 5:3</span></span>

Smoother than oil - The same comparison is used in marginal reference to
describe the treachery of a false friend.

[Proverbs 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 5:4</span></span>

Wormwood - In Eastern medicine this herb, the absinthium of Greek and
Latin botanists, was looked upon as poisonous rather than medicinal.
Compare [Rev 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#011).

[Proverbs 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 5:6</span></span>

Or (with the Septuagint and Vulgate), Lest she should ponder (or "She
ponders not") the way of life, her paths move to and fro (unsteady as an
earthquake); she knows not. The words describe with a terrible vividness
the state of heart and soul which prostitution brings upon its victims;
the reckless blindness that will not think, tottering on the abyss, yet
loud in its defiant mirth, ignoring the dreadful future.

[Proverbs 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 5:9</span></span>

Thine honor - i. e., "The grace and freshness of thy youth" (compare
[Hos 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006); [Dan
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008)). The thought of this is to guard
the young man against the sins that stain and mar it. The slave of lust
sacrifices "years" that might have been peaceful and happy to one who is
merciless.

[Proverbs 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 5:10</span></span>

Strangers - The whole gang of those into whose hands the slave of lust
yields himself. The words are significant as showing that the older
punishment of death [Deu 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021); [Eze
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038); [Joh
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005) was not always inflicted, and that
the detected adulterer was exposed rather to indefinite extortion.
Besides loss of purity and peace, the sin, in all its forms, brings
poverty.

[Proverbs 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 5:11</span></span>

Yet one more curse is attendant on impurity. Then, as now, disease was
the penalty of this sin.

[Proverbs 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 5:12</span></span>

More bitter than slavery, poverty, disease, will be the bitterness of
self-reproach, the hopeless remorse that worketh death.

[Proverbs 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 5:14</span></span>

The conscience-stricken sinner had been "almost" given up to every form
of evil in the sight of the whole assembly of fellow-townsmen; "almost,"
therefore, condemned to the death which that assembly might inflict [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022). The public scandal of the sin
is brought in as its last aggravating feature.

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

The teacher seeks to counteract the evils of mere sensual passion
chiefly by setting forth the true blessedness of which it is the
counterfeit. The true wife is as a fountain of refreshment, where the
weary soul may quench its thirst. Even the joy which is of the senses
appears, as in the Song of Solomon, purified and stainless (see [Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019) marginal reference).

[Proverbs 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 5:16</span></span>

Wedded love streams forth in blessing on all around, on children and on
neighbors and ill the streets, precisely because the wife's true love is
given to the husband only.

[Proverbs 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 5:19</span></span>

Better, "A loving hind (is she) and pleasant roe." As in the whole
circle of Arab and Persian poetry the antelope and the gazelle are the
chosen images of beauty, so they served with equal fitness for the
masculine and feminine types of it. (Compare the names Tabitha and
Dorcas [Act 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036).

[Proverbs 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 5:20</span></span>

Emphasis is laid (see the [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016)
note) upon the origin of the beguiler.

[Proverbs 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 5:21</span></span>

One more warning. The sin is not against man, nor dependent on man's
detection only. The secret sin is open before the eyes of Yahweh. In the
balance of His righteous judgment are weighed all human acts.

Pondereth - Note the recurrence of the word used of the harlot herself
(see [Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006) note): she ponders not,
God does.

[Proverbs 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 5:23</span></span>

The end of the sensual life: to "die without instruction," life ended,
but the discipline of life fruitless; to "go astray," as if drunk with
the greatness of his folly (the same word is used as for "ravished" in
[Pro 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019), see marg.), even to the
end. This is the close of what might have gone on brightening to the
perfect day [Pro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).
