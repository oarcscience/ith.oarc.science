### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 3:1</span></span>

In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat - This date agrees exactly with
the statements that Jehoshaphat began to reign in the fourth year of
Ahab [Kg1 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041.md), and Ahaziah in the
17th year of Jehoshaphat [Kg1 22:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#051.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 3:2</span></span>

On the "evil" done by Ahab, see especially [Kg1
16:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030.md). Jehoram, warned by the fate
of his brother ([Kg2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#004) note.md), began
his reign by a formal abolition of the Phoenician state religion
introduced by Ahab - even if he connived at its continuance among the
people [Kg2 10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026.md); and by a
re-establishment of the old worship of the kingdom as arranged by
Jeroboam.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 3:4</span></span>

Moab, the region immediately east of the Dead Sea and of the lower
Jordan, though in part suited for agriculture, is in the main a great
grazing country. Mesha resembled a modern Arab Sheikh, whose wealth is
usually estimated by the number of his flocks and herds. His tribute of
the wool of 100, 000 lambs was a tribute in kind, the ordinary tribute
at this time in the East.

Mesha is the monarch who wrote the inscription on the "Moabite stone"
([Kg2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001) note.md). The points
established by the Inscription are:

1\. That Moab recovered from the blow dealt by David [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md), [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012.md), and became again an independent
state in the interval between David's conquest and the accession of
Omri;

2\. That Omri reconquered the country, and that it then became subject
to the northern kingdom, and remained so throughout his reign and that
of his son Ahab, and into the reign of Ahab's son and successor,
Ahaziah;

3\. That the independence was regained by means of a war, in which Mesha
took town after town from the Israelites, including in his conquests
many of the towns which, at the original occupation of the holy land,
had passed into the possession of the Reubenites or the Gadites, as
Baal-Meon [Num 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md), Kirjathaim [Num
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037.md), Ataroth [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md), Nebo [Num
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md), Jahaz [Jos
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md), etc.;

4\. That the name of Yahweh was well known to the Moabites as that of
the God of the Israelites; and

5\. That there was a sanctuary of Yahweh at Nebo, in the Trans-Jordanic
territory, where "vessels" were used in His service.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 3:7</span></span>

The close alliance between the two kingdoms still subsisted. Jehoram
therefore sends confidently to make the same request with respect to
Moab that his father had made two years before with respect to Syria
(marginal reference). Jehoshaphat consented at once, notwithstanding
that his former compliance had drawn upon him the rebuke of a prophet
[Ch2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md). Perhaps Jehoram's removal
of the Baal-worship [Kg2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#002.md) weighed
with him. He had himself been attacked by the Moabites in the preceding
year; and though the attempt had failed, Jehoshaphat would feel that it
might be renewed, and that it was important to seize the opportunity of
weakening his enemy which now offered itself.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 3:8</span></span>

The readiest and most natural "way" was across the Jordan near Jericho
into the Arboth-Moab, and then along the eastern shore of the Dead Sea
to Moab proper, the tract south of the Arnon. But the way chosen was
that which led to the Edomite country, namely, round the southern
extremity of the Dead Sea, and across the Arabah, or continuation of the
Jordan and Dead Sea valley. Thus would be effected a junction with the
forces of Edom, which had resumed its dependence on Judah, though the
year before it had been in alliance with Moab [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md); and they would come upon the
Moabites unprepared.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 3:9</span></span>

Seven days' journey - The distance of the route probably followed is not
much more than 100 miles. But the difficulties of the way are great; and
the army might not be able to move along it at a faster rate than about
15 miles a day.

No water - The kings had probably expected to find sufficient water for
both men and baggage animals in the Wady-el-Ahsy, which divides Edom
from Moab, and which has a stream that is now regarded as perennial. But
it was dried up - quite a possible occurrence with any of the streams of
this region.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 3:11</span></span>

A prophet of the Lord - i. e. of Yahweh. It was necessary to inquire
thus definitely, as there were still plenty of prophets who were only
prophets of Baal [Kg2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#013.md).

Here is Elisha - Jehoram appears to have been ignorant of his presence
with the host, and one of his "servants," or officers, answered
Jehoshaphat's inquiry.

Which poured water - An act signifying ministration or attendance
(compare [Joh 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005) ff.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 3:13</span></span>

Jehoram's humility in seeking [Kg2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#012.md) instead of summoning Elisha, does
not save him from rebuke. His reformation [Kg2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#002.md) had been but a half reformation -
a compromise with idolatry.

Nay: for the Lord hath called ... - The force of this reply seems to be
- "Nay, reproach me not, since I am in a sore strait - and not only I,
but these two other kings also. The Lord - Yahweh - is about to deliver
us into the hand of Moab. If thou canst not, or wilt not help, at least
do not reproach."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 3:15</span></span>

Music seems to have been a regular accompaniment of prophecy in the
"schools of the prophets" (marginal reference), and an occasional
accompaniment of it elsewhere [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 3:16</span></span>

Ditches - Or "pits" [Jer 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003.md). They
were to dig pits in the broad valley or wady, wherein the water might
remain, instead of flowing off down the torrent course.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 3:17</span></span>

No rain was to fall where the Israelites and their enemies were
encamped; there was not even to be that all but universal accompaniment
of rain in the East, a sudden rise of wind (compare [Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045.md); [Psa
147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018.md); [Mat
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#025).md).

Cattle, and your beast - The former are the animals brought for food.
The latter are the baggage animals.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 3:19</span></span>

Ye shall fell every good tree - This is not an infringement of the rule
laid down in [Deu 20:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md). The
Israelites were not forbidden to fell the fruit trees in an enemy's
country, as a part of the ravage of war, when they had no thoughts of
occupying the country. The plan of thus injuring an enemy was probably
in general use among the nations of these parts at the time. We see the
destruction represented frequently on the Assyrian monuments and
mentioned in the inscriptions of Egypt.

And stop all wells of water - The stoppage of wells was a common feature
of ancient, and especially Oriental, warfare (compare [Gen
26:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015).md).

Mar ... with stones - The exact converse of that suggested in [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md). The land in and about Palestine
is so stony that the first work of the cultivator is to collect the
surface stones together into heaps. An army marching through a land
could easily undo this work, dispersing the stones thus gathered, and
spreading them once more over the fields.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 3:20</span></span>

When the meat offering was offered - i. e. about sunrise, when the
morning sacrifice was offered. Compare [Kg1
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#029.md).

There came water by the way of Edom - The Wady-el-Ahsy drains a
considerable portion of northern Edom. Heavy rain had fallen during the
night in some part of this tract, and with the morning a freshet of
water came down the valley, filling the pits.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 3:21</span></span>

And stood in the border - On the north side of the wady, ready to defend
their territory.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 3:23</span></span>

The sun had risen with a ruddy light, as is frequently the case after a
storm (compare [Mat 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003).md), nearly over
the Israelite camp, and the pits, deep but with small mouths, gleaming
redly through the haze which would lie along the newly moistened valley,
seemed to the Moabites like pools of blood. The preceding year, they and
their allies had mutually destroyed each other [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md). It seemed to them, from their
knowledge of the jealousies between Judah, Israel, and Edom, not
unlikely that a similar calamity had now befallen their foes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 3:25</span></span>

Kir-Haraseth, also Kir-Hareseth, is identified almost certainly with the
modern Kerak, a strong city on the highland immediately east of the
southern part of the Dead Sea. It was the great fortress of Moab, though
not the capital, which was Rabbath or Rabbah. It was an important
strong-hold at the time of the Crusades, and is still a place of great
strength. Kir seems to have meant "fortress." It is found in Cir-cesium,
Car-chemish, etc.

Kir-Haraseth resisted all the attempts to dismantle it; but the slingers
found places on the hills which surrounded it, from where they could
throw their stones into it and harass the garrison, though they could
not take the town.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 3:26</span></span>

To break through, even unto the king of Edom - Either because he thought
that the king of Edom would connive at his escape or to take vengeance
on him for having deserted his former allies ([Kg2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#008) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 3:27</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Mesha, when his sally failed, took, as a
last resource, his first born son, and offered him as a burnt-offering
to appease the manifest anger of his god Chemosh, and obtain his aid
against his enemies. This act was thoroughly in accordance with
Moabitish notions.

And there was great indignation against Israel - Either the Israelites
were indignant with themselves, or the men of Judah and the Edomites
were indignant at the Israelites for having caused the pollution of this
sacrifice, and the siege was relinquished.
