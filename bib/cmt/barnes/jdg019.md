### [Judges Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 19:0</span></span>

This history has no connection whatever with the preceding. The note of
time [Jdg 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028) shows that the date of
it is in the lifetime of the first generation of settlers in Canaan.

[Judges 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 19:1</span></span>

A concubine - See the margin. The name does not imply any moral
reproach. A concubine was as much the man's wife as the woman so called,
though she had not the same rights. See [Jdg
19:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#003).

[Judges 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 19:2</span></span>

Played the whore against him - Perhaps only meaning that she ran away
from him, and left him, for she returned to her father's house.

[Judges 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 19:9</span></span>

This is a perfect picture of the manners of the time. It is probable
that the father showed more than usual hospitality, in order to ensure
the kind treatment of his daughter by her husband. These particulars are
given to account for their journey running so far into the evening,
which was the immediate cause of the horrible catastrophe which
followed.

[Judges 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 19:12</span></span>

City of a stranger - This shows how completely, even in these early
days, the Jebusite population had excluded both the tribes of Judah and
Benjamin.

[Judges 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 19:14</span></span>

Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin - See [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024) note.

[Judges 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 19:15</span></span>

A street - Probably the square or place within the gates, where courts
were held, bargains made, and where the chief men and strangers
congregated.

[Judges 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 19:16</span></span>

Which was also of Mount Ephraim - i. e., of the country of the Levite.
This single giver of hospitality was himself a stranger and sojourner at
Gibeah.

[Judges 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 19:18</span></span>

The house of the Lord - Probably at Shiloh (marginal references). The
Levite was probably one of those who ministered at the tabernacle. His
two donkeys and servant show him to have been in good circumstances, and
he had a home of his own.

[Judges 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 19:23</span></span>

This man is come into mine house - He appeals to the sacred rights of
hospitality, just as Lot did [Gen
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008). Both cases betray painfully the
low place in the social scale occupied by woman in the old world, from
which it is one of the glories of Christianity to have raised her.

[Judges 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 19:29</span></span>

A knife - Rather, "the" "knife". The single household implement used,
not like our knives at our meals, but for slaughtering and cutting up
the animals into joints for eating [Gen
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#006), [Gen
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#010); [Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014).

Together with her bones ... - Rather, "into her bones", or "bone by
bone, into twelve pieces". The "pieces" are synonymous with the "bones"
(compare [Eze 24:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004)). There is
something truly terrible in the stern ferocity of grief and indignation
which dictated this desperate effort to arouse his countrymen to avenge
his wrong. Compare [Sa1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#007).
