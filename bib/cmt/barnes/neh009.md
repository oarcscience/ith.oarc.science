### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

The festival lasted from the 15th day of the 7th month to the first. The
22nd day was a day of solemn observance [Neh
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#018.md). One day seems to have been
allowed the people for rest; and then the work of repentance, for which
they had shown themselves ready [Neh
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md), was taken in hand, and a general
fast was proclaimed.

[Nehemiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 9:4</span></span>

The Septuagint and the Vulgate remove the comma after "stairs." By the
"stairs (or scaffold) of the Levites" is to be understood as an elevated
platform from which they could the better address and lead the people
(compare [Neh 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004).md).

[Nehemiah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 9:5</span></span>

Stand up - The people had knelt to confess and to worship God [Neh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#003.md). They were now to take the proper
attitude for praise. Compare throughout the margin reference.

[Nehemiah 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 9:6</span></span>

The host of heaven worshippeth thee - i. e the angels. See [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md); [Psa
103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021.md).

[Nehemiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 9:17</span></span>

In their rebellion - The Septuagint and several maunscripts have "in
Egypt" (the words in the original differing by one letter only), and
translate - "And appointed a captain to return to their bondage in
Egypt." Compare the margin reference. The appointment of a leader is
regarded here as made, whereas we are only told in the Book of Numbers
that it was proposed.

[Nehemiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 9:22</span></span>

Thou didst divide them into corners - i. e., parts of the holy land; or
as some prefer "thou didst distribute them on all sides."

[Nehemiah 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 9:25</span></span>

Became fat. - i. e., "grew proud," or "wanton" - a phrase only occurring
here, in the margin reference, and in [Jer
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md).

Delighted themselves - Rather, "luxuriated." The word in the original
does not occur elsewhere; but cognate terms make the sense clear.

[Nehemiah 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">neh 9:26</span></span>

Slew thy prophets - Compare [Kg1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md);
[Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md); [Ch2
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md). Jewish tradition further
affirms that more than one of the great prophets (e. g., Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel) were martyred by their countrymen.

[Nehemiah 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 9:27</span></span>

Thou gavest them saviours - See [Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md) etc.

[Nehemiah 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">neh 9:38</span></span>

Seal unto it - The exact force of the phrase used is doubtful; but its
general sense must be that the classes named took part in the sealing.
It was usual in the East to authenticate covenants by appending the
seals of those who were parties to them (see [Jer
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010).md).
