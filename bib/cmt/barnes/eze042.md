### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 42:1</span></span>

Utter court - Outward court, so [Eze
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md).

Into the chamber ... before the building - to the chambers (See L, Plan
II)... over against etc. "The building" is the temple-building, for this
row of chambers was built against eighty cubits of the wall bounding
"the separate place" and twenty cubits of the wall of the temple-court.

[Ezekiel 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 42:2</span></span>

He brought me "before" a row of chambers 100 cubits long, east and west.
"The door" of which lay on the north side of the chambers. The priests
entered from the outer court (O); the breadth of this block of chambers
was fifty cubits, north and south [Eze
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008.md).

[Ezekiel 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 42:3</span></span>

These "chambers" (compare [Eze 46:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#019).md)
did not reach to the western wall; between it and them lay a court for
cooking (M), probably forty cubits by thirty; such court with its
approaches filled up the corner of fifty cubits square, as in the case
of the kitchen-courts for the people. In these chambers were
dining-rooms for the priests (see [Eze
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013).md), and baths, for no priest could
enter upon his daily ministry without having first bathed. "The
chambers" extended beyond "the separate place" to the wall of the
temple-court, on the other side of which wall was the twenty cubits
space. The "pavement" (H) was no doubt continued along the temple-wall,
so that these priests' chambers, like the thirty chambers, stood upon "a
pavement," and were, on the east side, "over against this pavement."

Translate [Eze 42:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md), "Then he
brought me forth into the outward court, the way toward the north, and
he brought me to the chambers which were over against the separate
place, and which were over against the building, toward the north along
the front of the length of an hundred cubits, with the door by the
north, and the breadth fifty cubits over against the twenty cubits which
were in the inner court, and over against the pavement which was in the
outward court, gallery upon gallery in three stories."

[Ezekiel 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 42:4</span></span>

Or, In the front "of the chambers" was a gangway "of ten cubits" breadth
(leading) "inward," a path "of one cubit, and their doors toward the
north." The "gangway" had stairs to the upper stories, while along the
north front of the building there was a kerb of one cubit, as before the
guard-chambers [Eze 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#012.md), on which
kerb the north doors (leading to the basement) opened. Others follow the
Septuagint "And opposite the chambers a walk 10 cubits in width to 100
cubits in length."

[Ezekiel 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 42:5</span></span>

Render: "And the upper chambers were" shortened, for galleries took off
from them, from "the lower" and from "the middle-most, chambers, of the
building." The building rose in terraces, as was usual in Babylonian
architecture, and so each of the two upper stories receded from the one
below it.

[Ezekiel 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 42:6</span></span>

The front of the higher stories was not supported on pillars, but there
was a narrowing from "the lowest" (chambers) "and" from "the middlemost"
(chambers) "from the ground."

[Ezekiel 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 42:7</span></span>

The "wall" here must be one from north to south, fencing off from the
outer court the passage along the east side of the chambers, and
therefore fifty cubits long.

[Ezekiel 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 42:8</span></span>

The length - From north to south.

Before the temple - This describes their position in a general way; more
precisely they lay over against partly the "separate place" and partly
the "temple-court" [Eze 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 42:9</span></span>

The entry from these chambers to the temple-court was by a passage lying
to the east fenced off by the "wall" [Eze
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md). This passage is described as
lying under the chambers, being on the basement, and also having access
by steps to the temple-court, which was raised many steps above the
outer court.

[Ezekiel 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 42:10</span></span>

Render it: Breadth-wise (was) the wall [Eze
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007.md) toward the east; in front of the
separate place and of the building (were) the chambers: i. e., on the
east was "the wall" ("geder"); along the boundary wall of "the separate
place" and of the "building" (the temple) lay the "chambers."

[Ezekiel 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 42:11</span></span>

Translate: And along the front of them - like (literally as the
appearance of) the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they
and as broad as they, and (like) all their goings out, and like their
fashions, and like their doors, even so were the doors of the chambers
which were toward the south; (with) a door at the head of the way, the
way of the wall adjoined eastward as one entereth into them (the
chambers).

[Ezekiel 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 42:13</span></span>

In [Lev 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013.md) it was prescribed that
the priests should eat of the sacrifices in the "holy place." This was
originally before the altar in the inner court - now separate chambers
are assigned, and these become "the holy place" for this purpose. Of the
"trespass-offering" and "meat-offering" what was not consumed was eaten
[Lev 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006.md), but the "sin-offering" was
burned without the camp [Eze 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#021.md).
Probably the carcass was brought from the altar to the chamber before
being carried out.

[Ezekiel 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 42:14</span></span>

Compare [Lev 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023.md).

Those things which are for the people - namely, the outer court.

[Ezekiel 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 42:15</span></span>

The Precincts. The temple and its courts were surrounded by an area of
exact dimensions 3,000 cubits (1,500 yards) square. See Plan IV.

[Eze 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015.md)

The inner house - The temple and its courts, all that lay within the
"wall on the outside of the house [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md); the gate" is the eastern gate of
the outer court.

Measured it round about - The precincts, into which he had brought the
seer through the eastern gate of the outer court.

[Ezekiel 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 42:20</span></span>

The "sanctuary" proper is probably here the most holy place as
distinguished from the rest of the temple [Eze
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#023.md); [Eze
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003.md); but the term was capable of
extension first to the whole temple, then to all the ground that was
separated to "holy" as distinguished from "profane," i. e., common uses.

In the vision the courts rose on successive platforms, the outer court
being raised seven steps above the precincts, the inner court eight
steps above the outer, and the temple itself ten steps above the court
of sacrifice.
