### [Romans Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 15:0</span></span>

It may be of importance to state that between the last verse of the
preceding chapter and the first verse of Rom. 15, the Arabic version,
some manuscripts and many of the Greek fathers, as Chrysostom,
Theodoret, Theophylact, etc. have introduced [Rom
16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md). Why this was done, has been
a matter of controversy. The discussion, however, is of no practical
importance, and most critics concur in the opinion that the present
arrangement of the Greek text is genuine.

[Romans 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 15:1</span></span>

We then that are strong - The apostle resumes the subject of the
preceding chapter; and continues the exhortation to brotherly love and
mutual kindness and forbearance. By the "strong" here he means the
strong "in faith" in respect to the matters under discussion; those
whose minds were free from doubts and perplexities. His own mind was
free from doubt, and there were many others, particularly of the Gentile
converts, that had the same views. But many also, particularly of the
"Jewish" converts, had many doubts and scruples.

Ought to bear - This word bear properly means to "lift up," to "bear
away," to "remove." But here it is used in a larger sense; "to bear
with, to be indulgent to, to endure patiently, not to contend with;"
[Gal 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md); [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md), "Thou canst not bear them that
are evil."

And not to please ourselves - Not to make it our main object to gratify
our own wills. We should be willing to deny ourselves, if by it we may
promote the happiness of others. This refers particularly to "opinions"
about meats and drinks; but it may be applied to Christian conduct
generally, as denoting that we are not to make our own happiness or
gratification the standard of our conduct, but are to seek the welfare
of others; see the example of Paul, [Co1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019.md), [Co1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022.md); see also [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md); [Co1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005.md), "Love seeketh not her own;" [Co1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md), "Let no man seek his own, but
every man another's wealth; also [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md).

[Romans 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 15:2</span></span>

Please his neighbour - That is, all other persons, but especially the
friends of the Redeemer. The word "neighbor" here has special reference
to the members of the church. It is often used, however, in a much
larger sense; see [Luk 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036.md).

For his good - Not seek to secure for him indulgence in those things
which Would be injurious to him, but in all those things whereby his
welfare would be promoted.

To edification - See the note at [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md).

[Romans 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 15:3</span></span>

For even Christ - The apostle proceeds, in his usual manner, to
illustrate what he had said by the example of the Saviour. To a
Christian, the example of the Lord Jesus will furnish the most ready,
certain, and happy illustration of the nature and extent of his duty.

Pleased not himself - This is not to be understood as if the Lord Jesus
did not voluntarily and cheerfully engage in his great work. He was not
"compelled" to come and suffer. Nor is it to be understood as if he did
not "approve" the work, or see its propriety and fitness. If he had not,
he would never have engaged in its sacrifices and self-denials. But the
meaning may be expressed in the following particulars:

\(1\) He came to do the will or desire of God in "undertaking" the work
of salvation. It was the will of God; it was agreeable to the divine
purposes, and the Mediator did not consult his own happiness and honor
in heaven, but cheerfully came to "do the will" of God; [Psa
40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); compare [Heb
10:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md).

\(2\) Christ when on earth, made it his great object to do the will of
God, to finish the work which God had given him to do, and not to seek
his own comfort and enjoyment. This he expressly affirms; [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md); [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md).

\(3\) he was willing for this to endure whatever trials and pains the
will of God might demand, not seeking to avoid them or to shrink from
them. See particularly his prayer in the garden; [Luk
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md).

\(4\) in his life, he did not seek personal comfort, wealth, or friends,
or honors. He denied himself to promote the welfare of others; he was
poor that they might be rich; he was in lonely places that he might seek
out the needy and provide for them. Nay, he did not seek to preserve his
own life when the appointed time came to die, but gave himself up for
all.

\(5\) there may be another idea which the apostle had here. He bore with
patience the ignorance, blindness, erroneous views, and ambitious
projects of his disciples. He evinced kindness to them when in error;
and was not harsh, censorious, or unkind, when they were filled with
vain projects of ambition, or perverted his words, or were dull of
apprehension. So says the apostle, "we" ought to do in relation to our
brethren.

But as it is written - [Psa 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md). This
psalm, and the former part of this verse, is referred to the Messiah;
compare [Rom 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021.md), with [Mat
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034.md), [Mat
27:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#048.md).

The reproaches - The calumnies, censures, harsh, opprobrious speeches.

Of them that reproached thee - Of the wicked, who vilified and abused
the law and government of God.

Fell on me - In other words, Christ was willing to suffer reproach and
contempt in order to do good to others. tie endured calumny and contempt
all his life, from those who by their lips and lives calumniated God, or
reproached their Maker. We may learn here,

\(1\) That the contempt of Jesus Christ is contempt of him who appointed
him.

\(2\) we may see the kindness of the Lord Jesus in being willing thus to
"throw himself" between the sinner and God; to "intercept," as it were,
our sins, and to bear the effects of them in his own person. He stood
between "us" and God; and both the reproaches and the divine displeasure
due to them, "met" on his sacred person, and produced the sorrows of the
atonement - his bitter agony in the garden and on the cross. Jesus thus
showed his love of God in being willing to bear the reproaches aimed at
him; and his love to "men" in being willing to endure the sufferings
necessary to atone for these very sins.

\(3\) if Jesus thus bore reproaches, "we" should be willing also to
endure them. We suffer in the cause where be has gone before us, and
where he has set us the example; and as "he" was abused and vilified, we
should be willing to be so also.

[Romans 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 15:4</span></span>

For whatsoever things ... - This is a "general" observation which struck
the mind of the apostle, from the particular case which he had just
specified. He had just made use of a striking passage in the Psalms to
his purpose. The thought seems suddenly to have occurred to him that
"all" the Old Testament was admirably adapted to express Christian
duties and doctrine, and he therefore turned aside from his direct
argument to express this sentiment. It should be read as a parenthesis.

Were written aforetime - That is, in ancient times; in the Old
Testament.

For our learning - For our "teaching" or instruction. Not that this was
the "only" purpose of the writings of the Old Testament, to instruct
Christians; but that all the Old Testament might be useful "now" in
illustrating and enforcing the doctrines and duties of piety toward God
and man.

Through patience - This does not mean, as our translation might seem to
suppose, patience "of the Scriptures," but it means that by patiently
enduring sufferings, in connection with the consolation which the
Scriptures furnish, we might have hope. The "tendency" of patience, the
apostle tells us [Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md), is to
produce "hope;" see the notes at this place.

And comfort of the Scriptures - By means of the consolation which the
writings of the Old Testament furnish. The word rendered "comfort" means
also "exhortation" or "admonition." If this is its meaning here, it
refers to the admonitions which the Scriptures suggest, instructions
which they impart, and the exhortations to patience in trials. If it
means "comfort," then the reference is to the examples of the saints in
affliction; to their recorded expressions of confidence in God in their
trials, as of Job, Daniel, David, etc. Which is the precise meaning of
the word here, it is not easy to determine.

Might have hope - Note, [Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md). We
may learn here,

\(1\) That afflictions may prove to be a great blessing.

\(2\) that their proper tendency is to produce "hope."

\(3\) that the way to find support in afflictions is to go to the Bible.

By the example of the ancient saints, by the expression of their
confidence in God, by their patience, "we" may learn to suffer, and may
not only be "instructed," but may find "comfort" in all our trials; see
the example of Paul himself in [Co2
1:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#002.md).

[Romans 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 15:5</span></span>

Now the God of patience - The God who is "himself" long-suffering, who
bears patiently with the errors and faults of his children, and who can
"give" patience, may he give you of his Spirit, that you may bear
patiently the infirmities and errors of each other. The example of God
here, who bears long with his children, and is not angry soon at their
offences, is a strong argument why Christians should bear with each
other. If God bears long and patiently with "our" infirmities, "we"
ought to bear with each other.

And consolation - Who gives or imparts consolation.

To be like-minded ... - Greek To think the same thing; that is, to be
united, to keep from divisions and strifes.

According to Christ Jesus - According to the example and spirit of
Christ; his was a spirit of peace. Or, according to what his religion
requires. The name of Christ is sometimes thus put for his religion;
[Co2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md); [Eph
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020.md). If all Christians would imitate
the example of Christ, and follow his instructions, there would be no
contentions among them. He earnestly sought in his parting prayer their
unity and peace; [Joh 17:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md).

[Romans 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 15:6</span></span>

That ye may with one mind - The word used here is translated "with one
accord;" [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md); [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md); [Act
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md). It means unitedly, with one
purpose, without contentions, and strifes, and jars.

And one mouth - This refers, doubtless, to their prayers and praises.
That they might join without contention and unkind feeling, in the
worship of God. Divisions, strife, and contention in the church prevent
union in worship. Though the "body" may be there, and the church
"professedly" engaged in public worship, yet it is a "divided" service;
and the prayers of strife and contention are not heard; [Isa
58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004.md).

Glorify God - Praise or honor God. This would be done by their union,
peace, and harmony; thus showing the tendency of the gospel to overcome
the sources of strife and contention among people, and to bring them to
peace.

Even the Father ... - This is an addition designed to produce love.

\(1\) he is "a Father;" we then, his children, should regard him as
pleased with the union and peace of his family.

\(2\) he is the Father of our Lord; our "common" Lord; our Lord who has
commanded us to be united, and to love one another. By the desire of
honoring "such" a Father, we should lay aside contentions, and be united
in the bands of love.

[Romans 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 15:7</span></span>

Wherefore - In view of all the considerations tending to produce unity
and love, which have been presented. He refers to the various arguments
in this and the preceding chapter.

Receive ye one another - Acknowledge one another as Christians, and
treat one another as such, though you may differ in opinion about many
smaller matters; see [Rom 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003.md).

As Christ also received us - That is, received us as his friends and
followers; see [Rom 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003.md).

To the glory of God - In order to promote his glory. He has redeemed us,
and renewed us, in order to promote the honor of God; compare [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md). As Christ has received us in
order to promote the glory of God, so ought we to treat each other in a
similar manner for a similar purpose. The exhortation in tiffs verse is
to those who had been divided on various points pertaining to rites and
ceremonies; to those who had been converted from among "Gentiles" and
"Jews;" and the apostle here says that Christ had received "both." In
order to enforce this, and especially to show the "Jewish" converts that
they ought to receive and acknowledge their "Gentile" brethren, he
proceeds to show, in the following verses, that Christ had reference to
"both" in his work. He shows this in reference to the "Jews" [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md), and to the "Gentiles" [Rom
15:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md). Thus, he draws all his
arguments from the work of Christ.

[Romans 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 15:8</span></span>

Now I say - I affirm, or maintain. I, a "Jew," admit that his work had
reference to the Jews; I affirm also that it had reference to the
Gentiles.

That Jesus Christ - That "the Messiah." The force of the apostle's
reasoning would often be more striking if he would retain the word
"Messiah," and not regard the word "Christ" as a mere surname. It is the
name of his "office;" and to "a Jew" the name "Messiah" would convey
much more than the idea of a mere proper name.

Was a minister of the circumcision - Exercized his office - the office
of the Messiah - among the Jews, or with respect to the Jews, for the
purposes which he immediately specifies. He was born a Jew; was
circumcised; came "to" that nation; and died in their midst, without
having gone himself to any other people.

For the truth of God - To confirm or establish the truth of the promises
of God. He remained among them in the exercise of his ministry, to show
that God was "true," who had said that the Messiah should come to them.

To confirm the promises ... - To "establish," or to show that the
promises were true; see the note at [Act
3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md). The "promises" referred to
here, are those particularly which related to the coming of the Messiah.
By thus admitting that the Messiah was the minister of the circumcision,
the apostle conceded all that the Jew could ask, that he was to be
peculiarly "their" Messiah; see the note at [Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md).

[Romans 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 15:9</span></span>

And that the Gentiles ... - The benefits of the gospel were not to be
confined to "the Jews;" and as God "designed" that those benefits should
be extended to the "Gentiles," so the Jewish converts ought to be
willing to admit them and treat them as brethren. That God "did" design
this, the apostle proceeds to show.

Might glorify God - Might "praise," or give thanks to God. This implies
that the favor shown to them was a "great" favor.

For his mercy - Greek, On account of the mercy shown to them.

As it is written - [Psa 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md). The
expression there is one of David's. He says that he will praise God for
his mercies "among" the pagan, or when surrounded "by" the pagan; or
that he would confess and acknowledge the mercies of God to him, as we
should say, "to all the world." The apostle, however, uses it in this
sense, that the "Gentiles" would "participate" with the Jew in offering
praise to God, or that they would be united. This does not appear to
have been the original design of David in the psalm, but the "words"
express the idea of the apostle.

And sing ... - Celebrate thy praise. This supposes that "benefits" would
be conferred on them, for which they would celebrate his goodness.

[Romans 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 15:10</span></span>

And again ... - ; [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md). In this
place the "nations" or Gentiles are called on to rejoice with the Jews,
for the interposition of God in their behalf. The design of the
quotation is to show that the Old Testament speaks of the Gentiles as
called on to celebrate the praises of God; of course, the apostle infers
that they are to be introduced to the same privileges as his people.

[Romans 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 15:11</span></span>

And again - [Psa 117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md). The object in
this quotation is the same as before. The apostle accumulates quotations
to show that it was the common language of the Old Testament, and that
he was not depending on a single expression for the truth of his
doctrine.

All ye Gentiles - In the psalm, "all ye nations;" but the original is
the same.

And laud him - "Praise" him. The psalm is directly in point. It is a
call on "all" nations to praise God; the very point in the discussion of
the apostle.

[Romans 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 15:12</span></span>

Esaias saith - [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md).

There shall be a root - A descendant, or one that should proceed from
him when he was dead. When a tree dies, and falls, there may remain a
"root" which shall retain life, and which shall send up a sprout of a
similar kind. So Job says [Job 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md),
"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease." So in
relation to Jesse. Though he should fall, like an aged tree, yet his
name and family should not be extinct. There should be a descendant who
should rise, and reign over the Gentiles. The Lord Jesus is thus called
also the "root and the offspring of David;" [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md); [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md).

Of Jesse - The father of David; [Sa1
17:58](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#058.md). The Messiah was thus descended
from Jesse.

He that shall rise - That is, as a sprout springs up from a decayed or
fallen tree. Jesus thus "rose" from the family of David, that had fallen
into poverty and humble life in the time of Mary.

To reign over the Gentiles - This is quoted from the Septuagint of [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md). The Hebrew is, "Which shall
stand up for an ensign of the people;" that is, a standard to which they
shall flock. Either the Septuagint or the Hebrew would express the idea
of the apostle. The "substantial" sense is retained, though it is not
literally quoted. The idea of his "reigning" over the Gentiles is one
that is fully expressed in the second psalm.

In him ... - Hebrew, "To it shall the Gentiles seek." The sense,
however, is the same. The design of this quotation is the same as the
preceding, to show that it was predicted in the Old Testament that the
Gentiles should be made partakers of the privileges of the gospel. The
argument of the apostle is, that if this was designed, then converts to
Christianity from among the "Jews" should lay aside their prejudices,
and "receive" them as their brethren, entitled to the same privileges of
the gospel as themselves. The "fact" that the Gentiles would be admitted
to these privileges, the apostle had more fully discussed in Rom. 10-11.

[Romans 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 15:13</span></span>

Now the God of hope - The God who "inspires," or "produces" the
Christian hope.

All joy and peace - [Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md). If
they were filled with this, there would be no strife and contention.

In believing - The effect of believing is to produce this joy and peace.

That ye may abound ... - That your hope may be steadfast and strong.

Through the power ... - By means of the powerful operation of the Holy
Spirit. It is by his power alone that the Christian has the hope of
eternal life; see [Eph 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md).

[Romans 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 15:14</span></span>

And I myself also - The apostle here proceeds to show them why he had
written this Epistle, and to state his confidence in them. He had
exhorted them to peace; he had opposed some of their strongest
prejudices; and in order to secure their obedience to his injunctions,
he now shows them the deep interest which he had in their welfare,
though he had never seen them.

Am persuaded - He had never seen them [Rom
1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md), but he had full confidence in
them. This confidence he had expressed more fully in the first chapter.

Of you - Concerning you. I have full confidence in you.

My brethren - An address of affection; showing that he was not disposed
to assume undue authority, or to lord it over their faith.

Are full of goodness - Filled with "kindness" or "benevolence." That is,
they were "disposed" to obey any just commands; and that consequently
any errors in their opinions and conduct had not been the effect of
obstinacy or perverseness. There was indeed danger in the city of Rome
of pride and haughtiness; and among the Gentile converts there might
have been some reluctance to receive instruction from a foreign Jew. But
the apostle was persuaded that all this was overcome by the mild and
humbling spirit of religion, and that they were disposed to obey any
just commands. He made this observation, therefore, to conciliate
respect to his authority as an apostle.

Filled with all knowledge - That is, instructed in the doctrines and
duties of the Christian religion. This was true; but there might be
still some comparatively unimportant and nonessential points, on which
they might not be entirely clear. On these, the apostle had written; and
written, not professedly to communicate "new" ideas, but to "remind"
them of the great principles on which they were before instructed, [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md).

Able also ... - That is, you are so fully instructed in Christian
principles, as to be able to give advice and counsel, if it is needed.
From this verse we may learn,

\(1\) That when it is our duty to give instruction, admonition, or
advice, it should be in a kind, conciliating manner; not with harshness,
or with the severity of authority. Even "an apostle" did not assume
harshness or severity in his instructions.

\(2\) there is no impropriety in speaking of the good qualities of
Christians in their presence; or even of "commending" and "praising"
them when they deserve it.

The apostle Paul was as far as possible from always dwelling on the
faults of Christians. When it was necessary to reprove them, he did it,
but did it with tenderness and tears. When he "could" commend, he
preferred it; and never hesitated to give them credit to the utmost
extent to which it could be rendered. He did not "flatter," but he told
the truth; he did not commend to excite pride and vanity, but to
encourage, and to prompt to still more active efforts. The minister who
always censures and condemns, whose ministry is made up of complaints
and lamentations, who never speaks of Christians but in a strain of
fault-finding, is unlike the example of the Saviour and of Paul, and may
expect little success in his work; compare [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Rom
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md); [Co1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005.md); [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md); [Phi
1:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md); [Heb
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md); [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md).

[Romans 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md)

Nevertheless - Notwithstanding my full persuasion of your knowledge and
your purpose to do right. Perhaps he refers also to the fact that he was
a stranger to them.

The more boldly - More boldly than might have been expected from a
stranger. The reason why he showed this boldness in declaring his
sentiments, he immediately states - that he had been especially called
to the function of instructing the Gentiles.

In some sort - ἀπὸ μέρος apo meros. In part. Some have supposed that he
referred to a "party" at Rome - the Gentile party (Whitby). Some refer
it to different "parts" of his epistle - on some subjects (Stuart).
Probably the expression is designed to qualify the phrase "more boldly."
The phrase, says Grotius, "diminishes" that of which it is spoken, as
[Co1 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009.md), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Co2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md); and means the same as "somewhat
more freely;" that is, I have been induced to write the more freely,
"partly" because I am appointed to this very office. I write somewhat
more freely to a church among the Gentiles than I even should to one
among the Jews, "because" I am appointed to this very office.

As putting you in mind - Greek, Calling to your "remembrance," or
"reminding" you; compare [Pe2 1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md).
This was a delicate way of communicating instruction. The apostles
presumed that all Christians were acquainted with the great doctrines of
religion; but they did not command, enjoin, or assume a spirit; of
dictation. How happy would it be if all teachers would imitate the
example of the "apostles" in this, and be as modest and humble "as they
were."

Because of the grace ... - Because God has conferred the favor on me of
appointing me to this function; see the note at [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md).

[Romans 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 15:16</span></span>

The minister - λειτουργὸν leitourgon. This is not the word which is
commonly translated "minister" διάκονος diakonos. This word is properly
appropriated to those who minister in public offices or the affairs of
the state. In the New Testament it is applied mainly to the Levitical
priesthood, who ministered and served at the altar; [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). It is however applied to the
ministers of the New Testament, as discharging "substantially" the same
offices toward the church which were discharged by the Levitical
priesthood; that is, as engaged in promoting the welfare of the church,
occupied in holy things, etc.; [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md), "as they "ministered" to the
Lord and fasted," etc. It is still used in a larger sense in [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md); [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md).

To the Gentiles - Compare [Rom 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md);
[Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md).

Ministering - ἱερουργοῦντα hierourgounta. Performing the function of a
priest in respect to the gospel of God. The office of a "priest" was to
offer sacrifice. Paul here retains the "language," though without
affirming or implying that the ministers of the New Testament were
literally "priests" to offer sacrifice. The word used here occurs
nowhere else in the New Testament. Its meaning here is to be determined
from the connection. The question is, What is the "sacrifice" of which
he speaks? It is the "offering up" - the sacrifice of the Gentiles. The
Jewish sacrifices were abolished. The Messiah had fulfilled the design
of their appointment, and they were to be done away. (See the Epistle to
the Hebrews.) There was to be no further "literal" sacrifice. But now
the "offerings" of the Gentiles were to be as acceptable as had been the
offerings of the Jews. God made no distinction; and in speaking of these
offerings, Paul used "figurative" language drawn from the Jewish rites.
But assuredly he did not mean that the offerings of the Gentiles were
"literal" sacrifices to expiate sins; nor did he mean that there was to
be an order of men who were to be called "priests" under the New
Testament. If this passage "did" prove that, it would prove that it
should be confined to the "apostles," for it is of them only that he
uses it. The meaning is this: "Acting in the Christian church
substantially as the priests did among the Jews; that is, endeavoring to
secure the acceptableness of the offerings which the Gentiles make to
God."

That the offering up - The word here rendered "offering up" προσφορά
prosphora commonly means "a sacrifice" or an "expiatory" offering, and
is applied to Jewish sacrifices; [Act
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md); [Act
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md). It is also applied to the
sacrifice which was made by our Lord Jesus Christ when he offered
himself on the cross for the sins of people; [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md). It does not always mean
"bloody" sacrifices, but is used to denote "any" offering to God; [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), [Heb
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008.md),[Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md), [Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md). Hence, it is used in this large
sense to denote the "offering" which the Gentiles who were converted to
Christianity made of themselves; their "devoting" or dedicating
themselves to God. The "language" is derived from the customs of the
Jews; and the apostle represents himself "figuratively" as a priest
presenting this offering to God.

Might be acceptable - Or, approved by God. This was in accordance with
the prediction in [Isa 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md), "They
shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all
nations," etc. This does not mean that it was by any merit of the
apostle that this offering was to be rendered "acceptable"; but that he
was appointed to prepare the way, so that "their" offering, as well as
that of the "Jews," might come up before God.

Being sanctified - That is, "the offering" being sanctified, or made
holy. The sacrifice was "prepared" or made fit "to be" an offering,
among the Jews, by salt, oil, or frankincense, according to the nature
of the sacrifice; [Lev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014.md), etc. In
allusion to this, the apostle says that the offering of the Gentiles was
rendered "holy," or fit to be offered, by the converting and purifying
influences of the Holy Spirit. They were prepared, not by salt and
frankincense, but by the cleansing influences of God's Spirit. The same
idea, substantially, is expressed by the apostle Peter in [Act
10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046.md); [Act
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017.md).

[Romans 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 15:17</span></span>

I have therefore ... - I have cause of glorying. I have cause of
rejoicing that God has made me a minister to the Gentiles, and that he
has given me such success among them. The ground of this he states in
[Rom 15:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018.md).

Glory - Of "boasting" καύχησιν kauchēsin, the word usually rendered
"boasting"); [Jam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md); [Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md); [Co2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#014.md); [Co2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024.md); [Co2
9:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003.md); [Co2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015.md); [Co2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010.md), [Co2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md). It means also "praise,
thanksgiving," and "joy;" [Co1 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031.md);
[Co2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Co2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004.md); [Co2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024.md); [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md). This is its meaning here, that
the apostle had great cause of "rejoicing" or "praise" that he had been
so highly honored in the appointment to this office, and in his success
in it.

Through Jesus Christ - By the assistance of Jesus Christ; ascribing his
success among the Gentiles to the aid which Jesus Christ had rendered
him.

In those things which pertain to God - Compare [Heb
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md). The things of religion; the
things which God has commanded, and which pertain to his honor and
glory. They were not things which pertained to "Paul," but to "God:" not
worked by Paul, but by Jesus Christ; yet he might rejoice that he had
been the means of diffusing so far those blessings. The success of a
minister is not for "his own" praises, but for the honor of God; not by
his skill or power, but by the aid of Jesus Christ; yet he may rejoice
that "through" him such blessings are conferred upon people.

[Romans 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 15:18</span></span>

For I will not dare to speak - I should be restrained; I should be
afraid to speak, if the thing were not as I have stated. I should be
afraid to set up a claim beyond what is strictly in accordance with the
truth.

Which Christ hath not wrought by me - I confine myself "strictly" to
what I have done. I do not arrogate to myself what Christ has done by
others. I do not exaggerate my own success, or claim what others have
accomplished.

To make the Gentiles obedient - To bring them to obey God in the gospel.

By word and deed - By preaching, and by all other means; by miracle, by
example, etc. The "deeds," that is, the "lives" of Christian ministers
are often as efficacious in bringing people to Christ as their public
ministry.

[Romans 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 15:19</span></span>

Through mighty signs and wonders - By stupendous and striking miracles;
see the note at [Act 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md). Paul here
refers, doubtless, to the miracles which he had himself performed; see
[Act 19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md), "And God wrought
special miracles by the hands of Paul," etc.

By the power of the Spirit of God - This may either be connected with
signs and wonders, and then it will mean that those miracles were
performed by the power of the Holy Spirit; or it may constitute a new
subject, and refer to the gift of prophecy, the power of speaking other
languages. Which is its true meaning cannot, perhaps, be ascertained.
The interpretations "agree" in this, that he traced his success in "all"
things to the aid of the Holy Spirit.

So that from Jerusalem - Jerusalem, as a "center" of his work; the
center of all religious operations and preaching under the gospel. This
was not the place where "Paul" began to preach [Gal
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md), but it was the place where
the "gospel" was first preached, and the apostles began to reckon their
success from that as a point; compare the note at [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049.md).

And round about - καί κύκλῳ kai kuklō. In a circle. That is, taking
Jerusalem as a center, he had fully preached round that center until you
come to Illyricum.

Unto Illyricum - Illyricum was a province lying to the northwest of
Macedonia, bounded north by a part of Italy and Germany, east by
Macedonia, south by the Adriatic, west by Istria. It comprehended the
modern Croatia and Dalmatia. So that taking Jerusalem as a center, Paul
preached not only in Damascus and Arabia, but in Syria, in Asia Minor,
in all Greece, in the Grecian Islands, and in Thessaly and Macedonia.
This comprehended no small part of the then known world; "all" of which
had heard the gospel by the labors of one indefatigable man There is no
where in the Acts express mention of Paul's going "into" Illyricum; nor
does the expression imply that he preached the gospel "within" it, but
only "unto" its borders. It may have been, however, that when in
Macedonia, he crossed over into that country; and this is rendered
somewhat probable from the fact that "Titus" is mentioned as having gone
into "Dalmatia" [Ti2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md), which was a
part of Illyricum.

I have fully preached - The word used here means properly "to fill up"
πεπληρωκέναι peplērōkenai, "to complete," and here is used in the sense
of "diffusing abroad," or of "filling up" all that region with the
gospel; compare [Ti2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md). It means
that he had faithfully diffused the knowledge of the gospel in all that
immense country.

[Romans 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 15:20</span></span>

Yea, so have I strived - The word used here φιλοτιμούμενον
philotimoumenon means properly "to be ambitious, to be studious of
honor;" and then to "desire" earnestly. In that sense it is used here.
He earnestly desired; he made it a point for which he struggled, to
penetrate into regions which had not heard the gospel.

Not where Christ was named - Where the gospel had not been before
preached.

Lest I should build ... - That is, he desired to found churches himself;
he regarded himself as particularly called to this. Others might be
called to edify the church, but he regarded it as his function to make
known the name of the Saviour where it was not before known. This work
was particularly adapted to the ardor, zeal, energy, and bravery of such
a man as Paul. Every man has his proper gift; and there are some
particularly suited to "found" and establish churches; others to edify
and comfort them; compare [Co2
10:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013.md). The apostle chose the higher
honor, involving most danger and responsibility; but still any office in
building up the church is honorable.

[Romans 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 15:21</span></span>

But as it is written - [Isa 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md).
This is not literally quoted, but the sense is retained. The design of
quoting it is to justify the principle on which the apostle acted. It
was revealed that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles; and he
regarded it as a high honor to be the instrument of carrying this
prediction into effect.

[Romans 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 15:22</span></span>

For which cause - I have been so entirely occupied in this leading
purpose of my life, that I have not been able to come to you.

Much hindered - Many ways; not many times. I had so frequent and urgent
demands on my time elsewhere, that I could not come to you.

From coming to you - Where the gospel "has been" preached. I have
desired to come, but have been unable to leave the vast region where I
might preach the gospel to those who had never heard it.

[Romans 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 15:23</span></span>

But now ... - Having no further opportunity in these regions to preach
to those who have never heard the gospel.

In these parts - In the regions before specified. He had gone over them,
had established churches, had left them in the care of elders [Act
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md), and was now prepared to
penetrate into some new region, and lay the foundation of other
churches.

And having a great desire ... - See [Rom
1:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md).

[Romans 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 15:24</span></span>

Whensoever I take my journey into Spain - Ancient Spain comprehended the
modern kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, or the whole of the Spanish
peninsula. It was then subject to the Romans. It is remarkable, even
here, that the apostle does not say that his principal object was to
visit the church at Rome, much as he desired that, but only to "take it
in his way" in the fulfillment of his higher purpose to preach the
gospel in regions where Christ was not named. Whether he ever fulfilled
his purpose of visiting "Spain" is a matter of doubt. Some of the
fathers, Theodoret (on [Phi 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md); [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017).md) among others, say that after he
was released from his captivity when he was brought before Nero, he
passed two years in Spain. If he was imprisoned a "second" time at Rome,
such a visit is not improbable as having taken place "between" the two
imprisonments. But there is no certain evidence of this. Paul probably
projected "many" journeys which were never accomplished.

To be brought on my way ... - To be assisted by you in regard to this
journey; or to be accompanied by you. This was the custom of the
churches; [Act 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md); [Act
17:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014.md); [Act
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038.md); [Act
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005.md); [Co1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006.md), [Co1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011.md); [Jo3
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md).

If first ... - If on my journey, before I go into Spain.

Somewhat - Greek, "In part." As though he could not be "fully" satisfied
with their company, or could not hope to enjoy their society as fully
and as long as he could desire. This is a very tender and delicate
expression.

Filled - This is a strong expression, meaning to be "satisfied," to
enjoy. To be "filled" with a thing is to have great satisfaction and joy
in it.

With your company - Greek, With "you;" meaning in your society. The
expression "to be filled" with one, in the sense of being "gratified,"
is sometimes used in the classic writers. (See "Clarke" on this verse.)

[Romans 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 15:25</span></span>

But now I go ... - I am about to go now. The mention of this intended
journey to Jerusalem is introduced in several other places, and is so
mentioned that Dr. Paley has derived from it a very strong argument for
the genuineness of this Epistle. This intended journey is mentioned in
[Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md), "Paul purposed in the
spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
Jerusalem, saying after I have been there, I must also see Rome;" see
also [Act 20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md). That he "went" to
Jerusalem according to his purpose is recorded in his defense before
Felix [Act 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md), "Now after many
years, I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings."

To minister to the saints - To supply their necessities by bearing the
contribution which the churches have made for them.

[Romans 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 15:26</span></span>

For it hath pleased them of Macedonia - That is, they have done it
"cheerfully" and "voluntarily." See their liberality and cheerfulness
commended by the apostle in [Co2
8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md). Paul had been at much pains to
obtain this collection, but still they did it freely; see [Co2
9:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004.md). It was with reference to this
collection that he directed them to lay by for this purpose as God had
prospered them on the first day of the week; [Co1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md).

Of Macedonia - That is, the Christians in Macedonia - those who had been
Gentiles, and who had been converted to the Christian religion; [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md). Macedonia was a country of
Greece, bounded north by Thrace, south by Thessaly, west by Epirus, and
east by the AEgean sea. It was an extensive region, and was the kingdom
of Philip, and his son Alexander the Great. Its capital was Philippi, at
which place Paul planted a church. A church was also established at
Thessalonica, another city of that country; [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md), etc.; compare [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md); [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md); [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md); [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md), [Th1
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007.md); [Th1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md).

And Achaia - Achaia in the largest sense comprehended "all" ancient
Greece. Achaia Proper, however, was a province of Greece embracing the
western part of the Peloponnesus, of which Corinth was the capital; see
the note at [Act 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012.md). This place is
mentioned as having been concerned in this collection in [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md).

The poor saints ... - The Christians who were in Judea were exposed to
special trials. They were condemned by the sanhedrin, opposed by the
rulers, and persecuted by the people; see [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md), etc.; [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md), etc. Paul sought not only to
relieve them by this contribution, but also to promote fellow-feeling
between them and the Gentile Christians. And "this" circumstance would
tend much to enforce what he had been urging in Rom. 14; 15 on the duty
of kind feeling between the Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity.
Nothing tends so much to wear off prejudice, and to prevent unkind
feeling in regard to others, as to set about some purpose "to do them
good," or to unite "with" them in doing good.

[Romans 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 15:27</span></span>

Their debtors - The reason he immediately states; compare [Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md).

Of their spiritual things - Have received the gospel by the
instrumentality of those who had been Jews; and were admitted now to the
same privileges with them.

Carnal things - Things pertaining to the flesh; that is, to this life.
On this ground the apostle puts the obligation to support the ministers
of the gospel; [Co1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md). It becomes a
matter of "debt" where the hearer of the gospel "receives," in spiritual
blessings, far more than he confers by supporting the ministry. Every
man who contributes his due proportion to support the gospel may receive
far more, in return, in his own peace, edification, and in the order and
happiness of his family, than his money could purchase in any other way.
The "gain" is on his side, and the money is not lost. The minister is
not a beggar; and what is necessary to his support is not almsgiving. He
has an equitable claim - as much as a physician, or a lawyer, or a
teacher of youth has - on the necessaries and comforts of life.

[Romans 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 15:28</span></span>

Have sealed to them - That is, have "secured it" to them. To seal an
instrument of writing, a contract, deed, etc. is to "authenticate it,"
to make it "sure." In this sense it is used here. Paul was going himself
to see that it was placed "securely" in their hands.

This fruit - This result of the liberality of the Gentile churches - the
fruit which their benevolence had produced.

I will come ... - This was Paul's full purpose; but it is not clear that
he ever accomplished it; Note, [Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024.md).

By you - Taking Rome in my way.

[Romans 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 15:29</span></span>

I am sure - Greek, I know; expressing the fullest confidence, a
confidence that was greatly confirmed by the success of his labors
elsewhere.

In the fulness of the blessings ... - This is a Hebrew mode of
expression, where one noun performs the purpose of an adjective, and
means "with a full or abundant blessing." This confidence he, expressed
in other language in [Rom 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md); see
the notes.

Of the gospel of Christ - Which the gospel of Christ is suited to
impart. Thus, every minister of the gospel should wish to go. This
should be his everburning desire in preaching. Paul went to Rome; but he
went in bonds; Acts 27; 28. But though he went in this manner, he was
permitted there to preach the gospel for at least two years, nor can we
doubt that his ministry was attended with the anticipated success; [Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md). God may disappoint us in
regard to the "mode" in which we purpose to do good; but if we really
desire it, he will enable us to do it in "his own way." It "may" be
better to preach the gospel in "bonds" than at liberty; it "is" better
to do it even in a prison, than not at all. Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim's
Progress to amuse his heavy hours during a twelve years' cruel
imprisonment. If he had been at liberty, he probably would not have
written it at all. The great desire of his heart was accomplished, but a
"prison" was the place in which to do it. Paul preached; but preached in
chains.

[Romans 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 15:30</span></span>

For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake - Greek, By or through διά dia our Lord
Jesus Christ; It means probably out of love and regard to him; in order
to promote his honor and glory, and to extend his kingdom among people.
Paul desired to be delivered from the bands of the Jews, that he might
promote the honor of Jesus Christ among the Gentiles.

And for the love of the Spirit - διά dia. By the mutual love and
sympathy which the Spirit of God produces in the minds of all who are
the friends of God. I beseech you now to manifest that love by praying
earnestly for me.

That ye strive together with me - That you unite with me in earnest
prayer. The word "strive" denotes intense "agony" or effort, such as was
used by the wrestlers in the Greek games; and then the "agony," or
strong effort, which a man makes in prayer, who is earnestly desirous to
be heard. The use of the word here denotes Paul's earnest desire that
they should make an "intense" effort in their prayers that he might be
delivered. Christians, though at a distance from each other, may unite
their prayers for a common object. Christians everywhere "should"
wrestle in prayer for the ministers of the gospel, that they may be kept
from temptations; and especially for those who are engaged, as the
apostle was, in arduous efforts among the pagan, that they may be kept
from the many dangers to which they are exposed in their journeying in
pagan lands.

That I may be ... - The unbelieving Jews in Judea had been opposed to
Paul's conversion. They could not forget that he had borne letters of
commission from them to persecute the Christians at Damascus. They
regarded him as an apostate. They had heard of his success among the
Gentiles; and they had been informed that he "taught all the Jews among
the Gentiles to forsake the laws of Moses;" [Act
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md). Hence, the apostle could not
but be aware that in returning to Judea, he exposed himself to special
dangers. His fears, as the result showed, were well founded. They
evinced all the opposition to him which he had ever anticipated; Acts
21.

And that my service - My ministry; or the act of service which I am
going to perform for them; referring to the contribution which he was
bearing for the poor saints at Jerusalem.

For Jerusalem - For the poor Christians in Jerusalem.

May be accepted of the saints - That the poor Christians there may be
willing to receive it. The grounds of "doubt" and "hesitation" whether
they would be willing to receive this, seem to have been two.

\(1\) many, even among Christians, might have had their minds filled
with prejudice against the apostle, from the reports constantly in
circulation among the Jews, that he was opposing and denouncing the
customs of Moses. Hence, in order to satisfy them, when he went up to
Jerusalem, he actually performed a "vow," in accordance with the Law of
Moses, to show that he did not intend to treat his laws with contempt;
[Act 21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#022.md), [Act
21:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md).

\(2\) many of the converts from Judaism might be indisposed to receive
an offering made by "Gentiles." They might have retained many of their
former feelings - that the Gentiles were polluted, and that they ought
to have no fellowship with them. Early opinions and prejudices wear off
by slow degrees. Christians retain former notions long after their
conversion; and often many years are required to teach them enlarged
views of Christian charity. It is not wonderful that the Christians in
Judea should have been slow to learn all the ennobling lessons of
Christian benevolence, surrounded as they were by the institutions of
the Jewish religion, and having been themselves educated in the
strictest regard for those institutions.

[Romans 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 15:32</span></span>

That I may come to you - That I I may not be impeded in my intended
journey by opposition in Judea.

With joy - Joy to myself in being permitted to come; and producing joy
to you by my presence.

By the will of God - If God will; if God permit. After all his desires,
and all their prayers, it still depended on the will of God; and to that
the apostle was desirous to submit. This should be the end of our most
ardent desires, and this the object of all our prayers, that the will of
God should be done; compare [Jam
4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014.md). Paul "did" go by the will of
God; but he went in bonds.

And be refreshed - Greek, May find "rest" or "solace" with you.

[Romans 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 15:33</span></span>

Now the God of peace - God, the author or promoter of peace and union.
In [Rom 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md), he is called the God of
hope. Here the apostle desires that the God who gives peace would impart
to them union of sentiment and feeling, particularly between the Jewish
and Gentile Christians - the great object for which he labored in his
journey to Judea, and which he had been endeavoring to promote
throughout this Epistle; see [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033.md); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md).

This is the close of the doctrinal and hortatory parts of this Epistle.
The remainder is made up chiefly of salutations. In the verses
concluding this chapter, Paul expressed his earnest desire to visit
Rome. He besought his brethren to pray that he might be delivered from
the unbelievers among the Jews. His main desire was granted. He was
permitted to visit Rome; yet the very thing from which he sought to be
delivered, the very opposition of the Jews, made it necessary for him to
appeal to Caesar, and this was the means of his accomplishing his
desire. (See the closing chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.) God thus
often grants our "main desire;" he hears our prayer; but he may make use
of that from which we pray to be delivered as the "means" of fulfilling
our own requests. The Christian prays that he may be sanctified; yet at
the same time he may pray to be delivered from affliction. God will hear
his main desire, to be made holy; will convert what he fears into a
blessing, and make it the means of accomplishing the great end. It is
right to express our "desires - all" our desires - to God; but it should
be with a willingness that he should choose his own means to accomplish
the object of our wishes. Provided the "God of peace" is with us, all is
well.
