### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 17:1</span></span>

This night - The night of the day on which David fled, and Absalom
entered into Jerusalem. Ahithophel's idea was to fall upon David by
surprise, and in the first confusion of the surprised army to seize and
kill David only.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 17:3</span></span>

The man whom thou seekest - namely, David. Ahithophel means to say: "If
I can only smite David, there will be no civil war, all the people will
peaceably submit."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 17:7</span></span>

At this time - Rather, "The counsel which Ahithophel has given this time
is not good." He contrasts it with that given before [Sa2
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021.md), which was good. This gave an
appearance of candour to his conduct, and so gave weight to his dissent.
Observe the working of David's prayer [Sa2
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 17:9</span></span>

Some pit, or in some other place - The Hebrew has "in one of the pits,"
or "in one of the places." Hence, "place" must have some defined
meaning. It probably is used here, as elsewhere, for a "dwelling-house"
or "village," which might in that district be fortified houses [Sa2
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#012.md); [Sa1
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025.md).

Hushai's argument is that there was no chance of seizing David by
surprise as Ahithophel suggested. There was sure to be sharp fighting,
and the terror of the names of David, Joab, Abishai, Ittai, and their
companions, would magnify the first few blows received into a victory,
and Absalom's men would flee in panic. It is likely that Absalom was not
a man of courage, and Hushai, knowing this, adroitly magnified the
terror of the warlike prowess of David and his mighty men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 17:12</span></span>

As the dew - Like the drops of dew, in the vast number of our host, and
in our irresistible and unavoidable descent upon our enemies.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 17:16</span></span>

Hushai, like a wise and prudent man, knowing, too, Absalom's weak and
fickle character, would not depend upon the resolution, taken at his
instigation, not to pursue the king, but took instant measures to
advertise David of his danger.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 17:17</span></span>

En-rogel - See the marginal reference.

A wench - Hebrew "the maid servant," namely, of the high priest, either
Zadok or Abiathar, or possibly one employed in some service in the
temple courts. ([Sa1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022) note..md)

And they went and told king David - As related afterward [Sa2
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#021.md). Here mentioned by anticipation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 17:18</span></span>

Bahurim - See the marginal reference. They were not all Shimeis in
Bahurim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 17:19</span></span>

A covering - Hebrew "the covering," perhaps "the hanging" or "awning" at
the door of the house, as the word seems to mean when spoken of the
tabernacle.

Ground corn - Or "peeled barley," which she spread out as if for the
purpose of drying it in the sun.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 17:20</span></span>

As soon as ever she had hid the men she went into the house, as if busy
about her usual occupations. Had Absalom's servants, who had had
information from some of the people of Bahurim that the men had come to
this house, found her in the court it might have directed their
attention to the peeled barley.

Over the brook of water - Compare [Sa2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md) note. The word for "brook"
("Michal") occurs only here. One has been found in this very district,
still so called. The woman showed great presence of mind and adroitness
in not denying that they had been there.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 17:23</span></span>

To his city - To Giloh (marginal reference). Ahithophel was probably
influenced by deep mortification at the slight put upon him by rejecting
his counsel. He is a memorable example of the impotence of worldly
wisdom. Compare the marginal reference.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 17:24</span></span>

Mahanaim - See [Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md). The same
reasons which induced Abner to choose it for Ishbosheth probablv made it
a good rallying point for David. It was a strong city, in a
well-provisioned country, with a mountainous district for retreat in
case of need, and with a warlike and friendly population.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 17:25</span></span>

Ithra an Israelite - Or "Jether the Ishmeelite" [Ch1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017.md). "Ithra" and "Jether" are
practically the same names. "Israelite" in the text is wrong. It should
be either "Ishmaelite" or "Jezreelite" [Sa2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002.md).

Abigail the daughter of Nahash - If Zeruiah and Abigail were Jesse's
daughters, the only probable way of reconciling our text with [Ch1
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#016.md), is to suppose that Nahash was
Jesse's wife. If Zeruiah and Abigail were only sisters of David by the
mother, then Nahash might be the name of her first husband.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 17:27</span></span>

Shobi's father may have been the king of the Ammonites, and Shobi
appointed by David as tributary king or governor of Ammon after he took
Rabbah [Sa2 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#029.md). On the other hand,
Nahash may have been a common name among the Ammonites, and the Nahash
of [Sa2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025.md) may have been of that
nation.

On Machir, see the marginal reference.

Barzillai was ancestor, through a daughter, to a family of priests, who
were called after him "sons of Barzillai," and who returned from
captivity with Zerubbabel, but were not allowed to officiate as priests,
or eat of the holy things, through defect of a proper register [Ezr
2:61-63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#061.md). It is likely that being
wealthy they had neglected their priestly privileges, as a means of
maintenance, before the captivity.

Rogelim was situated in the highlands of Gilead, but the exact situation
is not known. It means "the fullers," being the plural of the word
"Rogel," in "En-Rogel," [Sa2 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#017.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 17:29</span></span>

Cheese of kine - Or, as others, "milch cows," which is more in
accordance with the context, being coupled with "sheep," and is more or
less borne out etymologically by the Arabic. God's care for David was
evident in the kindness of these people.
