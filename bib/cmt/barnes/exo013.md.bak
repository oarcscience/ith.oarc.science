### [Exodus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 13:2</span></span>

Sanctify unto me - The command is addressed to Moses. It was to declare
the will of God that all firstborn were to be consecrated to Him, set
apart from all other creatures. The command is expressly based upon the
Passover. The firstborn exempt from the destruction became in a new and
special sense the exclusive property of the Lord: the firstborn of man
as His ministers, the firstborn of cattle as victims. In lieu of the
firstborn of men the Levites were devoted to the temple services.

[Exodus 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 13:4</span></span>

Abib - April. Compare [Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002.md). It is
uncertain whether this name was ancient or given then for the first
time. It is found only in the Pentateuch, six times as the name of the
first month, twice in the sense of young wheat, hence its etymology,
namely, the month when the wheat began to ripen. The name resembles the
Egyptian Epiphi, and may possibly have been derived from it.

[Exodus 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 13:5</span></span>

The Canaanites - Five nations only are named in this passage, whereas
six are named in [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), and ten in
the original promise to Abraham, [Gen
15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md). The first word "Canaanite"
is generic, and includes all the Hamite races of Palestine.

[Exodus 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 13:9</span></span>

Hebrew writers have generally regarded this as a formal injunction to
write the precepts on slips of parchment, and to fasten them on the
wrists and forehead; but other commentators are generally agreed that it
is to be understood metaphorically. The words appear to be put into the
mouths of the parents. They were to keep all the facts of the Passover
constantly in mind, and, referring to a custom prevalent ages before
Moses in Egypt, to have them present as though they were inscribed on
papyrus or parchment fastened on the wrists, or on the face between the
eyes. If, as may be inferred from [Deu
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md), Moses adopted this custom, he
would take care to warn the people against the Egyptian superstition of
amulets. Modern Israelites generally allege this precept as a
justification for the use of phylacteries.

[Exodus 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 13:13</span></span>

An ass - The ass could not be offered in sacrifice, being an unclean
animal: possibly the only unclean animal domesticated among the
Israelites at the time of the Exodus. This principle was extended to
every unclean beast; see [Num 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015.md).

Thou shalt redeem - The lamb, or sheep, was given to the priest for the
service of the sanctuary.

Firstborn of man - The price of redemption was fixed at five shekels of
the sanctuary: [Num 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#047.md), where see
the note.

[Exodus 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 13:18</span></span>

Harnessed - More probably, "marshalled" or "in orderly array." There is
not the least indication that the Israelites had been disarmed by the
Egyptians, and as occupying a frontier district frequently assailed by
the nomads of the desert they would of necessity be accustomed to the
use of arms. Compare [Exo 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 13:20</span></span>

Etham - The house or "sanctuary of Tum" (the Sun God worshipped
especially by that name in Lower Egypt), was in the immediate vicinity
of Heliopolis, called by the Egyptians the fortress of Zar, or Zalu (i.
e. of foreigners); the frontier city where the Pharaohs of the 18th
dynasty reviewed their forces when about to enter upon a campaign on
Syria. The name Pithom (see [Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011).md)
has precisely the same meaning with Etham, and may possibly be
identified with it.

[Exodus 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 13:21</span></span>

Pillar of cloud - The Lord Himself did for the Israelites by
preternatural means that which armies were obliged to do for themselves
by natural agents. The Persians and Greeks used fire and smoke as
signals in their marches, and in a well-known papyrus, the commander of
an Egyptian expedition is called "A flame in the darkness at the head of
his soldiers." By this sign then of the pillar of cloud, the Lord showed
Himself as their leader and general [Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md), [Exo
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md).
