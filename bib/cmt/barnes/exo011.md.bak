### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

The Lord said - Or "the Lord had said." The first three verses of this
chapter are parenthetical. Before Moses relates the last warning given
to Pharaoh, he feels it right to recall to his readers' minds the
revelation and command which had been previously given to him by the
Lord.

When he shall let you go ... - When at last he lets you depart with
children, flocks, herds, and all your possessions, he will compel you to
depart in haste. Moses was already aware that the last plague would be
followed by an immediate departure, and, therefore, measures had
probably been taken to prepare the Israelites for the journey. In fact,
on each occasion when Pharaoh relented for a season, immediate orders
would of course be issued by Moses to the heads of the people, who were
thus repeatedly brought into a state of more or less complete
organization for the final movement.

[Exodus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 11:2</span></span>

Every man - In [Exo 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md) only women
were named; the command is more explicit when the time has come for its
execution.

Borrow - "ask." See [Exo 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md) note.

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

And Moses said - The following words must be read in immediate
connection with the last verse of the preceding chapter.

About midnight - This marks the hour, but not the day, on which the
visitation would take place. There may have been, and probably was, an
interval of some days, during which preparations might be made both for
the celebration of the Passover, and the departure of the Israelites.

[Exodus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 11:5</span></span>

Two points are to be noticed:

1\. The extent of the visitation: the whole land suffers in the persons
of its firstborn, not merely for the guilt of the sovereign, but for the
actual participation of the people in the crime of infanticide [Exo
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md).

2\. The limitation: Pharaoh's command had been to slay ALL the male
children of the Israelites, but only one child in each Egyptian family
was to die. If Tothmosis II was the Pharaoh, the visitation fell with
special severity on his family. He left no son, but was succeeded by his
widow.

The mill - This consisted of two circular stones, one fixed in the
ground, the other turned by a handle. The work of grinding was extremely
laborious, and performed by women of the lowest rank.

Firstborn of beasts - This visitation has a special force in reference
to the worship of beasts, which was universal in Egypt; each district
having its own sacred animal, adored as a manifestation or
representative of the local tutelary deity.

[Exodus 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 11:7</span></span>

Shall not a dog move his tongue - A proverb expressive of freedom from
alarm and immunity front assault.
