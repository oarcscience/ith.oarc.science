### [Judges Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#001.md)

[Judges 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 14:1</span></span>

Timnath - See [Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md) and note. It
was below Zorah [Jdg 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md), about three
miles S. W. of it.

[Judges 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 14:2</span></span>

Get her for me - namely, by Paying the requisite dowry (see marginal
references) and gifts to relations. Hence, the frequent mention of
parents taking wives for their sons [Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016.md); [Neh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#030.md), because the parents of the
bridegroom conducted the negotiation, and paid the dower to the parents
of the bride.

[Judges 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 14:3</span></span>

The uncircumcised Philistines - Compare [Sa1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md); [Sa1
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md); [Sa1
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004.md), for a similar use of the term as
one of reproach. Also [Act 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#003.md).

[Judges 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 14:4</span></span>

His father and mother very properly opposed Samson's marriage with a
Pagan woman, the daughter of the oppressors of his race. But they could
not prevail, because it was the secret purpose of God by these means to
"seek occasion" against the Philistines; i. e. to make the misconduct of
the father of Samson's wife, which He foresaw, the occasion of
destruction to the Philistines. Compare the marginal references for
similar statements.

[Judges 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 14:8</span></span>

The formal dowry and gifts having been given by Samson's father, an
interval, varying according to the Oriental custom, from a few days to a
full year, elapsed between the betrothal and the wedding, during which
the bride lived with her friends. Then came the essential part of the
marriage ceremony, namely, the removal of the bride from her father's
house to that of the bridegroom or his father.

The carcase of the lion - The lion, slain by him a year or some months
before, had now become a mere skeleton, fit for bees to swarm into. It
was a universal notion among the ancients that bees were generated from
the carcass of an ox.

[Judges 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 14:10</span></span>

Made a feast ... - This was the wedding-feast, protracted in this
instance seven days, in that of Tobias (Tobit 8:19) fourteen days. It
was an essential part of the marriage ceremony [Gen
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#022.md); [Est
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018.md); [Mat
22:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md), [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md).

[Judges 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 14:11</span></span>

Thirty companions - These were "the children of the bride-chamber" ([Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md); see [Jdg
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#020).md). From the number of them it may
be inferred that Samson's family was of some wealth and importance.

[Judges 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 14:12</span></span>

See the marginal references. Riddles formed one of the amusements of
these protracted feasts.

Sheets - Rather "linen shirts;" the "garments" which follow are the
outward garments worn by the Orientals.

[Judges 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 14:14</span></span>

Three days ... on the seventh day - Proposed alterations, such as "six
days ... on the fourth day," are unnecessary if it be remembered that
the narrator passes on first to the seventh day (at [Jdg
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015).md), and then goes back at [Jdg
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#016.md) and beginning of [Jdg
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md) to what happened on the 4th,
5th, and 6th days.

To take that we have - See the margin. They affirm that they were only
invited to the wedding for the sake of plundering them by means of this
riddle, and if Samson's wife was a party to plundering her own
countrymen, she should suffer for it.

[Judges 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 14:18</span></span>

They try to give the answer in a way to make it appear that they had
guessed it. Samson saw at once that she had betrayed him. He lets them
know in a speech, which was of the nature of a riddle, that he had
discovered the treachery.

[Judges 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 14:20</span></span>

His companion - Perhaps one of those mentioned in [Jdg
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#011.md). The transaction denotes loose
notions of the sanctity of marriage among the Philistines. It should be
noted carefully that the practical lesson against ungodly marriages
comes out most strongly in this case and that the providential purpose
which out of this evil brought discomfiture to the Philistines, has
nothing to do with the right or wrong of Samson's conduct.
