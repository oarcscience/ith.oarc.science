### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

The establishment thereof - literally, "the faithfulness thereof" or, in
other words, "after these things had been faithfully accomplished."

[Ch2 32:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md) form a passage
supplementary to [Kg2 18:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 32:3</span></span>

To stop the waters ... - Compare [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md). Hezekiah's object was probably
twofold - to hide the springs outside the city in order to distress the
Assyrians, and to convey their water underground into the city, in order
to increase his own supply during the siege.

[2 Chronicles 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 32:4</span></span>

The "brook" intended is probably not the Kidron, but the natural
water-course of the Gihon, which ran down the Tyropoeon valley (compare
the [Kg1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#003) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 32:5</span></span>

The breaches in the wall of Jerusalem were not entirely due to the old
hostility of Joash (marginal reference); but may have been caused either
by neglect and carelessness in the reign of Ahaz 2 Chr. 28, or by the
simple process of natural decay. Hezekiah pulled down houses for the
purpose of his repairs [Isa 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#010.md).

On Millo, see the marginal references notes.

[2 Chronicles 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 32:6</span></span>

The street of the gate ... - Or, "the square at the gate" (compare [Ch2
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#004) note.md). The gate intended is
probably that of Ephraim [Ch2 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023.md) -
the great northern gate, opposite the "Camp of the Assyrians " -
represented by the modern Damascus gate.

[2 Chronicles 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 32:7</span></span>

On the language, compare the marginal references, for details, see [Isa
22:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005.md); [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 32:8</span></span>

The faith, which Hezekiah's words express, presently wavered, died away,
and was succeeded by despair and submission (compare [Kg2
18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014) notes.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 32:9</span></span>

The author of Chronicles compresses into 13 verses the history which
occupies in Kings a chapter and a half ([Kg2
18:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017); where see the notes.md).

[Ch2 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#010.md)

In the siege - Perhaps "in straitness" (compare [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009).md). Jerusalem is thought by some to
have been not so much besieged at this time, as distressed and
straitened for supplies, because the Assyrians were masters of the open
country.

[Ch2 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#013.md)

fathers - i. e. "predecessors." Sennacherib really belonged to a dynasty
that had only furnished one king before himself.

[Ch2 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022.md)

Guided them ... - A slight alteration of the existing text gives the
sense - "gave them rest round about;" a common expression in Chronicles
[Ch2 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015.md); [Ch2
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#030.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

Compare 2 Kings 20 and notes. The "sign" is not (as in the margin) the
miraculous cure, but the going back of the shadow on the dial of Ahaz
(see [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031).md).

[2 Chronicles 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 32:25</span></span>

His heart was lifted up - Compare the marginal reference. Hezekiah's
pride was shown in his unnecessarily exhibiting his treasures to the
ambassadors from Babylon (see [Kg2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013).md).

There was wrath upon him - Compare [Kg2
20:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 32:26</span></span>

Hezekiah humbled himself - Perhaps this is the self-humiliation of which
Jeremiah speaks (marginal reference) as following on a certain prophecy
uttered by Micah. The prophecy [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md) is by some referred to the
earlier part of the reign of Hezekiah; but there is nothing to show that
it was not delivered about this time.

[2 Chronicles 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch2 32:30</span></span>

See [Ch2 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md) note. Either then or
afterward, Hezekiah conducted the water of this spring by an underground
channel down the Tyropoeon valley to a pool or reservoir (marginal
reference).

[2 Chronicles 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch2 32:32</span></span>

And in the book - The "and" is not in the original. The meaning is, that
the acts were recorded in the prophecy of Isaiah, which formed a part of
the compilation known as "the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
See Introduction.

[2 Chronicles 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 32:33</span></span>

The chiefest of the sepulchres - Most modern commentators render - "on
the ascent to the sepulchres;" but some think that an excavation above
all the other tombs - in the same repository, but at a higher level (see
the margin) - is intended. The catacomb of David was full; and the later
princes had sepulchres quite distinct from the old burial-place (see
[Ch2 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#020.md); [Kg2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#018.md), [Kg2
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#026.md); [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030).md).
