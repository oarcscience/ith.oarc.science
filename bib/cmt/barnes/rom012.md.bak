### [Romans Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md)

[Romans 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 12:1</span></span>

I beseech you - The apostle, having finished the argument of this
Epistle, proceeds now to close it with a practical or hortatory
application, showing its bearing on the duties of life, and the
practical influence of religion. None of the doctrines of the gospel are
designed to be cold and barren speculations. They bear on the hearts and
lives of people; and the apostle therefore calls on those to whom he
wrote to dedicate themselves without reserve unto God.

Therefore - As the effect or result of the argument or doctrine. In
other words, the whole argument of the eleven first chapters is suited
to show the obligation on us to devote ourselves to God. From
expressions like these, it is clear that the apostle never supposed that
the tendency of the doctrines of grace was to lead to licentiousness.
Many have affirmed that such was the tendency of the doctrines of
justification by faith, of election and decrees, and of the perseverance
of the saints. But it is plain that Paul had no such apprehensions.
After having fully stated and established those doctrines, he concludes
that we ought therefore to lead holy lives, and on the ground of them he
exhorts people to do it.

By the mercies of God - The word "by" διὰ dia denotes here the reason
why they should do it, or the ground of appeal. So great had been the
mercy of God, that this constituted a reason why they should present
their bodies, etc. see [Co1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); [Rom
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030.md). The word "mercies" here denotes
favor shown to the undeserving, or kindness, compassion, etc. The plural
is used in imitation of the Hebrew word for mercy, which has no
singular. The word is not often used in the New Testament; see [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md), where God is called "the Father
of mercies;" [Phi 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md); [Heb
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md). The particular mercy to which
the apostle here refers, is that shown to those whom he was addressing.
He had proved that all were by nature under sin; that they had no claim
on God; and that he had showed great compassion in giving his Son to die
for them in this state, and in pardoning their sins. This was a ground
or reason why they should devote themselves to God.

That ye present - The word used here commonly denotes the action of
bringing and presenting an animal or other sacrifice before an altar. It
implies that the action was a free and voluntary offering. Religion is
free; and the act of devoting ourselves to God is one of the most free
that we ever perform.

Your bodies - The bodies of animals were offered in sacrifice. The
apostle specifies their bodies particularly in reference to that fact.
Still the entire animal was devoted; and Paul evidently meant here the
same as to say, present Yourselves, your entire person, to the service
of God; compare [Co1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md); [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md). It was not customary or proper to
speak of a sacrifice as an offering of a soul or spirit, in the common
language of the Jews; and hence, the apostle applied their customary
language of sacrifice to the offering which Christians were to make of
themselves to God.

A living sacrifice - A sacrifice is an offering made to God as an
atonement for sin; or any offering made to him and his service as an
expression of thanksgiving or homage. It implies that he who offers it
presents it entirely, releases all claim or right to it, and leaves it
to be disposed of for the honor of God. In the case of an animal, it was
slain, and the blood offered; in the case of any other offering, as the
first-fruits, etc., it was set apart to the service of God; and he who
offered it released all claim on it, and submitted it to God, to be
disposed of at his will. This is the offering which the apostle entreats
the Romans to make: to devote themselves to God, as if they had no
longer any claim on themselves; to be disposed of by him; to suffer and
bear all that he might appoint; and to promote his honor in any way
which he might command. This is the nature of true religion.

Living - ζῶσυν zōsun. The expression probably means that they were to
devote the vigorous, active powers of their bodies and souls to the
service of God. The Jew offered his victim, slew it, and presented it
dead. It could not be presented again. In opposition to this, we are to
present ourselves with all our living, vital energies. Christianity does
not require a service of death or inactivity. It demands vigorous and
active powers in the service of God the Saviour. There is something very
affecting in the view of such a sacrifice; in regarding life, with all
its energies, its intellectual, and moral, and physical powers, as one
long sacrifice; one continued offering unto God. An immortal being
presented to him; presented voluntarily, with all his energies, from day
to day, until life shall close, so that it may he said that he has lived
and died an offering made freely unto God. This is religion.

Holy - This means properly without blemish or defect. No other sacrifice
could be made to God. The Jews were expressly forbid to offer what was
lame, or blind, or in anyway deformed; [Deu
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021.md); [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md), [Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md); [Lev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md); [Lev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#020.md); [Deu
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md); compare [Mal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008.md). If offered without any of these
defects, it was regarded as holy, that is, appropriately set apart, or
consecrated to God. In like manner we are to consecrate to God our best
faculties; the vigor of our minds, and talents, and time. Not the
feebleness of sickness merely; not old age alone; not time which we
cannot otherwise employ, but the first vigor and energies of the mind
and body; our youth, and health, and strength. Our sacrifice to God is
to be not divided, separate; but it is to be entire and complete. Many
are expecting to be Christians in sickness; many in old age; thus
purposing to offer unto him the blind and the lame. The sacrifice is to
be free from sin. It is not to be a divided, and broken, and polluted
service. It is to be with the best affections of our hearts and lives.

Acceptable unto God - They are exhorted to offer such a sacrifice as
will be acceptable to God; that is, such a one as he had just specified,
one that was living and holy. No sacrifice should be made which is not
acceptable to God. The offerings of the pagan; the pilgrimages of the
Muslims; the self-inflicted penalties of the Roman Catholics,
uncommanded by God, cannot be acceptable to him. Those services will be
acceptable to God, and those only, which he appoints; compare [Col
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md). People are not to invent
services; or to make crosses; or to seek persecutions and trials; or to
provoke opposition. They are to do just what God requires of them, and
that will be acceptable to God. And this fact, that what we do is
acceptable to God, is the highest recompense we can have. It matters
little what people think of us, if God approves what we do. To please
him should be our highest aim; the fact that we do please him is our
highest reward.

Which is your reasonable service - The word rendered "service" λατρείαν
latreian properly denotes worship, or the homage rendered to God. The
word "reasonable" with us means what is "governed by reason; thinking,
speaking, or acting conformably to the dictates of reason" (Webster); or
what can be shown to be rational or proper. This does not express the
meaning of the original. That word λογικὴν logikēn denotes what pertains
to the mind, and a reasonable service means what is mental, or
pertaining to reason. It stands opposed, nor to what is foolish or
unreasonable, but to the external service of the Jews, and such as they
relied on for salvation. The worship of the Christian is what pertains
to the mind, or is spiritual; that of the Jew was external. Chrysostom
renders this phrase "your spiritual ministry." The Syriac, "That ye
present your bodies, etc., by a rational ministry."

We may learn from this verse,

\(1\) That the proper worship of God is the free homage of the mind. It
is not forced or constrained. The offering of ourselves should be
voluntary. No other can be a true offering, and none other can be
acceptable.

\(2\) we are to offer our entire selves, all that we have and are, to
God. No other offering can be such as he will approve.

\(3\) the character of God is such as should lead us to that. It is a
character of mercy; of long-continued and patient forbearance, and it
should influence us to devote ourselves to him.

\(4\) it should be done without delay. God is as worthy of such service
now as he ever will or can be. He has every possible claim on our
affections and our hearts.

[Romans 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 12:2</span></span>

And be not conformed ... - The word rendered "conformed" properly means
to put on the form, fashion, or appearance of another. It may refer to
anything pertaining to the habit, manner, dress, style of living, etc.,
of others.

Of this world - τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ tō aiōni toutō. The word which is
commonly rendered "world," when applied to the material universe, is
κόσμος kosmos, "cosmos." The word used here properly denotes an age, or
generation of people. It may denote a particular generation, or it may
be applied to the race. It is sometimes used in each of these senses.
Thus, here it may mean that Christians should not conform to the maxims,
habits, feelings, etc., of a wicked, luxurious, and idolatrous age, but
should be conformed solely to the precepts and laws of the gospel; or
the same principle may be extended to every age, and the direction may
be, that Christians should not conform to the prevailing habits, style,
and manners of the world, the people who know not God. They are to be
governed by the laws of the Bible; to fashion their lives after the
example of Christ; and to form themselves by principles different from
those which prevail in the world. In the application of this rule there
is much difficulty. Many may think that they are not conformed to the
world, while they can easily perceive that their neighbor is. They
indulge in many things which others may think to be conformity to the
world, and are opposed to many things which others think innocent. The
design of this passage is doubtless to produce a spirit that should not
find pleasure in the pomp and vanity of the World; and which will regard
all vain amusements and gaieties with disgust, and lead the mind to find
pleasure in better things.

Be ye transformed - The word from which the expression here is derived
means "form, habit" μορφή morphē. The direction is, "put on another
form, change the form of the world for that of Christianity." This word
would properly refer to the external appearance, but the expression
which the apostle immediately uses, "renewing of the mind,." shows that
he did not intend to use it with reference to that only, but to the
charge of the whole man. The meaning is, do not cherish a spirit.
devoted to the world, following its vain fashions and pleasures, but
cultivate a spirit attached to God, and his kingdom and cause.

By the renewing - By the making new; the changing into new views and
feelings. The Christian is often represented as a new creature; [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); [Gal
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015.md); [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md).

Your mind - The word translated "mind" properly denotes intellect, as
distinguished from the will and affections. But here it seems to be used
as applicable to the whole spirit as distinguished from the body,
including the understanding, will, and affections. As if he had said,
Let not this change appertain to the body only, but to the soul. Let it
not be a mere external conformity, but let it have its seat in the
spirit. All external changes, if the mind was not changed, would be
useless, or would be hypocrisy. Christianity seeks to reign in the soul;
and having its seat there, the external conduct and habits will be
regulated accordingly.

That ye may prove - The word used here δοκιμάζω dokimazō is commonly
applied to metals, to the operation of testing, or trying them by the
severity of fire, etc. Hence, it also means to explore, investigate,
ascertain. This is its meaning here. The sense is, that such a renewed
mind is essential to a successful inquiry after the will of God. Having
a disposition to obey him, the mind will be prepared to understand his
precepts. There will be a correspondence between the feelings of the
heart and his will; a nice tact or taste, which will admit his laws, and
see the propriety and beauty of his commands. A renewed heart is the
best preparation for studying Christianity; as a man who is temperate is
the best suited to understand the arguments for temperance; the man who
is chaste, has most clearly and forcibly the arguments for chastity,
etc. A heart in love with the fashions and follies of the world is
ill-suited to appreciate the arguments for humility, prayer, etc. "If
any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of
God," [Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md). The reason why the
heart is renewed is that we may do the will of God: the heart that is
renewed is best suited to appreciate and understand his will.

That good ... - This part of the verse might be rendered, that ye may
investigate the will of God, or ascertain the Will of God, what is good,
and perfect, and acceptable. The will of God relates to his commands in
regard to our conduct, his doctrines in regard to our belief, his
providential dealings in relation to our external circumstances. It
means what God demands of us, in whatever way it may be made known. They
do not err from his ways who seek his guidance, and who, not confiding
in their own wisdom, but in God, commit their way to him. "The meek will
he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way," [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md). The word "good" here is not an
adjective agreeing with "will," but a noun. "That ye may find the will
of God, what is good and acceptable." It implies that that thing which
is good is his will; or that we may find his will by finding what is
good and perfect. That is good which promotes the honor of God and the
interests of his universe.

Perfect - Free from defect, stain, or injury. That which has all its
parts complete, or which is not disproportionate. Applied to religion,
it means what is consistent, which is carried out; which is evinced in
all the circumstances and reactions of life.

Acceptable - That which will be pleasing to God. or which he will
approve. There is scarcely a more difficult text in the Bible than this,
or one that is more full of meaning. It involves the main duty of
religion to be separated from the world; and expresses the way in which
that duty may be performed, and in which we may live so as to ascertain
and do the will of God. If all Christians would obey this, religion
would be everywhere honored. If all would separate from the vices and
follies, the amusements and gaieties of the world, Christ would be
glorified. If all were truly renewed in their minds, they would lose
their relish for such things, and seeking only to do the will of God,
they would not be slow to find it.

[Romans 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 12:3</span></span>

For I say - The word "for" shows that the apostle is about to introduce
some additional considerations to enforce what he had just said, or to
show how we may evince a mind that is not conformed to the world.

Through the grace - Through the favor, or in virtue of the favor of the
apostolic office. By the authority that is conferred on me to declare
the will of God as an apostle; see the note at [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md); see also [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md), [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md); [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md).

Not to think ... - Not to over-estimate himself, or to think more of
himself than he ought to. What is the true standard by which we ought to
estimate ourselves he immediately adds. This is a caution against pride;
and an exhortation not to judge of ourselves by our talents, wealth, or
function, but to form another standard of judging of ourselves, by our
Christian character. The Romans would probably be in much danger from
this quarter. The prevailing habit of judging among them was according
to rank, or wealth, or eloquence, or function. While this habit of
judging prevailed in the world around them, there was danger that it
might also prevail in the church. And the exhortation was that they
should not judge of their own characters by the usual modes among
people, but by their Christian attainments. There is no sin to which
people are more prone than an inordinate self-valuation and pride.
Instead of judging by what constitutes true excellence of character,
they pride themselves on that which is of no intrinsic value; on rank,
and titles, and external accomplishments; or on talents, learning, or
wealth. The only true standard of character pertains to the principles
of action, or to that which constitutes the moral nature of the man; and
to that the apostle calls the Roman people.

But to think soberly - Literally, "to think so as to act soberly or
wisely." So to estimate ourselves as to act or demean ourselves wisely,
prudently, modestly. Those who over-estimate themselves are proud,
haughty, foolish in their deportment. Those who think of themselves as
they ought, are modest, sober, prudent. There is no way to maintain a
wise and proper conduct so certain, as to form a humble and modest
estimate of our own character.

According as God hath dealt - As God has measured to each one, or
apportioned to each one. In this place the faith which Christians have,
is traced to God as its giver. This act, that God has given it, will be
itself one of the most effectual promoters of humility and right
feeling. People commonly regard the objects on which they pride
themselves as things of their own creation, or as depending on
themselves. But let an object be regarded as the gift of God, and it
ceases to excite pride, and the feeling is at once changed into
gratitude. He, therefore, who regards God as the source of all
blessings, and he only, will be an humble man.

The measure of faith - The word "faith" here is evidently put for
religion, or Christianity. Faith is a main thing in religion. It
constitutes its first demand, and the Christian religion, therefore, is
characterized by its faith, or its confidence, in God; see [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md); compare Heb. 11; Rom. 4. We are
not, therefore, to be elated in our view of ourselves; we are not to
judge of our own characters by wealth, or talent, or learning, but by
our attachment to God, and by the influence of faith on our minds. The
meaning is, judge yourselves, or estimate yourselves, by your piety. The
propriety of this rule is apparent:

\(1\) Because no other standard is a correct one, or one of value. Our
talent, learning, rank, or wealth, is a very improper rule by which to
estimate ourselves. All may be wholly unconnected with moral worth; and
the worst as well as the best people may possess them.

\(2\) God will judge us in the day of judgment by our attachment to
Christ and his cause Matt. 25; and that is the true standard by which to
estimate ourselves here.

\(3\) nothing else will secure and promote humility but this. All other
things may produce or promote pride, but this will effectually secure
humility. The fact that God has given all that we have; the fact that
the poor and obscure may have as true an elevation of character as
ourselves; the consciousness of our own imperfections and short-comings
in the Christian faith; and the certainty that we are soon to be
arraigned to try this great question, whether we have evidence that we
are the friends of God; will all tend to promote humbleness of mind and
to bring down our usual inordinate self-estimation. If all Christians
judged themselves in this way, it would remove at once no small part of
the pride of station and of life from the world, and would produce deep
attachment for those who are blessed with the faith of the gospel,
though they may be unadorned by any of the wealth or trappings which now
promote pride and distinctions among men.

[Romans 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 12:4</span></span>

For - This word here denotes a further illustration or proof of what he
had just before said. The duty to which he was exhorting the Romans was,
not to be unduly exalted or elevated in their own estimation. In order
to produce proper humility, he shows them that God has appointed certain
orders or grades in the church; that all are useful in their proper
place; that we should seek to discharge our duty in our appropriate
sphere; and thus that due subordination and order would be observed. To
show this, he introduces a beautiful comparison drawn from the human
body. There are various members in the human frame; all useful and
honorable in their proper place; and all designed to promote the order,
and beauty, and harmony of the whole. So the church is one body,
consisting of many members, and each is suited to be useful and comely
in its proper place. The same comparison he uses with great beauty and
force in 1Co. 12:4-31; also [Eph 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md);
[Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md). In that chapter the
comparison is carried out to much greater length, and its influence
shown with great force.

Many members - Limbs, or parts; feet, hands, eyes, ears, etc.; [Co1
12:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014.md).

In one body - Constituting one body; or united in one, and making one
person. Essential to the existence, beauty, and happiness of the one
body or person.

The same office - The same use or design; not all appointed for the same
thing; one is to see, another to hear, a third to walk with, etc.; [Co1
12:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014.md).

[Romans 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 12:5</span></span>

So we, being many - We who are Christians, and who are numerous as
individuals.

Are one body - Are united together, constituting one society, or one
people, mutually dependent, and having the same great interests at
heart, though to be promoted by us according to our special talents and
opportunities. As the welfare of the same body is to be promoted in one
manner by the feet, in another by the eye, etc.; so the welfare of the
body of Christ is to be promoted by discharging our duties in our
appropriate sphere, as God has appointed us.

In Christ - One body, joined to Christ, or connected with him as the
head; [Eph 1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md), "And gave him to
be head over all things to the church, which is his body;" compare [Joh
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md). This does not mean that there
is any physical or literal union, or any destruction of personal
identity, or any thing particularly mysterious or unintelligible.
Christians acknowledge him as their head. that is, their Lawgiver; their
Counsellor, Guide, and Redeemer. They are bound to him by especially
tender ties of affection, gratitude, and friendship; they are united in
him, that is, in acknowledging him as their common Lord and Saviour. Any
other unions than this is impossible; and the sacred writers never
intended that expressions like these should be explained literally. The
union of Christians to Christ is the most tender and interesting of any
in this world, but no more mysterious than what binds friend to friend,
children to parents, or husbands to their wives; compare [Eph
5:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md). (See the supplementary note
at [Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)..md)

And every one members one of another - Compare [Co1
12:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025.md). That is, we are so united as
to be mutually dependent; each one is of service to the other; and the
existence and function of the one is necessary to the usefulness of the
other. Thus, the members of the body may be said to be members one of
another; as the feet could not, for example, perform their functions or
be of use if it were not for the eye; the ear, the hand, the teeth,
etc., would be useless if it were not for the other members, which go to
make up the entire person. Thus, in the church, every individual is not
only necessary in his place as an individual, but is needful to the
proper symmetry and action of the whole. And we may learn here:

\(1\) That no member of the church of Christ should esteem himself to be
of no importance. In his own place he may be of as much consequence as
the man of learning, wealth, and talent may be in his.

\(2\) God designed that there should be differences of endowments of
nature and of grace in the church; just as it was needful that there
should be differences in the members of the human body.

\(3\) no one should despise or lightly esteem another. All are
necessary. We can no more spare the foot or the hand than we can the
eye; though the latter may be much more curious and striking as a proof
of divine skill. We do not despise the hand or the foot any more than we
do the eye; and in all we should acknowledge the goodness and wisdom of
God. See these thoughts carried out in [Co1
12:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md).

[Romans 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 12:6</span></span>

Having then gifts - All the endowments which Christians have are
regarded by the apostle as gifts. God has conferred them; and this fact,
when properly felt, tends much to prevent our thinking of ourselves more
highly than we ought to think, [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md). For the use of the word rendered
"gifts," see [Rom 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md); [Rom
5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md); [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md); [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md); [Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md); [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md), [Co1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009.md),[Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md), etc. It may refer to natural
endowments as well as to the favors of grace; though in this place it
refers doubtless to the distinctions conferred on Christians in the
churches.

Differing - It was never designed that all Christians should be equal.
God designed that people should have different endowments. The very
nature of society supposes this. There never was a state of perfect
equality in any thing; and it would be impossible that there should be,
and yet preserve society. In this, God exercises a sovereignty, and
bestows his favors as he pleases, injuring no one by conferring favors
on others; and holding me responsible for the right use of what I have,
and not for what may be conferred on my neighbor.

According to the grace - That is, the favor, the mercy that is bestowed
on us. As all that we have is a matter of grace, it should keep us from
pride; and it should make us willing to occupy our appropriate place in
the church. True honor consists not in splendid endowments, or great
wealth and function. It consists in rightly discharging the duties which
God requires of us in our appropriate sphere. If all people held their
talents as the gift of God; if all would find and occupy in society the
place for which God designed them, it would prevent no small part of the
uneasiness, the restlessness, the ambition, and misery of the world.

Whether prophecy - The apostle now proceeds to specify the different
classes of gifts or endowments which Christians have, and to exhort them
to discharge aright the duty which results from the rank or function
which they held in the church. "The first is prophecy." This word
properly means to predict future events, but it also means to declare
the divine will; to interpret the purposes of God; or to make known in
any way the truth of God, which is designed to influence people. Its
first meaning is to predict or foretell future events; but as those who
did this were messengers of God, and as they commonly connected with
such predictions, instructions, and exhortations in regard to the sins,
and dangers, and duties of people, the word came to denote any who
warned, or threatened, or in any way communicated the will of God; and
even those who uttered devotional sentiments or praise. The name in the
New Testament is commonly connected with teachers; [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md), "There were in the church at
Antioch certain prophets, and teachers, as Barnabas, etc.;" [Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md), "and Judas and Silas, being
prophets themselves, etc.;" [Act
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md), "a certain prophet named
Agabus." In [Co1 12:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md), prophets
are mentioned as a class of teachers immediately after apostles, "And
God hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets;
thirdly teachers, etc."

The same class of persons is again mentioned in [Co1
14:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029.md), [Co1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039.md). In this place they are spoken
of as being under the influence of revelation, "Let the prophets speak
two or three, and let the other judge. If anything be revealed to
another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. And the spirits
of the prophets are subject to the prophets;" [Co1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039.md), "Covet to prophesy, and forbid
not to speak with tongues." In this place endowments are mentioned under
the name of prophecy evidently in advance even of the power of speaking
with tongues. Yet all these were to be subject to the authority of the
apostle. [Co1 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037.md). In [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md), they are mentioned again in the
same order; "And he gave some apostles; and some prophets; and some
evangelists; and some pastors, and teachers, etc." From these passages
the following things seem clear in relation to this class of persons:

\(1\) They were an order of teachers distinct from the apostles, and
next to them in authority and rank.

\(2\) they were under the influence of revelation, or inspiration in a
certain sense.

\(3\) they had power of controlling themselves, and of speaking or
keeping silence as they chose. They had the power of using their
prophetic gifts as we have the ordinary faculties of our minds, and of
course of abusing them also. This abuse was apparent also in the case of
those who had the power of speaking with tongues, [Co1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002.md), [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004.md),[Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md), [Co1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011.md), etc.

\(4\) they were subject to the apostles.

\(5\) they were superior to the other teachers and pastors in the
church.

\(6\) the office or the endowment was temporary, designed for the
settlement and establishment of the church; and then, like the apostolic
office, having accomplished its purpose, to be disused, and to cease.
From these remarks, also, will be seen the propriety of regulating this
function by apostolic authority; or stating, as the apostle does here,
the manner or rule by which this gift was to be exercised.

According to the proportion - This word ἀναλογίαν analogian is no where
else used in the New Testament. The word properly applies to mathematics
(Scheusner), and means the ratio or proportion which results from
comparison of one number or magnitude with another. In a large sense,
therefore, as applied to other subjects, it denotes the measure of any
thing. With us it means analogy, or the congruity or resemblance
discovered between one thing and another, as we say there is an analogy
or resemblance between the truths taught by reason and revelation. (See
Butler's Analogy.) But this is not its meaning here. It means the
measure, the amount of faith bestowed on them, for he was exhorting them
to [Rom 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md). "Think soberly,
according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith." The word
"faith" here means evidently, not the truths of the Bible revealed
elsewhere; nor their confidence in God; nor their personal piety; but
the extraordinary endowment bestowed on them by the gifts of prophecy.

They were to confine themselves strictly to that; they were not to usurp
the apostolic authority, or to attempt to exercise their special
function; but they were to confine themselves strictly to the functions
of their office according to the measure of their faith, that is, the
extraordinary endowment conferred on them. The word "faith" is thus used
often to denote that extraordinary confidence in God which attended the
working of miracles, etc., [Mat 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#026.md);
[Mat 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md); [Luk
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#006.md). If this be the fair
interpretation of the passage, then it is clear that the interpretation
which applies it to systems of theology, and which demands that we
should interpret the Bible so as to accord with the system, is one that
is wholly unwarranted. It is to be referred solely to this class of
religious teachers, without reference to any system of doctrine, or to
any thing which had been revealed to any other class of people; or
without affirming that there is any resemblance between one truth and
another. All that may be true, but it is not the truth taught in this
passage. And it is equally clear that the passage is not to be applied
to teachers now, except as an illustration of the general principle that
even those endowed with great and splendid talents are not to
over-estimate them, but to regard them as the gift of God; to exercise
them in subordination to his appointment and to seek to employ them in
the manner, the place, and to the purpose that shall be according to his
will. They are to employ them in the purpose for which God gave them;
and for no other.

[Romans 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 12:7</span></span>

Or ministry - διακονίαν diakonian. This word properly means service of
any kind; [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md). It is used in
religion to denote the service which is rendered to Christ as the
Master. It is applied to all classes of ministers in the New Testament,
as denoting their being the servants of Christ; and it is used
particularly to denote that class who from this word were called
deacons, that is, those who had the care of the poor, who provided for
the sick, and who watched over the external matters of the church. In
the following places it is used to denote the ministry, or service,
which Paul and the other apostles rendered in their public work; [Act
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017.md), [Act
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md); [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md); [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md); [Act
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#019.md); [Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md); [Rom
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#031.md); [Co2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md); [Co2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003.md); [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md). In a few places this word is
used to denote the function which the deacons fulfilled; [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md); [Act
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029.md); [Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md); [Co2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md). In this sense the word "deacon"
διάκονος diakonos is most commonly used, as denoting the function which
was performed in providing for the poor and administering the alms of
the church. It is not easy to say in what sense it is used here. I am
inclined to the opinion that he did not refer to those who were
appropriately called deacons, but to those engaged in the function of
the ministry of the word; whose business it was to preach, and thus to
serve the churches. In this sense the word is often used in the New
Testament, and the connection seems to demand the same interpretation
here.

On our ministering - Let us be wholly and diligently occupied in this.
Let this be our great business, and let us give entire attention to it.
Particularly the connection requires us to understand this as directing
those who ministered not to aspire to the office and honors of those who
prophesied. Let them not think of themselves more highly than they
ought, but be engaged entirely in their own appropriate work.

He that teacheth - This word denotes those who instruct, or communicate
knowledge. It is clear that it is used to denote a class of persons
different, in some respects, from those who prophesied and from those
who exhorted. But in what this difference consisted, is not clear.
Teachers are mentioned in the New Testament in the grade next to the
prophets; [Act 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md); [Co1
12:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md). Perhaps the difference between
the prophets, the ministers, the teachers, and the exhorters was this,
that the first spake by inspiration; the second engaged in all the
functions of the ministry properly so called, including the
administration of the sacraments; the teachers were employed in
communicating instruction simply, teaching the doctrines of religion,
but without assuming the function of ministers; and the fourth exhorted,
or entreated Christians to lead a holy life, without making it a
particular subject to teach, and without pretending to administer the
ordinances of religion.

The fact that teachers are so often mentioned in the New Testament,
shows that they were a class by themselves. It may be worthy of remark
that the churches in New England had, at first, a class of people who
were called teachers. One was appointed to this office in every church,
distinct from the pastor, whose proper business it was to instruct the
congregation in the doctrines of religion. The same thing exists
substantially now in most churches, in the appointment of Sunday school
teachers, whose main business it is to instruct the children in the
doctrines of the Christian religion. It is an office of great importance
to the church; and the exhortation of the apostle may be applied to
them: that they should be assiduous, constant, diligent their teaching;
that they should confine themselves to their appropriate place; and
should feel that their office is of great importance in the church of
God; and remember that this is his arrangement, designed to promote the
edification of his people.

[Romans 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 12:8</span></span>

He that exhorteth - This word properly denotes one who urges to the
practical duties of religion, in distinction from one who teaches its
doctrines. One who presents the warnings and the promises of God to
excite men to the discharge of their duty. It is clear that there were
persons who were recognised as engaging especially in this duty, and who
were known by this appellation, as distinguished from prophets and
teachers. How long this was continued, there is no means of
ascertaining; but it cannot be doubted that it may still be expedient,
in many times and places, to have persons designated to this work. In
most churches this duty is now blended with the other functions of the
ministry.

He that giveth - Margin, "imparteth." The word denotes the person whose
function it was to distribute; and probably designates him who
distributed the alms of the church, or him who was the deacon of the
congregation. The connection requires that this meaning should be given
to the passage: and the word rendered "giveth" may denote one who
imparts or distributes that which has been committed to him for that
purpose, as well as one who gives out of his private property. As the
apostle is speaking here of offices in the church, the former is
evidently what is intended. It was deemed an important matter among the
early Christians to impart liberally of their substance to support the
poor, and provide for the needy: [Act
2:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md); [Act
4:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md); [Act
5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md); [Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md); [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md); [Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md), [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md). Hence, it became necessary to
appoint persons over these contributions, who should be especially
charged with the management of them, and who would see that they were
properly distributed; [Act 6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md).
These were the persons who were denominated deacons; [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md).

With simplicity - see [Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md), "If
thine eye be single," etc.; [Luk
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034.md). The word "simplicity" ἁπλοτής
haplotēs is used in a similar sense to denote singleness, honesty of
aim, purity, integrity, without any mixture of a base, selfish, or
sinister end. It requires the bestowment of a favor without seeking any
personal or selfish ends; without partiality; but actuated only by the
desire to bestow them in the best possible manner to promote the object
for which they were given; [Co2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002.md);
[Co2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011.md), [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md); [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md). It is plain that when property
was intrusted to them, there would be danger that they might be tempted
to employ it for selfish and sinister ends, to promote their influence
and prosperity; and hence, the apostle exhorted them to do it with a
single aim to the object for which it was given. Well did he know that
there was nothing more tempting than the possession of wealth, though
given to be appropriated to others. And this exhortation is applicable
not only to the deacons of the churches, but to all who in this day of
Christian benevolence are intrusted with money to advance the kingdom of
the Lord Jesus Christ.

He that ruleth - This word properly designates one who is set over
others, or who presides or rules, or one who attends with diligence and
care to a thing. In [Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md), it is
used in relation to ministers in general: "And we beseech you, brethren,
to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord;" [Ti1
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md), it is applied to the head of a
family, or one who diligently and faithfully performs the duty of a
father: "One that ruleth well his own house;" [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md), it is applied to "elders" in the
church: "Let the elders that rule well, etc." It is not used elsewhere
except in [Tit 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), [Tit
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#014.md), in a different sense, where it
is translated "to maintain good works." The prevailing sense of the
word, therefore, is to rule, to preside over, or to have the management
of. But to what class of persons reference is had here, and what was
precisely their duty, has been made a matter of controversy, and it is
not easy to determine. Whether this refers to a permanent office in the
church, or to an occasional presiding in their assemblies convened for
business, etc. is not settled by the use of the word. It has the idea of
ruling, as in a family, or of presiding, as in a deliberate assembly;
and either of these ideas would convey all that is implied in the
original word; compare [Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md).

With diligence - This word properly means haste [Mar
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#025.md); [Luk
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md); but it also denotes industry,
attention, care; [Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md), "What
carefulness it wrought in you;" [Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012.md), "That our care for you in the
sight of God, etc.;" [Co2 8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md),
(Greek) [Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md). It means here that
they should be attentive to the duties of their vocation, and engage
with ardor in what was committed to them to do.

He that showeth mercy - It is probable, says Calvin, that this refers to
those who had the care of the sick and infirm, the aged and the needy;
not so much to provide for them by charity, as to attend on them in
their affliction, and to take care of them. To the deacons was committed
the duty of distributing alms, but to others that of personal
attendance. This can hardly be called an office, in the technical sense;
and yet it is not improbable that they were designated to this by the
church, and requested to perform it. There were no hospitals and no
almshouses. Christians felt it was their duty to show personal attention
to the infirm and the sick; and so important was their function, that it
was deemed worthy of notice in a general direction to the church.

With cheerfulness - The direction given to those who distributed alms
was to do it with simplicity, with an honest aim to meet the purpose for
which it was intrusted to them. The direction here varies according to
the duty to be performed. It is to be done with cheerfulness,
pleasantness, joy; with a kind, benign, and happy temper. The importance
of this direction to those in this situation is apparent. Nothing tends
so much to enhance the value of personal attendance on the sick and
afflicted, as a kind and cheerful temper. If any where a mild, amiable,
cheerful, and patient disposition is needed, it is near a sick bed, and
when administering to the wants of those who are in affliction. And
whenever we may be called to such a service, we should remember that
this is indispensable. If moroseness, or impatience, or fretfulness is
discovered in us, it will pain those whom we seek to benefit, embitter
their feelings, and render our services of comparatively little value.
The needy and infirm, the feeble and the aged, have enough to bear
without the impatience and harshness of professed friends. It may be
added that the example of the Lord Jesus Christ is the brightest which
the world has furnished of this temper. Though constantly encompassed by
the infirm and the afflicted, yet he was always kind, and gentle, and
mild, and has left before us exactly what the apostie meant when he
said, "he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness." The example of the good
Samaritan is also another instance of what is intended by this
direction; compare [Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md). This
direction is particularly applicable to a physician.

We have here an account of the establishment, the order, and the duties
of the different members of the Christian church. The amount of it all
is, that we should discharge with fidelity the duties which belong to us
in the sphere of life in which we are placed; and not despise the rank
which God has assigned us; not to think of ourselves more highly than we
ought; but to act well our part, according to the station where we are
placed, and the talents with which we are endowed. If this were done, it
would put an end to discontent, ambition, and strife, and would produce
the blessings of universal peace and order.

[Romans 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 12:9</span></span>

Let love - The apostle proceeds to specify the duties of Christians in
general, that they might secure the beauty and order of the church. The
first which he specifies is love. This word here evidently refers to
benevolence, or to good-will toward all mankind. In [Rom
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010.md) he specifies the duty of
brotherly love; and there can be no doubt that he here refers to the
benevolence which we ought to cherish toward all people. A similar
distinction is found in [Pe2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#007.md), "And
to brotherly-kindness add charity," that is, benevolence, or good will,
and kind feelings to others.

Without dissimulation - Without hypocrisy. Let it be sincere and
unfeigned. Let it not consist in words or professions only, but let it
be manifested in acts of kindness and in deeds of charity; [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md); compare [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md). Genuine benevolence is not what
merely professes attachment, but which is evinced by acts of kindness
and affection.

Abhor that which is evil - The word "abhor" means to hate; to turn from;
to avoid. The word "evil" here has reference to malice, or unkindness,
rather than to evil in general. The apostle is exhorting to love, or
kindness; and between the direction to love all people, and the
particular direction about brotherly love, he places this general
direction to abhor what is evil; what is evil in relation to the subject
under discussion, that is, malice or unkindness. The word "evil" is not
infrequently used in this limited sense to denote some particular or
special evil; [Mat 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037.md), [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md), etc.; compare [Psa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md); [Psa
97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010.md); [Th1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md).

Cleave to that which is good - The word rendered "cleave" to denotes
properly the act of gluing, or uniting firmly by glue. It is then used
to denote a very firm adherence to an object; to be firmly united to it.
Here it means that Christians should be firmly attached to what is good,
and not separate or part from it. The good here referred to is
particularly what pertains to benevolence - to all people, and
especially to Christians. It should not be occasional only, or
irregular; but it should be constant, active, decided.

[Romans 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 12:10</span></span>

Be kindly affectioned - The word used here occurs no where else in the
New Testament. It properly denotes tender affection, such as what
subsists between parents and children; and it means that Christians
should have similar feelings toward each other, as belonging to the same
family, and as united in the same principles and interests. The Syriac
renders this, "Love your brethren, and love one another;" compare [Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017.md).

With brotherly love - Or in love to the brethren. The word denotes the
affection which subsists between brethren. The duty is one which is
often presented in the New Testament, and which our Saviour intended
should be regarded as a badge of discipleship; see the note at [Joh
13:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md), "By this shall all people
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another;" [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md), [Joh
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#017.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Th1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md); [Jo1
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md); [Jo1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md), [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md); [Jo1
4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md). The apostle Paul in this
place manifests his unique manner of writing. He does not simply enjoin
brotherly love, but he adds that it should be kindly affectioned. It
should be with the tenderness which characterizes the most endearing
natural relationship. This he expresses by a word which is made for the
occasion (φιλοστοργοὶ philostorgoi), blending love with natural
affection, and suffering it to be manifest in your contact with one
another.

In honour - In showing or manifesting respect or honor. Not in seeking
honor, or striving after respect, but in showing it to one another.

Preferring one another - The word "preferring" means going before,
leading, setting an example. Thus, in showing mutual respect and honor,
they were to strive to excel; not to see which could obtain most honor,
but which could confer most, or manifest most respect; compare [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md); [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md). Thus, they were to be studious
to show to each other all the respect which was due in the various
relations of life; children to show proper respect to parents, parents
to children, servants to their masters, etc.; and all to strive by
mutual kindness to promote the happiness of the Christian community. How
different this from the spirit of the world; the spirit which seeks, not
to confer honor, but to obtain it; which aims, not to diffuse respect,
but to attract all others to give honor to us. If this single direction
were to be obeyed in society, it would put an end at once to no small
part of the envy, and ambition, and heartburning, and dissatisfaction of
the world. It would produce contentment, harmony, love, and order in the
community; and stay the progress of crime, and annihilate the evils of
strife, and discord, and malice. And especially, it would give order and
beauty to the church. It would humble the ambition of those who, like
Diotrephes, love to have the pre-eminence [Jo3
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md), and make every man willing to
occupy the place for which God has designed him, and rejoice that his
brethren may be exalted to higher posts of responsibility and honor.

[Romans 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 12:11</span></span>

Not slothful - The word rendered "slothful" refers to those who are
slow, idle, destitute of promptness of mind and activity; compare [Mat
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#016.md).

In business - τῇ σπουδῇ tē spoudē. This is the same word which in [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md) is rendered "diligence." It
properly denotes haste, intensity, ardor of mind; and hence, also it
denotes industry, labor. The direction means that we should be
diligently occupied in our proper employment. It does not refer to any
particular occupation, but is used in general sense to denote all the
labor which we may have to do; or is a direction to be faithful and
industrious in the discharge of all our appropriate duties; compare [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md). The tendency of the Christian
religion is to promote industry:

\(1\) It teaches the value of time.

\(2\) presents numerous and important things to be done.

\(3\) it inclines people to be conscientious in the improvement of each
moment.

\(4\) and it takes away the mind from those pleasures and pursuits which
generate and promote indolence.

The Lord Jesus was constantly employed in filling up the great duties of
his life, and the effect of his religion has been to promote industry
wherever it has spread both among nations and individuals. An idle man
and a Christian are names which do not harmonize. Every Christian has
enough to do to occupy all his time; and he whose life is spent in ease
and in doing nothing, should doubt altogether his religion. God has
assigned us much to accomplish; and he will hold us answerable for the
faithful performance of it; compare [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md); [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md); [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md); [Th2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010.md), [Th2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012.md). All that would be needful to
transform the idle, and vicious, and wretched, into sober and useful
people, would be to give to them the spirit of the Christian religion;
see the example of Paul, [Act
20:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md).

Fervent - This word is usually applied to water, or to metals so heated
as to bubble, or boil. It hence is used to denote ardor, intensity, or
as we express it, a glow, meaning intense zeal, [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md).

In Spirit - In your mind or heart. The expression is used to denote a
mind filled with intense ardor in whatever it is engaged. It is supposed
that Christians would first find appropriate objects for their labor,
and then engage in them with intense ardor and zeal.

Serving - Regarding yourselves as the servants of the Lord. This
direction is to be understood as connected with the preceding, and as
growing out of it. They were to be diligent and fervid, and in doing so
were to regard themselves as serving the Lord, or to do it in obedience
to the command of God, and to promote his glory. The propriety of this
caution may easily be seen.

\(1\) the tendency of worldly employments is to take off the affections
from God.

\(2\) people are prone to forget God when deeply engaged in their
worldly employments. It is proper to recall their attention to him.

\(3\) the right discharge of our duties in the various employments of
life is to be regarded as serving God. He has arranged the order of
things in this life to promote employment. He has made industry
essential to happiness and success; and hence, to be industrious from
proper motives is to be regarded as acceptable service of God.

\(4\) he has required that all such employments should be conducted with
reference to his will and to his honor, [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md); [Col
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md), [Col
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md). The meaning of the whole verse
is, that Christians should be industrious, should be ardently engaged in
some lawful employment, and that they should pursue it with reference to
the will of God, in obedience to his commands, and to his glory.

[Romans 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 12:12</span></span>

Rejoicing in hope - That is, in the hope of eternal life and glory which
the gospel produces; see the notes at [Rom
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md).

Patient in tribulation - In affliction patiently enduring all that maybe
appointed. Christians may be enabled to do this by the sustaining
influence of their hope of future glory; of being admitted to that world
where there shall be no more death, and where all tears shall be wiped
away from their eyes, [Rev 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md); [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md); compare [Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md). See the influence of hope in
sustaining us in affliction more fully considered in the notes at [Rom
8:18-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md).

Continuing instant in prayer - That is, be persevering in prayer; see
[Col 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002.md); see the notes at [Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md). The meaning of this direction
is, that in order to discharge aright the duties of the Christian life,
and especially to maintain a joyful hope, and to be sustained in the
midst of afflictions, it is necessary to cherish a spirit of prayer, and
to live near to God. How often a Christian should pray, the Scriptures
do not inform us. Of David we are told that he prayed seven times a day
[Psa 119:164](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#164.md); of Daniel, that he was
accustomed to pray three times a day [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md); of our Saviour we have repeated
instances of his praying mentioned; and the same of the apostles. The
following rules, perhaps, may guide us in this.

\(1\) every Christian should have some time allotted for this service,
and some place where he may be alone with God.

\(2\) it is not easy, perhaps not possible, to maintain a life of piety
without regular habits of secret devotion.

\(3\) the morning, when we have experienced God's protecting care, when
the mind is fresh, and the thoughts are as yet clear and unoccupied with
the world, when we go forth to the duties, trials, and temptations of
the day; and the evening, when we have again experienced his goodness,
and are about to commit ourselves to his protecting care, and when we
need his pardoning mercy for the errors and follies of the day, seem to
be times which commend themselves to all as appropriate seasons for
private devotion.

\(4\) every person will also find other times when private prayer will
be needful, and when he will be inclined to it. In affliction, in
perplexity, in moments of despondency, in danger, and want, and
disappointment, and in the loss of friends, we shall feel the propriety
of drawing near to God, and of pouring out the heart before him.

\(5\) besides this, every Christian is probably conscious of times when
he feels especially inclined to pray; he feels just like praying; he has
a spirit of supplication; and nothing but prayer will meet the
instinctive desires of his bosom. We are often conscious of an earnest
desire to see and converse with an absent friend, to have communion with
those we love; and we value such fellowship as among the happiest
moments of life. So with the Christian. He may have an earnest desire to
have communion with God; his heart pants for it; and he cannot resist
the propensity to seek him, and pour out his desires before him. Compare
the feelings expressed by David in [Psa
42:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md), "As the hart panteth after the
water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee O God. My soul thirsteth for
God for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God;"
compare [Psa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md). Such seasons should
be improved; they are the "spring times" of our piety; and we should
expand every sail, that we may be "filled with all the fullness of God."
They are happy, blessed moments of our life; and then devotion is
sweetest and most pure; and then the soul knows what it is to have
fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md).

\(6\) in addition to all this, Christians may be in the habit of praying
to God without the formality of retirement, God locks upon the heart;
and the heart may pour forth its secret desires to Him even when in
business, when conversing with a friend, when walking, when alone, and
when in society. Thus, the Christian may live a life of prayer; and it
shall be one of the characteristics of his life that he prays! By this
he shall be known; and in this he shall learn the way to possess peace
in religion:

"In every joy that crowns my days,

In every pain I bear.

My heart shall find delight in praise,

Or seek relief in prayer.

"When gladness wings my favou'd hour,

Thy love my thoughts shall fill,

Resign'd when storms of sorrow lower,

My soul shall meet thy will,

"My lifted eye, without a tear.

The gathering storm shall see.

My steadfast heart shall know no fear,

That heart shall rest on thee."

[Romans 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 12:13</span></span>

Distributing - The word used here denotes having things in "common"
κοινωνοῦντες koinōnountes. It means that they should be communicative,
or should regard their property as so far common as to supply the needs
of others. In the earliest times of the church, Christians had all
things in common (Notes, [Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044).md),
and felt themselves bound to meet all the needs of their brethren. One
of the most striking effects of Christianity was to loosen their grasp
on property, and dispose them to impart liberally to those who had need.
The direction here does not mean that they should literally have all
things in common; that is, to go back to a state of savage barbarity;
but that they should be liberal, should partake of their good things
with those who were needy; compare [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006.md); [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md); [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md); [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md).

To the necessity - To the needs. That is, distribute to them such things
as they need, food, raiment, etc. This command, of course, has reference
to the poor. "Of saints." Of Christians, or the friends of God. They are
called saints as being holy (ἁγιοι hagioi), or consecrated to God. This
duty of rendering aid to Christians especially, does not interfere with
the general love of mankind. The law of the New Testament is [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md), "As we have opportunity, let us
do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of
faith." The Christian is indeed to love all mankind, and to do them good
as far as may be in his power, [Mat
5:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md); [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md). But he is to show particular
interest in the welfare of his brethren, and to see that the poor
members of the church are provided for; for,

\(1\) They are our brethren; they are of the same family; they are
attached to the same Lord; and to do good to them is to evince love to
Christ, [Mat 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md); [Mar
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041.md).

\(2\) they are left especially to the care of the church; and if the
church neglects them, we may be sure the world will also, [Mat
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011.md). Christians, especially in the
time of the apostles, had reason to expect little compassion from the
people of the world. They were persecuted and oppressed; they would be
embarrassed in their business, perhaps thrown out of occupation by the
opposition of their enemies; and it was therefore especially incumbent
on their Brethren to aid them. To a certain extent it is always true,
that the world is reluctant to aid the friends of God; and hence the
poor followers of Christ are in a special manner thrown on the
benefactions of the church.

\(3\) it is not improbable that there might be a special reason at that
time for enjoining this on the attention of the Romans. It was a time of
persecution, and perhaps of extensive distress. In the days of Claudius
(about a.d. 50), there was a famine in Judea which produced great
distress, and many of the poor and oppressed might flee to the capital
for aid. We know, from other parts of the New Testament, that at that
time the apostle was deeply interested in procuring aid for the poor
brethren in Judea, [Rom 15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025.md);
compare [Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md); [Co2
8:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md); [Co2
9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md). But the same reasons for aiding
the poor followers of Christ will exist substantially in every age; and
one of the most precious privileges conferred upon people is to be
permitted to assist those who are the friends of God, [Psa
41:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md); [Pro
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md).

Given to hospitality - This expression means that they should readily
and cheerfully entertain strangers. This is a duty which is frequently
enjoined in the Scriptures, [Heb 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md),
"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby many have
entertained angels unawares;" [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md), "Use hospitality one to another
without grudging." Paul makes this especially the duty of a Christian
bishop; [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md), "A bishop then must
...be given to hospitality;" [Tit 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md).
Hospitality is especially enjoined by the Saviour, and its exercise
commanded; [Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md), [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md), "He that receiveth you
receiveth me, etc." The waver of hospitality is one of the charges which
the Judge of mankind will allege against the wicked, and on which he
will condemn them; [Mat 25:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#043.md), "I was
a stranger, and ye took me not in." It is especially commended to us by
the example of Abraham [Gen 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md),
and of Lot [Gen 19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md), who thus
received angels unawares.

It was one of the virtues on which Job particularly commended himself,
and which he had not failed to practice; [Job
31:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016.md), "If I have withheld the poor
from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have
eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof,
etc." In the time of our Saviour it was evidently practiced in the most
open and frank manner; [Luk 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md), "And
in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give."
A remarkable instance is also mentioned in [Luk
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md). This virtue is no less common in
eastern nations at present than it was in the time of Christ. It is
eminently the virtue of oriental nations, of their ardent and open
temperament. It springs up naturally in countries thinly settled, where
the sight of a stranger would be therefore especially pleasant; in
countries too, where the occupation was chiefly to attend flocks, and
where there was much leisure for conversation; and where the population
was too sparse, and the travelers too infrequent, to justify inn-keeping
as a business.

From all these causes, it has happened that there are, properly
speaking, no inns or taverns in the regions around Palestine. It was
customary, indeed, to erect places for lodging and shelter at suitable
distances, or by the side of springs or watering places, for travelers
to lodge in. But they are built at the public expense, and are
unfurnished. Each traveler carries his own bed and clothes and cooking
utensils, and such places are merely designed as a shelter for caravans;
(see Robinson's Calmet, art. Caravanserai.) It is still so; and hence,
it becomes, in their view, a virtue of high order to entertain, at their
own tables, and in their families, such strangers as may be traveling.
Niebuhr says, that "the hospitality of the Arabs has always been the
subject of praise; and I believe that those of the present day exercise
this virtue no less than the ancients did. There are, in the villages of
Tehama, houses which are public, where travelers may lodge and be
entertained some days gratis, if they will be content with the fare; and
they are much frequented. When the Arabs are at table, they invite those
who happen to come to eat with them, whether they be Christians or
Muslims, gentle or simple." - "The primitive Christians," says Calmet,
"considered one principal part of their duty to consist in showing
hospitality to strangers. They were in fact so ready in discharging this
duty, that the very pagan admired them for it. They were hospitable to
all strangers, but especially to those who were of the household of
faith. Believers scarcely ever traveled without letters of communion,
which testified the purity of their faith, and procured for them a
favorable reception wherever the name of Jesus Christ was known;"
(Calmet, Dict.) Calmer is also of opinion that the two minor epistles of
John may be such letters of recommendation and communion; compare [Jo2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md).

It may be added that it would be particularly expected of Christians
that they should show hospitality to the ministers of religion. They
were commonly poor; they received no fixed salary; they traveled from
place to place; and they would be dependent for support on the kindness
of those who loved the Lord Jesus Christ. This was particularly intended
by our Saviour's instructions on the subject, [Mat
10:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011.md), [Mat
10:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md). The duty of hospitality is
still binding upon Christians and all people. The law of Christ is not
repealed. The customs of society are indeed changed; and one evidence of
advancement in commerce and in security, is furnished in the fact that
inns are now provided and patronized for the traveler in all Christian
lands. Still this does not lessen the obligations to show hospitality.
It is demanded by the very genius of the Christian religion; it evinces
proper love toward mankind; it shows that there is a feeling of
brotherhood and kindness toward others, when such hospitality is shown.
It unites society, creates new bonds of interest and affection, to show
kindness to the stranger and to the poor. To what extent this is to be
done, is one of those questions which are to be left to every man's
conscience and views of duty. No rule can be given on the subject. Many
men have not the means to be extensively hospitable; and many are not
placed in situations that require it. No rules could be given that
should be applicable to all cases; and hence, the Bible has left the
general direction, has furnished examples where it was exercised, has
recommended it to mankind, and then has left every man to act on the
rule, as he will answer it to God; see [Mat
25:34-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md).

[Romans 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 12:14</span></span>

Bless them ... - see the note at [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md); compare [Luk
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#028.md).

Bless, and curse not - Bless only; or continue to bless, however long or
aggravated may be the injury. Do not be provoked to anger, or to
cursing, by any injury, persecution, or reviling. This is one of the
most severe and difficult duties of the Christian religion; and it is a
duty which nothing else but religion will enable people to perform. To
curse denotes properly to devote to destruction. Where there is power to
do it, it implies the destruction of the object. Thus, the fig-tree that
was cursed by the Saviour soon withered away: [Mar
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021.md). Thus, those whom God curses
will be certainly destroyed; [Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md). Where there is not power to do
it, to curse implies the invoking of the aid of God to devote to
destruction. Hence, it means to imprecate; to implore a curse from God
to rest on others; to pray that God would destroy them. In a larger
sense still, it means to abuse by reproachful words; to calumniate; or
to express oneself in a violent, profane, and outrageous manner. In this
passage it seems to have special reference to this.

[Romans 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 12:15</span></span>

Rejoice with them ... - This command grows out of the doctrine stated in
[Rom 12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md), that the church is one;
that it has one interest; and therefore that there should be common
sympathy in its joys and sorrows. Or, enter into the welfare of your
fellow-Christians, and show your attachment to them by rejoicing that
they are made happy; compare [Co1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026.md), "And whether .... one member be
honored, all the members rejoice with it." In this way happiness
diffuses and multiplies itself. It becomes expanded over the face of the
whole society; and the union of the Christian body tends to enlarge the
sphere of happiness and to prolong the joy conferred by religion. God
has bound the family of man together by these sympathies, and it is one
of the happiest of all devices to perpetuate and extend human
enjoyments.

Weep ... - See the note at [Joh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035.md).
At the grave of Lazarus our Saviour evinced this in a most tender and
affecting manner. The design of this direction is to produce mutual
kindness and affection, and to divide our sorrows by the sympathies of
friends. Nothing is so well suited to do this as the sympathy of those
we love. All who are afflicted know how much it diminishes their sorrow
to see others sympathizing with them, and especially those who evince in
their sympathies the Christian spirit. How sad would be a suffering
world if there were none who regarded our griefs with interest or with
tears! if every sufferer were left to bear his sorrows unpitied and
alone! and if all the ties of human sympathy were rudely cut at once,
and people were left to suffer in solitude and unbefriended! It may be
added that it is the special duty of Christians to sympathize in each
other's griefs:

\(1\) Because their Saviour set them the example;

\(2\) Because they belong to the same family;

\(3\) Because they are subject to similar trials and afflictions; and,

\(4\) Because they cannot expect the sympathy of a cold and unfeeling
world.

[Romans 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 12:16</span></span>

Be of the same mind ... - This passage has been variously interpreted.
"Enter into each other's circumstances, in order to see how you would
yourself feel." Chrysostom. "Be agreed in your opinions and views."
Stuart. "Be united or agreed with each other." Flatt; compare [Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md). A literal translation of the
Greek will give somewhat a different sense, but one evidently correct.
"Think of, that is, regard, or seek after the same thing for each other;
that is, what you regard or seek for yourself, seek also for your
brethren. Do not have divided interests; do not be pursuing different
ends and aims; do not indulge counter plans and purposes; and do not
seek honors, offices, for yourself which you do not seek for your
brethren, so that you may still regard yourselves as brethren on a
level, and aim at the same object." The Syriac has well rendered the
passage: "And what you think concerning yourselves, the same also think
concerning your brethren; neither think with an elevated or ambitious
mind, but accommodate yourselves to those who are of humbler condition;"
compare [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md).

Mind not high things - Greek, Not thinking of high things. That is, not
seeking them, or aspiring after them. The connection shows that the
apostle had in view those things which pertained to worldly offices and
honors; wealth, and state, and grandeur. They were not to seek them for
themselves; nor were they to court the society or the honors of the
people in an elevated rank in life. Christians were commonly of the
poorer ranks, and they were to seek their companions and joys there, and
not to aspire to the society of the great and the rich; compare [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005.md), "And seekest thou great things
for thyself? Seek them not;" [Luk
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md).

Condescend - συναπαγομενοι sunapagomenoi. Literally, "being led away by,
or being conducted by." It does not properly mean to condescend, but
denotes a yielding, or being guided and led in the thoughts, feelings,
plans, by humble objects. Margin, "Be contented with mean things."

To men of low estate - In the Greek text, the word here is an adjective
ταπεινοις tapeinois, and may refer either to "people" or to "things,"
either in the masculine or neuter gender. The sentiment is not
materially changed whichever interpretation is adopted. It means that
Christians should seek the objects of interest and companionship, not
among the great, the rich, and the noble, but among the humble and the
obscure. They should do it because their Master did it before them;
because his friends are most commonly found among those in humble life;
because Christianity prompts to benevolence rather than to a fondness
for pride and display; and because of the influence on the mind produced
by an attempt to imitate the great, to seek the society of the rich, and
to mingle with the scenes of gaiety, folly, and ambition.

Be not wise ... - Compare [Isa 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md),
"Wo unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own
sight." See the note at [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md).
The meaning is, do not trust in the conceit of your own superior skill
and understanding, and refuse to hearken to the counsel of others.

In your own conceits - Greek, "Among yourselves." Syriac, "In your own
opinion." The direction here accords with that just given, and means
that they should not be elated with pride above their brethren; or be
headstrong and self-confident. The tendency of religion is to produce a
low estimate of our own importance and attainments.

[Romans 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 12:17</span></span>

Recompense - Render, give, or return; see the note at [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md). This is probably one of the most
difficult precepts of Christianity; but the law of Christ on the subject
is unyielding. It is a solemn demand made on all his followers, and it
"must" be obeyed.

Provide - The word rendered "provide" means properly to "think" or
"meditate beforehand." Make it a matter of "previous thought," of
"settled plan," of "design." This direction would make it a matter of
"principle" and fixed purpose to do what is right; and not to leave it
to the fluctuations of feeling, or to the influence of excitement. The
same direction is given in [Co2 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021.md).

Things honest - Literally, things "beautiful," or "comely." The
expression here does not refer to "property," or to "provision" made for
a family, etc. The connection requires us to understand it respecting
"conduct," and especially our conduct toward those who injure us. It
requires us to evince a spirit, and to manifest a deportment in such
cases, that shall be lovely and comely in the view of others; such as
all people will approve and admire. And the apostle wisely cautions us
to "provide" for this, that is, to think of it beforehand, to make it a
matter of fixed principle and purpose, so that we shall not be overtaken
and excited by passion. If left to the time when the offence shall be
given, we may be excited and off our guard, and may therefore evince an
improper temper. All persons who have ever been provoked by injury (and
who has not been?) will see the profound wisdom of this caution to
"discipline" and "guard" the temper by previous purpose, that we may not
evince an improper spirit.

In the sight of all men - Such as all must approve; such that no man can
blame; and, therefore, such as shall do no discredit to religion. This
expression is taken from [Pro 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md). The
passage shows that people may be expected to approve a mild, kind, and
patient temper in the reception of injuries; and facts show that this is
the case. The Christian spirit is one that the world "must" approve,
however little it is disposed to act on it.

[Romans 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 12:18</span></span>

If it be possible - If it can be done. This expression implies that it
could not always be done. Still it should be an object of desire; and we
should endeavor to obtain it.

As much as lieth in you - This implies two things:

\(1\) We are to do our utmost endeavors to preserve peace, and to
appease the anger and malice of others.

\(2\) we are not to "begin" or to "originate" a quarrel.

So far as "we" are concerned, we are to seek peace. But then it does not
always depend on us. Others may oppose and persecute us; they will hate
religion, and may slander, revile, and otherwise injure us; or they may
commence an assault on our persons or property. For "their" assaults we
are not answerable; but we are answerable for our conduct toward them;
and on no occasion are we to commence a warfare with them. It may not be
"possible" to prevent their injuring and opposing us; but it is possible
not to begin a contention with them; and "when they" have commenced a
strife, to seek peace, and to evince a Christian spirit. This command
doubtless extends to everything connected with strife; and means that we
are not to "provoke" them to controversy, or to prolong it when it is
commenced; see [Psa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md); [Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md), [Mat
5:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md); [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md). If all Christians would follow
this command, if they would never "provoke" to controversy, if they
would injure no man by slander or by unfair dealing, if they would
compel none to prosecute them in law by lack of punctuality in payment
of debts or honesty in business, if they would do nothing to irritate,
or to prolong a controversy when it is commenced, it would put an end to
no small part of the strife that exists in the world.

[Romans 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 12:19</span></span>

Dearly beloved - This expression of tenderness was especially
appropriate in an exhortation to peace. It reminded them of the
affection and friendship which ought to subsist among them as brethren.

Avenge not yourselves - To "avenge" is to take satisfaction for an
injury by inflicting punishment on the offender. To take such
satisfaction for injuries done to society, is lawful and proper for a
magistrate; [Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md). And to take
satisfaction for injuries done by sin to the universe, is the province
of God. But the apostle here is addressing private individual
Christians. And the command is, to avoid a spirit and purpose of
revenge. But this command is not to be so understood that we may not
seek for "justice" in a regular and proper way before civil tribunals.
If our character is assaulted, if we are robbed and plundered, if we are
oppressed contrary to the law of the land, religion does not require us
to submit to such oppression and injury without seeking our rights in an
orderly and regular manner. If it did, it would be to give a premium to
iniquity, to countenance wickedness, and require a man, by becoming a
Christian, to abandon his rights.

Besides, the magistrate is appointed for the praise of those who do
well, and to punish evil-doers; [Pe1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014.md). Further, our Lord Jesus did not
surrender his rights [Joh 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023.md); and
Paul demanded that he himself should be treated according to the rights
and privileges of a Roman citizen; [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md). The command here "not to avenge
ourselves" means, that we are not to take it out of the hands of God, or
the hands of the law, and to inflict it ourselves. It is well known that
where there are no laws, the business of vengeance is pursued by
individuals in a barbarous and unrelenting manner. In a state of savage
society, vengeance is "immediately taken," if possible, or it is pursued
for years, and the offended man is never satisfied until he has imbrued
his hands in the blood of the offender. Such was eminently the case
among the Indians of this country (America). But Christianity seeks the
ascendancy of the laws; and in cases which do not admit or require the
interference of the laws, in private assaults and quarrels, it demands
that we bear injury with patience, and commit our cause unto God; see
[Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md).

But rather give place unto wrath - This expression has been interpreted
in a great variety of ways. Its obvious design is to induce us not to
attempt to avenge ourselves, but to leave it with God. To "give place,"
then, is to leave it for God to come in and execute wrath or vengeance
on the enemy. Do not execute wrath; leave it to God; commit all to him;
leave yourself and your enemy in his hands, assured that he will
vindicate you and punish him.

For it is written - [Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md).

Vengeance is mine - That is, it belongs to me to inflict revenge. This
expression implies that it is "improper" for people to interfere with
that which properly belongs to God. When we are angry, and attempt to
avenge ourselves, we should remember, therefore, that we are infringing
on the prerogatives of the Almighty.

I will repay ... - This is said in substance, though not in so many
words, in [Deu 32:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md). Its design is
to assure us that those who deserve to be punished, shall be; and that,
therefore, the business of revenge may be safely left in the bands of
God. Though "we" should not do it, yet if it ought to be done, it will
be done. This assurance will sustain as, not in the "desire" that our
enemy shall be punished, but in the belief that "God" will take the
matter into his own hands; that he can administer it better than we can;
and that if our enemy "ought" to be punished, he will be. "We,"
therefore, should leave it all with God. That God will vindicate his
people, is clearly and abundantly proved in [Th2
1:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md); [Rev
6:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md); [Deu
32:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040.md).

[Romans 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 12:20</span></span>

Therefore, if thine enemy hunger ... - This verse is taken almost
literally from [Pro 25:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021.md). Hunger
and thirst here are put for want in general. If thine enemy is needy in
any way, do him good, and supply his needs. This is, in spirit, the same
as the command of the Lord Jesus [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md), "Do good to them that hate you,"
etc.

In so doing - It does not mean that we are to do this "for the sake" of
heaping coals of fire on him, but that this will be the result.

Thou shalt heap ... - Coals of fire are doubtless emblematical of
"pain." But the idea here is not that in so doing we shall call down
divine vengeance on the man; but the apostle is speaking of the natural
effect or result of showing him kindness. Burning coals heaped on a
man's head would be expressive of intense agony. So the apostle says
that the "effect" of doing good to an enemy would be to produce pain.
But the pain will result from shame, remorse of conscience, a conviction
of the evil of his conduct, and an apprehension of divine displeasure
that may lead to repentance. To do this, is not only perfectly right,
but it is desirable. If a man can be brought to reflection and true
repentance, it should be done. In regard to this passage we may remark,

\(1\) That the way to promote "peace" is to do good even to enemies.

\(2\) the way to bring a man to repentance is to do him good. On this
principle God is acting continually. He does good to all, even to the
rebellious; and he designs that his goodness should lead people to
repentance; [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md). People will
resist wrath, anger, and power; but "goodness" they cannot resist; it
finds its way to the heart; and the conscience does its work, and the
sinner is overwhelmed at the remembrance of his crimes.

\(3\) if people would act on the principles of the gospel, the world
would soon be at peace. No man would suffer himself many times to be
overwhelmed in this way with coals of fire. It is not human nature, bad
as it is; and if Christians would meet all unkindness with kindness, all
malice with benevolence, and all wrong with right, peace would soon
pervade the community, and even opposition to the gospel might soon die
away.

[Romans 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 12:21</span></span>

Be not overcome of evil - Be not "vanquished" or "subdued" by injury
received from others. Do not suffer your temper to be excited; your
Christian principles to be abandoned; your mild, amiable, kind, and
benevolent temper to be ruffled by any opposition or injury which you
may experience. Maintain your Christian principles amidst all
opposition, and thus show the power of the gospel. They are overcome by
evil who suffer their temper to be excited, who become enraged and
revengeful and who engage in contention with those who injure them; [Pro
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022.md).

But overcome evil with good - That is, subdue or vanquish evil by doing
good to others. Show them the loveliness of a better spirit; the power
of kindness and benevolence; the value of an amiable, Christian
deportment. So doing, you may disarm them of their rage, and be the
means of bringing them to better minds.

This is the noble and grand sentiment of the Christian religion. Nothing
like this is to be found in the pagan classics; and nothing like it ever
existed among pagan nations. Christianity alone has brought forth this
lovely and mighty principle; and one design of it is to advance the
welfare of man by promoting peace, harmony, and love. The idea of
"overcoming evil with good" never occurred to people until the gospel
was preached. It never has been acted on except under the influences of
the gospel. On this principle God shows kindness; on this principle the
Saviour came, and bled, and died; and on this principle all Christians
should act in treating their enemies, and in bringing a world to the
knowledge of the Lord Jesus. If Christians will show benevolence, if
they will send forth proofs of love to the ends of the earth, the evils
of the world will be overcome. Nor can the nations be converted until
Christians act on this great and most important principle of their
religion, "on the largest scale possible," to "overcome evil with good."
