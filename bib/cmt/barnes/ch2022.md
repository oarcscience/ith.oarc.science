Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 22:2</span></span>

For "42" read "22" (see the marginal reference). Ahaziah's father,
Jehoram, was but 40 when be died [Ch2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md).

[2 Chronicles 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 22:7</span></span>

The destruction of Ahaziah was of God - i. e. his untimely end was a
judgment upon him for his idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 22:9</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Ahaziah after remaining a while at
Megiddo, removed to Samaria, where his wounds could be better cared for
and concealment might be easier; Jehu's emissaries discovered him there;
they took him to Jehu, who happened at the time to be at Megiddo; and
then and there Jehu put him to death. The narrative here is therefore
supplementary to that of 2 Kings, and finds its proper place between the
clause," He fled to Megiddo," and the words "and died there."

And when they had slain him, they buried him - Jehu's emissaries killed
him but allowed his servants to bury him (see [Kg2
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#028).md).

No power ... - As Ahaziah was but twenty-three at his death ([Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002) note.md), he had no grown-up son to
take the crown.

[2 Chronicles 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 22:10</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference and notes.
