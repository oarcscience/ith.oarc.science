### [Exodus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 23:1</span></span>

These four commands, addressed to the conscience, are illustrations of
the ninth commandment, mainly in reference to the giving of evidence in
legal causes. Compare [Kg1 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md); [Act
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011.md).

[Exo 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002.md)

This verse might be more strictly rendered, "Thou shalt not follow the
many to evil; neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause so as to
incline after the many to pervert justice."

[Exo 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003.md)

Countenance - Rather, show partiality to a man's cause because he is
poor (compare [Lev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015).md).

These four commands, addressed to the conscience, are illustrations of
the ninth commandment, mainly in reference to the giving of evidence in
legal causes. Compare [Kg1 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md); [Act
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011.md).

[Exodus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 23:4</span></span>

So far was the spirit of the law from encouraging personal revenge that
it would not allow a man to neglect an opportunity of saving his enemy
from loss.

[Exo 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#005.md)

The sense appears to be: "If thou see the ass of thine enemy lying down
under his burden, thou shalt forbear to pass by him; thou shalt help him
in loosening the girths of the ass."

[Exodus 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 23:6</span></span>

Four precepts evidently addressed to those in authority as judges:

\(a\) To do justice to the poor. Comparing [Exo
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md) with [Exo
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003.md), it was the part of the judge to
defend the poor against the oppression of the rich, and the part of the
witness to take care lest his feelings of natural pity should tempt him
to falsify evidence.

\(b\) To be cautious of inflicting capital punishment on one whose guilt
was not clearly proved. A doubtful case was rather to be left to God
Himself, who would "not justify the wicked," nor suffer him to go
unpunished though he might be acquitted by an earthly tribunal. [Exo
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007.md).

\(c\) To take no bribe or present which might in any way pervert
judgment [Exo 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008.md); compare [Num
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#015.md); [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md); [Act
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026.md).

\(d\) To vindicate the rights of the stranger [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009.md) - rather, the foreigner. ([Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010) note..md) This verse is a
repetition of [Exo 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md), but the
precept is there addressed to the people at large, while it is here
addressed to the judges in reference to their official duties. The
caution was perpetually necessary. Compare [Eze
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007.md); [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md). The word rendered "heart" is more
strictly "soul," and would be better represented here by feelings.

[Exodus 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 23:10</span></span>

This is the first mention of the Sabbatical year; the law for it is
given at length in [Lev 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#002.md). Both the
Sabbatical year and the weekly Sabbath are here spoken of exclusively in
their relation to the poor, as bearing testimony to the equality of the
people in their covenant with Yahweh. In the first of these
institutions, the proprietor of the soil gave up his rights for the year
to the whole community of living creatures, not excepting the beasts: in
the latter, the master gave up his claim for the day to the services of
his servants and cattle.

[Exo 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012.md)

May be refreshed - Literally, "may take breath."

[Exodus 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 23:13</span></span>

Compare [Deu 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md); [Jos
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#005.md); [Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md).

[Exodus 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 23:14</span></span>

This is the first mention of the three great Yearly Festivals. The feast
of Unleavened bread, in its connection with the Paschal Lamb, is spoken
of in Exo. 12; 13: but the two others are here first named. The whole
three are spoken of as if they were familiarly known to the people. The
points that are especially enjoined are that every male Israelite should
attend them at the sanctuary (compare [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023).md), and that he should take with
him an offering for Yahweh, presenting himself before his King with his
tribute in his hand. That this condition belonged to all the feasts,
though it is here stated only in regard to the Passover, cannot be
doubted. See [Deu 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md).

[Exo 23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015.md)

On the Feast of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover, see Exo. 12:1-20,
[Exo 12:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#043.md); [Exo
13:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003.md); [Exo
34:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#018.md); [Lev
23:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md). On the Feast of the
Firstfruits of Harvest, called also the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of
Pentecost, see [Exo 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md); [Lev
23:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md). On the Feast of Ingathering,
called also the Feast of Tabernacles, see [Lev
23:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md), [Lev
23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md).

[Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md)

In the end of the year - Compare [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md). The year here spoken of must
have been the civil or agrarian year, which began after harvest, when
the ground was prepared for sowing. Compare [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md); [Deu
16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013.md). The sacred year began in
spring, with the month Abib, or Nisan. See [Exo
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002.md) note, and [Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009.md).

When thou hast gathered - Rather, when thou gatherest in.

[Exodus 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 23:18</span></span>

The blood of my sacrifice - It is generally considered that this must
refer to the Paschal Lamb. See [Exo
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007.md), [Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011.md), [Exo
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013.md), [Exo
12:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md), [Exo
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#027.md).

The fat of my sacrifice - Strictly, the fat of my feast; the "best part"
of the feast, that is, the Paschal lamb itself. Compare [Exo
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#025.md).

[Exodus 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 23:19</span></span>

The first of the firstfruits of thy land - The "best," or "chief" of the
firstfruits, that is, the two wave loaves described [Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017.md). As the preceding precept
appears to refer to the Passover, so it is likely that this refers to
Pentecost. They are called in Leviticus, "the firstfruits unto the
Load;" and it is reasonable that they should here be designated the
"chief" of the firstfruits. If, with some, we suppose the precept to
relate to the offerings of firstfruits in general, the command is a
repetition of [Exo 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md).

Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk - This precept is
repeated. See the marginal references. If we connect the first of the
two preceding precepts with the Passover, and the second with Pentecost,
it seems reasonable to connect this with the Feast of Tabernacles. The
only explanation which accords with this connection is one which refers
to a superstitious custom connected with the harvest; in which a kid was
seethed in its mother's milk to propitiate in some way the deities, and
the milk was sprinkled on the fruit trees, fields and gardens, as a
charm to improve the crops of the coming year. Others take it to be a
prohibition of a custom of great antiquity among the Arabs, of preparing
a gross sort of food by stewing a kid in milk, with the addition of
certain ingredients of a stimulating nature: and others take it in
connection with the prohibitions to slaughter a cow and a calf, or a ewe
and her lamb, on the same day [Lev
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028.md), or to take a bird along with
her young in the nest [Deu 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006.md). It is
thus understood as a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of
nature.

[Exodus 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 23:20</span></span>

An Angel - See [Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md), [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md); [Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md).

[Exodus 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 23:22</span></span>

The rendering in the margin is better. Cf. [Deu
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#004.md).

[Exodus 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 23:23</span></span>

I will cut them off - The national existence of the Canaanites was
indeed to be "utterly" destroyed, every trace of their idolatries was to
be blotted out, no social contact was to be held with them while they
served other gods, nor were alliances of any kind to be formed with
them. (See Deut. 7; [Deu 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md), [Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029)..md) But it is alike contrary to
the spirit of the divine law, and to the facts bearing on the subject
scattered in the history, to suppose that any obstacle was put in the
way of well disposed individuals of the denounced nations who left their
sins and were willing to join the service of Yahweh. The spiritual
blessings of the covenant were always open to those who sincerely and
earnestly desired to possess them. See [Exo
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010.md); [Lev
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#034.md); [Lev
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#022.md).

[Exodus 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 23:27</span></span>

Destroy - Rather, overthrow. See [Exo
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md).

[Exodus 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 23:28</span></span>

Hornets - Compare the marginal references. The word is used figuratively
for a cause of terror and discouragement. Bees are spoken of in the like
sense, [Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md); [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md).

[Exodus 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 23:29</span></span>

Beast of the field - i. e. destructive animals.

[Exodus 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 23:31</span></span>

In [Exo 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023.md), the limits of the Land
of Canaan, strictly so called, are indicated; to this, when the
Israelites were about to take possession of it, were added the regions
of Gilead and Bashan on the left side of the Jordan [Num
32:33-42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md); [Jos
13:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md). These two portions made up
the holy land, of which the limits were recognized, with inconsiderable
variations, until the final overthrow of the Jewish polity. But in this
verse the utmost extent of Hebrew dominion, as it existed in the time of
David and Solomon, is set forth. The kingdom then reached to Eloth and
Ezion-geber on the AElanitic Gulf of the Red Sea [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md), and to Tiphsah on the "River,"
that is, the River Euphrates [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024.md), having for its western boundary
"the Sea of the Philistines," that is, the Mediterranean, and for its
southern boundary "the desert," that is, the wildernesses of Shur and
Paran (compare [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md); [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004).md).
