### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 45:0</span></span>

This chapter describes the portion of territory reserved for the
priests, in the middle of which is to be the temple with its courts and
precincts, for the Levites, for the city, and for the prince.

[Ezekiel 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

By lot - Not by casting lots, but by "allotment," the several portions
being assigned by rule [Jos 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006).

Oblation - The oblation (properly "heaveoffering") was regarded as the
Lord's portion [Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030). This
"oblation" is given here as part of the provision made for the priests,
and was probably in lieu of tithes [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030); [Num
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021), just as the prince had his
definite portion of land instead of being supported by the contributions
of the people. The priests and Levites had, in addition, the sacrifices
([Eze 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028), note). This provision for
them, out of proportion in any actual arrangement, is no doubt intended
to symbolize the reverence and honor due to God, and expressed by
liberality to His services and His ministers. The Septuagint read "the
breadth twenty thousand;" and those who adopt this, read [Eze
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003) "and from this" whole measure is
to be deducted the priests' special portion 25,000 from east to west,
and 10,000 from north to south. Others, retaining the reading of the
text, suppose the term oblation here to denote the portion assigned to
the priests alone (as in [Eze 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009)),
and "of this measure" [Eze 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003) to
mean not "deducted from this measure," but "computed by this measure."
The King James Version rightly supplies "reeds," since the precincts
[Eze 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020) were 500 "reeds" square.
25,000 reeds =about 42 12 statute miles, 36 12 geographic miles.

[Ezekiel 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 45:2</span></span>

The "sanctuary" here probably means the whole temple precincts.

Suburbs - literally, as margin. To mark out more distinctly the sacred
precincts, a vacant space of fifty cubits was left on all sides.

[Ezekiel 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 45:5</span></span>

For a possession for twenty chambers - literally, "For a possession
twenty chambers," possibly twenty out of the thirty chambers in the
outer court [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017), and assigned
for their use during residence in the sanctuary. The Septuagint reads
"for cities to dwell in" (compare [Num
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002)) which some adopt here.

[Ezekiel 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 45:6</span></span>

This portion is to belong to the whole people, not to be subject to the
encroachments made by the later kings of Judah [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013). The Levites' portion 10,000
reeds, the priests' portion 10,000 reeds, and the city portion 5,000
reeds. make in all 25,000 reeds from north to south. The measure of each
of these portions from east to west has been defined to be 25,000 reeds
([Eze 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001) note), and thus we have a
square of 25,000 in all.

[Ezekiel 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 45:7</span></span>

On either side of the 25,000 reeds a strip of land, running westward to
the sea, eastward to the Jordan, formed the possession of the prince
(see [Eze 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#018) note). For the other
tribes the limits from west to east are the Mediterranean Sea and the
Jordan [Eze 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008).

[Eze 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007)

And the length shall be over against - Or, "and" in length "over
against."

The definition of the prince's territory was to prevent the oppressions
foretold ([Sa1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#014) ff), described
[Kg2 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#035), and reproved Jer. 22.

[Ezekiel 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 45:9</span></span>

The princes are exhorted to execute judgment, and abstain from
"exaction" (literally "ejection") such as that of Naboth by Ahab [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019).

[Ezekiel 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 45:10</span></span>

A general exhortation to honesty, expressed by true weights and measures
(marginal references). This fitly introduces the strict regulation of
quantities in the prescribed offerings.

[Ezekiel 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 45:11</span></span>

The ephah was in use for dry measure, the bath for liquid. The homer
seems to have contained about 75 gallons (see [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040), note; [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036), note).

After the homer - i. e., according to the standard of the homer.

[Ezekiel 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 45:12</span></span>

The shekel - See the marginal reference.

The "maneh" shall be of true weight, but it would seem that in Ezekiel's
time there were "manehs" of different value.

[Ezekiel 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 45:13</span></span>

The offerings. to be made by the people through the prince for the
service of the sanctuary. In the Mosaic Law the offerings for the
sacrifices of the ordinary festivals were left to the free will of the
people. Here they are reduced to regular order and the amounts ordained.
In later days there were often shortcomings in these respects [Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008). This is obviated, and regularity
ensured in the new order of things. No mention is made of wine for the
drink-offering, or of bullocks for the burnt-offering, so that the
enumeration is not complete.

[Eze 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#014)

Cor - Translated "measure" in [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011), ... Here it is a synonym of
"homer."

[Eze 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017)

The people's gifts were to be placed in the hands of the prince, so as
to form a common stock, out of which the prince was to provide what was
necessary for each sacrifice. Compare [Kg1
8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062); [Ezr
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#017). The prince handed the gifts to
the priests, whose part it was to sacrifice and offer. But the prominent
part assigned to the prince in "making reconciliation for the sins of
the people" seems to typify the union of the kingly and priestly offices
in the person of the Mediator of the New covenant.

[Ezekiel 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 45:18</span></span>

This order of certain solemn services does not follow exactly the order
of Moses, of Solomon, or of Ezra. The deviation can scarcely have been
accidental, and furnishes a fresh indication that the whole vision is
symbolic, representative of the times when, after the oblation of the
one Sacrifice, reconciliation and sanctification were effected for man
through the presence of God dwelling in the midst of the people.

[Eze 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018)

In the first day - If this is only a special Passover for the
dedication, the prolongation of the festival may be compared with that
under Solomon [Ch2 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008). But it is more
probably a general ordinance, and, in this case, we have an addition to
the Mosaic ritual (compare [Lev 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)).
Here the "first day" is marked by the rites of expiation, which are
repeated on the seventh day [Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020), for the purpose of including
those who transgressed from ignorance rather than willfulness.

[Eze 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#023)

Comparing this with the daily sacrifices of the Paschal week [Num
28:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019), and those of the daily
sacrifices of the week of the Feast of tabernacles (see [Num
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012)...), it will be seen that here
the covenant number seven is preserved throughout to indicate a perfect,
in lieu of an imperfect, covenant with God.

[Eze 45:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#025)

The Feast of tabernacles (compare the marginal references). Some think
that the other great festival, the Feast of Weeks, is intended.
