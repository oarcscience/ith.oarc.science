### [Joshua Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001)

[Joshua 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 22:1</span></span>

The events of this chap. are no doubt recorded in their proper
historical order. The auxiliary forces of the trans-Jordanic tribes were
not sent away immediately after the campaigns against the Canaanites
were over. They set forth from Shiloh, [Jos
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009), to which place the sanctuary had
been removed [Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001) after the
conquest and the settlement of the children of Judah and of Joseph in
their possessions, and after the appointment of the Levitical cities.

[Joshua 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 22:7</span></span>

The insertion of this explanation about the half tribe, and the
repetition of Joshua's farewell, are examples of a marked characteristic
of very ancient writers and of Hebrew writers as much as any - that of
giving a completeness and finish to each section of their story. The
Jewish historian scarcely ever quotes or reminds, but repeats so much as
may be necessary to make his account of the transaction in hand fully
intelligible by itself. (Compare also [Jos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014), [Jos
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#033); [Jos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#003); [Jos
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#007).) It is quite possible, however,
that the particulars special to [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008), may be due to some other
narrative of the whole event than that to which [Jos
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#005) belongs, and may have been
interwoven by a later reviser.

[Joshua 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 22:9</span></span>

Gilead - Here used in the widest sense for the whole trans-Jordanic
district.

[Joshua 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 22:10</span></span>

The two tribes and a half erected this altar in order to keep alive
their claim to have the same interest as the other tribes had in the
sanctuary of God, which was established on the west side of Jordan: and
in order to forestall any assertion that the Jordan itself was a natural
barrier of exclusion between them and the sanctuary, they built it on
the west or Canaanite bank of the Jordan and not on the east.

The word rendered "borders" is noteworthy; it means circuits,
arrondissements.

[Joshua 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 22:12</span></span>

Gathered themselves together - The various tribes had already dispersed
to their homes, and were now summoned together again.

[Joshua 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 22:17</span></span>

From which we are not cleansed until this day - Phinehas, who had borne
a conspicuous part in vindicating the cause of God against those who
fell away to Baal-peor, means that terrible as the punishment had been,
there were still those among them who hankered after Baal worship, and
even practiced it in secret. (Compare Joshua's words, [Jos
24:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014).)

[Joshua 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 22:19</span></span>

Unclean - i. e. unholy because the sanctuary was not in it, but on the
other side of Jordan.

[Joshua 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 22:22</span></span>

The repeated invocation of God, and that by His three names - אל 'êl,
אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym, יהוה yehovâh: compare [Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001) - marks the earnestness of the
protestation. The conduct of the two tribes and a half has often been
noted as exemplary. They had had a grave and capital crime most
unexpectedly laid to their charge, of which they were entirely innocent.
Yet there is no word of reproach or recrimination in their vindication
of themselves. They are contented simply to repudiate the false
accusation and to explain the real motives of conduct perhaps suggested
to them by a precedent set by Moses [Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015).

Save us not this day - The words are a direct appeal to God, exactly
equivalent in effect to our form "So help me God."

[Joshua 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 22:34</span></span>

The word עד ‛êd is not found after "altar" in the text of most
manuscripts, nor is it represented in the Septuagint or Vulgate. The
passage should probably run: "the children of Reuben and the children of
Gad named the altar, that (as they said) it might be, etc." The title
placed on the altar was perhaps simply a witness between them that the
Lord was God (Wordsworth).
