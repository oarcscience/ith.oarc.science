### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 16:2</span></span>

It was the purpose of God that David should be anointed at this time as
Saul's successor, and as the ancestor and the type of His Christ. It was
not the purpose of God that Samuel should stir up a civil war, by
setting up David as Saul's rival. Secrecy, therefore, was a necessary
part of the transaction. But secrecy and concealment are not the same as
duplicity and falsehood. Concealment of a good purpose, for a good
purpose, is clearly justifiable. There is therefore nothing in the least
inconsistent with truth in the occurrence here related. Compare [Exo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#016.md); [Exo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md); [Exo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#013.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 16:4</span></span>

Trembled - There was evidently something unusual in Samuel's coming to
Bethlehem; and the elders, knowing that Samuel was no longer at
friendship with Saul, foreboded some evil.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 16:10</span></span>

Seven - i. e., including the three who had already passed. It appears
that Jesse had eight sons; but in [Ch1
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013.md), only seven are ascribed to
him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 16:11</span></span>

We will not sit down ... - . literally, we will not turn round to sit at
the table.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 16:13</span></span>

The Spirit ... came upon David - The exact phrase used of the Judges and
Saul. See [Sa1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006.md), note; [Jdg
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md), note; [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md), note; [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md), note; [Jdg
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md), note; [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md), note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 16:15</span></span>

The "evil" or "melancholy" spirit here spoken of was "the Spirit of
God," or "of Jehovah," as being God's messenger and minister, sent by
Him to execute His righteous purpose upon Saul (see [Kg1
22:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019) note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 16:16</span></span>

The medicinal effects of music on the mind and body, especially as
appeasing anger, and soothing and pacifying a troubled spirit, are well
known. It is deeply interesting to have the youthful David thus brought
before us, as using music for its highest purpose, that of turning the
soul to the harmony of peace and love. We may infer that some of his
Psalms, such e. g. as [Psa 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md),
were already composed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 16:18</span></span>

A mighty valiant man ... - David's reputation for courage, skill,
discretion, and manly beauty, was already great. Since "the Spirit of
the Lord came upon him," his natural qualities and powers had been
greatly enhanced. His feat of killing the lion and the bear (see the
marginal references) had been performed, like Samson's feats of strength
[Jdg 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006.md), [Jdg
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019.md); [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md), under the same supernatural
influence, and was probably more or less known.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 16:21</span></span>

The difficulty of reconciling this verse with [Sa1
17:55-58](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055.md), is met thus: The words here
are the ultimate sequence of David's first visit to Saul, and of his
skill in music, and are therefore placed here; but they did not really
come to pass until after David's victory over Goliath (see [Sa1
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#002).md). It is quite conceivable that if
David had only played once or twice to Saul, and then returned to his
father's house for some months, Saul might not recognize him.
