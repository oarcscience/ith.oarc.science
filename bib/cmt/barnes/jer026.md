### [Jeremiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 26:1</span></span>

Jer. 26 is a narrative of the danger to which Jeremiah was exposed by
reason of the prophecy contained in Jer. 7 and should be read in
connection with it. [Jer 26:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#004.md)
contain a summary of the prediction contained in Jer. 7, and that again
is but an outline of what was a long address.

[Jeremiah 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 26:9</span></span>

The charge against Jeremiah was that of prophesying falsely, for which
the penalty was death [Deu 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020.md). They
assumed that it was absolutely impossible that Jerusalem ever could
become like Shiloh.

Against Jeremiah - unto Jeremiah. They regularly constituted themselves
a congregation to take part in his trial.

[Jeremiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 26:10</span></span>

The princes of Judah - The priests could scourge a man etc., but could
not then try him for his life, as the Sanhedrim subsequently did until
the Romans deprived them of the power.

The new gate - That built by Jotham [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md), and probably a usual place for
trials.

[Jeremiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 26:11</span></span>

This man is worthy to die - literally, A sentence of death is to this
man, i. e., is his desert.

[Jeremiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 26:12</span></span>

The answer of Jeremiah is simple and straightforward. Yahweh, he
affirmed, had truly sent him, but the sole object of his prophesying had
been to avert the evil by leading them to repentance. If they would
amend their ways God would deliver them from the threatened doom. As for
himself he was in their hands, but if they put him to death they would
bring the guilt of shedding innocent blood upon themselves and upon the
city.

[Jeremiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 26:16</span></span>

This man ... - literally, There is not to this man a sentence of death,
i. e., he is acquitted by the princes and the congregation.

[Jeremiah 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 26:17</span></span>

The elders of the land - The heads and spokesmen of the congregation,
who added their approval after the princes who represented the king had
given their decision.

[Jeremiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 26:19</span></span>

Thus might we procure ... - Rather, And we should commit a great evil
against our own souls; i. e., by putting Jeremiah to death, we should
commit a sin which would prove a great misfortune to ourselves.

[Jeremiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 26:20</span></span>

This narrative of Urijah's fate was no part of the speech of the elders,
who would not be likely to contrast the behavior of the reigning king so
unfavorably with that of Hezekiah. Moreover, it would have been a
precedent, not for acquitting Jeremiah, but for putting him to death.
Jeremiah, when he reduced the narrative to writing, probably added this
history to show the ferocity of Jehoiakim, and the danger to which he
had been himself exposed.

[Jeremiah 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 26:21</span></span>

His mighty men - The commanders of his army; the princes are the civil
officers.

[Jeremiah 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 26:22</span></span>

Elnathan - Possibly the king's father-in-law [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md).

[Jeremiah 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 26:23</span></span>

Out of Egypt - As Jehoiakim was a vassal of Egypt, he would easily
obtain the surrender of a man accused of treason.

[Jeremiah 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 26:24</span></span>

Ahikam - See the marginal reference. His son Gemariah lent Jeremiah his
room for the public reading of Jehoiakim's scroll, and another son
Gedaliah was made governor of the land by the Chaldaeans [Jer
39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014.md); the family probably shared the
political views of Jeremiah.
