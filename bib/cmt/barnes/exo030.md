### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

[Exo 37:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#025.md); [Exo
40:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#026.md). The altar of incense was to
be a casing of boards of shittim wood [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005.md), [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md) inches square and three feet in
height (taking the cubit as 18 inches), entirely covered with plates of
gold. Four "horns" were to project upward at the corners like those of
the altar of burnt-offering [Exo 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002.md).
A crown or moulding of gold was to run round the top. On each of two
opposite sides there was to be a gold ring through which the staves were
to be put when it was moved from place to place.

[Exo 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#004.md)

By the two corners thereof - Not corners. See the margin. The sense
appears to be: And two gold rings shalt thou make for it under its
moulding; on its two sides shalt thou make them (i. e. one ring on each
side).

[Exo 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md)

The place for the altar of incense was outside the veil, opposite to the
ark of the covenant and between the candlestick on the south side and
the showbread table on the north [Exo
40:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#022.md). It appears to have been
regarded as having a more intimate connection with the holy of holies
than the other things in the holy place; and the mention of the
mercy-seat in this verse, if we associate with it the significance of
incense as figuring the prayers of the Lord's people [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md); [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md), seems to furnish additional
pound for an inference that the incense altar took precedence of the
table of showbread and the candlestick.

[Exo 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md)

The lamps - See [Exo 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037.md).

[Exo 30:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007.md)

The offering of the incense accompanied that of the morning and evening
sacrifice. The two forms of offering symbolized the spirit of man
reaching after communion with Yahweh, both in act and utterance. See
[Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md).

[Exo 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md)

By this regulation, the symbolism of the altar of incense was kept free
from ambiguity. atonement was made by means of the victim on the brazen
altar in the court ontside; the prayers of the reconciled worshippers
had their type within the tabernacle.

[Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md)

See the marginal references.

[Exodus 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 30:11</span></span>

The Ransom of Souls. - [Exo 38:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md).
On comparing these words with those of [Num
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md), we may perhaps infer that the
first passage relates to a mere counting of the adult Israelites at the
time when the money was taken from each, and that what the latter
passage enjoins was a formal enrolment of them according to their
genealogies and their order of military service.

A ransom for his soul - What the sincere worshipper thus paid was at
once the fruit and the sign of his faith in the goodness of Yahweh, who
had redeemed him and brought him into the covenant. Hence, the payment
is rightly called a ransom inasmuch as it involved a personal
appropriation of the fact of his redemption. On the word soul, see [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011.md).

That there be no plague - i. e. that they might not incur punishment for
the neglect and contempt of spiritual privileges. Compare [Exo
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035.md); [Co1
11:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#027.md); and the exhortation in our
communion Service.

[Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md)

Half a shekel - The probable weight of silver in the half-shekel would
now be worth about 1 shilling, 3 1/2d. (Compare [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md). See [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note..md) Gerah is, literally, a
bean, probably the bean of the carob or locust-tree. It was used as the
name of a small weight, as our word grain came into use from a grain of
wheat.

[Exo 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015.md)

Every Israelite stood in one and the same relation to Yahweh. See [Exo
30:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md).

[Exo 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016.md)

tabernacle of the congregation - tent of meeting, here and in [Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018.md), [Exo
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020.md),

A memorial unto the children of Israel - The silver used in the
tabernacle was a memorial to remind each man of his position before the
Lord, as one of the covenanted people.

[Exodus 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 30:17</span></span>

[Exo 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md). The bronze for the "Laver
of brass" and its foot was supplied from the bronze mirrors of the women
who voluntarily gave up these articles of luxury. Bronze mirrors were
much used by the ancient Egyptians. No hint is given as to the form of
the laver. The brazen sea and the ten lavers that served the same
purpose in the temple of Solomon, were elaborately worked in artistic
designs and are minutely described [Kg1
7:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md).

[Exo 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#019.md)

Wash their hands and their feet - On certain solemn occasions he was
required to bathe his whole person [Exo
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004.md); [Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004.md). The laver must also have
furnished the water for washing those parts of the victims that needed
cleansing [Lev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md).

[Exo 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020.md)

That they die not - See [Exo 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035.md)
note.

[Exodus 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 30:22</span></span>

Compare [Exo 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#029.md).

[Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md)

Principal spices - i. e. the best spices.

Pure myrrh - Is a gum which comes from the stem of a low, thorny, ragged
tree, that grows in Arabia Felix and Eastern Africa, called by botanists
Balsamodendron myrrha. The word here rendered pure, is literally,
"freely flowing", an epithet which is explained by the fact that the
best myrrh is said to exude spontaneously from the bark, while that of
inferior quality oozes out in greater quantity from incisions made in
the bark.

Five hundred shekels - Probably rather more than 15 1/4 lbs. See [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md).

Cinnamon - is obtained from a tree allied to the laurel that grows in
Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and other islands of the Indian Ocean, known in
Botany as the Cinnamomum zeylanicum. It is the inner rind of the tree
dried in the sun. It was imported from India in very early times by the
people of Ophir, and brought with other spices from the south part of
Arabia by the trading caravans that visited Egypt and Syria. The mention
of these spices in Exodus may be taken as the earliest notice we have
connected with commerce with the remote East.

Two hundred and fifty shekels - about 7 lbs. 14 oz.

Sweet calamus - The fragrant cane (or rush) was probably what is now
known in India as the Lemon Grass.

[Exo 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#024.md)

Cassia - is the inner bark of an Indian tree (Cinnamomum cassia), which
differs from that which produces cinnamon in the shape of its leaves and
some other particulars. It was probably in ancient times, as it is at
present, by far less costly than cinnamon, and it may have been on this
account that it was used in double quantity.

An hin - Probably about six pints. See [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md).

[Exo 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md)

An oil of holy ointment - Rather, a holy anointing oil.

After the art of the apothecary - According to Jewish tradition, the
essences of the spices were first extracted, and then mixed with the
oil. The preparation of the anointing oil, as well as of the incense,
was entrusted to Bezaleel [Exo 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#029.md),
and the care of preserving it to Eleazar, the son of Aaron [Num
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#016.md). In a later age, it was prepared
by the sons of the priests [Ch1 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#030.md).

[Exo 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032.md)

Upon man's flesh - i. e. on the persons of those who were not priests
who might employ it for such anointing as was usual on festive occasions
([Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md); [Pro
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#009.md); [Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017), etc..md).

[Exo 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#033.md)

A stranger - See [Exo 29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033.md).

Cut off from his people - See [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md).

[Exodus 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 30:34</span></span>

[Exo 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#029.md). The incense, like the
anointing oil, consisted of four aromatic ingredients.

Stacte - supposed to be either the gum of the Storax tree (Styrax
officinale) found in Syria and the neighboring countries, or the gum
known as Benzoin, or Gum Benjamin, which is an important ingredient in
the incense now used in churches and mosques, and is the produce of
another storax tree (Styrax benzoin) that grows in Java and Sumatra.

Onycha - , a perfume perhaps made from the cap of the strombus, or
wing-shell, which abounds in the Red Sea.

Galbanum - , a gum of a yellowish brown color, in the form of either
grains or masses. It is imported from India, Persia, and Africa; but the
plant from which it comes is not yet certainly known.

Pure frankincense - This was the most important of the aromatic gums.
Like myrrh, it was regarded by itself as a precious perfume [Sol
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006.md); [Mat
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011.md), and it was used unmixed with
other substances in some of the rites of the law. The tree from which it
is obtained is not found in Arabia, and it was most likely imported from
India by the Sabaeans, like Cinnamon, Cassia, and Calamus (see [Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).md). The tree is now known as the
Boswellia serrata, or B. thurifera, and grows abundantly in the
highlands of India. The frankincense of commerce is a different
substance, the resin of the spruce and of some other kinds of fir.

[Exo 30:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#035.md)

See [Exo 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md).

Tempered together - The four substances were perhaps pounded and
thoroughly mixed together, and then fused into a mass. This rendering is
to be preferred to that in the margin.

[Exo 30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036.md)

See [Exo 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md).

[Exo 30:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#037.md)

Compare [Exo 30:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032.md).
