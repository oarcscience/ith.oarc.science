### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 1:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass ... - There is no break whatever between the two
books of Samuel, the division being purely artificial.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 1:9</span></span>

Anguish - The Hebrew word used here occurs nowhere else, and is of
doubtful meaning (compare the margin). The rabbis interpret it as a
cramp or giddiness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 1:10</span></span>

The Amalekite was one of those who came "to strip the slain" on "the
morrow" after the battle [Sa1 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008.md),
and had the luck to find Saul and possess himself of his crown and
bracelet. He probably started off immediately to seek David, and
invented the above story, possibly having heard from some Israelite
prisoner an account of what really did happen.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 1:12</span></span>

For Saul ... - David's thoroughly patriotic and unselfish character is
strongly marked here. He looked upon the death of Saul, and the defeat
of Israel by a pagan foe, with unmixed sorrow, though it opened to him
the way to the throne, and removed his mortal enemy out of the way. For
Jonathan he mourned with all the tenderness of a loving friend.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 1:13</span></span>

Whether David believed the Amalekite's story, or not, his anger was
equally excited, and the fact that the young man was an Amalekite, was
not calculated to calm or check it. That David's temper was hasty, we
know from [Sa1 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#013.md), [Sa1
25:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#032.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 1:16</span></span>

David might well think his sentence just though severe, for he had more
than once expressed the deliberate opinion that none could lift up his
hand against the Lord's anointed, and be guiltless (see [Sa1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006.md); [Sa1
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md), [Sa1
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#011.md), [Sa1
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#016).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 1:17</span></span>

The words lamented and lamentation must be understood in the technical
sense of a funeral dirge or mournful elegy. (See similar dirges in [Sa2
3:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033.md); and [Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025)..md) This and the brief stanza on
the death of Abner are the only specimens preserved to us of David's
secular poetry.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 1:18</span></span>

The use of the bow - Omit "the use of." "The bow" is the name by which
this dirge was known, being so called from the mention of Jonathan's bow
in [Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md). The sense would then be:
And he commanded them to teach the children of Israel the song called
Kasheth (the bow), i. e. he gave directions that the song should be
learned by heart (compare [Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019).md).
It has been further suggested that in the Book of Jasher there was,
among other things, a collection of poems, in which special mention was
made of the bow. This was one of them. [Sa1
2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md) was another; [Num
21:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027.md) was another; Lam. 2 was
another; Lam. 3 was another; Jacob's blessing Gen. 49; Moses' song Deut.
32; perhaps his Blessing (Deut. 33. See 2 Sam. 1:29); and such Psalms as
Ps. 44; [Psa 46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md); [Psa
76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md), etc.; Hab. 3; and [Zac
9:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md), also belonged to it. The title
by which all the poems in this collection were distinguished was קשׁת
qesheth, "the bow." When therefore the writer of 2 Samuel transferred
this dirge from the Book of Jasher to his own pages, he transferred it,
as we might do any of the Psalms, with its title.

The book of Jasher - See the marginal reference note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 1:19</span></span>

The beauty ... - i. e. Saul and Jonathan who were the chief ornament and
pride of Israel, and slain upon "high places" [Sa2
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025.md), namely, on Mount Gilboa.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 1:20</span></span>

Gath, the royal city of Achish [Sa1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md); [Sa1
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002.md). Askelon, the chief seat of
worship ([Sa1 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010) note.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 1:21</span></span>

Let there be no dew ... - For a similar passionate form of poetical
malediction, compare [Job 3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md); [Jer
20:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md).

Nor fields of offerings - He imprecates such complete barrenness on the
soil of Gilboa, that not even enough may grow for an offering of
first-fruits. The latter part of the verse is better rendered thus: For
there the shield of the mighty was polluted, the shield of Saul was not
anointed with oil, but with blood). Shields were usually anointed with
oil in preparation for the battle [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 1:24</span></span>

The women of Israel are most happily introduced. They who had come out
to meet king Saul with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music"
in the day of victory, are now called to weep over him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 1:25</span></span>

How are the mighty fallen - The recurrenee of the same idea [Sa2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#019.md), [Sa2
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#025.md), [Sa2
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#027.md) is perfectly congenial to the
nature of elegy, since grief is fond of dwelling upon the particular
objects of the passion, and frequently repeating them. By unanimous
consent this is considered one of the most beautiful odes in the Bible,
and the generosity of David in thus mourning for his enemy and
persecutor, Saul, enhances the effect upon the mind of the reader.
