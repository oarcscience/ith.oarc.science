### [Joshua Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 5:1</span></span>

The Amorites were the principal of those nations which occupied the hill
country of Judaea ([Gen 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#016) note.md);
the Canaanites of those that dwelt on the coast and low lands. These
words are therefore equivalent to "all the kings of the highlanders, and
all the kings of the lowlanders:" i. e. the kings of all the tribes of
the country.

Until we were passed over - The use of the first person has been noted
here, and in [Jos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md) (compare [Act
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010).md), as suggesting the hand of one
who himself shared in what he describes. But the text as read (though
not written) by the Jewish authorities here, has the third person; as
have some manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate, etc.: and a change of person
like this in Hebrew, even if the text stand, does not of itself warrant
the inference. (Compare [Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)..md)

[Joshua 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 5:2</span></span>

Make thee sharp knives - Render rather as marg., and compare marginal
reference and note. Knives of flint or stone were in fact used for
circumcision, and retained for that and other sacred purposes, even
after iron had become in common use. The rendering of the margin is
adopted by almost all ancient versions, by most commentators, and by the
fathers generally, who naturally regarded circumcision performed by
Joshua and by means of knives of stone or rock, as symbolic of the true
circumcision performed by Christ, who is more than once spoken of as the
Rock (compare [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md); [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md). See [Jos
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042.md).

Circumcise again ... - i. e. make that which once was a circumcised
people but is not so now, once more a circumcised people. (See [Jos
4:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004)..md)

[Joshua 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 5:3</span></span>

The hill of the foreskins - i. e. the hill where the foreskins, the
emblem of all worldly and carnal affections, were buried. (Compare [Col
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md); [Col
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)..md)

[Joshua 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 5:4</span></span>

Of the whole nation those only were already circumcised at the time of
the passage of the Jordan who had been under twenty years of age at the
time of the complaining and consequent rejection at Kadesh (compare the
marginal reference). These would have been circumcised before they left
Egypt, and there would still survive of them more than a quarter of a
million of thirty-eight years old and upward.

The statements of these verses are of a general kind. The "forty years"
of [Jos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md) is a round number, and the
statement in the latter part of [Jos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005.md) cannot be strictly accurate. For
there must have been male children born in the wilderness during the
first year after the Exodus, and these must have been circumcised before
the celebration of the Passover at Sinai in the first month of the
second year (compare [Num 9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md), and
[Exo 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048).md). The statements of the
verses are, however, sufficiently close to the facts for the purpose in
hand; namely, to render a reason for the general circumcising which is
here recorded.

The reason why circumcision was omitted in the wilderness, was that the
sentence of [Num 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md) ff placed the
whole nation for the time under a ban; and that the discontinuance of
circumcision, and the consequent omission of the Passover, was a
consequence and a token of that ban. The rejection was not, indeed,
total, for the children of the complainers were to enter into the rest;
nor final, for when the children had borne the punishment of the
fathers' sins for the appointed years, and the complainers were dead,
then it was to be removed, as now by Joshua. But for the time the
covenant was abrogated, though God's purpose to restore it was from the
first made known, and confirmed by the visible marks of His favor which
He still vouchsafed to bestow during the wandering. The years of
rejection were indeed exhausted before the death of Moses (compare [Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014).md): but God would not call upon the
people to renew their engagement to Him until He had first given them
glorious proof of His will and power to fulfill His engagements to them.
So He gave them the first fruits of the promised inheritance - the
kingdoms of Sihon and Og; and through a miracle planted their feet on
the very soil that still remained to be conquered; and then recalled
them to His covenant. It is to be noted, too, that they were just about
to go to war against foes mightier than themselves. Their only hope of
success lay in the help of God. At such a crisis the need of full
communion with God would be felt indeed; and the blessing and strength
of it are accordingly granted.

The revival of the two great ordinances - circumcision and the Passover
- after so long an intermission could not but awaken the zeal and
invigorate the faith and fortitude of the people. Both as seals and as
means of grace and God's good purpose toward them then, the general
circumcision of the people, followed up by the solemn celebration of the
Passover - the one formally restoring the covenant and reconciling them
nationally to God, the other ratifying and confirming all that
circumcision intended - were at this juncture most opportune.

[Joshua 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 5:8</span></span>

The circumcision must have taken place on the day after the passage of
Jordan, i. e. the 11th Nisan, and the Passover was kept on the 14th of
the same month. For so long at least, they who had been circumcised
would be disabled from war (compare the marginal reference), though they
would not necessarily be debarred from keeping the feast. The submission
of the people to the rite was a proof of faith, even though we remember
that the panic of the Canaanites [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md) would render any immediate attack
from them unlikely, and that there must have been a large number of "men
of war" who would not need to be circumcised at all (see the note at
[Jos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#004).md).

[Joshua 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 5:9</span></span>

The reproach of Egypt - i. e. "reproach proceeding from Egypt." The
expression probably refers to taunts actually uttered by the Egyptians
against Israel, because of their long wanderings in the desert and
failures to acquire a settlement in Canaan (compare [Exo
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012.md); [Num
14:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md); [Deu
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#028.md); [Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027).md). These reproaches were now to
end, for they had actually entered Canaan, and the restoration of the
covenant was a pledge from God to accomplish what was begun for them.

[Joshua 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 5:11</span></span>

Old corn of the land - Rather "produce of the land," the new grain just
coming in at the time of the Passover. (So in [Jos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#012)..md)

On the morrow after the passover - These words denote in [Num
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md) the 15th Nisan, but must here
apparently mean the 16th. For the Israelites could not lawfully eat of
the new grain until the first fruits of it had been presented, and this
was done on "the morrow after the Sabbath," i. e. the morrow after the
first day of Unleavened Bread, which was to be observed as a Sabbath,
and is therefore so called. (Compare [Lev
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md), [Lev
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md), [Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014)..md)

The term Passover, which is sometimes used for the lamb slain on the
evening of the 14th Nisan, sometimes for the paschal meal, sometimes for
the whole eight days' festival, here means the first great day of the
eight, the Sabbath of the first holy convocation.

[Joshua 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 5:13</span></span>

A man - See [Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md), note; [Gen
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002.md), note. The appearance was that of
God manifested in the Person of His Word. Hence, the command of [Jos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#015.md). That the appearance was not in a
vision merely is clear from the fact that Joshua "went unto Him" and
addressed Him.

[Joshua 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 5:14</span></span>

Captain of the host of the Lord - i. e. of the angelic host, the host of
heaven (compare [Kg1 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md); [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003), etc..md). The armed people of Israel
are never called "the host of the Lord," though once spoken of in [Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md) as "all the hosts of the Lord."
The Divine Person intimates that He, the Prince (see the marginal
references) of the Angels had come to lead Israel in the coming strife,
and to overthrow by heavenly might the armies and the strongholds of
God's and Israel's enemies. Accordingly, the capture of Jericho and the
destruction of the Canaanites generally form a fit type of a grander and
more complete conquest and excision of the powers of evil which yet
waits accomplishment. (Compare with this verse [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md); [Th2
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)..md)
