### [Zephaniah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 2:1</span></span>

Having set forth the terrors of the Judgment Day, the prophet adds an
earnest call to repentance; and then declares how judgments, forerunners
of that Day, shall fall, one by one, on those nations around, who know
not God, and shall rest upon Nineveh, the great beautiful ancient city
of the world. Jerome: "See the mercy of God. It had been enough to have
set before the wise the vehemence of the coming evil. But because He
willeth not to punish, but to alarm only, Himself calleth to repentance,
that He may not do what He threatened." Cyril: "Having set forth clearly
the savageness of the war and the greatness of the suffering to come, he
suitably turns his discourse to the duty of calling to repentance, when
it was easy to persuade them, being terrified. For sometimes when the
mind has been numbed, and exceedingly bent to evil, we do not readily
admit even the will to repent, but fear often drives us to it, even
against our will. He calls us then to friendship with Himself. For as
they revolted, became aliens, serving idols and giving up their mind to
their passions, so they would, as it were, retrace their steps, and lay
hold of the friendship of God, choosing to serve Him, nay and Him Alone,
and obey His commandments. Wherefore, while we have time, while the
Lord, in His forbearance as God, gives way, let us enact repentance,
supplicate, say weeping, "remember not the sins and offences of my
youth" [Psa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md); let us unite
ourselves with Him by sanctification and sobriety. So shall we be
sheltered in the day of wrath, and wash away the stain of our falls,
before the Day of the Lord come upon us. For the Judge will come, He
will come from heaven at the due season, and will reward each according
to his work."

Gather yourselves together, yea gather together - o, rather, "Sift
yourselves, yea sift" . The exact image is from gathering stubble or dry
sticks, which are picked up one by one, with search and care.

So must men deal with the dry and withered leaves of a past evil life.
The English rendering however, comes to the same meaning. We use,
"collect oneself" for bringing oneself, all one's thoughts, together,
and so, having full possession of oneself. Or "gathering ourselves"
might stand in contrast with being "abroad," as it were, out of
ourselves amid the manifoldness of things seen. Jerome: "Thou who, taken
up with the business of the world, hurriest to and fro amid divers
things, return to the Church of the saints, and join thyself to their
life and assembly, whom thou seest to please God, and bring together the
dislocated members of thy soul, which now are not knit together, into
one frame of wisdom, and cleave to its embrace." "Gather yourselves"
into one, wherein ye have been scattered; to the One God, from whom they
had wandered, seeking pleasure from His many creatures; to His one fold
and Church, from which they had severed themselves outwardly by joining
the worship of Baal, inwardly, by serving him and his abominable rites;
joining and joined to the assembly of the faithful, by oneness of faith
and life.

In order to repent, a man must know himself thoroughly; and this can
only be done by taking act by act, word by word, thought by thought, as
far as he can, not in a confused heap or mass, as they lie in any man's
conscience, but one by one, each picked up apart, and examined, and
added to the sear unfruitful heap, plucking them as it were, and
gathering them out of himself, that so they may, by the Spirit of
burning, the fire of God's Spirit kindling repentance, be burned up, and
not the sinner himself be fuel for fire with them. The word too is
intensive, "Gather together all which is in you, thoroughly, piece by
piece" (for the sinner's whole self becomes chaff, dry and empty). To
use another image, "Sift yourselves thoroughly, so that nothing escape,
as far as your diligence can reach, and then - "And gather on," that is,
"glean on;" examine yourselves, "not lightly and after the manner of
dissemblers before God," but repeatedly, gleaning again and again, to
see if by any means anything have escaped: continuing on the search and
ceasing not.

The first earnest search into the soul must be the beginning, not the
end. Our search must be continued, until there be no more to be
discovered, that is, when sin is no more, and we see ourselves in the
full light of the presence of our Judge. For a first search, however
diligent, never thoroughly reaches the whole deep disease of the whole
man; the most grievous sins hide other grievous sins, though lighter.
Some sins flash on the conscience, at one time, some at another; so that
few, even upon a diligent search, come at once to the knowledge of all
their heaviest sins. When the mist is less thick, we see more clearly
what was before one dark dull mass of imperfection and misery. :
"Spiritual sins are also with difficulty sifted, (as they are,) by one
who is carnal. Whence it happens, that things in themselves heavier he
perceives less or very little, and conscience is not grieved so much by
the memory of pride or envy, as of impurities and crimes."

So having said, "Sift yourselves through and through," he says, "sift
on." A diligent sifting and search into himself must be the beginning of
all true repentance and pardon. : "What remains, but that we give
ourselves wholly to this work, so holy, and needful? "Let us search and
try our ways and our doings" , and let each think that he has made
progress, not if he find not what to blame, but if he blame what he
finds. Thou hast not sifted thyself in vain, if thou hast discovered
that thou needest a fresh sitting; and so often has thy search not
failed thee, as thou judgest that it must be renewed. But if thou ever
dost this, when there is need, thou dost it ever. But ever remember that
thou needest help from above and the mercy of Jesus Christ our Lord Who
is over all, God blessed forever." The whole course of self-examination
then lies in two words of divine Scripture. And withal he warns them,
instead of gathering together riches which shall "not be able to deliver
them in the day of trouble," to gather themselves into themselves, and
so "judge" themselves "thoroughly , that they be not judged of the Lord"
[Co1 11:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md).

O nation not desired - o, that is, having nothing in itself to be
desired or loved, but rather, for its sin, hateful to God. God yearneth
with pity and compassion over His creatures; He "hath a desire to the
work of His Hands" . Here Israel is spoken to, as what he had made
himself, hateful to God by his sins, although still an object of His
tender care, in what yet remained to him of nature or grace which was
from Himself.

[Zephaniah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zep 2:2</span></span>

Before the decree bring forth - God's word is full (as it were) of the
event which it foretelleth; it contains its own fulfillment in itself,
and "travaileth" until it come to pass, giving signs of its coming, yet
delaying until the full time. Time is said to bring forth what is
wrought in it. "Thou knowest not, what a day shall bring forth."

Before the day pass as the chaff - Or, parenthetically, "like chaff the
day passeth by." God's counsels lie wrapt up, as it were, in the womb of
time, wherein He hides them, until the moment which He has appointed,
and they break forth suddenly to those who look not for them. The mean
season is given for repentance, that is, the day of grace, the span of
repentance still allowed, which is continually whirling more swiftly by;
and woe, if it be fruitless as chaff! Those who profit not by it shall
also be as chaff, carried away pitilessly by the whirlwind to
destruction. Time, on which eternity hangs, is a slight, uncertain
thing, as little to be counted upon, as the light dry particles which
are the sport of the wind, driven uncertainly here and there. But when
it is "passed," then "cometh," not "to" them, but "upon" them, from
heaven, overwhelming them, "abiding upon" [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md) them, not to pass away, "the heat
of the anger of Almighty God." This warning he twice repeats, to impress
the certainty and speed of its conming [Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032.md). It is the warning of our Lord,
"Take heed, lest that day come upon you unawares" [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md).

[Zephaniah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 2:3</span></span>

Seek ye the Lord - He had exhorted sinners to penitence; he now calls
the righteous to persevere and increase more and more. He bids them
"seek diligently" , and that with a three-fold call, to seek Him from
whom they received daily the three-fold blessing [Num
6:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md), Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
as he had just before threatened God's impending judgment with the same
use of the mysterious number, three. They, whom he calls, were already,
by the grace of God, "meek," and "had wrought His judgment." Rup.:
"Submitting themselves to the word of God, they had done and were doing
the judgment of God, 'judging themselves that they benot judged;' the
beginning of which judgment is, as sinners and guilty of death, to give
themselves to the Cross of the Lord, that is, to be 'baptized' in 'His
Death and be buried with Him by Baptism into death;' but the perfection
of that judgment or righteousness is, to 'walk in newness of life, as He
rose from the dead through the glory of the Father' [Rom
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md)."

Dionysius: "Since the meek already have God through grace as the
Possessor and Dweller in their heart, how shall they seek Him but that
they may have Him more fully and more perfectly, knowing Him more
clearly, loving Him more ardently, cleaving to Him more inseparably,
that so they may be heard by Him, not for themselves only, but for
others?" It is then the same Voice as at the close of the Revelation,
"the righteous, let him be still more righteous; the holy, let him be
still more holy" [Rev 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011.md). They are
the "meek," who are exhorted "diligently" to "seek meekness," and they
who had "wrought His judgment," who are "diligently" to "seek
Righteousness." And since our Lord saith, "Learn of Me, for I am meek
and lowly of heart" [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), He
bids (Jerome) "those who imitated His meekness and did His judgment, to
seek the Lord in their meekness." Meekness and Righteousness may be His
Attributes, Who is All-gentleness and All-Righteousness, the Fountain of
all, wheresoever it is, in gentleness receiving penitents, and, as "the
Righteous Judge, giving the crown of righteousness" to those who "love
Him and keep His commandments," yea He joineth righteousness with
meekness, since without His mercy no man living could be justified in
His Sight. Cyril: "God is sought by us, when, of our choice, laying
aside all listlessness, we thirst after doing what pleases Him; and we
shall do judgment too, when we fulfill His divine law, working out what
is good unshrinkingly; and we shall gain the prize of righteousness,
when crowned with glory for well-doing and running the well-reported
anti blameless way of true piety to God and of love to the brethren, for
'love is the fulfilling of the law' [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010.md)."

It may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger - Rup.: "Shall
these too then scarcely be 'hid in the day of the Lord's anger?' Doth
not the Apostle Peter say the very same? 'If it first begin at us, what
shall be the end of them that obey not the Gospel of God? And if the
righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear?' [Pe1 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md). So then,
although any be 'meek,' although he 'have wrought the judgment' of the
Lord, let him ever suspect himself, nor think that he has 'already
attained,' since neither can any righteous be saved, if he be judged
'without mercy.'" Dionysius: "He saith, if 'may' be; not that there is
any doubt that the meek and they who perseveringly seek God, shall then
be saved, but, to convey how difficult it is to be saved, and how
fearful and rigorous is the judgment of God." To be hid is to be
sheltered from wrath under the protection of God; as David says, "In the
time of trouble He shall hide me" [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); and, "Thou shalt hide them (that
trust in Thee) in the secret of Thy presence from the pride of man; Thou
shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues" [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md). And in Isaiah, "A Man shall be
as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest" [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); and, "There shall be a
tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of
refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain" [Isa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md).

[Zephaniah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 2:4</span></span>

For - As a ground for repentance and perseverance, he goes through Pagan
nations, upon whom God's wrath should come. Jerome: "As Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, after visions concerning Judah, turn to other nations
round about, and according to the character of each, announce what shall
come upon them, and dwell at length upon it, so doth this prophet,
though more briefly" And thus under five nations, who lay west, east,
south and north, he includes all mankind on all sides, and, again,
according to their respective characters toward Israel, as they are
alien from, or hostile to the Church; the Philistines [Zep
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md), as a near, malicious, infesting
enemy; Moab and Ammon [Isa 2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008.md),
people akin to her (as heretics) yet ever rejoicing at her troubles and
sufferings; Etheopians [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md),
distant nations at peace with her, and which are, for the most part,
spoken of as to be brought unto her; Assyria Isa. 13-15, as the great
oppressive power of the world, and so upon it the full desolation rests.

In the first fulfillment, because Moab and Ammon aiding Nebuchadnezzar,
(and all, in various ways wronging God's people [Isa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md); [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md); [Amo
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md); [Jer
48:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md), [Jer
48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md); [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md); [Eze
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003.md), [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006.md), [Eze
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008).md), trampled on His sanctuary,
overthrew His temple and blasphemed the Lord, the prophecy is turned
against them. So then, before the captivity came, while Josiah was yet
king, and Jerusalem and the temple were, as yet, not overthrown, the
prophecy is directed against those who mocked at them. "Gaza shall be
forsaken." Out of the five cities of the Philistines, the prophet
pronounces woe upon the same four as Amos [Amo
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md) before, Jeremiah [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) soon after, and Zechariah [Zac
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md) later. Gath, then, the fifth had
probably remained with Judah since Uzziah [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md) and Hezekiah [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md). In the sentence of the rest,
regard is had (as is so frequent in the Old Testament) to the names of
the places themselves, that, henceforth, the name of the place might
suggest the thought of the doom pronounced upon it.

The names expressed boastfulness, and so, in the divine judgment,
carried their own sentence with them, and this sentence is pronounced by
a slight change in the word. Thus 'Azzah' (Gaza,) 'strong' shall be
'Azoobah, desolated;' "Ekron, deep-rooting" , shall "Teaker, be
uprooted;" the "Cherethites" (cutters off) shall become (Cheroth)
"diggings;" "Chebel, the band" of the sea coast, shall be in another
sense "Chebel," an "inheritance" [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md), [Zep
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007.md), divided by line to the remnant of
Judah; and "Ashdod" (the waster shall be taken in their might, not by
craft, nor in the way of robbers, but "driven forth" violently and
openly in the "noon-day."

For Gaza shall be forsaken - Some vicissitudes of these towns have been
noted already . The fulfillment of the prophecy is not tied down to
time; the one marked contrast is, that the old pagan enemies of Judah
should be destroyed, the house of Judah should be restored, and should
re-enter upon the possession of the land, promised to them of old. The
Philistine towns had, it seems, nothing to fear from Babylon or Persia,
to whom they remained faithful subjects. The Ashdodites (who probably,
as the most important, stand for the whole ) combined with Sanballat,
"the Ammonites and the Arabians" [Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md), to hinder the rebuilding of the
walls of Jerusalem. Even an army was gathered, headed by Samaria Neh. 2.

They gave themselves out as loyal, Jerusalem as rebellious [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md); [Neh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#006.md). The old sin remaining, Zechariah
renewed the sentence by Zephaniah against the four cities Zech. 9; a
prophecy, which an unbeliever also has recognized as picturing the march
of Alexander . : "All the other cities of Palestine having submitted,"
Gaza alone resisted the conqueror for two or five months. It had come
into the hands of the Persians in the expedition of Cambyses against
Egypt . The Gazaeans having all perished fighting at their posts,
Alexander sold the women and children, and re-populated the city from
the neighborhood . Palestine lay between the two rival successors of
Alexander, the Ptolemies and Seleucidae, and felt their wars .

Gaza fell through mischance into the hands of Ptolemy , 11 years after
the death of Alexander , and soon after, was destroyed by Antiochus (198
b.c.), "preserving its faith to Ptolemy" as before to the Persians, in a
way admired by a pagan historian. In the Maccabee wars, Judas Maccabaeus
chiefly destroyed the idols of Ashdod, but also "spoiled their cities"
(1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan set it on fire, with its idol-temple, which was
a sort of citadel to it (1 Macc. 10:84); Ascalon submitted to him (1
Macc. 10:86); Ekron with its borders were given to him by Alexander
Balas (1 Macc. 10:89); he burned the suburbs of Gaza (1 Macc. 11:61);
Simon took it, expelled its inhabitants, filled it with believing Jews
and fortified it more strongly than before (1 Macc. 13:43-48); but,
after a year's siege, it was betrayed to Alexander Jannaeus, who killed
its senate of 500 and razed the city to the ground .

Gabinius restored it and Ashdod . After Herod's death, Ashdod was given
to Salome ; Gaza, as being a Greek city , was detached from the realm of
Archelaus and annexed to Syria. It was destroyed by the Jews in their
revolt when Florus was "procurator," 55 A.D . Ascalon and Gaza must
still have been strong, and were probably a distinct population in the
early times of Antipater, father of Herod, when Alexander and Alexandra
set him over all Idumaea, since "he is said" then "to have made
friendship with the Arabs, Gazites and Ascalonites, likeminded with
himself, and to have attached them by many and large presents."

Yet though the inhabitants were changed, the hereditary hatred remained.
Philo in his Embassy to Caius, 40 a.d., used the strong language , "The
Ascalonites have an implacable and irreconcilable enmity to the Jews,
their neighbors, who inhabit the holy land." This continued toward
Christians. Some horrible atrocities, of almost inconceivable savagery,
by these of Gaza and Ascalon 361 a.d., are related by Theodoret and
Sozomen . : "Who is ignorant of the madness of the Gazaeans?" asks
Gregory of Nazianzus, of the times of Julian. This was previous to the
conversion of the great Gazite temple of Marna into a Christian Church
by Eudoxia . On occasion of Constantine's exemption of the Maiumas Gazae
from their control, it is alleged, that they were "extreme heathen." In
the time of the Crusades the Ascalonites are described by Christians as
their "most savage enemies."

It may be, that a likeness of sin may have continued on a likeness of
punishment. But the primary prediction was against the people, not
against the walls. The sentence, "Gaza shall be forsaken," would have
been fulfilled by the removal or captivity of its inhabitants, even if
they had not been replaced by others. A prediction against any ancient
British town would have been fulfilled, if the Britons in it had been
replaced or exterminated by Danes, and these by Saxons, and these
subdued by the Normans, though their displacers became wealthy and
powerful in their place. Even on the same site it would not be the same
Gaza, when the Philistine Gaza became Edomite, and the Edomite Greek,
and the Greek Arabian . Ashdod (as well as Gaza) is spoken of as a city
of the Greeks ; New Gaza is spoken of as a mixture of Turks, Arabians,
Fellahs, Bedouins out of Egypt, Syria, Petraea . Felix Faber says,
"there is a wonderful com-mixture of divers nations in it, Ethiopians,
Arabs, Egyptians, Syrians, Indians and eastern Christians; no Latins ."
Its Jewish inhabitants fled from it in the time of Napoleon: now, with
few exceptions it is inhabited by Arabs .

But these, Ghuzzeh, Eskalon, Akir, Sedud, are at most successors of the
Philistine cities, of which there is no trace above the surface of the
earth. It is common to speak of "remnants of antiquity," as being or not
being to be found in any of them; but this means, that, where these
exist, there are remains of a Greek or Roman, not of a Philistine city.

Of the four cities, "Akkaron," Ekron, ("the firm-rooting") has not left
a vestage. It is mentioned by name only, after the times of the Bible,
by some who passed by it . There was "a large village of Jews" so called
in the time of Eusebius and Jerome , "between Azotus and Jamnia." Now a
village of "about 50 mud houses without a single remnant of antiquity
except 2 large finely built wells" bears the name of Akir. Jerome adds,
"Some think that Accaron is the tower of Strato, afterward called
Caesarea." This was perhaps derived from misunderstanding his Jewish
instructor . But it shows how entirely all knowledge of Ekron was then
lost.

Ashdod - Or Azotus which, at the time when Zephaniah prophesied, held
out a twenty-nine years' siege against Psammetichus, is replaced by "a
moderate sized village of mud houses, situated on the eastern declivity
of a little flattish hill," "entirely modern, not containing a vestige
of antiquity." "A beautiful sculptured sarcophagus with some fragments
of small marble shafts," "near the Khan on the southwest." belong of
course to later times. "The whole south side of the hill appears also,
as if it had been once covered with buildings, the stones of which are
now thrown together in the rude fences." Its Bishops are mentioned from
the Council of Nice to 536 a.d. , and so probably continued until the
Muslim devastation. It is not mentioned in the Talmud . Benjamin of
Tudela calls it Palmis, and says, "it is desolate, and there are no Jews
in it ." : "Neither Ibn Haukal (Yacut), Edrisi, Abulfeda, nor William of
Tyre mention it."

Ascalon and Gaza had each a port, Maiuma Gazae, Maiuma Ascalon;
literally, "a place on the sea" (an Egyptian name ) belonging to Ascalon
or Gaza. The name involves that Ascalon and Gaza themselves, the old
Philistine towns, were not on the sea. They were, like Athens, built
inland, perhaps (as has been conjectured) from fear of the raids of
pirates, or of inroads from those who (like the Philistines themselves
probably, or some tribe of them) might come from the sea. The port
probably of both was built in much later times; the Egyptian name
implies that they were built by Egyptians, after the time when its kings
Necos and Apries, (Pharaoh-Necho and Pharaoh-Hophra, who took Gaza [Jer
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001).md) made Egypt a naval power . This
became a characteristic of these Philistine cities. They themselves lay
more or less inland, and had a city connected with them of the same
name, on the shore. Thus there was an , "Azotus by the sea," and an
"Azotus Ispinus." There were "two Iamniae, one inland." But Ashdod lay
further from the sea than Gaza; Yamnia, (the Yabneel of Joshua [Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md), in Uzziah's time, Yabneh [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006).md) further than Ashdod. The port of
Yamnia was burned by Judas (2 Macc. 12:9).

The "name," Maiumas, does not appear until Christian times, though "the
port of Gaza" is mentioned by Strabo : to it, Alexander brought from
Tyre the machines, with which he took Gaza itself . That port then must
have been at some distance from Gaza. Each port became a town, large
enough to have, in Christian times, a Bishop of its own. The Epistle of
John of Jerusalem, inserted in the Acts of the Council of
Constantinople, 536 a.d., written in the name of Palestine i., ii., and
iii., is signed by a Bishop of Maiumen of Ascalon, as well as by a
Bishop of Ascalon, as it is by a Bishop of Maiumas of Gaza as well as by
a Bishop of Gaza. . Yabne, or Yamnia, was on a small eminence , 6 12
hours from the sea .

The Maiumas Gazae became the more known. To it, as being Christian,
Constantine gave the right of citizenship, and called it Constantia from
his son, making it a city independent of Gaza. Julian the Apostate gave
to Gaza (which, though it had Bishops and Martyrs, had a pagan temple at
the beginning of the 5th century) its former jurisdiction over it, and
though about 20 furlongs off, it was called "the maritime portion of
Gaza" . It had thenceforth the same municipal officers; but, "as regards
the Church alone," Sozomen adds, "they still appear to be two cities;
each has its own Bishop and clergy, and festivals and martyrs, and
commemorations of those who had been their Bishops, and 'boundaries of
the fields around,' whereby the altars which belong to each Episcopate
are parted." The provincial Synod decided against the desire of a Bishop
of Gaza, in Sozomen's time, who wished to bring the Clergy of the
Maiumites under himself ruling that "although deprived of their civil
privileges by a pagan king, they should not be deprived of those of the
Church."

In 400 a.d., then, the two cities were distinct, not joined or running
into one another.

Jerome mentions it as "Maiumas, the emporium of Gaza, 7 miles from the
desert on the way to Egypt by the sea;" Sozomen speaks of "Gaza by the
sea, which they also call Maiumas;" Evagrius , "that which they also
call Maiumas, which is over against the city Gaza" , "a little city."
Mark the deacon, 421 a.d., says , "We sailed to the maritime portion of
Gaza, which they call Maiumas," and Antoninus Martyr, about the close of
the 6th century , "we came from Ascalon to Mazomates, and came thence,
after a mile, to Gaza - that magnificent and lovely city." This perhaps
explains how an anonymous Geographer, enumerating the places from Egypt
to Tyre, says so distinctly , "after Rinocorura lies the new Gaza, being
itself also a city; then the desert Gaza," (writing, we must suppose,
after some of the destructions of Gaza); and Jerome could say equally
positively ; "The site of the ancient city scarce yields the traces of
foundations; but the city now seen was built in another place in lieu of
that which fell."

Keith, who in 1844 explored the spot, found widespread traces of some
extinct city.

: "At seven furlongs from the sea the manifold but minute remains of an
ancient city are yet in many places to be found - Innumerable fragments
of broken pottery, pieces of glass, (some beautifully stained) and of
polished marble, lie thickly spread in every level and hollow, at a
considerable elevation and various distances, on a space of several
square miles. In fifty different places they profusely lie, in a level
space far firmer than the surrounding sands," "from small patches to
more open spaces of twelve or twenty thousand square yards." "The oblong
sand-hill, greatly varied in its elevation and of an undulated surface,
throughout which they recur, extends to the west and west-southwest.
from the sea nearly to the environs of the modern Gaza." "In attempts to
cultivate the sand (in 1832) hewn stones were found, near the old port.
Remains of an old wall reached to the sea. - Ten large fragments of wall
were embedded in the sand. About 2 miles off are fragments of another
wall. Four intermediate fountains still exist, nearly entire in a line
along the coast, doubtless pertaining to the ancient port of Gaza. For a
short distance inland, the debris is less frequent, as if marking the
space between it and the ancient city, but it again becomes plentiful in
every hollow. About half a mile from the sea we saw three pedestals of
beautiful marble. Holes are still to be seen from which hewn stones had
been taken."

On the other hand, since the old Ashkelon had, like Gaza, Jamnia,
Ashdod, a sea-port town, belonging to it but distinct from itself, (the
city itself lying distinct and inland), and since there is no space for
two towns distinct from one another, within the circuit of the Ashkelon
of the crusades, which is limited by the nature of the ground, there
seems to be no choice but that the city of the crusades, and the present
skeleton, should have been the Maiumas Ascalon, the sea-port. The change
might the more readily take place, since the title "port" was often
omitted. The new town obliterated the memory of the old, as Neapelis,
Naples, on the shore, has taken place of the inland city (whatever its
name was), or Utrecht, it is said, has displaced the old Roman town, the
remains of which are three miles off at Vechten , or Sichem is called
Neapolis, Nablous, which yet was 3 miles off (Jerome).

Erriha is, probably, at least the second representative of the ancient
Jericho; the Jericho of the New Testament, built by Herod, not being the
Jericho of the prophets. The Corcyra of Greek history gave its name to
the island; it is replaced by a Corfu in a different but near locality,
which equally gives its name to the island now. The name of Venetia
migrated with the inhabitants of the province, who fled from Attila,
some 23 miles, to a few of the islands on the coast, to become again the
name of a great republic . In our own country, "old Windsor" is said to
have been the residence of the Saxon monarchs; the present Windsor, was
originally "new Windsor: old Sarum was the Cathedral city, until the
reign of Henry iii: but, as the old towns decayed, the new towns came to
be called Windsor, Sarum, though not the towns which first had the name.
What is now called Shoreham, not many years ago, was called "new
Shoreham," in distinction from the neighboring village .

William of Tyre describes Ashkelon as "situated on the sea-shore, in the
form of a semi-circle, whose chord or diameter lies on the sea-shore;
but its circumference or arc on the land, looking east. The whole city
lies as in a trench, all declining toward the sea, surrounded on all
sides by raised mounds, on which are walls with numerous towers of solid
masonry, the cement being harder than the stone, with walls of due
thickness and of height proportionate; it is surmounted also with outer
walls of the same solidity." He then describes its four gates,
east-north-south toward Jerusalem, Gaza, Joppa, and the west, called the
sea-gate, because "by it the inhabitants have an egress to the sea."

A modern traveler, whose description of the ruins exactly agrees with
this, says , "the walls are built on a ridge of rocks that winds round
the town in a semicircular direction and terminates at each end in the
sea; the ground falls within the walls in the same manner, that it does
without, so that no part of it could be seen from the outside of the
walls. There is no bay nor shelter for shipping, but a small harbor
advancing a little way into the town toward its eastern extremity seems
to have been formed for the accommodation of such small craft as were
used in the better days of the city." The harbor, moreover, was larger
during the crusades, and enabled Ascalon to receive supplies of corn
from Egypt and thereby to protract its siege. Sultan Bibars filled up
the port and cast stones into the sea, 1270 a.d., and destroyed the
remains of the fortifications, for fear that the Franks, after their
treaty with the king of Tunis, should bring back their forces against
Islamism and establish themselves there . Yet Abulfeda, who wrote a few
years later, calls it "one of the Syrian ports of Islam" .

This city, so placed on the sea, and in which too the sea enters, cannot
be the Ashkelon, which had a port, which was a town distinct from it.
The Ascalon of the Philistines, which existed down into Christian times,
must have been inland.

Benjamin of Tudela in the 12th century who had been on the spot, and who
is an accurate eyewitness , says, "From Ashdod are two parasangs to
Ashkelonah ; this is new Ashkelon which Ezra the priest built on the
sea-shore, and they at first called it Benibra . Jerome has another
Benamerium, north of Zoar, now N'mairah. Tristram land of Moab p. 57.

A well in Ascalon is mentioned by Eusebius. "There are many wells
(named) in Scripture and are yet shewn in the country of Gerar, and at
Ascalon." v. φρέαρ phrear. William of Tyre says: "It has no fountains,
either within the compass of the walls, or near it; but it abounds in
wells, both within and without, which supply palatable water, fit for
drinking. For greater caution the inhabitants had built some cisterns
within, to receive rain-water. Benj. of T. also says, "There in the
midst of the city is a well which they call Beer Ibrahim-al-khalil (the
well of Abraham the friend (of God)) which he dug in the days of the
Philistines." Keith mentions "20 fountains of excellent water opened up
anew by Ibrahim Pasha." p. 274), and it is distant from the old
Ashkelon, which is desolate, four parasangs. "When the old Ashkelon
perished, is unknown. If, as seems probable from some of the antiquities
dug up, the Ashkelon, at which Herod was born and which he beautified,
was the seaport town, commerce probably attracted to it gradually the
inhabitants of the neighboring town of Ascalon, as the population of the
Piraeus now exceeds that of Athens.

The present Ashkelon is a ghastly skeleton; all the frame-work of a
city, but none there. "The soil is good," but the "peasants who
cultivate it" prefer living outside in a small village of mud-huts,
exposed to winds and sand-storms, because they think that God has
abandoned it, and that evil spirits (the Jan and the Ghul) dwell there .

Even the remains of antiquity, where they exist, belong to later times.
A hundred men excavated in Ashkelon for 14 days in hopes of finding
treasure there. They dug 18 feet below the surface, and fouud marble
shafts, a Corinthian capital, a colossal statue with a Medusa's head on
its chest, a marble pavement and white-marble pedestal . The excavation
reached no Philistine Ashkelon.

"Broken pottery," "pieces of glass," "fragments of polished marble," "of
ancient columns, cornices etc." were the relics of a Greek Gaza.

Though then it is a superfluity of fulfillment, and what can be found
belongs to a later city, still what can be seen has an impressive
correspondence with the words Gaza is "forsaken;" for there are miles of
fragments of some city connected with Gaza. The present Gaza occupies
the southern half of a hill built with stone for the Moslem conquerors
of Palestine. : "Even the traces of its former existence, its vestiges
of antiquity, are very rare; occasional columns of marble or gray
granite, scattered in the streets and gardens, or used as thresholds at
the gates and doors of houses, or laid upon the front of
watering-troughs. One fine Corinthian capital of white marble lies
inverted in the middle of the street." These belong then to times later
than Alexander, since whose days the very site of Gaza must have changed
its aspect.

Ashkelon shall be a desolation - The site of the port of Ascalon was
well chosen, strong, overhanging the sea, fenced from the land,
stretching forth its arms toward the Mediterranean, as if to receive in
its bosom the wealth of the sea, yet shunned by the poor hinds around
it. It lies in such a living death, that it is "one of the most mournful
scenes of utter desolation" which a traveler "even in this land of ruins
ever beheld." But this too cannot be the Philistine city. The sands
which are pressing hard upon the solid walls of the city, held back by
them for the time, yet threatening to overwhelm "the spouse of Syria,"
and which accumulated in the plain below, must have buried the old
Ashkelon, since in this land, where the old names so cling to the spot,
there is no trace of it.

Ekron shall be uprooted - And at Akir and Esdud "celebrated at present,
for its scorpions," the few stones, which remain, even of a later town,
are but as gravestones to mark the burial place of departed greatness.

Jerome: "In like way, all who glory in bodily strength and worldly power
and say, "By the strength of my hand I have done it," shall be left
desolate and brought to nothing in the day of the Lord's anger." And
"the waster," they who by evil words and deeds injure or destroy others
and are an offence unto them, these shall be east out shamefully, into
outer darkness, Rup.: "when the saints shall receive the fullest
brightness" in the 'mid-day' of the Sun of Righteousness. The judgment
shall not be in darkness, save to them, but in mid-day, so that the
justice of God shall be clearly seen, and darkness itself shall be
turned into light, as was said to David, "Thou didst this thing
secretly, but I will do it before all Israel and before the sun" [Sa2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012.md); and our Lord, "Whatsoever ye
have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye
have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the
house-tops" [Luk 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md); and Paul, "the
Lord shall come, Who both will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart" [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005.md). And "they who by seducing words
in life or in doctrine uprooted others, shall be themselves rooted up"
[Mat 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md).

[Zephaniah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 2:5</span></span>

The "woe" having been pronounced on the five cities apart, now falls
upon the whole nation of the Cherethites or Philistines. The Cherethites
are only named as equivalent to the Philistines, probably as originally
a distinct immigration of the same people . The name is used by the
Egyptian slave of the Amalekite [Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md) for those whom the author of the
first book of Samuel calls Philistines [Sa1
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016.md). Ezekiel uses the name parallel
with that of "Philistines," with reference to the destruction which God
would bring upon them .

The word of the Lord - Comes not to them, but "upon" them, overwhelming
them. To them He speaketh not in good, but in evil; not in grace, but in
anger; not in mercy, but in vengeance. Philistia was the first enemy of
the Church. It showed its enmity to Abraham and Isaac and would fain
that they should not sojourn among them [Gen
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#034.md); [Gen
26:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014.md), [Gen
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028.md). They were the hindrance that
Israel should not go straight to the promised land [Exo
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md). When Israel passed the Red Sea
[Exo 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md), "sorrow" took hold of
them." They were close to salvation in body, but far in mind. They are
called "Canaan," as being a chief nation of it [Gen
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#021.md), and in that name lay the
original source of their destruction. They inherited the sins of Canaan
and with them his curse, preferring the restless beating of the barren,
bitter sea on which they dwelt, "the waves of this troublesome world,"
to being a part of the true Canaan. They would absorb the Church into
the world, and master it, subduing it to the pagan Canaan, not subdue
themselves to it, and become part of the heavenly Canaan.

[Zephaniah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zep 2:6</span></span>

The seacoast shall be dwellings and cottages - o, literally, cuttings or
diggings. This is the central meaning of the word; the place of the
Cherethites (the cutters off) shall be "cheroth" of shepherds, places
which they dug up that their flocks might be enclosed therein. The
tracts once full of fighting men, the scourge of Judah, should be so
desolate of its former people, as to become a sheep-walk. Men of peace
should take the place of its warriors.

So the shepherds of the Gospel with their flocks have entered into
possession of war-like nations, turning them to the Gospel. They are
shepherds, the chief of whom is that Good Shepherd, who laid down His
Life for the sheep. And these are the sheep of whom He speaks, "Other
sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and
they shall hear My Voice; and there shall be one fold and One Shepherd"
[Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md).

[Zephaniah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 2:7</span></span>

And the coast shall be - Or probably, "It shall be a portion for the
remnant of the house of Judah." He uses the word, employed in the first
assignment of the land to Israel ; and of the whole people as belonging
to God, "Jacob is the 'lot' of His inheritance" [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md). "The tract of the sea," which,
with the rest, was assigned to Israel, which, for its unfaithfulness,
was seldom, even in part, possessed, and at this time, was wholly
forfeited, should be a portion for the mere "remnant" which should be
brought back. David used the word in his psalm of thanksgiving, when he
had brought the ark to the city of David, how God had "confirmed the
covenant to Israel, saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
the lot of your inheritance" [Ch1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#018.md); [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md); and Asaph, "He cast out the he
athen before them and divided to them an inheritance by line" [Psa
78:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#055.md). It is the reversal of the doom
threatened by Micah, "Thou shalt have none, that shall cast a cord by
lot in the congregation of the Lord" [Mic
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005.md). The word is revived by Ezekiel in
his ideal division of the land to the restored people [Eze
47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md). "The gifts and calling of God
are without repentance" [Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md).
The promise, which had slumbered during Israel's faithlesshess, should
be renewed to its old extent. : "There is no prescription against the
Church." The boat threatens to sink; it is tossed, half-submerged, by
the waves; but its Lord "rebukes the wind and the sea; wind and sea obey
Him, and there is a great calm" [Mat
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md).

For the remnant of the house of Juda - Yet, who save He in whose hand
are human wills, could now foresee that Judah should, like the ten
tribes, rebel, be carried captive, and yet, though like and worse than
Israel in its sin [Jer 3:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md); [Eze
16:48-52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#048.md); [Eze
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011.md), should, unlike Israel, be
restored? The re-building of Jerusalem was, their enemies pleaded,
contrary to sound policy [Ezr 4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md)
: the plea was for the time accepted, for the rebellions of Jerusalem
were recorded in the chronicles of Babylon [Ezr
4:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#019.md). Yet the falling short of the
complete restoration depended on their own wills. God turned again their
captivity; but they only, "whose spirit God stirred," willed to return.
The temporal restoration was the picture of the spiritual. They who
returned had to give up lands and possessions in Babylonia, and a
remnant only chose the land of promise at such cost. Babylonia was as
attractive as Egypt formerly.

In the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening - One city
is named for all. "They shall lie down," he says, continuing the image
from their flocks, as Isaiah, in a like passage, "The first-born of the
poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety" [Isa
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md) :30.

The true Judah shall overspread the world; but it too shall only be a
remnant; these shall, in safety, "go in and out and find pasture" [Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md). "In the evening" of the world
they shall find their rest, for then also in the time of antichrist, the
Church shall be but a remnant still. "For the Lord their God shall visit
them," for He is the Good Shepherd, who came to seek the one sheep which
was lost and who says of Himself, "I will seek that which was lost, and
bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was
broken, and will strengthen that which was sick" [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md); and who in the end will more
completely "turn away their captivity," bring His banished to their
everlasting home, the Paradise from which they have been exiled, and
separate forever the sheep from the goats who now oppress and scatter
them abroad Ezek. 17-19.

[Zephaniah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 2:8</span></span>

I - Dionysius: "God, Who know all things, "I heard" that is, have known
within Me, in My mind, not anew but from eternity, and now I shew in
effect that I know it; wherefore I say that I hear, because I act after
the manner of one who perceiveth something anew." I, the just Judge,
heard (see [Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#039.md); [Eze
35:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#012).md). He was present and "heard,"
even when, because He avenged not, He seemed not to hear, but laid it up
in store with Him to avenge in the due time [Deu
32:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md).

The reproach of Moab and the reviling of the children of Ammon, whereby
they have reproached My people - Both words, "reproached, reviled,"
mean, primarily, cutting speeches; both are intensive, and are used of
blaspheming God as unable to help His people, or reviling His people as
forsaken by Him. If directed against man, they are directed against God
through man. So David interpreted the taunt of Goliah, "reviled the
armies of the living God" ([Sa1 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md),
[Sa1 17:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#036.md), [Sa1
17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045), coll. 10. 25.md), and the
Philistine cursed David "by his gods" [Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md). In a Psalm David complains,
"the reproaches of them that reproached Thee are fallen upon me" ([Psa
69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010) (9).md); and a Psalm which cannot
be later than David, since it declares the national innocency from
idolatry, connects with their defeats, the voice of him "that
reproacheth and blasphemeth" ([Psa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016) (17.md), joining the two words used
here). The sons of Corah say, "with a sword in my bones, mine enemies
reproach me, while they say daily unto me, where is thy God?" [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md). So Asaph, "The enemy hath
reproached, the foolish people hath blasphemed Thy Name" [Psa
74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md), [Psa
74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md); and, "we are become a reproach
to our neighbors. Wherefore should the pagan say, where is their God?
render unto our neighbors - the reproach wherewith they have reproached
Thee, O Lord" [Psa 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md), [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md), [Psa
79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md). And Ethan, "Remember, Lord, the
reproach of Thy servants - wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O
Lord, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of Thine Anointed"
[Psa 89:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050.md).

In history the repeated blasphemies of Sennacherib and his messengers
are expressed by the same words. In earlier times the remarkable
concession of Jephthah, "Wilt not thou possess what Chemosh thy god
giveth thee to possess? so whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out
before us, them will we possess" [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md), implies that the Ammonites
claimed their land as the gift of their god Chemosh, and that that war
was, as that later by Sennacherib, waged in the name of the false god
against the True.

The relations of Israel to Moab and Ammon have been so habitually
misrepresented, that a review of those relations throughout their whole
history may correct some wrong impressions. The first relations of
Israel toward them were even tender. God reminded His people of their
common relationship and forbade him even to take the straight road to
his own future possessions, across their hand against their will.
"Distress them not, nor contend with them," it is said of each, "for I
will not give thee of their land for a possession, for I have given it
unto the children of Lot for a possession" [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md). Idolaters and hostile as they
were, yet, for their father's sake, their title to their land had the
same sacred sanction, as Israel's to his. "I," God says, "have given it
to them as a possession." Israel, to their own manifest inconvenience,
"went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and
the land of Moab, but came not within the border of Moab" [Jdg
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#018.md). By destroying Sihon king of the
Amorites and Og king of Bashan, Israel removed formidable enemies, who
had driven Moab and Ammon out of a portion of the land which they had
conquered from the Zamzummim and Anakim [Deu
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), [Deu
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md), and who threatened the
remainder, "Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites" [Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025.md), [Num
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#031.md).

Heshbon, Dibon, Jahaz, Medeba, Nophah "were cities in the land of the
Amorites, in" which "Israel dwelt." The exclusion of Moab and Ammon from
the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md) was not, of course, from any
national antipathy, but intended to prevent a debasing intercourse; a
necessary precaution against the sensuousness of their idolatries. Moab
was the first in adopting the satanic policy of Balaam, to seduce Israel
by sensuality to their idolatries; but the punishment was appointed to
the partners of their guilt, the Midianites [Num
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#017.md); 31, not to Moab. Yet Moab was
the second nation, whose ambition God overruled to chasten His people's
idolatries. Eglon, king of Moab, united with himself Ammon and Amalek
against Israel. The object of the invasion was, not the recovery of the
country which Moab had lost to the Amorites but, Palestine proper.

The strength of Moab was apparently not sufficient to occupy the
territory of Reuben. They took possession only of "the city of palm
trees" [Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md); either the ruins of
Jericho or a spot close by it; with the view apparently of receiving
reinforcements or of securing their own retreat by the ford. This
garrison enabled them to carry their forays over Israel, and to hold it
enslaved for 18 years. The oppressiveness of this slavery is implied by
the cry and conversion of Israel to the Lord, which was always in great
distress. The memory of Eglon, as one of the oppressors of Israel, lived
in the minds of the people in the days of Samuel [Sa1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md). In the end, this precaution of
Moab turned to its own destruction, for, after Eglon was slain, Ephraim,
under Ehud, took the fords, and the whole garrison, 10,000 of Moab's
warriors, "every strong man and every man of might" [Jdg
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#029.md), were intercepted in their
retreat and perished. For a long time after this, we hear of no fresh
invasion by Moab. The trans-Jordanic tribes remained in unquestioned
possession of their land for 300 years Judg. 40:26, when Ammon, not
Moab, raised the claim, "Israel took away my land" [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md), although claiming the land down
to the Arnon, and already being in possession of the southernmost
portion of that land, Aroer, since Israel smote him "from Aroer unto
Minnith" [Jdg 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033.md). The land then,
according to a law recognized by nations, belonged by a twofold right to
Israel;

\(1\) that it had been won, not from Moab, but from the conquerors of
Moab, the right of Moab having passed to its conquerors ;

\(2\) that undisputed and unbroken possession "for time immemorial" as
we say, 300 years, ought not to be disputed .

The defeat by Jephthah stilled them for near 50 years until the
beginning of Saul's reign, when they refused the offer of the "men of
Jubesh-Gilead" to serve them, and, with a mixture of insolence and
savagery, annexed as a condition of accepting that entire submission,
"that I may thrust out all your right eyes, to lay it as a reproach to
Israel" [Sa1 11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md). The signal
victory of Saul [Sa1 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011.md) still did
not prevent Ammon, as well as Moab, from being among the enemies whom
Saul "worsted" . The term "enemies" implies that "they" were the
assailants. The history of Naomi shows their prosperous condition, that
the famine, which desolated Judah [Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md), did not reach them, and that they
were a prosperous land, at peace, at that time, with Israel. If all the
links of the genealogy are preserved [Rut
4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#021.md), Jesse, David's father, was
grandson of a Moabitess, Ruth, and perhaps on this ground David
entrusted his parents to the care of the king of Moab [Sa1
22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md).

Sacred history gives no hint, what was the cause of his terrible
execution upon Moab. But a Psalm of David speaks to God of some blow,
under which Israel had reeled. "O God, Thou hast abhorred us, and broken
us in pieces; Thou hast been wroth: Thou hast made the land to tremble
and cloven it asunder; heal its breaches, for it shaketh; Thou hast
showed Thy people a hard thing, Thou hast made it drink wine of reeling"
[Psa 60:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003.md); and thereon David
expresses his confidence that God would humble Moab, Edom, Philistia.
While David then was engaged in the war with the Syrians of Mesopotamia
and Zobah ([Psa 60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) title.md), Moab
must have combined with Edom in an aggressive war against Israel. "The
valley of salt" , where Joab returned and defeated them, was probably
within Judah, since "the city of salt" [Jos
15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md) was one of the six cities of the
wilderness. Since they had defeated Judah, they must have been overtaken
there on their return .

Yet this too was a religious war. "'Thou,'" David says "hast given a
'banner to them that fear Thee,' to be raised aloft because of the
truth" [Psa 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004.md).

There is no tradition, that the kindred Psalm of the sons of Corah, Ps.
44 belongs to the same time. Yet the protestations to God of the entire
absence of idolatry could not have been made at any time later than the
early years of Solomon. Even were there Maccabee Psalms, the Maccabees
were but a handful among apostates. They could not have pleaded the
national freedom from unfaithfulness to God, nor, except in two
subordinate and self-willed expeditions (1 Macc. 5:56-60, 67), were they
defeated. Under the Persian rule, there were no armies nor wars; no
immunity from idolatry in the later history of Judah. Judah did not in
Hezekiah's time go out against Assyria; the one battle, in which Josiah
was slain, ended the resistance to Egypt. Defeat was, at the date of
this Psalm, new and surprising, in contrast with God's deliverances of
old [Psa 44:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md); yet the inroad, by
which they had suffered, was one of spoiling [Psa
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#010.md), [Psa
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#012.md), not of subdual. Yet this too
was a religious war, from their neighbors. They were slain for the sake
of God [Psa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md), they were covered
with shame on account of the reproaches and blasphemies [Psa
44:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md) of those who triumphed over
God, as powerless to help; they were a scorn and derision to the petty
nations around them. It is a Psalm of unshaken faith amid great
prostration: it describes in detail what the lxth Psalm sums up in
single heavy words of imagery; but both alike complain to God of what
His people had to suffer for His sake.

The insolence of Ammon in answer to David's message of kindness to their
new king, like that to the men of Jabesh Gilead, seems like a deliberate
purpose to create hostilities. The relations of the previous king of
Ammon to David, had been kind [Sa2
10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md), perhaps, because David being a
fugitive from Israel, they supposed him to be Saul's enemy. The enmity
originated, not with the new king, but with "the princes of the children
of Ammon" [Sa2 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md). David's treatment
of these nations [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md); [Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md) is so unlike his treatment of
any others whom he defeated, that it implies an internecine warfare, in
which the safety of Israel could only be secured by the destruction of
its assailants.

Mesha king of Moab records one war, and alludes to others, not mentioned
in Holy Scripture. He says, that before his own time, "Omri, king of
Israel, afflicted Moab many days;" that "his son (Ahab) succeeded him,
and he too said, 'I will afflict Moab.'" This affliction he explains to
be that "Omri possessed himself of the land of Medeba" (expelling, it is
implied, its former occupiers) "and that" (apparently, Israel) , "dwelt
therein," "(in his days and in) the days of his son forty years." He was
also in possession of Nebo, and "the king of Israel" (apparently Omri,)
"buil(t) Jahaz and dwelt in it, when he made war with me" . Jahaz was
near Dibon. In the time of Eusebius, it was still "pointed out between
Dibon and Medeba" .

Mesha says, "And I took it to annex it to Dibon." It could not,
according to Mesha also, have been south of the Arnon, since Aroer lay
between Dibon and the Arnon, and Mesha would not have annexed to Dibon a
town beyond the deep and difficult ravine of the Arnon, with Aroer lying
between them. It was certainly north of the Arnon, since Israel was not
permitted to come within the border of Moab, but it was at Jahaz that
Sihon met them and fought the battle in which Israel defeated him and
gained possession of his land, "from the Arnon to the Jabbok" [Num
21:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md). It is said also that "Israel
dwelt in the land of the Amorites from Aroer which is on the edge of the
river Arnon" , and the city which is in the river unto Gilead [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md), [Jos
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md). Aroer on the edge of the river
Arnon, and the city which is in the river" Arnon, again occur in
describing the southern border of Reuben, among whose towns Jahaz is
mentioned, with Beth-Baal-Meon and Kiriathaim, which have been
identified.

The afflicting then of Moab by Omri, according to Mesha, consisted in
this, that he recovered to Israel a portion of the allotment of Reuben,
between 9 and 10 hours in length from north to south, of which, in the
time of Israel's weakness through the civil wars which followed on
Jeroboam's revolt, Moab must have dispossessed Reuben. Reuben had
remained in undisturbed possession of it, from the first expulsion of
the Amorites to the time at least of Rehoboam, about five hundred years.
: "The men of Gad" still "dwelt in Ataroth," Mesha says, "from time
immemorial."

The picture, which Mesha gives, is of a desolation of the southern
portion of Reuben. For, "I rebuilt," he says, "Baal-Meon, Kiriathaim,
Aroer, Beth-bamoth, Bezer, Beth-Diblathaim, Beth-baal-Meon." Of
Beth-Bamoth, and probably of Bezer, Mesha says, that they had previously
been destroyed . But Reuben would not, of course, destroy his own
cities. They must then have been destroyed either by Mesha's father, who
reigned before him, when invading Reuben, or by Omri, when driving back
Moab into his own land, and expelling him from these cities. "Possibly"
they were dismantled only, since Mesha speaks only of Omri's occupying
Medeba, Ataroth, and Jahaz. He held these three cities only, leaving the
rest dismantled, or dismantling them, unable to place defenders in them,
and unwilling to leave them as places of aggression for Moab. But
whether they ever were fortified towns at all, or how they were
desolated, is mere conjecture. Only they were desolated in these wars.

But it appears from Mesha's own statement, that neither Omri nor Ahab
invaded Moab proper. For in speaking of his successful war and its
results, he mentions no town south of the Arnon. He must have been a
tributary king, but not a foot of his land was taken. The subsequent war
was not a mere revolt, nor was it a mere refusal to pay tribute, of
which Mesha makes no complaint. Nor could the tribute have been
oppressive to him, since the spoils, left in the encampment of Moab and
his allies shortly after his revolt, is evidence of such great wealth.
The refusal to pay tribute would have involved nothing further, unless
Ahaziah had attempted to enforce it, as Hezekiah refused the tribute to
Assyria, but remained in his own borders. But Ahaziah, unlike his
brother Jehoram who succeeded him, seems to have undertaken nothing,
except the building of some ships for trade [Ch2
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md). Mesha's war was a renewal of
the aggression on Reuben.

Heshbon is not mentioned, and therefore must, even after the war, have
remained with Reuben.

Mesha's own war was an exterminating war, as far as he records it. "I
fought against the city," (Ataroth), he says, "and took it, and killed
all the mighty of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and of
Moab;" "I fought against it (Nebo) from break of day until norm and took
it, and slew all of it, 7,000 men; the ladies and maidens I devoted to
Ashtar Chemosh;" to be desecrated to the degradations of that sensual
idolatry. The words too "Israel perished with an everlasting
destruction" stand clear, whether they express Mesha's conviction of the
past or his hope of the future.

The war also, on the part of Moab, was a war of his idol Chemosh against
God. Chemosh, from first to last, is the agent. "Chemosh was angry with
his land;" "Chemosh (was pleased) with it in my days;" "I killed the
mighty for the well-pleasing of Chemosh;" "I took captive thence all (
...)and dragged it along before Chemosh at Kiriath;" "Chemosh said to
me, Go and take Nebo against Israel;" "I devoted the ladies and maidens
to Ashtar-Chemosh;" "I took thence the vessels of ihvh and dragged them
before Chemosh;" "Chemosh drove him (the king of Israel) out before (my
face);" "Chemosh said to me, Go down against Horonaim." "Chemosh (
...)it in my days."

Contemporary with this aggressive war against Israel must have been the
invasion by "the children of Moab and the children of Ammon, the great
multitude from beyond the sea, from Syria" [Ch2
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), in the reign of Jehoshaphat,
which brought such terror upon Judah. It preceded the invasion of Moab
by Jehoshaphat in union with Jehoram and the king of Edom. For the
invasion of Judah by Moab and Ammon took place, while Ahab's son,
Ahaziah, was still living. For it was after this, that Jehoshaphat
joined with Ahaziah in making ships to go to Tarshish . But the
expedition against Moab was in union with Jehoram who succeeded Ahaziah.
The abundance of wealth which the invaders of Judah brought with them,
and the precious jewels with which they had adorned themselves, show
that this was no mere marauding expedition, to spoil; but that its
object was, to take possession of the land or at least of some portion
of it.

They came by entire surprise on Jehoshaphat, who heard of them first
when they were at Hazazon-Tamar or Engedi, some 36 12 miles from
Jerusalem . He felt himself entirely unequal to meet them, and cast
himself upon God. There was a day of public humiliation of Judah at
Jerusalem. "Out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord"
[Ch2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#004.md). Jehoshaphat, in his public
prayer, owned, "we have no might against this great company which cometh
against us; neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon Thee" [Ch2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013.md). He appeals to God, that He had
forbidden Israel to invade Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, so that they
turned away from them and destroyed them not; and now these rewarded
them by "coming to cast us out of Thy possession which Thou hast given
us to inherit" [Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md). One of the
sons of Asaph foretold to the congregation, that they might go out
fearlessly, for they should not have occasion to fight.

A Psalm, ascribed to Asaph, records a great invasion, the object of
which was the extermination of Israel. "They have said; Come and let us
cut them off from" being "a nation, that the name of Israel may be no
more in remembrance" [Psa 83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004.md). It had
been a secret confederacy. "They have taken crafty counsel against Thy
people" [Psa 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md). It was directed
against God Himself, that is, His worship and worshipers. "For they have
taken counsel in heart together; against Thee do they make a covenant"
[Psa 83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md). It was a combination of the
surrounding petty nations; Tyre on the north, the Philistines on the
west; on the south the Amalekites, Ishmaelites, Hagarenes; eastward,
Edom, Gebal, Moab, Ammon. But its most characteristic feature was, that
Assur (this corresponds with no period after Jehoshaphat) occupies a
subordinate place to Edom and Moab, putting them forward and helping
"them." "Assur also," Asaph says, "is joined with them; they have become
an arm to the children of Lot" [Psa
83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008.md). This agrees with the
description, "there is come against thee a great multitude from beyond
the sea, from Syria."

Scripture does not record, on what ground the invasion of Moab by
Jehoram and Jehoshaphat, with the tributary king of Edom, was directed
against Moab proper; but it was the result doubtless of the double war
of Moab against Reuben and against Judah. It was a war, in which the
strength of Israel and Moab was put forth to the utmost. Jehoram had
mustered all Israel [Kg2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006.md); Moab had
gathered all who had reached the age of manhood and upward, "everyone
who girded on a girdle and upward" [Kg2
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#021.md). The three armies, which had made
a seven days' circuit in the wilderness, were on the point of perishing
by thirst and falling into the hands of Moab, when Elisha in God's name
promised them the supply of their want, and complete victory over Moab.
The eager cupidity of Moab, as of many other armies, became the occasion
of his complete overthrow. The counsel with which Elisha accompanied his
prediction, "ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city, and
every good tree ye shall fell, and all springs of water ye shall stop
up, and every good piece of land ye shall waste with stones" [Kg2
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019.md), was directed, apparently, to
dislodge an enemy so inveterate. For water was essential to the
fertility of their land and their dwelling there. We hear of no special
infliction of death, like what Mesha records of himself. The war was
ended by the king of Moab's sacrificing the heir-apparent of the king of
Edom , which naturally created great displeasure against Israel, in
whose cause Edom thus suffered, so that they departed to their own land
and finally revolted.

Their departure apparently broke up the siege of Ar and the expedition.
Israel apparently was not strong enough to carry on the war without
Edom, or feared to remain with their armies away from their own land, as
in the time of David, of which Edom might take the advantage. We know
only the result.

Moab probably even extended her border to the south by the conquest of
Horonaim .

After this, Moab is mentioned only on occasion of the miracle of the
dead man, to whom God gave life, when cast into Elisha's sepulchre, as
he came in contact with his bones. Like the Bedouin now, or the
Amalekites of old, "the bands of Moab came into the land, as the year
came" [Kg2 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020.md). Plunder, year by
year, was the lot of Israel at the hands of Moab.

On the east of Jordan, Israel must have remained in part (as Mesha says
of the Gadites of Arocr) in their old border. For after this, Hazael, in
Jehu's reign, smote Israel "from Aroer which is by the river Arnon" [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md); and at that time probably Amman
joined with him in the exterminating war in Gilead, destroying life
before it had come into the world, "that they might enlarge their
border" . Jeroboam ii, 825 b.c.; restored Israel "to the sea of the
plain" 2 Kings 16:25, that is, the dead sea, and, (as seems probable
from the limitation of that term in Deuteronomy, 'under Ashdoth-Pisgah
eastward,' [Deu 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017).md) to its northern
extremity, lower in latitude than Heshbon, yet above Nebo and Medeba,
lcaving accordingly to Moab all which it had gained by Mesha. Uzziah, a
few years later, made the Ammonites tributaries [Ch2
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md) 810 b.c. But 40 years later 771
b.c., Pul, and, after yet another 30 years, 740, Tiglath-pileser having
carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md), Moab again possessed itself of
the whole territory of Reuben. Probably before.

For 726 b.c., when Isaiah foretold that "the glory of Moab should be
contemned with all that great multitude" [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md), he hears the wailing of Moab
throughout all his towns, and names all those which had once been
Reuben's and of whose conquest or possession Moab had boasted [Isa
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md), [Isa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md), Nebo, Medeba, Dibon, Jahaz,
Baiith; as also those not conquered then [Isa
15:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md), [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md), Heshbon, Elealeh; and those of
Moab proper, Luhith, Horonaim, and its capitals, Ar-Moab and Kir-Moab.
He hears their sorrow, sees their desolation and bewails with their
weeping [Isa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md). He had prophesied
this before , and now, three years [Isa
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#013.md) before its fulfillment by
Tiglath-Pileser, he renews it. This tender sorrow for Moab has more the
character of an elegy than of a denunciation; so that he could scarcely
lament more tenderly the ruin of his own people.

He mentions also distinctly no sin there except pride. The pride of Moab
seems something of common notoriety and speech. "We have heard" [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md). Isaiah accumulates words, to
express the haughtiness of Moab; "the pride of Moab; exceeding proud;
his pride and his haughtiness and his wrath," pride overpassing bounds,
upon others. His words seem to be formed so as to keep this one bared
thought before us, as if we were to say "pride, prideful, proudness,
pridefulness;" and withal the unsubstantialness of it all, "the
unsubstantiality of his lies." Pride is the source of all ambition; so
Moab is pictured as retiring within her old bounds, "the fords of
Arnon," and thence asking for aid; her petition is met by the
counter-petition, that, if she would be protected in the day of trouble,
the out-casts of Israel might lodge with her now: "be thou a covert to
her from the face of the spoiler" [Isa
16:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004.md). The prophecy seems to mark
itself out as belonging to a time, after the two and a half tribes had
been desolated, as stragglers sought refuge in Moab, and when a severe
infliction was to come on Moab: "the [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md) remnant" shall be "small, small
not great."

Yet Moab recovered this too. It was a weakening of the nation, not its
destruction. Some 126 years after the prophecy of Isaiah, 30 years after
the prophecy of Zephaniah, Moab, in the time of Jeremiah, was in entire
prosperity, as if no visitation had ever come upon her. What Zephaniah
says of the luxuriousness of his people, Jeremiah says of Moab; "Moab is
one at ease from his youth; he is resting on his lees; and he hath not
been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity"
[Jer 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md). They "say, We are mighty
and strong men for the war" [Jer
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#014.md). Moab was a "strong staff, a
beautiful rod" [Jer 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md); "he
magnified himself against the Lord" [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md); "Israel was a derision to him"
[Jer 48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md); "he skipped for joy" at
his distress. Jeremiah repeats and even strengthens Isaiah's description
of his pride; "his pride, proud" [Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md), he repeats, "exceedingly; his
loftiness," again "his pride, his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his
heart."

Its "strongholds" [Jer 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md) were
unharmed; all its cities, "far and near," are counted one by one, in
their prosperity [Jer 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md), [Jer
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003.md), [Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md), [Jer
48:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md); its summer-fruits and
vintage were plenteous; its vines, luxuriant; all was joy and shouting.
Whence should this evil come? Yet so it was with Sodom and Gomorrah just
before its overthrow. It was, for beauty, "a paradise of God;
well-watered everywhere; as the garden of the Lord, like the land of
Egypt" [Gen 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md). In the morning "the
smoke of the country went up as the smoke of the furnace" [Gen
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#028.md). The destruction foretold by
Jeremiah is far other than the affliction spoken of by Isaiah. Isaiah
prophesies only a visitation, which should reduce her people: Jeremiah
foretells, as did Zephaniah, captivity and the utter destruction of her
cities. The destruction foretold is complete. Not of individual cities
only, but of the whole he saith, "Moab is destroyed" [Jer
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#004.md). "The spoiler shall come upon
every city, and no city shall escape, and the valley shall perish and
the high places shall be destroyed, as the Lord hath spoken" [Jer
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008.md).

Moab himself was to leave his land. "Flee, save your lives, and ye shall
be like the heath in the wilderness. Chemosh shall go forth into
captivity; his priests and his princes together. Give pinions unto Moab,
that it may flee and get away, and her cities shall be a desolation, for
there is none to dwell therein" [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md). It was not only to go into
captivity, but its home was to be destroyed. "I will send to her those
who shall upheave her, and they shall upheave her, and her vessels they
shall empty, all her flagons" (all that aforetime contained her) "they
shall break in pieces" [Jer 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012.md).
Moab is destroyed and her cities" [Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md); "the spoiler of Moab is come
upon her; he hath destroyed the strongholds" [Jer
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md). The subsequent history of the
Moabites is in the words, "Leave the cities and dwell in the rock,
dwellers of Moab, and be like a dove which nesteth in the sides of the
mouth of the pit" [Jer 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md). The
purpose of Moab and Ammon against Israel which Asaph complains of, and
which Mesha probably speaks of, is retorted upon her. "In Heshbon they
have devised evil against it; come and let us cut it off from being a
nation. Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
magnified himself against the Lord" [Jer
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md), [Jer
48:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#042.md).

Whence should this evil come? They had, with the Ammonites, been
faithful servants of Nebuchadnezzar against Judah [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md). Their concerted conspiracy with
Edom, Tyre, Zidon, to which they invited Zedekiah ([Jer
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002) following.md), was dissolved.
Nebuchadnezzars march against Judaea did not touch them, for they
"skipped with joy" [Jer 48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md) at
Israel's distresses. The connection of Baalis, king of the Ammonites,
with Ishmael [Jer 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014.md); [Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010.md) the assassin of Gedaliah, whom
the king of Babylon made governor over the land [Kg2
25:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md); [Jer
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#006.md); [Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md) out of their own people, probably
brought down the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar. For Chaldaeans too were
included in the slaughter [Jer 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#003.md).
The blow seems to have been aimed at the existence of the people, for
the murder of Gedaliah followed upon the rallying of the Jews "out of
all the places whither they had been driven" [Jer
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#012.md). It returned on Ammon itself;
and on Moab who probably on this, as on former occasions, was associated
with it. The two nations, who had escaped at the destruction of
Jerusalem, were warred upon and subdued by Nebuchadnezzar in the 23d
year of his reign , the 5th after the destruction of Jerusalem.

And then probably followed that complete destruction and disgraced end,
in which Isaiah, in a distinct prophecy, sees Moab trodden down by God
as "the heap of straw is trodden down in the waters (the kethib) of the
dunghill, and he (Moab) stretcheth forth his hands in the midst thereof,
as the swimmer stretcheth forth his hands to swim, and He, God, shall
bring down his pride with the treacheries of his hands" [Isa
25:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010.md). It speaks much of the
continued hostility of Moab, that, in prophesying the complete
deliverance for which Israel waited, the one enemy whose destruction is
foretold, is Moab and those pictured by Moab. "We have waited for Him
and He will save us - For in this mountain (Zion) shall the hand of the
Lord rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under Him" [Isa
25:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md).

After this, Moab, as a nation, disappears from history. Israel, on its
return from the captivity, was again enticed into idolatry by Moabite
and Anmonite wives, as well as by those of Ashdod and others [Neh
13:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023.md), Canaanites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Jebusites, Egyptians, Amorites [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md). Sanballat also, who headed the
opposition to the rebuilding of Jerusalem, was a Moabite [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md); [Neh
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md); Tobiah, an Ammonite [Neh
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002.md), [Neh
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#009.md). Yet it went no further than
intrigue and the threat of war. They were but individuals, who cherished
the old hostility. In the time of the Maccabees, the Ammonites, not
Moab, "with a mighty power and much people" were in possession of the
Reubenite cities to Jazar (1 Macc. 5:6, 8). It was again an
exterminating war, in which the Jews were to be destroyed (1 Macc. 5:9,
10, 27). After repeated defeats by Judas Maccabaeus, the Ammonites
"hired the Arabians" (1 Macc. 5:39) (not the Moabites) to help them, and
Judas, although victorious, was obliged to remove the whole Israelite
population, "all that were in the land of Gilead, from the least unto
the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a
very great host, to the end they might come into the land of Judaea" (1
Macc. 5:45). The whole population was removed, obviously lest, on the
withdrawal of Judas' army, they should be again imperiled. As it was a
defensive war against Ammon, there is no mention of any city, south of
the Arnon, in Moab's own territory. It was probably with the view to
magnify descendants of Lot, that Josephus speaks of the Moabites as
being "even yet a very great nation" . Justin's account, that there is
"even now a great multitude of Ammonites," does not seem to me to imply
a national existence. A later writer says , "not only the Edomites but
the Ammonites and Moabites too are included in the one name of
Arabians."

Some chief towns of Moab became Roman towns, connected by the Roman road
from Damascus to Elath. Ar and Kir-Moab in Moab proper became Areopolis
and Charac-Moab, and, as well as Medeba and Heshbon in the country which
had been Reuben's, preserve traces of Roman occupancy. As such, they
became Christian Sees. The towns, which were not thus revived as Roman,
probably perished at once, since they bear no traces of any later
building.

The present condition of Moab and Ammon is remarkable in two ways;

\(1\) for the testimony which it gives of its former extensive
population;

\(2\) for the extent of its present desolation.

"How fearfully," says an accurate and minute observer , "is this
residence of old kings and their land wasted!" It gives a vivid idea of
the desolation, that distances are marked, not by villages which he
passes but by ruins . : "From these ruined places, which lay on our way,
one sees how thickly inhabited the district formerly was." Yet the
ground remained fruitful.

It was partly abandoned to wild plants, the wormwood and other shrubs ;
partly, the artificial irrigation, essential to cultivation in this
land, was destroyed ; here and there a patch was cultivated; the rest
remained barren, because the crops might become the prey of the spoiler
, or the thin population had had no heart to cultivate it.

A list of 33 destroyed places which still retained their names, was
given to Seetzen , "of which many were cities in times of old, and
beside these, a great number of other wasted villages. One sees from
this, that, in the days of old, this land was extremely populated and
flourishing, and that destructive wars alone could produce the present
desolation." And thereon he adds the names of 40 more ruined places.
Others say : "The whole of the fine plains in this quarter" (the south
of Moab) "are covered with sites of towns, on every eminence or spot
convenient for the construction of one; and as all the land is capable
of rich cultivation, there can be no doubt that this country, now so
deserted, once presented a continued picture of plenty and fertility." :
"Every knoll" (in the highlands of Moab) "is covered with shapeless
ruins. - The ruins consist merely of heaps of squared and well-fitting
stones, which apparently were erected without mortar." : "One
description might serve for all these Moabite ruins. The town seems to
have been a system of concentric circles, built round a central fort,
and outside the buildings the rings continue as terrace-walks, the
gardens of the old city. The terraces are continuous between the twin
hillocks and intersect each other at the foot" . Ruined villages and
towns, broken walls that once enclosed gardens and vineyards, remains of
ancient roads; everything in Moab tells of the immense wealth and
population, which that country must have once enjoyed."

The like is observed of Ammon . His was direct hatred of the true
religion. It was not mere exultation at the desolation of an envied
people. It was hatred of the worship of God. "Thus saith the Lord God;
"Because thou saidst, Aha, against My sanctuary, because it was
profaned" [Eze 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md); and against the
land of Israel, because it was desolated; and against the house of
Judah, because they went into captivity." The like temper is shown in
the boast, "Because that Moab and Seir do say; Behold the house of Judah
is like unto the pagan" [Eze 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md),
that is, on a level with them.

Forbearing and long-suffering as Almighty God is, in His infinite mercy,
He does not, for that mercy's sake, bear the direct defiance of Himself.
He allows His creatures to forget Him, not to despise or defy Him. And
on this ground, perhaps, He gives to His prophecies a fulfillment beyond
what the letter requires, that they may be a continued witness to Him.
The Ammonites, some 1600 years ago, ceased to "be remembered among the
nations." But as Nineveh and Babylon, and the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, by being what they are, are witnesses to His dealings, so the
way in which Moab and Ammon are still kept desolate is a continued
picture of that first desolation. Both remain rich, fertile; but the
very abundance of their fertility is the cause of their desolation. God
said to Ammon, as the retribution on his contumely: "therefore, behold,
I give thee to the children of the East for a possession, and they shall
set their encampments in thee, and place their dwellings in thee; "they"
shall eat thy fruit and "they" shall drink thy milk; and I will make
Rabbah a dwelling-place of camels, and the children of Ammon a
couchingplace for flocks" [Eze 25:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md).

Of Moab He says also, "I will open the side of Moab from the cities,
which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, unto the men of
the East with the Ammonites" [Eze
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md), [Eze
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md). And this is an exact
description of the condition of the land at this day. All travelers
describe the richness of the soil. We have seen this as to Moab. But the
history is one and the same. One of the most fertile regions of the
world, full of ruined towns, destitute of villages or fixed habitations,
or security of property, its inhabitants ground down by those, who have
succeeded the Midianites and the Amalekites, "the children of the East."
"Thou canst not find a country like the Belka," says the Arabic proverb
, but "the inhabitants cultivate patches only of the best soil in that
territory when they have a prospect of being able to secure the harvest
against the invasion of enemies." "We passed many ruined cities," said
Lord Lindsay , "and the country has once been very populous, but, in 35
miles at least, we did not see a single village; the whole country is
one vast pasturage, overspread by the flocks and herds of the Anezee and
Beni Hassan Bedouins."

The site of Rabbath Amman was well chosen for strength. Lying "in a long
valley" through which a stream passed, "the city of waters" could not
easily be taken, flor its inhabitants compelled to surrender from hunger
or thirst. Its site, as the eastern bound of Peraea , "the last place
where water could be obtained and a frontier fortress against the wild
tribes beyond" , marked it for preservation. In Greek times, the
disputes for its possession attest the sense of its importance. In
Roman, it was one of the chief cities of the Decapolis, though its
population was said to be a mixture of Egyptians, Arabians, Phoenicians
. The coins of Roman Emperors to the end of the second century contain
symbols of plenty, where now reigns utter desolation .

In the 4th century, it and two other now ruined places, Bostra and
Gerasa, are named as "most carefully and strongly walled." It was on a
line of rich commerce filled with strong places, in sites well selected
for repelling the invasions of the neighboring nations . Centuries
advanced. It was greatly beautified by its Roman masters. The extent and
wealth of the Roman city are attested both by the remains of noble
edifices on both sides of the stream, and by pieces of pottery, which
are the traces of ancient civilized dwelling, strewed on the earth two
miles from the city. : "At this place, Amman, as well as Gerasa and
Gamala, three colonial settlements within the compass of a day's journey
from one another, there were five magnificent theaters and one
ampitheater, besides temples, baths, aqueducts, naumachia, triumphal
arches." : "Its theater was the largest in Syria; its colonnade had at
least 50 columns." The difference of the architecture shows that its
aggrandizement must have been the work of different centuries: its
"castle walls are thick, and denote a remote antiquity; large blocks of
stone are piled up without cement and still hold together as well as if
recently placed." It is very probably the same which Joab called David
to take, after the city of waters had been taken; within it are traces
of a temple with Corinthian columns, the largest seen there, yet "not of
the best Roman times."

Yet Amman, the growth of centuries, at the end of our 6th century was
destroyed. For "it was desolate before Islam, a great ruin." : "No where
else had we seen the vestiges of public magnificence and wealth in such
marked contrast with the relapse into savage desolation." But the site
of the old city, so well adapted either for a secure refuge for its
inhabitants or for a secure depository for their plunder, was, on that
very ground, when desolated of its inhabitants, suited for what God, by
Ezekiel, said it would become, a place, where the men of the East should
stable their flocks and herds, secure from straying. What a change, that
its temples, the center of the worship of its successive idols, or its
theaters, its places of luxury or of pomp, should be stables for that
drudge of man, the camel, and the stream which gave it the proud title
of "city of waters" their drinking trough! And yet of the cities whose
destruction is prophesied, this is foretold of Rabbah alone, as in it
alone is it fulfilled! "Ammon," says Lord Lindsay , "was situated on
both sides of the stream; the dreariness of its present aspect is quite
indescribable. It looks like the abode of death; the valley stinks with
dead camels; one of them was rotting in the stream; and though we saw
none among the ruins, they were absolutely "covered" in every direction
with their dung." "Bones and skulls of camels were mouldering there (in
the area of the ruined theater) and in the vaulted galleries of this
immense structure." "It is now quite deserted, except by the Bedouins,
who water their flocks at its little river, descending to it by a
"wady," nearly opposite to a theater (in which Dr. Mac Lennan saw great
herds and flocks) and by the "akiba."

Re-ascending it, we met sheep and goats by thousands, and camels by
hundreds." Another says , "The space intervening between the river and
the western hills is entirely covered with the remains of buildings, now
only used for shelter for camels and sheep." Buckingham mentions
incidentally, that he was prevented from sleeping at night "by the
bleating of flocks and the neighing of horses, barking of dogs etc."
Another speaks of "a small stone building in the Acropolis now used as a
shelter for flocks." While he was "traversing the ruins of the city, the
number of goats and sheep, which were driven in among them, was
exceedingly annoying, however remarkable, as fulfilling the prophecies"
. "Before six tents fed sheep and camels" . "Ezekiel points just to
these [Eze 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005.md), which passage Seetzen
cites. And in fact the ruins are still used for such stalls."

The prophecy is the very opposite to that upon Babylon, though both
alike are prophecies of desolation. Of Babylon Isaiah prophesies, "It
shall never be inhabited, neither shall it bedwelt in from generation to
generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there, neither shall
the shepherds make fold there, but wild beasts of the desert shall lie
there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and the
ostriches shall dwell there, and the jackals shall cry in their desolate
houses, and howling creatures in their pleasant palaces" [Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md). And the ruins are full of wild
beasts . Of Rabbah, Ezekiel prophesied that it should be "a possession
for the men of the East, and I" [Eze
25:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md), God says, "will make Rabbah a
stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching-place for flocks;" and
man's lawlessness fulfills the will and word of God.

[Zephaniah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 2:9</span></span>

Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts - Life especially belongs
to God, since He Alone is Underived Life. "He hath life in Himself" [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md). He is entitled "the living God,"
as here, in tacit contrast with the dead idols of the Philistines [Sa1
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md), [Sa1
17:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#036.md), with idols generally [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010.md); or against the blasphemies of
Sennacherib [Kg2 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004.md), [Kg2
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#016.md), the mockeries of scoffers [Jer
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036.md), of the awe of His presence
([Deu 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#025.md) ([Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026) in Hebrew).md), His might for His
people [Jos 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md); as the object of the
soul's longings , the nearness in the Gospel, "children of the living
God" ([Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md) ([Hos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001) in Hebrew).md). "Since He can swear
by no greater, He sware by Himself" [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md). Since mankind are ready mostly
to believe that God means well with them, but are slow to think that He
is in earnest in His threats, God employs this sanction of what He says,
twice only in regard to His promises or His mercy [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md); [Eze
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010.md); everywhere else to give
solemnity to His threats [Num 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028.md);
[Deu 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040), (adding לעולס.md) [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024.md); [Eze
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011.md); [Eze
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#016.md), [Eze

17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md); [Eze
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003); (in rebuke.md) [Eze
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003.md), [Eze
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031.md), [Eze
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033.md); [Eze
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#027.md); [Eze
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008.md); [Eze
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#011.md). In the same sense, I swear by
Myself, [Jer 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#005.md); [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md); hath sworn by Himself, [Amo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008.md); by the excellency of Jacob, [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007).md). The appeal to the truth of His
own being in support of the truth of His words is part of the grandeur
el the prophet Ezekiel in whom it chiefly occurs. God says in the same
meaning, by Myself have I sworn, of promises which required strong faith
.

Saith the Lord of Hosts - Their blasphemies had denied the very being of
God, as God, to whom they preferred or likened their idols; they had
denied His power or that He could avenge, so He names His Name of power,
"the Lord of the hosts" of heaven against their array against His
border, I, "the Lord of hosts" who can fulfill what I threaten, and "the
God of Israel" who Myself am wronged in My people, will make "Moab as
Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah." Sodom and Gomorrah had
once been flourishing cities, on the borders of that land, which Israel
had won from the Amorite, and of which Moab and Ammon at different times
possessed themselves, and to secure which Ammon carried on that
exterminating war. For they were to the east of the plain "between
Bethel and Ai," where Lot made his choice, "in the plain or circle of
Jordan" [Gen 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md), [Gen
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003.md), [Gen
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md), the well known title of the
tract, through which the Jordan flowed into the Dead Sea. Near this, lay
Zoar, (Ziara) beneath the caves whither Lot, at whose prayer it had been
spared, escaped from its wickedness.

Moab and Ammon had settled and in time spread from the spot, wherein
their forefathers had received their birth. Sodom, at least, must have
been in that part of the plain, which is to the east of the Jordan,
since Lot was bidden to flee to the mountains, with his wife and
daughters, and there is no mention of the river, which would have been a
hindrance [Gen 19:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md). Then it lay
probably in that "broad belt of desolation" in the plain of Shittim, as
Gomorrah and others of the Pentapolis may have lain in "the
sulphur-sprinkled expanse" between El Riha (on the site of Jericho) and
the dead sea, "covered with layers of salt and gypsum which overlie the
loamy subsoil, literally, fulfilling the descriptions of Holy Writ (says
an eye-witness), "Brimstone and salt and burning, that it is not sown
nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein" [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md) : "a fruitful land turned into
salthess" [Psa 107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034.md). "No man shall
abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it" [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md). An elaborate system of
artificial irrigation was carried through that cis-Jordanic tract, which
decayed when it was desolated of man, and that desolation prevents its
restoration.

The doom of Moab and Ammon is rather of entire destruction beyond all
recovery, than of universal barrenness. For the imagery, that it should
be the "breeding" (literally, 'possession') "of nettles" would not be
literally compatible, except in different localities, with that of
"saltpits," which exclude all vegetation. Yet both are united in Moab.
The soil continues, as of old, of exuberant fertility; yet in part, from
the utter neglect and insecurity of agriculture it is abandoned to a
rank and encumbering vegetation; elsewhere, from the neglect of the
former artiticial system of irrigation, it is wholly barren. The plant
named is one of rank growth, since outcasts could lie concealed under it
[Job 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007.md). The preponderating
authority seems to be for "mollach," the Bedouin name of the "mallow,"
Prof. E. H. Palmer says , "which," he adds, "I have seen growing in rank
luxuriance in Moab, especially in the sides of deserted Arab camps."

The residue of My people shall spoil them, and the remnant of My people
shall possess them - Again, a remnant only, but even these shall prevail
against them, as was first fulfilled in Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc.
5:6-8).

[Zephaniah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 2:10</span></span>

This shall they have for their pride - Literally, "This to them instead
of their pride." Contempt and shame shall be the residue of the proud
man; the exaltation shall be gone, and all which they shall gain to
themselves shall be shame. Moab and Ammon are the types of heretics . As
they were akin to the people of God, but hating it; akin to Abraham
through a lawless birth, but ever molesting the children of Abraham, so
heretics profess to believe in Christ, to be children of Christ, and yet
ever seek to overthrow the faith of Christians. As the Church says, "My
mothers children are" "angry with me" [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md). They seem to have escaped the
overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah (pagan sins), and to have found a place
of refuge (Zoar); and yet they are in darkness and cannot see the light
of faith; and in an unlawful manner they mingle, against all right, the
falsehood of Satan with the truth of God; so that their doctrines
become, in part, "doctrines of devils," in part have some stamp of the
original truth.

To them, as to the Jews, our Lord says, "Ye are of your father the
devil." While they profess to be children of God, they claim by their
names to have God for their Father (Moab) and to be of His people
(Ammon), while in hatred to His true children they forfeit both. As Moab
seduced Israel, so they the children of the Church. They too enlarge
themselves against the borders of the Church, rending off its children
and making themselves the Church. They too utter reproaches and
revilings against it. "Take away their revilings," says an early father
, "against the law of Moses, and the prophets, and God the Creator, and
they have not a word to utter." They too "remove the old landmarks which
the fathers" (the prophets and Apostles) "have set." And so, barrenness
is their portion; as, after a time, heretics ever divide, and do not
multiply; they are a desert, being out of the Church of God: and at last
the remnant of Judah, the Church, possesses them, and absorbs them into
herself.

[Zephaniah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 2:11</span></span>

The Lord will be terrible unto - (upon) them that is, upon Moab and
Ammon, and yet not in themselves only, but as instances of His just
judgment. Whence it follows, "For He will famish all the gods of the
earth" (Rup.). Miserable indeed, to whom the Lord is terrible! Whence is
this? Is not God by Nature sweet and pleasurable and serene, and an
Object of longing? For the Angels ever desire to look into Him, and, in
a wonderful and unspeakable way, ever look and ever long to look. For
miserable they, whose conscience makes them shrink from the face of
Love. Even in this life they feel this shrinking, and, as if it were
some lessening of their grief, they deny it, as though this could
destroy the truth, which they 'hold down in unrighteousness.'" [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md).

For He will famish all the gods of the earth - Taking away "the fat of
their sacrifices, and the wine of their drink-offerings" [Deu
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038.md). Within 80 years from the death
of our Lord , the governor of Pontus and Bithynia wrote officially to
the Roman Emperor, that "the temples had been almost left desolate, the
sacred rites had been for a long time intermitted, and that the victims
had very seldom found a purchaser," before the persecution of the
Christians, and consulted him as to the amount of its continuance.
Toward the close of the century, it was one of the Pagan complaints,
which the Christian Apologist had to answer "they are daily melting away
the revenues of our temples." The prophet began to speak of the subdual
of Moab and Ammon; he is borne on to the triumphs of Christ over all the
gods of the Pagan, when the worship of God should not be at Jerusalem
only, but "they shall worship Him, every one from his place."

Even all the isles of the pagan - For this is the very note of the
Gospel, that, Cyril: "each who through faith in Christ was brought to
the knowledge of the truth, by Him, and with Him, "worshipeth from his
place" God the Father; and God is no longer known in Judaea only, but
the countries and cities of the Pagan, though they be separated by the
intervening sea from Judaea, no less draw near to Christ, pray, glorify,
thank Him unceasingly. For formerly "His name" was "great in Israel"
[Psa 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md), but now He is well known to
all everywhere; earth and sea are full of His glory, and so every one
'worshipeth Him from his place;' and this is what is said, 'As I live,
saith the Lord, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the
Lord' [Num 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md)." "The isles" are any
distant lands on the seashore ([Jer
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md), following; [Eze
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015.md), following; [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010).md), especially the very distant
[Isa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md); but also Asia Minor [Dan
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md), [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008.md) and the whole coast of Europe,
and even the Indian Archipelago , since the ivory and ebony came from
its "many isles."

Zephaniah revives the term, by which Moses had spoken of the dispersion
of the sons of Japhet: "By these were the 'isles of the Gentiles'
divided in their lands, every one after his tongue" [Gen
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005.md). He adds the word, "all;" all,
wherever they had been dispersed, every one from his place, shall
worship God. One universal worship shall ascend to God from all
everywhere. So Malachi prophesied afterward; "From the rising up of the
sun even to the going down of the same My Name shall be great among the
Gentiles, and "in every place" incense shall be offered unto God and a
pure offering, for My Name shall be great among the pagan, saith the
Lord of hosts" [Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md). Even a Jew
says here: "This, without doubt, refers to the time to come, when all
the inhabitants of the world shall know that the Lord is God, and that
His is the greatness and power and glory, and He shall be called the God
of the whole earth." The "isles" or "coasts of the sea" are the more the
emblem of the Church, in that, Cyril: "lying, as it were, in the sea of
this world and encompassed by the evil events in it, as with bitter
waters, and lashed by the most vehement waves of persecutions, the
Churches are yet founded, so that they cannot fall, and rear themselves
aloft, and are not overwhelmed by afflictions. For, for Christ's sake,
the Churches cannot be shaken, and 'the gates of hell shall not prevail
against them' [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)."

[Zephaniah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012.md)

Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by My sword - Literally, "Ye
Ethiopians also, the slain of My sword are they." Having summoned them
to His throne, God speaks of them, not to them anymore; perhaps in
compassion, as elsewhere in indignation . The Ethiopians were not in any
direct antagonism to God and His people, but allied only to their old
oppressor, Egypt. They may have been in Pharaoh Necho's army, in
resisting which, as a subject of Assyria, Josiah was slain: they are
mentioned [Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md) in that army which
Nebuchadnezzar smote at Carchemish in the 4th year of Jehoiakim. The
prophecy of Ezekiel implies rather, that Ethiopia should be involved in
the calamities of Egypt, than that it should be itself invaded. "Great
terror shall be in Ethiopia, 'when the slain shall fall in Egypt' [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004.md)." "Ethiopia and Lybia and Lydia
etc. and all the men of the land that is in league, shall fall 'with
these,' by the sword" [Eze 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md). "They
also that 'uphold Egypt' shall fall" [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md).

Syene, the frontier-fortress over against Ethiopia, is especially
mentioned as the boundary also of the destruction. "Messengers" God
says, "shall go forth from Me to make the careless Ethiopians afraid"
[Eze 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009.md), while the storm was
bursting in its full desolating force upon Egypt. All the other cities,
whose destruction is foretold, are cities of lower or upper Egypt .

But such a blow as that foretold by Jeremiah and Ezekiel must have
fallen heavily upon the allies of Egypt. We have no details, for the
Egyptians would not, and did not tell of the calamities and disgraces of
their country. No one does. Josephus, however, briefly but distinctly
says , that after Nebuchadnezzar had in the 23rd year of his reign, the
5th after the destruction of Jerusalem, "reduced into subjection Moab
and Ammon, he invaded Egypt, with a view to subdue it," "killed its then
king, and having set up another, captured for the second time the Jews
in it and carried them to Babylon." The memory of the devastation by
Nebuchadnezzar lived on apparently in Egypt, and is a recognized fact
among the Muslim historians, who had no interest in the fulfillment of
Jewish prophecy, of which it does not appear that they even knew.

Bokht-nasar (Nebuchadnezzar), they say , "made war on the son of Nechas
(Necho), slew him and ruined the city of Memphis" and many other cities
of Egypt: he carried the inhabitants captive, without leaving one, so
that Egypt remained waste forty years without one inhabitant." Another
says , The refuge which the king of Egypt granted to the Jews who fled
from Nebuchadnezzar brought this war upon it: for he took them under his
protection and would not give them up to their enemy. Nebuchadnezzar, in
revenge, marched against the king of Egypt and destroyed the country."
"One may be certain," says a good authority , "that the conquest of
Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar was a tradition generally spread in Egypt and
questioned by no one."

Ethiopia was then involved, as an ally, and as far as its contingent was
concerned, in the war, in which Nebuchadnezzar desolated Egypt for those
40 years. But, although this fulfilled the prophecy of Ezekiel, Isaiah,
some sixty years before Zephaniah, prophesied a direct conquest of
Ethiopia. I "have given," God says, "Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and
Seba for thee" [Isa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md). It lay in
God's purpose, that Cyrus should restore His own people, and that his
ambition should find its vent and compensation in the lands beyond. It
may be that, contrary to all known human policy, Cyrus restored the Jews
to their own land, willing to bind them to himself, and to make them a
frontier territory toward Egypt, not subject only but loyal to himself.
This is quite consistent with the reason which he assigns; "The Lord God
of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He hath
charged me to build Him an house at Jerusalem which is in Judah" [Ezr
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md); and with the statement of
Josephus, that he was moved thereto by "reading the prophecy which
Isaiah left, 210 years before."

It is, alas! nothing new to Christians to have mixed motives for their
actions: the exception is to have a single motive, "for the glory of
God." The advantage to himself would doubtless flash at once on the
founder of a great empire, though it did not suggest the restoration of
the Jews. Egypt and Assyria had always, on either side, wished to
possess themselves of Palestine, which lay between them. Anyhow, one
Persian monarch did restore the Jews; his successor possessed himself of
"Egypt, and part, at least, of Ethiopia." Cyrus wished, it is related ,
"to war in person against Babylon, the Bactrians, the Sacae, and Egypt."
He perished, as is known, before he had completed the third of his
purposed conquests. Cambyses, although after the conquest of Egypt he
planned ill his two more distant expeditions, reduced "the Ethiopians
bordering upon Egypt" ( "lower Ethiopia and Nubia"), and these "brought
gifts" permanently to the Persian Sovereign. Even in the time of Xerxes,
the Ethiopians had to furnish their contingent of troops against the
Greeks. Herodotus describes their dress and weapons, as they were
reviewed at Doriscus . Cambyses, then, did not lose his hold over
Ethiopia and Egypt, when forced by the rebellion of Pseudo-Smerdis to
quit Egypt.

[Zephaniah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zep 2:13</span></span>

Zephaniah began by singling out Judah amid the general destruction, "I
will also stretch out My Hand upon Judah" [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md); he sums up the judgment of the
world in the same way; "He will stretch out, or, Stretch He forth, "His
Hand against the north and destroy Asshur, and make Nineveh a
desolation." Judah had, in Zephaniah's time, nothing to fear from
Assyria. Isaiah [Isa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md) and Micah
[Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md) had already foretold, that
the captivity would be to Babylon. Yet of Assyria alone the prophet, in
his own person, expresses his own conformity with the mind of God. Of
others he had said, "the word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, and
I will destroy thee; As I live, saith the Lord, Moab shall be as Sodom.
Ye also, O Ethiopians, the, slain of My sword are they." Of Assyria
alone, by a slight inflection of the word, he expresses that he goes
along with this, which he announces.

He does not say as an imprecation, "May He stretch forth His hand;" but
gently, as continuing his prophecies, "and," joining on Asshur with the
rest; only instead of saying "He will stretch forth," by a form almost
insulated in Hebrew, he says, "And stretch He forth His Hand." In a way
not unlike, David having declared God's judgments, "The Lord trieth the
righteous; and the wicked and the lover of violence doth His soul abhor,
subjoineth, On the wicked rain He snares," signifying that he (as all
must be in the Day of judgment), is at one with the judgment of God.
This is the last sentence upon Nineveh, enforcing that of Jonah and
Nahum, yet without place of repentance now. He accumulates words
expressive of desolateness. It should not only be a "desolation" [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md), [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md), as he had said of Ashkelon, Moab
and Amman, but a dry, parched , unfruitful [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md) land. As Isaiah, under the same
words, prophesies that the dry and desolate land should, by the Gospel,
be glad, so the gladness of the world should become dryness and
desolation. Asshur is named, as though one individual , implying the
entireness of the destruction; all shall perish as one man; or as
gathered into one and dependent upon one, its evil King. "The north" is
not only Assyria, in that its armies came upon Judah from the north, but
it stands for the whole power of evil (see [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md), as Nineveh for the whole
beautiful, evil, world. The world with "the princes of this world" shall
perish together.

[Zephaniah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 2:14</span></span>

And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her - No desolation is like
that of decayed luxury. It preaches the nothingness of man, the
fruitlessness of his toils, the fleetingness of his hopes and
enjoyments, and their baffling when at their height. Grass in a court or
on a once beaten road, much more, in a town, speaks of the passing away
of what has been, that man was accustomed to be there, and is not, or is
there less than he was. It leaves the feeling of void and forsakenness.
But in Nineveh not a few tufts of grass here and there shall betoken
desolation, it shall be one wild rank pasture, where "flocks" shall not
feed only, but "lie down" as in their fold and continual resting place,
not in the outskirts only or suburbs, but in the very center of her life
and throng and busy activity, "in the midst of her," and none shall fray
them away. So Isaiah had said of the cities of Aroer, "they shall be for
flocks, which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid" [Isa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002.md), and of Judah until its
restoration by Christ, that it should be "a joy of wild asses, a pasture
of flocks" ([Isa 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014.md), compare [Jer
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002).md). And not only those which are
wont to be found in some connection with man, but "all the beasts of a
nation" , the troops of wild and savage and unclean beasts which shun
the dwellings of man or are his enemies, these in troops have their lair
there.

Both the cormorant and the bittern - They may be the same. The pelican
retires inland to consume its food. Tristram, Houghton, in Smith's Bible
Dictionary, "Pelican" note. It could be a hedgehog.

Shall lodge in the upper lintels of it. - The "chapiters" (English
margin) or capitals of the pillars of the temples and palaces shall lie
broken and strewn upon the ground, and among those desolate fragments of
her pride shall unclean animals haunt. The pelican has its Hebrew name
from vomiting. It vomits up the shells which it had swallowed whole,
after they had been opened by the heat of the stomach, and so picks out
the animal contained in them , the very image of greediness and
uncleanness. It dwells also not in deserts only but near marshes, so
that Nineveh is doubly waste.

A voice shall sing in the windows - In the midst of the desolation, the
muteness of the hedgehog and the pensive loneliness of the solitary
pelican, the musing spectator is even startled by the gladness of a
bird, joyous in the existence which God has given it. Instead of the
harmony of music and men-singers and women-singers in their palaces
shall be the sweet music of some lonely bird, unconscious that it is
sitting "in the windows" of those, at whose name the world grew pale,
portions of the outer walls being all which remain of her palaces.
"Desolation" shall be "in the thresholds," sitting, as it were, in them;
everywhere to be seen in them; the more, because unseen. Desolation is
something oppressive; we "feel" its presence. There, as the warder watch
and ward at the empty portals, where once was the fullest throng, shall
"desolation sit," that no one enter. "For He shall uncover (hath
uncovered, English margin) the cedar-work:" in the roofless palaces, the
carved "cedar-work" shall be laid open to wind and rain. Any one must
have noticed, how piteous and dreary the decay of any house in a town
looks, with the torn paper hanging uselessly on its walls. A poet of our
own said niche beautiful ruins of a wasted monastery:

"For the gay beams of lightsome day

Gild, but to flout the ruins gray."

But at Nineveh it is one of the mightiest cities of the world which thus
lies waste, and the bared "cedar-work" had, in the days of its
greatness, been carried off from the despoiled Lebanon or Hermon .

[Zephaniah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 2:15</span></span>

This utter desolation is "the rejoicing city" (so unlike is it, that
there is need to point out that it is the same); this is she, who was
full of joy, exulting exceedingly, but in herself, not in God; "that
dwelt carelessly," literally, "securely," and so carelessly; saying
"Peace and safety" [Th1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md), as though
no evil would come upon her, and so perishing more certainly and
miserably (see [Jdg 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027).md) "That said
in her heart," this was her inmost feeling, the moving cause of all her
deeds; "I am and there is none beside me;" literally , "and there is no
I beside," claiming the very attribute of God (as the world does) of
self-existence, as if it alone were "I," and others, in respect of her,
were as nothing. Pantheism, which denies the being of God, as Author of
the world, and claims the life in the material world to be God, and each
living being to be a part of God, is only this self-idolatry, reflected
upon and carried out in words. All the pride of the world, all
self-indulgence which says, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die,"
all covetousness which ends in this world, speaks this by its acts, "I
and no I beside."

How is she become a desolation - Has passed wholly into it, exists only
as a desolation, "a place for beasts to lie down in," a mere den for
"the wild beasts. Every one that passeth by her shall hiss" in derision,
"and wag" (or wave) "his hand" in detestation, as though putting the
hand between them and it, so as not to look at it, or, as it were,
motioning it away. The action is different from that of "clapping the
hands in exultation" [Nah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md).

"It is not difficult," Jerome says, "to explain this of the world, that
when the Lord hath stretched forth His Hand over the north and destroyed
the Assyrian, the Prince of this world, the world also perishes together
with its Princes, and is brought to utter desolation, and is pitied by
none, but all hiss and shake their hands at its ruin. But of the Church
it seems, at first sight, blasphemous to say that it shall be a pathless
desert, and wild beasts shall dwell in her, and that afterward it shall
be said insultingly over her; 'This is the city given up to ill, which
"dwelt carelessly and said in her heart, I and none beside."' But whoso
should consider that of the Apostle, wherein he says, "in the last days
perilous times shall come" [Ti2 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001.md),
and what is written in the Gospel, that "because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold" [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md), so that then shall that be
fulfilled, "When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find the faith on the
earth?" he will not marvel at the extreme desolation of the Church,
that, in the reign of antichrist, it shall be reduced to a desolation
and given over to beasts, and shall suffer whatever the prophet now
describes.

For if for unbelief "God spared not the natural branches," but "brake
them off," and "turned rivers into a wilderness and the water-springs
into a dry ground," and "a fruitful land into barrenness, for the
iniquity of them that dwell therein," why not as to those of whom He had
said, "He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
into water-springs, and there He maketh the hungry to dwell" [Psa
107:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md); and as to those whom "out
of the wild olive He hath grafted into the good olive tree," why, if
forgetful of this benefit, they depart from their Maker and worship the
Assyrian, should He not undo them and bring them to the same thirst
wherein they were before? Which, whereas it may be understood generally
of the coming of antichrist or of the end of the world, yet it may, day
by day, be understood of those who feign to be of the Church of God, and
"in works deny it, are hearers of the word not doers," who in vain boast
in an outward show, whereas herds that is, troops of vices dwell in
them, and brute animals serving the body, and all the beasts of the
field which devour their hearts (and pelicans, that is, gluttons , whose
'god is their belly') and hedgehogs, a prickly animal full of spikes
which pricketh whatever it toucheth.

After which it is subjoined, that the Church shall therefore suffer
this, or hath suffered it, because it lifted itself up proudly and
raised its head like a cedar, given up to evil works, and yet promising
itself future blessedness, and despising others in its heart, nor
thinking that there is any other beside itself, and saying, "I am, and
there is no other beside me," how is it become a solitude, a lair of
beasts! For where before, dwelt the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, and Angels presided over its ministries, there shall beasts
dwell. And if we understand that, every one that passeth by shall hiss,
we shall explain it thus; when Angels shall pass through her, and not
remain in her, as was their wont, they shall be amazed and marvel, and
shall not support and bear her up with their hand, when falling, but
shall lift up the hands and shall pass by. Or they shall make a sound as
those who mourn. But if we understand this of the devil and his angels,
who destroyed the vine also that was brought out of Egypt, we shall say,
that through the soul, which before was the temple of God and hath
ceased so to be, the serpent passeth, and hisseth and spitteth forth the
venom of his malice in her, and not this only, but setteth in motion his
works which figuratively are called hands."

Rup.: "The earlier and partial fulfillment of prophecy does not destroy,
it rather confirms, the entire fulfillment to come. For whoso heareth of
the destruction of mighty cities, is constrained to believe the truth of
the Gospel, that the fashion of this world passeth away, and that, after
the likeness of Nineveh and Babylon, the Lord will in the end judge the
whole world also."
