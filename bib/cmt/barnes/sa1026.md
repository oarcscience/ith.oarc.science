### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 26:1</span></span>

The incident related in this chapter of the meeting between Saul and
David bears a strong general resemblance to that recorded in 1 Sam. 24,
and is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once. Existing
discrepancies are explained by the supposition that one narrative
relates fully some incidents on which the other is silent. On the whole
the most probable conclusion is that the two narratives relate to one
and the same event. (Compare the two narratives of the Creation, Gen. 1;
[Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md) ff; the two narratives of
David's war, 2 Sam. 8; and 2 Sam. 10; and those of the death of Ahaziah,
[Kg2 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md) ff; and [Ch2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md)

Ahimelech the Hittite - Only mentioned here. Uriah was also a Hittite.

Abishai - He was son of Zeruiah, David's sister, but probably about the
same age as David. He because very famous as a warrior [Sa2
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#018.md), but was implicated with his
brother Joab in the murder of Abner in retaliation for the death of
their brother Asahel [Sa2 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#030.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 26:15</span></span>

This incidental testimony to Abner's great eminence as a warrior is
fully borne out by David's dirge at Abner's death [Sa2
3:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031.md), [Sa2
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#038.md), as well as by his whole history.
At the same time David's bantering tone in regard to Abner, coupled with
what he says in [Sa1 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md), makes it
proable that David attributed Saul's persecution of him in some degree
to Abner. Abner would be likely to dread a rival in the young conqueror
of Judah (compare [Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 26:19</span></span>

If the Lord have stirred thee up - The meaning is clear from the
preceding history. "An evil spirit from God troubling him" was the
beginning of the persecution. And this evil spirit was sent in
punishment of Saul's sin [Sa1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md),
[Sa1 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md). If the continued
persecution was merely the consequence of this evil spirit continuing to
vex Saul, David advises Saul to seek God's pardon, and, as a
consequence, the removal of the evil spirit, by offering a sacrifice.
But if the persecution was the consequence of the false accusations of
slanderers, then "cursed" be his enemies who, by their actions, drove
David out from the only land where Yahweh was worshipped, and forced him
to take refuge in the country of pagan and idolaters (compare [Deu
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027.md); [Deu
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036).md).
