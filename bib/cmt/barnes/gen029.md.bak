### [Genesis Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

\- Jacob's Marriage

6\. רחל rāchēl, Rachel, "a ewe."

16\. לאה lê'âh, Leah, "wearied."

24\. זלפה zı̂lpâh, Zilpah, "drop?"

29\. בלהה bı̂lhâh, Bilhah, "timidity."

32\. ראוּבן re'uvbēn, Reuben, "behold a son." A paronomasia in allusion
to the phrase בעניי ראה be‛ānyı̂y rā'âh. Derivatives and compounds, being
formed by the common speaker, are sometimes founded upon resemblance in
sound, and not always on precise forms of the original sentence which
prompted them.

33\. שׁמעין shı̂m‛ôn, Shim'on, "hearing, answer."

34\. לוי lêvı̂y, Levi, "junction, union."

35\. יחוּדה yehûdâh, Jehudah, "praised."

In this chapter and the following, Jacob grows from a solitary fugitive
with a staff in his hand [Gen 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010.md) to
be the father of a large family and the owner of great wealth. He proves
himself to be a man of patience and perseverance, and the Lord according
to promise is with him.

[Gen 29:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

Jacob arrives at the well of Haran. "The land of the sons of the east."
The points of the heavens were defined by the usage of practical life,
and not by the standard of a science yet unknown. Hence, the east means
any quarter toward the sunrising. Haran was about four degrees east of
Beer-sheba, and five and a half degrees north. The distance was about
four hundred and fifty miles, and therefore it would take Jacob fifteen
days to perform the journey at thirty miles a day. If he reached Bethel
the first night, he must have travelled about fifty miles the first day.
After this he proceeds on his journey without any memorable incident. In
the neighborhood of Haran he comes upon a well, by which lay three
flocks. This is not the well near Haran where Abraham's servant met
Rebekah. It is in the pasture grounds at some distance from the town. On
its mouth was a large stone, indicating that water was precious, and
that the well was the common property of the surrounding natives. The
custom was to gather the flocks, roll away the stone, which was too
great to be moved by a boy or a female, water the flocks, and replace
the stone. Jacob, on making inquiry, learns that Haran is at hand, that
Laban is well, and that Rachel is drawing nigh with her father's flocks.
Laban is called by Jacob the son of Nahor, that is, his grandson, with
the usual latitude of relative names in Scripture [Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md). "The day is great." A great
part of it yet remains. It is not yet the time to shut up the cattle for
the night; "water the sheep and go feed them." Jacob may have wished to
meet with Rachel without presence of the shepherds. "We cannot." There
was a rule or custom that the flocks must be all assembled before the
stone was rolled away for the purpose of watering the cattle. This may
have been required to insure a fair distribution of the water to all
parties, and especially to those who were too weak to roll away the
stone.

[Gen 29:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009.md)

Jacob's interview with Rachel, and hospitable reception by Laban.
Rachel's approach awakens all Jacob's warmth of feeling. He rolls away
the stone, waters the sheep, kisses Rachel, and bursts into tears. The
remembrance of home and of the relationship of his mother to Rachel
overpowers him. He informs Rachel who he is, and she runs to acquaint
her father. Laban hastens to welcome his relative to his house. "Surely
my bone and my flesh art thou." This is a description of kinsmanship
probably derived from the formation of the woman out of the man [Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md). A month here means the period
from new moon to new moon, and consists of twenty-nine or thirty days.

[Gen 29:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#015.md)

Jacob serves seven years for Rachel. "What shall thy wages be?" An
active, industrious man like Jacob was of great value to Laban. "Two
daughters." Daughters in those countries and times were also objects of
value, for which their parents were accustomed to receive considerable
presents [Gen 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#053.md). Jacob at present,
however, is merely worth his labor. He has apparently nothing else to
offer. As he loves Rachel, he offers to serve seven years for her, and
is accepted. Isaac loved Rebekah after she was sought and won as a bride
for him. Jacob loves Rachel before he makes a proposal of marriage. His
attachment is pure and constant, and hence the years of his service seem
but days to him. The pleasure of her society both in the business and
leisure of life makes the hours pass unnoticed. It is obvious that in
those early days the contact of the sexes before marriage was more
unrestrained than it afterward became.

[Gen 29:21-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#021.md)

Jacob is betrayed into marrying Leah, and on consenting to serve other
seven years obtains Rachel also. He claims his expected reward when due.
"Made a feast." The feast in the house of the bride's father seems to
have lasted seven days, at the close of which the marriage was
completed. But the custom seems to have varied according to the
circumstances of the bridegroom. Jacob had no house of his own to which
to conduct the bride. In the evening: when it was dark. The bride was
also closely veiled, so that it was easy for Laban to practise this
piece of deceit. "A handmaid." It was customary to give the bride a
handmaid, who became her confidential servant [Gen
24:59](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#059.md), [Gen
24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md). In the morning Jacob discovers
that Laban had overreached him. This is the first retribution Jacob
experiences for the deceitful practices of his former days. He
expostulates with Laban, who pleads the custom of the country.

It is still the custom not to give the younger in marriage before the
older, unless the latter be deformed or in some way defective. It is
also not unusual to practise the very same trick that Laban now
employed, if the suitor is so simple as to be off his guard. Jacob,
however, did not expect this at his relative's hands, though he had
himself taken part in proceedings equally questionable. "Fulfill the
week of this." If this was the second day of the feast celebrating the
nuptials of Leah, Laban requests him to Complete the week, and then he
will give him Rachel also. If, however, Leah was fraudulently put upon
him at the close of the week of feasting, then Laban in these words
proposes to give Rachel to Jacob on fulfilling another week of nuptial
rejoicing. The latter is in the present instance more likely. In either
case the marriage of Rachel is only a week after that of Leah. Rather
than lose Rachel altogether, Jacob consents to comply with Laban's
terms.

Rachel was the wife of Jacob's affections and intentions. The taking of
a second wife in the lifetime of the first was contrary to the law of
nature, which designed one man for one woman [Gen
2:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md). But the marrying of a
sister-in-law was not yet incestuous, because no law had yet been made
on the subject. Laban gives a handmaid to each of his daughters. To
Rebekah his sister had been given more than one [Gen
24:61](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#061.md). Bondslaves had been in
existence long before Laban's time [Gen
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md). "And loved also Rachel more than
Leah." This proves that even Leah was not unloved. At the time of his
marriage Jacob was eighty-four years of age; which corresponds to half
that age according to the present average of human life.

[Gen 29:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031.md)

Leah bears four sons to Jacob. "The Lord saw." The eye of the Lord is
upon the sufferer. It is remarkable that both the narrator and Leah
employ the proper name of God, which makes the performance of promise a
prominent feature of his character. This is appropriate in the mouth of
Leah, who is the mother of the promised seed. "That Leah was hated" -
less loved than Rachel. He therefore recompenses her for the lack of her
husband's affections by giving her children, while Rachel was barren.
"Reuben" - behold a son. "The Lord hath looked on my affliction." Leah
had qualities of heart, if not of outward appearance, which commanded
esteem. She had learned to acknowledge the Lord in all her ways. "Simon"
- answer. She had prayed to the Lord, and this was her answer. "Levi" -
union, the reconciler. Her husband could not, according to the
prevailing sentiments of those days, fail to be attached to the mother
of three sons. "Judah" - praised. Well may she praise the Lord; for this
is the ancestor of the promised seed. It is remarkable that the wife of
priority, but not of preference, is the mother of the seed in whom all
nations are to be blessed. Levi the reconciler is the father of the
priestly tribe. Simon is attached to Judah. Reuben retires into the
background.

Reuben may have been born when Jacob was still only eighty-four, and
consequently Judah was born when Jacob was eighty-seven.
