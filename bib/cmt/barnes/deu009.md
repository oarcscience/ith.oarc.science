### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

The lesson of this chapter is exactly that of [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008), "By grace are ye saved through
faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works,
lest any man should boast."

In referring to their various rebellions, Moses here, as elsewhere, has
regard not so much for the order of time as to that of subject. (Compare
[Deu 1:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009) note.) Such reasons as
convenience and fitness to his argument sufficiently explain the
variations observable when the statements of this chapter are minutely
compared with those of Exo. 32-34. In these variations we have simply
such treatment of facts as is usual and warrantable between parties
personally acquainted with the matters.

[Deuteronomy 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 9:3</span></span>

So shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly - This is not
inconsistent with [Deu 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022), in which
instant annihilation is not to be expected for the reasons assigned.
Here Moses urges the people to trust in God's covenanted aid; since He
would then make no delay in so destroying the nations attacked by them
as to put them into enjoyment of the promises, and in doing so as fast
as was for the well-being of Israel itself.

[Deuteronomy 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 9:8</span></span>

Also in Horeb - Rather, "even in Horeb." The time and circumstances made
the apostasy at Horeb particularly inexcusable.

[Deuteronomy 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 9:18</span></span>

I fell down before the Lord, as at the first - Moses interceded for the
people before he came down from the mountain the first time [Exo
32:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011). This intercession is only
briefly alluded to in this verse. Afterward he spent another 40 days on
the mountain in fasting and prayer to obtain a complete restitution of
the covenant [Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028). It is this
second forty days, and the intercession of Moses made therein (compare
[Exo 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009)), that is more particularly
brought forward here and in [Deu
9:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025).

[Deuteronomy 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 9:20</span></span>

Israel could not even boast that its heads and representatives
continued, faithful. Aaron had been already designated for the high
priestly functions; but he fell away with the rest of the people. It was
due therefore solely to the grace of God and the intercession of Moses
that Aaron himself and his promised priesthood with him were not cut
off; just as at a later time, when Aaron had actually to die for a new
sin Israel owed it still to the same causes that Eleazar was substituted
and the High Priesthood perpetuated (compare [Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006); [Num
20:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024)).

[Deuteronomy 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 9:22</span></span>

See the marginal reference. Taberah was the name of a spot in or near
the station of Kibroth-hattaavah, and accordingly is not named in the
list of encampments given in [Num
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016). The separate mention of the two
is, however, appropriate here, for each place and each name was a
memorial of an act of rebellion. The instances in this and the next
verse are not given in order of occurrence. The speaker for his own
purposes advances from the slighter to the more heinous proofs of guilt.
