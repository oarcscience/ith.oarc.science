### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 33:0</span></span>

The promises of Jer. 32 are confirmed, but with a more directly
spiritual meaning. The prophet foreshows in it the happiness of the
returning exiles, of which the culminating glory is Messiah's birth [Jer
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015), in whom both the Levitical
priesthood and the Davidic kingdom are combined [Jer
33:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017), and God's covenant with
mankind made perpetual [Jer 33:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#019).

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

The prison - The guard.

[Jeremiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 33:2</span></span>

Or, Thus saith Yahweh the doer of it, Yahweh who formeth it, that He may
establish it, Yahweh is His name. The word "it" means whatsoever Yahweh
wills.

[Jeremiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 33:3</span></span>

Mighty things - Or, as in the margin. The words are probably a quotation
from [Isa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006).

[Jeremiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 33:4</span></span>

By ... by - Rather, against ... against. As the works of the enemy
approached the walls, houses were pulled down to build inner
fortifications. Swords are mentioned in [Eze
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009) (translated, axes), as used for
breaking down the towers in the walls. See [Jer
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017), note.

[Jeremiah 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 33:5</span></span>

Render, They, i. e., the Jews come to fight with the Chaldaeans, and to
fill them, i. e., the houses, with the dead bodies etc.

[Jeremiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 33:6</span></span>

I will bring it health and cure - I will lay upon it a bandage and
healing, i. e., a healing bandage, a plaster with healing medicines.

[Jeremiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 33:7</span></span>

At the first - i. e., before their sins had provoked God to anger.

[Jeremiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 33:9</span></span>

It - The city, Jerusalem.

They shall fear and tremble - With terror, because of the eternal
opposition between right and wrong, truth and error. The nations of the
earth as opposed to Israel represent the world as opposed to the Church.

[Jeremiah 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 33:10</span></span>

Which ye say shall be desolate - Of which ye say, It is desolate ... The
prophet first sees Judaea silent and desolate during the 70 years'
captivity: and then describes the two things, men and cattle, without
which land is valueless.

[Jeremiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 33:11</span></span>

Praise the Lord ... - The customary formula of thanksgiving in many of
the later Psalms, and from its occurrence in [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013); [Ch2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003), [Ch2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006) ff probably a regular part of the
liturgical service of the temple.

Shall say ... shall bring the sacrifice of praise - Or, say ... as they
bring praise, i. e., a thank-offering (see the marginal reference) into
the house of the Lord

At the first - Before the captivity, and when still unpolluted by the
sins which have brought upon it so heavy a chastisement.

[Jeremiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 33:12</span></span>

An habitation - "A shepherd's encampment." The words, "causing their
flocks to lie down," mean gathering them into the fold at night.

[Jeremiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 33:13</span></span>

Telleth - i. e., counts the number of his sheep.

[Jeremiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 33:14</span></span>

That good thing - Better, the good word [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010), with reference to the promise
already given [Jer 23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005).

[Jeremiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 33:15</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. When the good word was spoken, the name
Yahweh our Righteousness was given to the righteous Sprout: here it is
given to Jerusalem, i. e., to the Church, because it is her business
mediately to work on earth that righteousness which Christ works
absolutely. Compare [Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023).

[Jeremiah 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 33:17</span></span>

Read literally, these verses promise the permanent restoration of the
Davidic throne and (of the Levitical priesthood. As a matter of fact
Zedekiah was the last king of David's line, and the Levitical
priest-hood has long passed away. Both these changes Jeremiah himself
foretold [Jer 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030); [Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016). In what way then is this
apparent contradiction (compare [Isa
66:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020); Ezek. 40-48) to be
explained? The solution is probably as follows. It was necessary that
the Bible should be intelligible to the people at the time when it was
written, and in some degree to the writer. The Davidic kingship and the
Levitical priest-hood were symbols, which represented to the Jew all
that was most dear to his heart in the state of things under which he
lived. Their restoration was the restoration of his national and
spiritual life. Neither was so restored as to exist permanently. But
that was given instead, of which both were types, the Church, whose Head
is the true prophet, priest and King.

[Jeremiah 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 33:21</span></span>

This promise also has been not literally, but spiritually fulfilled, for
in this sense only have the seed of David and the Levites been
multiplied.

[Jeremiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 33:24</span></span>

Considerest thou not - literally, Hast thou not seen, i. e., noticed?

This people - i. e., the Jews.

Thus ... - Or, and "My people they have despised," so that they are "no
more a nation" in their sight. They say that God has rejected Judah as
well as Israel: and thus they despise themselves in their relation to
God as His covenant-people, by regarding their national existence as
about immediately to cease forever.

[Jeremiah 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 33:25</span></span>

The ordinances of heaven and earth - i. e., the whole order of nature
Nature is not more firmly established than God's purposes in grace.
