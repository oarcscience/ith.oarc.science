### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 25:1</span></span>

Render it:

\(1\) If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment,
and the judges judge them, and justify the righteous and condemn the
wicked (compare the marginal reference. and [Exo
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007); [Pro
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015));

\(2\) then it shall be, etc.

[Deu 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002)

Scourging is named as a penalty in [Lev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#020). The beating here spoken of
would be on the back with a rod or stick (compare [Pro
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013); [Pro
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#029); [Pro
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#003)).

[Deuteronomy 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 25:3</span></span>

The Jews to keep within the letter of the law fixed 39 stripes as the
maximum (compare the marginal reference.). Forty signifies the full
measure of judgment (compare [Gen
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#012); [Num
14:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033)); but the son of Israel was
not to be lashed like a slave at the mercy of another. The judge was
always to be present to see that the Law in this particular was not
overpassed.

[Deuteronomy 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 25:4</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. In other kinds of labor the oxen were
usually muzzled. When driven to and fro over the threshing-floor in
order to stamp out the grain from the chaff, they were to be allowed to
partake of the fruits of their labors.

[Deuteronomy 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 25:5</span></span>

The law of levirate marriage. The law on this subject is not unique to
the Jews, but is found (see [Gen 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008))
in all essential respects the same among various Oriental nations,
ancient and modern. The rules in these verses, like those upon divorce,
do but incorporate existing immemorial usages, and introduce various
wise and politic limitations and mitigations of them. The root of the
obligation here imposed upon the brother of the deceased husband lies in
the primitive idea of childlessness being a great calamity (compare [Gen
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004); and note), and extinction of
name and family one of the greatest that could happen (compare [Deu
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014); [Psa
109:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#012)). To avert this the ordinary
rules as to intermarriage are in the case in question (compare [Lev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016)) set aside. The obligation was
onerous (compare [Rut 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006)), and might
be repugnant; and it is accordingly considerably reduced and restricted
by Moses. The duty is recognized as one of affection for the memory of
the deceased; it is not one which could be enforced at law. That it
continued down to the Christian era is apparent from the question on
this point put to Jesus by the Sadducees (see the marginal references).

[Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

No child - literally, "no son." The existence of a daughter would
clearly suffice. The daughter would inherit the name and property of the
father; compare [Num 27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001).

[Deu 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009)

Loose his shoe from off his foot - In token of taking from the unwilling
brother all right over the wife and property of the deceased. Planting
the foot on a thing was an usual symbol of lordship and of taking
possession (compare [Gen 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#017); [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024)), and loosing the shoe and
handing it to another in like manner signified a renunciation and
transfer of right and title (compare [Rut
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007); [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008), and [Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009)). The widow here is directed
herself, as the party slighted and injured, to deprive her brother-law
of his shoe, and spit in his face (compare [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014)). The action was intended to
aggravate the disgrace conceived to attach to the conduct of the man.

[Deu 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010)

The house ... - Equivalent to "the house of the barefooted one." To go
barefoot was a sign of the most abject condition; compare [Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).

[Deuteronomy 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 25:12</span></span>

This is the only mutilation prescribed by the Law of Moses, unless we
except the retaliation prescribed as a punishment for the infliction on
another of bodily injuries [Lev
24:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019). The act in question was
probably not rare in the times and countries for which the Law of Moses
was designed. It is of course to be understood that the act was willful,
and that the prescribed punishment would be inflicted according to the
sentence of the judges.

[Deuteronomy 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 25:13</span></span>

Honesty in trade, as a duty to our neighbor, is emphatically enforced
once more (compare [Lev 19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035)). It
is noteworthy that John the Baptist puts the like duties in the
forefront of his preaching (compare [Luk
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012) ff); and that "the prophets"
(compare [Eze 45:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#010); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005); [Mic
6:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010)) and "the Psalms" [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010), [Pro
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#023), not less than "the Law,"
especially insist on them.

[Deu 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)

Divers weights - i. e. stones of unequal weights, the lighter to sell
with, the heavier to buy with. Stones were used by the Jews instead of
brass or lead for their weights, as less liable to lose anything through
rust or wear.

[Deu 25:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)

It was not after the spirit or mission of the Law to aim at overcoming
inveterate opposition by love and by attempts at conversion (contrast
[Luk 9:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)). The law taught God's
hatred of sin and of rebellion against Him by enjoining the extinction
of the obstinate sinner. The Amalekites were a kindred people [Gen
36:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015); and living as they did in
the peninsula of Sinai, they could not but have well known the mighty
acts God had done for His people in Egypt and the Red Sea; yet they
manifested from the first a persistent hostility to Israel (compare [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008), and note; [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045)). They provoked therefore the
sentence here pronounced, which was executed at last by Saul ([Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003) ff).
