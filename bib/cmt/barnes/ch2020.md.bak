### [2 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 20:0</span></span>

The narrative in 2 Chr. 20:1-30 is entirely additional to Kings; in [Ch2
20:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031.md), it runs parallel with [Kg1
22:41-49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

The present Hebrew (and English) text mentions the Ammonites twice over.
Hence, some adopt a different reading and translate "the children of
Ammon, and with them certain of the Maonites," etc. Compare [Ch2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md), note; [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md), note; [Ch1
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041.md), note.

[2 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 20:2</span></span>

Translate, "from beyond the sea, from Edom." The "sea" intended is, of
course, the Dead Sea. "Syria" (Aram) is probably a mistake of a copyist
for "Edom" (compare [Sa2 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012) note.md).

On Engedi, see [Sa1 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 20:3</span></span>

General fasts had been previously observed by the Israelites (e. g. [Jdg
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026.md); [Sa1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006).md); but we do not hear of any fast
having been "proclaimed" by authority before this.

[2 Chronicles 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 20:5</span></span>

The new court - In Solomon's Temple there were two courts. One of these
had probably been renovated by Jehoshaphat or by his father, Asa [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md), and was known as "the new
court."

[2 Chronicles 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 20:6</span></span>

Jehoshaphat's appeal is threefold:

\(1\) to God omnipotent [Ch2 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md);

\(2\) to "our God;"

\(3\) the God especially "of this house" the temple.

[Ch2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md)

Abraham thy friend - Historically, this is the first use of this
remarkable expression, afterward repeated (marginal references). The
ground of the expression is to be found principally in [Gen
18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md), where Abraham spoke with God
as a man with his friend (compare [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).md).

[Ch2 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#008.md), [Ch2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009.md)

The appeal recalls Solomon's prayer (marginal references), which God had
formally accepted by sending down fire from heaven to consume the
accompanying offering.

[2 Chronicles 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 20:10</span></span>

The Maonites of [Ch2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md) are here,
and in [Ch2 20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md), called the
"children" or inhabitants "of mount Seir." Hence, we may gather that
they were a tribe of Edomites, the inhabitants, probably of a city Maon
(now Ma'an) on the eastern side of the Wady el-Arabah.

[2 Chronicles 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 20:14</span></span>

"Mattaniah" is thought to be a corrupt reading for "Nethaniah," who is
mentioned among the sons of Asaph in [Ch1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md), [Ch1
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#012.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 20:15</span></span>

The prophet uses words familiar to the people, and connected with
several great deliverances (see the marginal references).

[Ch2 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#016.md)

By the "cliff (or, rather - as in the margin - ascent) of Ziz," we must
understand the mountain path which leads up from Engedi across the
elevated tract still known as El-Husasah, in the direction of Tekoa [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md).

At the end of the brook - Rather, "at the end of the gulley," or dry
torrent-course. No name like Jeruel has been as yet found in this
district.

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

Tekoa ([Sa2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002) note.md) lay on the
borders of the desert which skirts the highlands of Judaea toward the
east. The town was built on a hill of a considerable height.

[2 Chronicles 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 20:21</span></span>

Praise the beauty of holiness - Some render, "in the beauty of holiness"
- i. e. in rich apparel and ornaments suitable to a holy occasion.
Compare [Psa 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 20:22</span></span>

The Lord set ambushments - These liers in wait have been regarded as
angels employed by God to confuse the host and cause its destruction, so
that the Moabites and Ammonites first united to destroy the Edomites,
and then turned upon each other.

[2 Chronicles 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 20:24</span></span>

The march of Judah from Jerusalem would take five or six hours. By the
time they reached the watch-towers in the wilderness of Jeruel all was
over.

[2 Chronicles 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 20:25</span></span>

Riches with the dead bodies - Several manuscripts give another reading:
"riches, and garments."

[2 Chronicles 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 20:26</span></span>

The valley of Berachah - Probably, the Wady Bereikut, which lies at a
short distance from Tekoa toward the northwest.

[2 Chronicles 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 20:33</span></span>

The latter clause of this verse helps to reconcile the first clause with
the statement that Jehoshaphat "took away the high places" (see [Ch2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 20:34</span></span>

Who is mentioned ... - Words which are now generally thought to mean
"whose work was inserted into the Book of the Kings."

Of Israel - "Israel" is probably used here inexactly for "Judah"
(compare [Ch2 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md); [Ch2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md), [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch2 20:35</span></span>

After this - Jehoshaphat's history had been formally completed [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md). Consequently we can lay no
stress on the note of time contained in the words "after this," which
are detached from the context to which they originally referred. On the
history [Ch2 20:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md), see marginal
references and notes.
