### [Exodus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

(Compare Exo. 36:8-33.) The tabernacle was to comprise three main parts,
the tabernacle [Exo 26:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), more
strictly so-called, its tent [Exo
26:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md), and its covering [Exo
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md) (Compare [Exo
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011.md); [Exo
39:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033.md); [Exo
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#019.md), [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Num
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025), etc..md). These parts are very
clearly distinguished in the Hebrew, but they are confounded in many
places of the English Version (see [Exo
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md), [Exo
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009), etc..md). The tabernacle itself was
to consist of curtains of fine linen woven with colored figures of
cherubim, and a structure of boards which was to contain the holy place
and the most holy place; the tent was to be a true tent of goats' hair
cloth to contain and shelter the tabernacle: the covering was to be of
red rams' skins and "tachash" skins [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005.md), and was spread over the goats'
hair tent as an additional protection against the weather. On the
external form of the tabernacle and the arrangement of its parts, see
cuts at the end of the chapter.

[Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

The tabernacle - The משׁכן mı̂shkân, i. e. the dwelling-place; the
definite article regularly accompanies the Hebrew word when the
dwelling-place of Yahweh is denoted. But in this place the word is not
used in its full sense as denoting the dwelling-place of Yahweh: it
denotes only the tabernacle-cloth [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md). The word is, in fact, employed
with three distinct ranges of meaning,

\(1\) in its strict sense, comprising the cloth of the tabernacle with
its woodwork ([Exo 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009.md); [Exo
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md); [Exo
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#013.md); [Exo
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#018), etc..md);

\(2\) in a narrower sense, for the tabernacle-cloth only ([Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md); [Exo
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011.md); [Exo
39:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033), etc..md);

\(3\) in a wider sense, for the tabernacle with its tent and covering
([Exo 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019.md); [Exo
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#018), etc..md).

With ten curtains - Rather, of ten breadths. Five of these breadths were
united so as to form what, in common usage, we should call a large
curtain [Exo 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#003.md). The two curtains
thus formed were coupled together by the loops and taches to make the
entire tabernacle-cloth [Exo 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md).

Of cunning work - More properly, of the work of the skilled weaver. The
colored figures of cherubim (see [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md), [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018).md) were to be worked in the loom,
as in the manufacture of tapestry and carpets (see [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036) note.md). On the different kinds of
workmen employed on the textile fabrics, see [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md).

[Exo 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#003.md)

Each curtain formed of five breadths (see [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001).md), was 42 feet in length and 30
feet in breadth, taking the cubit at 18 inches.

[Exo 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#004.md)

The meaning appears to be, "And thou shalt make loops of blue on the
edge of the one breadth (which is) on the side (of the one curtain) at
the coupling; and the same shalt thou do in the edge of the outside
breadth of the other (curtain) at the coupling." The "coupling" is the
uniting together of the two curtains: ("selvedge" is the translation of
a word signifying extremity or end).

[Exo 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#005.md)

The words "in the edge," etc. mean, "on the edge of the breadth that is
at the coupling in the second (curtain)."

[Exo 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md)

Taches of gold - Each "tache," or clasp, was to unite two opposite
loops.

Couple the curtains - i. e. couple the two outside breadths mentioned in
[Exo 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#004.md).

[Exo 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md)

A covering upon the tabernacle - A tent over the tabernacle. The Hebrew
word here used, is the regular one for a tent of skins or cloth of any
sort.

[Exo 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md)

tabernacle - tent, not tabernacle. The passage might be rendered, "thou
shalt equally divide the sixth breadth at the front of the tent." In
this way, half a breadth would overhang at the front and half at the
back.

[Exo 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#010.md)

Or: "And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the outside breadth
of the one (curtain) at the coupling, and fifty loops on the edge of the
outside breadth of the other (curtain) at the coupling."

[Exo 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#011.md)

In the tent, clasps of bronze were used to unite the loops of the two
curtains; in the tabernacle, clasps of gold, compare [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md), [Exo
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037.md).

Couple the tent together - Not "covering," as in the margin. By "the
tent" is here meant the tent-cloth alone.

[Exo 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#013.md)

The measure of the entire tabernacle-cloth was about 60 ft. by 42; that
of the tent-cloth was about 67 ft. by 45. When the latter was placed
over the former, it spread beyond it at the back and front about 3 ft.
(the "half-curtain," [Exo 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#009.md), [Exo
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012).md) and at the sides 18 inches.

[Exo 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016.md)

The board would therefore be about 15 ft. long, and 27 in. broad.

[Exo 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md)

The entire length of the structure was about 45 ft. in the clear, and
its width about 15 ft.

The south side southward - Or, the south side on the right. As the
entrance of the tabernacle was at its east end, the south side, to a
person entering it, would be on the left hand: but we learn from
Josephus that it was usual, in speaking of the temple, to identify the
south with the right hand and the north with the left hand, the entrance
being regarded as the face of the structure and the west end as its
back.

[Exo 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019.md)

Sockets - More literally, bases, or foundations. Each base weighed a
talent, that is, about 94 lbs. (see [Exo
38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027).md), and must have been a massive
block. The bases formed a continuous foundation for the walls of boards,
presenting a succession of sockets or mortices (each base having a
single socket), into which the tenons were to fit. They served not only
for ornament but also for the protection of the lower ends of the boards
from the decay which would have resulted from contact with the ground.

[Exo 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md)

The sides of the tabernacle westward - Rather, the back of the
tabernacle toward the west. See [Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018.md).

[Exo 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#023.md)

In the two sides - Rather, at the back.

[Exo 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#024.md)

The corner boards appear to have been of such width, and so placed, as
to add 18 in. to the width of the structure, making up with the six
boards of full width [Exo 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md) about
15 ft. in the clear (see [Exo 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018).md).
The "ring" was so formed as to receive two bars meeting "beneath" and
"above" at a right angle.

[Exo 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#027.md)

For the two sides westward - For the back toward the west. Compare [Exo
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md),

[Exo 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#028.md)

In the midst of the boards - If we suppose the boards to have been of
ordinary thickness [Exo 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016.md), the bar
was visible and passed through an entire row of rings. In any case, it
served to hold the whole wall together.

[Exo 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md)

Vail - Literally, separation (see [Exo
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#012) note.md).

[Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md)

Taches - Not the same as the hooks of the preceding verse, but the
clasps of the tabernacle-cloth (see [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006).md).

[Exo 26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#034.md)

See [Exo 25:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md), [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md), [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md).

[Exo 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md)

The door of the tent - The entrance to the tent, closed by the "hanging"
or curtain [Exo 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016.md).

Wrought with needlework. - The work of the embroiderer. The entrance
curtain of the tent and that of the court [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016.md) were to be of the same
materials, but embroidered with the needle, not made in figures in the
loom (see [Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md); [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035).md).

[Exo 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037.md)

Rice pillars - These, it should be observed, belonged to the entrance of
the tent, not, in their architectural relation, to the entrance of the
tabernacle.

Sockets of brass - Their bases (see [Exo
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#019).md) were of bronze (like the taches
of the tentcloth, [Exo 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#011).md), not of
silver, to mark the inferiority of the tent to the tabernacle.

We are indebted to Mr. Fergusson for what may be regarded as a
satisfactory reconstruction of the sanctuary in all its main
particulars. He holds that what sheltered the Mishkan was actually a
tent of ordinary form, such as common sense and practical experience
would suggest as best suited for the purpose.

According to this view the five pillars at the entrance of the tent [Exo
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037.md) were graduated as they would
naturally be at the entrance of any large tent of the best form, the
tallest one being in the middle to support one end of a ridge-pole.

Such a ridge-pole, which must have been sixty feet in length, would have
required support, and this might have been afforded by a plain pole in
the middle of the structure. Over this framing of wood-work the
tent-cloth of goats' hair was strained with its cords and tent-pins in
the usual way. (See cut.)

Above the tent-cloth of goats' hair was spread the covering of red rams'
skins.

The five pillars, to reach across the front of the tent, must have stood
five cubits (about 7 1/2 ft.) apart. Their heads were united by
connecting rods ("fillets" [Exo 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010).md)
overlaid with gold [Exo 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038.md). The
spaces at the sides and back may have been wholly or in part covered in
for the use of the officiating priests, like the small apartments which
in after times skirted three sides of the temple. It was probably here
that those portions of the sacrifices were eaten which were not to be
carried out of the sacred precincts [Lev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md), [Lev
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md). We may also infer that priests
lodged in them. Compare [Sa1 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md).
