### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 20:1</span></span>

The son of Bichri ... - Rather, "a Bichrite," formed like the names
"Ahohite," "Hachmonite," etc. [Sa2
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md), and so called from Becher, the
son of Benjamin [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md); [Ch1
7:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md) Saul was also of this family. It
is evident that the transfer of the royalty from their tribe to that of
Judah still rankled in the hearts of many Benjamites ([Sa2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008) note.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 20:2</span></span>

From Jordan ... - The men of Israel only escorted David from Jordan to
Gilgal, and there left him; but the men of Judah in a body went with him
all the way to Jerusalem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 20:4</span></span>

To Amasa ... - Evidently feeling his way toward fulfilling the promise
to Amasa (marginal reference).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 20:5</span></span>

He tarried - The cause of Amasa's delay is not stated. It may have been
the unwillingness of the men of Judah to place themselves under his
orders, or it may have been caused by a wavering or hesitation in
loyalty. This last is evidently insinuated in [Sa2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#011.md), and no doubt this was the
pretext, whether grounded in fact or not, by which Joab justified the
murder of Amasa before David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 20:6</span></span>

To Abishai - Probably, as the king was on bad terms with Joab, and
wished to deprive him of his post as Captain of the host, he gave his
orders to Abishai, and weakly connived at the execution of them by Joab,
which was inevitable.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 20:8</span></span>

Amasa went before them - Rather, "advanced to meet them." Amasa was no
doubt returning to Jerusalem, according to his orders [Sa2
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004.md), and was probably much surprised
to meet the army in march. Joab's resolution was quickly taken.

And Joab's garment ... - Render, "And Joab was girded with his military
garment, as his clothing, and upon it" - i. e., the military garment -
(or "him"), "the girdle of a sword fastened on his loins in its sheath,
and as he went forth" (to meet Amasa) "it fell" out of the sheath. What
appears to have happened is that, by accident or design, Joab's sword
fell out of the scabbard on the ground as he was going to meet Amasa,
and that he picked it up with his left hand so as to have his right hand
free for the customary salutation [Sa2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md). This awakened no suspicion in
Amasa's mind. Compare the case of Ehud, [Jdg
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#021.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 20:11</span></span>

He that favoreth Joab ... - This speech, addressed to Amasa's followers
as well as Joab's, shows very distinctly that the rivalry between Joab
and Amasa, and David's purpose to make Amasa captain in Joab's room,
were well known; and shows also the real reason why Joab killed Amasa.
What is added, "and he that is for David," was intended to identify
Joab's cause with David's, and also to insinuate that Amasa had not been
loyal to David ([Sa2 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005) note.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 20:12</span></span>

All the people ... - i. e., the levies which Amanda had been leading to
Jerusalem; they were irresolute as to what they should do, and the
stoppage at Amasa's body very nearly led to their refusing to follow
Joab. But upon the prompt removal and hiding of the body they passed on
and followed Joab, their old captain.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 20:14</span></span>

Abel - More commonly called [Sa2 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md)
"Abel-Beth-maachah" to distinguish it from other places of the name of
"Abel" (a grassy plain). It is represented by the modern Abil-el-Kamh, a
Christian village on the northwest of lake Huleh, the ancient Merom.
Compare [Ch2 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004.md), "Abel-maim," Abel
by the water.

And all the Berites - What this means is utterly unknown. Many approve
of the reading of the Latin Version, connecting it with what follows:
"And all the choice young men mustered and followed him."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 20:15</span></span>

Cast up a bank - See the marginal references. The throwing up of mounds
against the walls of besieged places by the besiegers is well
illustrated in the Assyrian sculptures.

The trench - The "pomoerium," or fortified space outside the wall. When
the mound was planted in the pomoerium the battering engines were able
to approach close to the wall to make a breach.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 20:18</span></span>

This was an old proverb. Abel, like Teman, and some other places, was
once famous for the wisdom of its inhabitants [Kg1
4:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md). The wise woman was herself a
remnant of this traditional wisdom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 20:19</span></span>

I am one ... - The woman speaks in the name of the whole city, which she
means to say was peaceable and loyal.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 20:20</span></span>

Joab's character is strongly brought out in the transaction. Politic,
decided, bold, and unscrupulous, but never needlessly cruel or
impulsive, or even revengeful. No life is safe that stands in his way,
but from policy he never sacrifices the most insignificant life without
a purpose. (Compare [Sa2 2:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027)..md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 20:23</span></span>

Now Joab ... - This is by no means an unmeaning repetition. Joab had
been dismissed to make room for Amasa, and was now, as the result of his
successful expedition against Sheba, and the death of Amasa, reinstated
in his command. Moreover, this was a fresh beginning of David's reign,
and therefore a statement of his chief officers is as proper as in [Sa2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md), when he had just established
himself on the throne of Israel. Compare [Kg1
4:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 20:24</span></span>

Adoram - Not mentioned before by name or office. Apparently, therefore,
the office was not instituted until the latter part of David's reign,
and its duties probably were the collection of the tribute imposed upon
vanquished nations, or the command of the forced levies employed in
public works. Adoram was stoned to death in the beginning of the reign
of Rehoboam [Kg1 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#018.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 20:26</span></span>

Ira the Jairite - Not mentioned before: perhaps the same as "Ira an
Ithrite" (marginal reference), i. e., an inhabitant of Jattir in the
hill country of Judah [Jos 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md); [Sa1
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027.md). Perhaps we ought to read
"Ithrite," for "Jairite."

A chief ruler ... about David - More simply and clearly, "was David's
kohen" ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018) note.md). In the early
part oph David's reign his own ons were כהן kôhên (chief rulers). The
deaths of Amnon and Absalom, and the dissensions in the family, had
probably caused the change of policy in this respect.
