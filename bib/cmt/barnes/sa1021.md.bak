### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 21:1</span></span>

Nob was a city of the priests, the high priest resided there, and the
tabernacle was pitched there [Sa1
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md), [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md),[Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md); [Sa1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010.md). It was situated on the road
from the north to Jerusalem, near Anathoth, and within sight of the holy
city [Isa 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md); [Neh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#032.md). But the site has not been
identified with certainty.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 21:2</span></span>

A fresh instance of David's unscrupulous readiness of invention (compare
[Sa1 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 21:4</span></span>

Common - As opposed to holy. (See the marginal references, and compare
the use of the word in [Act 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014.md),
[Act 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)..md) It gives an idea of the
depressed and poor condition of the priesthood at that time, that
Ahimelech should have had no bread at hand except the showbread.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 21:5</span></span>

The vessels of the young men ... - i. e., their clothes [Deu
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005) or wallets (marginal reference.md),
or other articles which might be Levitically unclean and need cleansing
([Lev 13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058.md); [Exo
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md), etc.; [Mar
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004).md), as well as the person.

And the bread ... - The meaning is; "Though it is treating it like
common bread to give it to me and my young men, there is fresh showbread
baked and put on the table in place of what you give us;" the day being
Friday. as is indicated in the verse following.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 21:7</span></span>

Detained before the Lord - Either to fulfill a vow [Act
21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md), or on account of
uncleanness, or under the law of lepers [Lev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md), [Lev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#011.md), [Lev
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#021.md), or as a proselyte. It is not
impossible that Doeg may have been in custody or in sanctuary for some
crime.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 21:9</span></span>

Wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod - Rather, "in the cloak," Goliath's
military cloak, which was part of the dedicated trophy. The ephod was
naturally hung up where the high priest alone could get at it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 21:10</span></span>

Achish king of Gath - It appears from the title that Ps. 34 was composed
on this occasion. (See the note there.) Nothing can give a more lively
impression of the straits to which David was reduced than the fact of
his going to the country of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 21:11</span></span>

The king of the land - The Philistines gave him the title which their
own lords bore.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 21:13</span></span>

Scrabbled - literally, made marks (margin), namely, the mark of the
"tau" (t), which in the ancient Hebrew and Phoenician was in the shape
of a cross. (See [Eze 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004)..md)

On the doors of the gate - The gate of Achish's palace-yard or court, in
which the attendants waited. The house itself stood in this court.
(Compare [Est 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md), [Est
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021)..md)
