### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

There seems to be a contrast here between the more popular proceedings
of David [Sa2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001), and the statelier
system of his son, who merely summons the chief men as representatives
of the nation. The rest of the people "assembled themselves" [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002), and were mere spectators of the
solemnity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 8:2</span></span>

The feast in the month Ethanim - i. e. the Feast of Tabernacles, or the
Feast of Ingathering, the commemoration of the dwelling in booths at the
time of the Exodus (margin reference), and the festival of thanksgiving
on account of the completion of harvest [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016); [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039); [Deu
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013). It was one of the three on
which the people were required to "appear before the Lord."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 8:3</span></span>

In [Ch2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#004), ""the Levites" took up
the ark;" and by the Law the ark was the special charge of the
Kohathites [Num 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031); [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015). But all priests were Levites
[Jos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003), though all Levites were not
priests. And as Joshua had done [Jos
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006); [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006), so Solomon called upon the
priests to bear the holy structure, allowing to mere Levites only the
inferior honor of helping to transport the tabernacle and the vessels of
the sanctuary.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 8:4</span></span>

And the tabernacle of the congregation - Not the tented structure
erected for the ark on Mount Zion [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017) by David, but the original
tabernacle made by Moses, which had hitherto remained at Gibeon (margin
reference). The tabernacle and its holy vessels were probably placed in
the treasury.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

It was forbidden to withdraw the staves wholly from the rings (margin
reference); but they appear to have been now drawn forward in such a way
that their ends or heads could be seen from the holy place, or great
chamber of the temple, though without their being visible from the porch
or vestibule. Either the doorway into the holy of holies was not exactly
opposite the ark, but a little on one side; or, though that doorway was
in the middle, opposite the ark, the doorway from the porch into the
main chamber was not opposite to it. In Assyrian temples the arrangement
of the outer door, the inner door, and the sanctuary, seems to have been
designedly such that a mere passer-by on the outside should not obtain
even a glimpse of the shrine. It is suggested that the withdrawal of the
staves was intended as a sign that the ark had reached "the place of its
rest," and was not to be borne about anymore.

There they are unto this day - This is a quotation from an author who
lived while the temple was still standing. See also [Kg1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

Comparing this statement with [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004), it would seem that Solomon, now
that the sacred chest had reached its final resting-place, and stood in
a large chamber surrounded by tables [Ch2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008), removed the pot of manna and the
rod from the interior, and set them elsewhere in the holy of holies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 8:10</span></span>

The cloud - the visible symbol of the divine presence - the Shechinah of
the Targums - which halt been promised before the ark was begun [Exo
29:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043), and had filled the tabernacle
as soon as it was completed [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034), and which had probably been
seen from time to time during the long interval when we have no express
mention of it, now once more appeared in full magnificence, and took, as
it were, possession of the building which Solomon was dedicating. The
presence of God in the temple henceforth was thus assured to the Jews,
and His approval of all that Solomon had done was signified.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 8:11</span></span>

As in the case of Moses [Exo 40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035), so
now the glory of the Lord, the manifestation of the divine presence,
which the cloud usually veiled, shone forth from it with such
brilliancy, that mortal man could not bear the sight.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 8:12</span></span>

Rather, "The Lord spake of dwelling in the thick darkness" (margin
reference). Solomon sees in the cloud the visible symbol of God's
presence, and accepts the token as a proof that He has taken possession
of the house built for Him, and will thenceforth dwell there [Kg1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 8:14</span></span>

Solomon had spoken the preceding words, addressed to God, with his face
directed to the holy of holies. He now turned around and looked outward
toward the people. The people "stood" to hear him the attitude of
respect and attention. This first blessing seems to have been without
speech - an inward prayer accompanied by the ordinary gesture of
blessing.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 8:15</span></span>

The exact words of 2 Sam. 7 are not reproduced; only their general sense
is given. In [Kg1 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#018), what was
merely tacitly implied was regarded as actually "said."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 8:16</span></span>

The marginal reference completes the sense of this verse here. The
passage is in accordance with archaic modes of speech, and is probably
the more verbally accurate of the two.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

The margin reference shows that the king was so placed as to be seen by
all present, and that, before beginning his prayer, he knelt down upon
his knees (compare [Kg1 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 8:23</span></span>

Compare [Deu 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 8:25</span></span>

Solomon's prayer is, perhaps, generally for the fulfillment of all the
promises made to David in connection with the building of the temple.
But there seems to be special allusion in this verse to the promise
recorded in [Psa 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 8:27</span></span>

heaven of heavens - Compare [Deu
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014); [Psa
148:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004). It seems to mean the heaven in
its most extended compass. Solomon combines with his belief in Yahweh's
special presence in the temple, the strongest conviction that He is no
local or finite deity, but is ever present everywhere. Compare [Psa
139:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 8:29</span></span>

The choice of Jerusalem as the place seems to have been made by special
revelation to David. See [Psa 78:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#068);
[Psa 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013); and compare [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001).

Toward this place - Better (here and in [Kg1
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030)) than the marginal "in." Wherever
they were, the Jews always worshipped toward the temple. (See margin
reference.)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 8:30</span></span>

And when thou hearest, forgive - literally, "both hear and forgive" - i.
e., "hear the prayer, and forgive the sin" which alone causes God to
chasten men or to withhold from them His choicest blessings.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 8:31</span></span>

The oath come before ... - "The oath" is equivalent to "the man who
swears the oath." A slight alteration in the present Hebrew text gives
the sense "and he (the accused) go and swear before thine altar," etc.
The threats and the promises, the punishments and calamities of [Kg1
8:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031) were distinctly named in the
Law. See the margin reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 8:36</span></span>

Teach them ... - Rather, "when thou art teaching them (by thy
chastisement) the good way that they should walk in," i. e. when thou
art still teaching, not taking vengeance.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 8:37</span></span>

In the land of their cities - literally, "in the land of their gates."
Hence, the marginal translation "jurisdiction," because judgments were
pronounced in the town gates [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018). Another reading gives "in one
of their cities."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 8:38</span></span>

Know every man the plague of his own heart - i. e. perceive one's
sinfulness, or recognize one's sufferings as divine chastisements, and
sin as their cause.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 8:41</span></span>

Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic Law than its liberality with
regard to strangers, both in general [Exo
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021); [Lev
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035); [Deu
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#019) and in religious matters [Num
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#014); [Deu
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#012). It is quite in the spirit of
these enactments that Solomon, having first prayed to God on behalf of
his fellow-countrymen, should next go on to intercede for the strangers,
and to ask for their prayers the same acceptance which he had previously
begged for the prayers of faithful Israelites.

For thy name's sake - i. e. "to visit the place where Thou hast set Thy
name" (Compare [Deu 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011), etc.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 8:42</span></span>

Great name - A somewhat rare expression. It does not occur at all in the
Pentateuch; though "mighty hand" and the "stretched out arm" are so
frequent [Exo 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006); [Exo
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009); [Deu
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029) : only once in Joshua [Jos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009); and twice in the Psalms [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001); [Psa
99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003). About the time of the captivity
the use of the phrase became more common [Eze
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023); [Jer
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006); [Jer
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 8:43</span></span>

That all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee - Solomon
prays that the result of Yahweh's hearing the prayers of pagans
addressed toward the temple may be the general conversion of the world
to the worship of Him. Compare [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001); [Psa
98:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001).

This house ... - literally, as in the margin. In Scripture, when God's
Name is said to be "called upon" persons or things, it seems to be meant
that God is really present in them, upholding them and sanctifying them.
This passage therefore means, that the pagan, when their prayers,
directed toward the temple, are granted, will have a full assurance that
God is present in the building in some very special way.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 8:47</span></span>

Bethink themselves - literally, as in the margin - i. e. "reflect,"
"consider seriously." Compare [Deu
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).

Sinned, done perversely, committed wickedness - The words here used seem
to have become the standard form of expressing contrition when the time
of the captivity arrived and the Israelites were forcibly removed to
Babylon (compare the margin reference). The three expressions are
thought to form a climax, rising from negative to positive guilt, and
from mere wrongful acts to depravation of the moral character.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">kg1 8:50</span></span>

Compassion ... - Not merely such compassion as Evil-Merodach showed
toward Jehoiachin [Kg2 25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027); [Jer
52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031), but such as Cyrus and
Artaxerxes showed in allowing the captive Jews to return to their own
land [Ezr 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003); [Neh
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#006).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 8:51</span></span>

The furnace of iron - Egypt is so called as a place of severe trial and
affliction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">kg1 8:54</span></span>

If the prayer of Solomon be, as it has all the appearance of being, a
genuine document of the time, preserved in the archives to which the
authors of both Kings and Chronicles had access, all theories of the
late origin of Deuteronomy must be regarded as baseless. While
references are not infrequent to other portions of the Pentateuch, the
language of the prayer is mainly modelled upon Deuteronomy, the promises
and threats contained in which are continually before the mind of the
writer. (See the margin reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">kg1 8:58</span></span>

Incline our hearts - This is a doctrine which first appears in Scripture
in the Davidical Psalms (see the margin reference and [Psa
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)). Solomon in this prayer seems
to be thoroughly penetrated with his father's spirit.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">kg1 8:61</span></span>

As at this day - i. e. "as ye are now doing, in coming with pious
intentions to this festival."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">kg1 8:63</span></span>

These numbers have been thought incredible, but they are not impossible.
At least 100, 000, or 120, 000 men [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065) were assembled; and as they all
offered sacrifice with the king [Kg1
8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062), the number of victims must have
been enormous. Part of the flesh of so many victims would be eaten; but
much of the meat may have been privately burned [Lev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#006), the object of the sacrifice
being the glory of God, and not the convenience of the people. Profusion
was a usual feature of the sacrifices of antiquity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">kg1 8:64</span></span>

The middle of the court - Or, "the whole area of the court " - all the
"mid" space within the enclosing walls, which thus became one huge
altar, on any part of which victims might be offered at one and the same
time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

A feast necessarily accompanied such a sacrifice as Solomon was holding.
Compare [Lev 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005). On the present
occasion there was a double festival - first, the Feast of the
Dedication, from the 8th to the 15th of the month Ethanim (or Tisri),
and then the Feast of tabernacles, from the 15th to the 22nd [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002). On the day after this, "the
eighth day," counting from the commencement of the second seven, and the
twenty-third day of the month (margin reference "m"), Solomon dismissed
the people to their homes.

The entering in of Hamath - Compare [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021), note andmargin reference. The
phrase marks the extreme northern boundary of the holy land.

The river of Egypt - The Wady-el-Arish, the only large water-course on
this coast (margin reference).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">kg1 8:66</span></span>

Their tents - i. e. "their homes." The word "tents" was used for
"houses" from an old habit of speech, which had come down from the time
when the Israelites were a nomadic nation.
