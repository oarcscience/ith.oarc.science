### [Leviticus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 6:1</span></span>

In the Hebrew Bible [Lev 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md) form
part of Lev. 5. It is evident that they ought to do so.

[Leviticus 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 6:5</span></span>

In the day of his trespass offering - The restitution was thus to be
associated with the religious act by which the offender testified his
penitence.

[Leviticus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 6:9</span></span>

Rather, "This, the burnt-offering, shall be upon the fire on the altar
all night unto the morning." See [Exo
29:38-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md), with the notes.

[Leviticus 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 6:10</span></span>

Ashes ... with the burnt-offering - Rather, the ashes to which the fire
hath consumed the burnt-offering.

[Leviticus 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 6:13</span></span>

The fire shall ever be burning - This was a symbol of the never-ceasing
worship which Yahweh required of His people. It was essentially
connected with their acts of sacrifice.

[Leviticus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 6:14</span></span>

See [Lev 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md); [Exo
29:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040.md).

[Lev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md)

With unleavened bread shall it be eaten - This should be, it (the
remainder) shall be eaten unleavened.

[Leviticus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 6:20</span></span>

See [Lev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md). Aaron's sons here spoken
of (as in [Lev 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022).md) must be the
succession of high priests who succeeded him. The day of this offering
was probably the eighth day of the ceremony of consecration [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035.md); [Lev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md), when the high priest appears to
have entered upon the duties of his office.

A meat offering perpetual - Jewish tradition is in favor of these words
implying that this מנחה mı̂nchāh was offered by the high priest as a
daily rite from the time of his consecration.

[Leviticus 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 6:21</span></span>

In a pan - See [Lev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005.md) note.

[Leviticus 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 6:22</span></span>

It shall be wholly burnt - literally, "it shall ascend in fire as a
whole burnt-offering."

[Leviticus 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 6:23</span></span>

Not be eaten - Compare [Lev 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md); [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md) note.

[Leviticus 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 6:25</span></span>

The place where ... - See [Lev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md).

It is most holy - See [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md). The
key to the special sanctity of the flesh of the sin-offering, as set
forth in [Lev 6:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md), must, it would
seem, be found in the words of Moses to the priests [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md). The flesh of the victim, which
represented the sinner for whom atonement was now made, was to be
solemnly, and most exclusively, appropriated by those who were appointed
to mediate between the sinner and the Lord. The far-reaching symbolism
of the act met its perfect fulfillment in the One Mediator who took our
nature upon Himself. [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md).

[Leviticus 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 6:28</span></span>

The earthen vessel - Unglazed pottery would absorb some of the juices of
the meat: and a vessel made holy could not be put to any other purpose.

[Leviticus 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 6:30</span></span>

To reconcile withal generally rendered "to make atonement for."

The holy place - The outer apartment of the tabernacle. See the [Lev
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018.md) note.
