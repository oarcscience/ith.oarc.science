Heritage

### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

Consult the notes to the passages referred to in the margin.

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

All the plain on the east - i. e. the Arabah or depressed tract along
the east bank of Jordan, the modern El-Ghor (see [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md).

[Jos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md)

From the middle of the river - i. e. as appears from [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md), "from the city that is in the
midst of the river;" namely,, Ar Moab (see [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036).md).

[Jos 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003.md)

From the plain - Render "over the plain;" for the words describe not one
of the boundaries of Sihon's kingdom, but part of the territory included
in it, i. e. the eastern portion of the Ghor, between the Sea of
Tiberias and the Dead Sea.

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

The names of the kings are given in the order of their actual encounter
with Joshua. Those enumerated in [Jos
12:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#010.md) either belonged to the league
of the southern Canaanites ([Jos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)
ff), the power of which was broken in the battle of Beth-horon, or were
at any rate conquered in the campaign following that battle. Those
mentioned in [Jos 12:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#019.md) were in
like manner connected with the northern confederates ([Jos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001) ff.md), who were defeated at the
Waters of Merom.

[Jos 12:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#013.md)

The identification of several of these places is still uncertain: the
same name (e. g. Aphek, [Jos 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018).md)
being applied to various places in various parts of Palestine. Geder, or
Gedor [Jos 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), a city in the
mountain district in the south of the territory of Judah, is no doubt
the modern "Jedur".

[Jos 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021.md)

Taanach - A Levitical town [Jos 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025.md)
in the territory of Issachar, but assigned to the Manassites ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md); Compare [Ch1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029).md), is identified with "Taanuk". It
was here that Barak encountered the host of Sisera [Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md). Megiddo was near it, and is
thought to have been "el Lejjun" (the Roman Legion), (or Mujedd'a
(Conder)).

[Jos 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022.md)

Kedesh - i. e. Kedesh Naphtali, a city of refuge, a Levitical city, and
the home of Barak [Jdg 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md).

Jokneam - A Levitical city in the territory of Zebulon [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md); perhaps the modern "Kaimon".
"Tell Kaimon" is a conspicuous and important position, commanding the
main pass across the ridge of Carmel from Phoenicia to Egypt. This
famous mountain range (about 15 miles long) no doubt received the name
Carmel (the word means "a fruitful field" as opposed to "wilderness") as
descriptive of its character; and thus the name became an emblem of
beauty and luxuriance ([Isa 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md); [Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005), etc..md). Its highest part, about 4
miles from Tell Kaimon, is nearly 1,750 feet above the sea. Its modern
name, "Jebel Mar Elias", preserves still that association with the great
deeds of Elijah, from which Carmel derives its chief Biblical interest.
Mount Carmel was probably, like Lebanon, from very ancient Canaanite
times, regarded as especially sacred; and since the altar of the Lord
repaired by Elijah [Kg1 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#030.md) was an
old one which had been broken down, Carmel was probably no less esteemed
by the Israelites also. In later times the caves which abound toward the
western bluffs of the range have been frequented by Christian, Jewish,
and Mussulman anchorites. The order of Carmelite or barefooted friars
took its rise from the convent founded by Louis, which still crowns the
western headland.

[Jos 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#023.md)

The king of the nations - See [Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md) and note. It means king of
certain mixed and probably nomadic tribes, which regarded Gilgal [Jos
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#019.md) as their center and capital.

[Jos 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024.md)

Tirzah - This place, the capital of Jeroboam and his successors until
the clays of Omri ([Kg1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md); [Kg1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021), etc..md), is identified by some
with "Tulluzah", a town 3 miles northeast of Nablous, (by others with
Teiasir).
