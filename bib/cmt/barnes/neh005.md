### [Nehemiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 5:2</span></span>

Are many - A slight emendation brings this verse into exact parallelism
with the next, and gives the sense - "We have pledged our sons and our
daughters, that we might get corn, and eat and live." Compare [Neh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005).

[Nehemiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 5:4</span></span>

The king's tribute - The tax payable to the Persian monarch (compare
[Ezr 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013); [Est
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001)). In ancient times, heavy
taxation was often productive of debt and distress.

[Nehemiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 5:5</span></span>

The power of a father to sell his daughter into slavery is expressly
mentioned in the Law [Exo 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007). The
power to sell a son appears from this passage. In either case, the sale
held good for only six years, or until the next year of jubilee (see the
marginal references).

[Nehemiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 5:7</span></span>

Ye exact usury - The phrase is unique to Nehemiah, and is best explained
by the context, which shows the practice of the rich Jews at the time to
have been not so much to lend on usury as to lend on mortgage and
pledge.

[Nehemiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 5:8</span></span>

Nehemiah contrasts his own example with that of the rich Jews. He had
spent money in redeeming some countrymen in servitude among the pagan;
they were causing others to be sold into slavery among the Jews.

[Nehemiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 5:10</span></span>

I ... might exact - Nehemiah had lent, but not upon pledge.

[Nehemiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 5:11</span></span>

The hundredth part of the money ... - i. e. the interest. It is
conjectured that the 100th part was payable monthly, or, in other words,
that interest was taken at the rate of twelve per cent. The Law
altogether disallowed the taking of interest from Israelites (see [Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025); [Lev
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036), etc.).

[Nehemiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 5:13</span></span>

I shook my lap - Compare the marginal references. By "lap" is meant a
fold in the bosom of the dress, capable of serving as a pocket. Compare
[Isa 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022) margin.

[Nehemiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 5:14</span></span>

Have not eaten the bread of the governor - i. e. "have not, like other
Persian governors, lived at the expense of the people under my
government." See [Ezr 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#014) note.

[Nehemiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 5:15</span></span>

Forty shekels of silver - A daily sum from the entire province. For such
a table as that kept by Nehemiah [Neh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018), this would be a very moderate
payment.

[Nehemiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 5:16</span></span>

I continued ... land - i. e. - "I took my share in the work of the wall,
as general superintendent. I did not take advantage of the general
poverty to buy poor men's plots of ground."

[Nehemiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 5:18</span></span>

Compare the far grander provision for Solomon's table (see the marginal
reference).
