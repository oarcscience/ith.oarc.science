### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 9:0</span></span>

The punishment of the dwellers in Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 9:1</span></span>

Them that have charge - The angels who have charge to execute God's
sentence.

Every man - "angels," not "men."

[Ezekiel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 9:2</span></span>

Six men - angels of wrath - figurative of destruction. They come from
the north, the quarter from which invading armies entered the holy land.
These "six" angels, with the "one among them," a superior over the six,
make up the number "seven," a number symbolic of God's covenant with His
people.

The higher gate - The north gate of the court of the priests. The temple
rose by platforms; as there was a north gate to the outer and also to
the inner court, the latter was probably distinguished as the "higher
gate." It was built by Jotham [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md).

Clothed with linen - The priestly garment [Exo
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006.md), [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008.md); [Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004.md). This "One Man" (Compare [Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md); [Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013).md) was the "angel of the covenant,"
the great high priest, superior to those by whom He was surrounded,
receiving direct communication from the Lord, taking the coals of
vengeance from between the cherubim [Eze
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md), but coming with mercy to the
contrite as well as with vengeance to the impenitent; these are
attributes of Jesus Christ [Joh 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md);
[Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md); [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md); [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md).

A writer's inkhorn - Usually a flat case about nine inches long, by an
inch and a quarter broad, and half an inch thick, the hollow of which
serves to contain the reed pens and penknife. At one end is the
ink-vessel which is twice as heavy as the shaft. The latter is passed
through the girdle and prevented from slipping through by the projecting
ink-vessel. The whole is usually of polished metal, brass, copper or
silver. The man with the inkhorn has to write in the Book of Life the
names of those who shall be marked. The metaphor is from the custom of
registering the names of the Israelites in public rolls. Compare [Exo
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md); [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

[Ezekiel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 9:3</span></span>

Cherub - The singular is put collectively for the "cherubim," which were
upon the mercy-seat of the ark in the holy of holies, the proper seat of
the glory of the Lord in the midst of Israel. God is represented as
"arising" from between the cherubim to scatter His enemies [Num
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md).

[Ezekiel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 9:4</span></span>

mercy precedes judgment. So in the case of Sodom Gen. 19, and in the
last day [Luk 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018.md), [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md); [Rev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md). This accords with the
eschatological character of the predictions in this chapter (see the
introduction of Ezekiel).

A mark - literally, "Tau," the name of the last letter of the Hebrew
alphabet. The old form of the letter was that of a cross. The Jews have
interpreted this sign variously, some considering that "Tau," being the
last of the Hebrew letters, and so closing the alphabet, denoted
completeness, and thus the mark indicated the completeness of the sorrow
for sin in those upon whom it was placed. Others again observed that
"Tau" was the first letter of Torah ("the Law") and that the foreheads
were marked as of men obedient to the Law. Christians, noting the
resemblance of this letter in its most ancient form to a cross, have
seen herein a reference to the cross with which Christians were signed.
The custom for pagan gods and their votaries to bear certain marks
furnishes instances, in which God was pleased to employ symbolism,
generally in use, to express higher and more divine truth. The sign of
the cross in baptism is an outward sign of the designation of God's
elect, who at the last day shall be exempted from the destruction of the
ungodly [Mat 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md), [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md).

[Ezekiel 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 9:6</span></span>

Begin at my sanctuary - The first to be punished were those who had
brought idolatry nearest to the holy place. The "ancient men," i. e.,
the 25 men who had stood with their backs to the altar [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md) were the first to be slain.

[Ezekiel 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 9:7</span></span>

Defile the house - By filling the temple and its courts with the bodies
of the slain. See [Num 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md).

[Ezekiel 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 9:8</span></span>

Left - The prophet was left alone, all who had been around him were
slain.
