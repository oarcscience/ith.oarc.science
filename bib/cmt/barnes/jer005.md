### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 5:0</span></span>

The capture and the destruction of Jerusalem was owing to its utter
immorality. Josiah's reforms were frustrated by the immorality prevalent
among all classes. The prophet sees evil triumphing, but we must not
take his words so literally as to conclude that there were no good men
then in Jerusalem (compare [Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027);
[Jer 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

The broad places - The open spaces next the gates, and other places of
concourse.

A man - Or, anyone.

That executeth - "That" practiceth.

Truth - uprightness, probity (so in [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 5:2</span></span>

Though they take the most binding form of oath, they do so only as a
means of deceiving others.

[Jeremiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 5:3</span></span>

Upon the truth - God looks to the "faith," the upright purpose of the
heart, and without it the nominal fealty of an oath is an abomination.

[Jeremiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 5:4</span></span>

Therefore - More simply "and."

They are foolish - Or, they act foolishly (see [Num
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011)), not having that knowledge
which would enable them to guide their ways with discretion.

[Jeremiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 5:5</span></span>

They have known ... - Men of education, who read the Scriptures, and
learn from them the nature of God's judgments.

But these - literally, surely they (compare [Jer
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004)).

The yoke - The Mosaic law.

And burst ... - They have torn off, torn themselves loose from.

The bonds - The fastenings by which the yoke was fixed upon the necks of
the oxen.

[Jeremiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 5:6</span></span>

Evenings - See the margin. From its habit of skulking about in the
twilight the wolf is often called the "evening wolf" [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008); [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003), but the word used here means a
sandy desert.

Leopard - panther.

[Jeremiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 5:7</span></span>

Rather, Why, "for what reason" should "I pardon thee?"

When ... - Or, "though I bound them to me by oath, yet they committed
adultery."

The harlots' houses - The harlot's house, i. e., the temple of an idol;
the prophet had also in view (see [Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008)) the unchastity which accompanied
most forms of nature-worship.

[Jeremiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 5:8</span></span>

In the morning - Render, they rove about. Some prefer, "(horses) from
Mesech."

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

Her walls - It is Possible that not the city walls, but those of a
vineyard are meant. Judaea is God's vineyard [Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), and God permits the enemy to
enter the vineyard to destroy her.

Battlements - tendrils. The tendrils and branches of Judah's vine are
given up to ruin, but not the stock. See [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013) note.

[Jeremiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 5:12</span></span>

It is not he - i. e., Who speaks by the prophets.

[Jeremiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 5:13</span></span>

Word - Rather, speaker. Literally, And he who speaketh is not in them,
i. e., there is no one who speaketh in them; what the prophets say has
no higher authority than themselves.

Thus ... - i. e., May the evil which the prophets threaten fall upon
their head.

[Jeremiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 5:15</span></span>

Israel is not put here for the ten tribes, but for the whole house of
Jacob, of which Judah was now the representative.

Mighty - "permanent, enduring." The word is the usual epithet of the
rocks [Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021), and of ever-flowing
streams [Deu 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004), Hebrew). It
describes therefore a nation, whose empire is firm as a rock, and ever
rolling onward like a mighty river. The epithet "ancient" refers simply
to time.

Whose laguage thou knowest not - This would render them more pitiless,
as they would not understand their cries for mercy.

[Jeremiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 5:16</span></span>

Their quiver - See [Jer 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029), note.

[Jeremiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 5:17</span></span>

Or,

It shall eat "thine harvest and thy bread:"

They shall eat "thy sons and thy daughters."

It shall eat thy sheep and thy cattle:

It shall eat "thy vines and thy fig-trees."

They shall impoverish ... - Or, It shall batter thy "fortified cities,
wherein thou" trustest, with weapons of war. There is probably reference
here to an instrument like a battering-ram, with which the Assyrians
beat down the walls of their enemies.

[Jeremiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 5:19</span></span>

The reason why God so chastises His people. As they in a land especially
consecrated to Yahweh had served "strange" (i. e., foreign gods, so
shall they in a land belonging to others be the slaves of strangers.

[Jeremiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 5:20</span></span>

Against the God

\(1\) of Creation [Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022), and

\(2\) of Providence [Jer 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024),

They sin, not merely by apostasy, but by a general immorality extending
to all classes [Jer 5:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025). It is in
this immorality that their idolatry has its root.

[Jer 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022)

The sea is the symbol of restless and indomitable energy, chafing
against all resistance, and dashing to pieces the works whereby man
endeavors to restrain its fury. Yet God has imposed upon it laws which
it must obey, and keeps it in its appointed place, not by barriers of
iron but by a belt of sand. Modern science has shown that the resisting
power of sand is enormous. A wave which would shatter rocks fails
powerless upon sand.

Can they not prevail - The opposite of "thou couldest" [Jer
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#005). The sea, the mightiest of God's
works, cannot prevail, cannot break God's laws, because He has not
endowed it with free-will. Man, physically impotent, can prevail,
because, being made in God's image, he is free.

[Jer 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023)

The heart, or will of the Jews was first "revolting," literally a will
that "drew back" from God, because it disliked His service; and secondly
it was "rebellious," a will that actively resisted Him. Compare [Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018), [Deu
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#020).

[Jer 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024)

As God's Providence addresses itself chiefly to the thoughtful, Jeremiah
says in their heart. By the intelligent study of God's dealings men
perceive that they are not merely acts of power but also of love.

The appointed weeks - literally, He guardeth, maintaineth, for us the
weeks which are the statutes or settled laws "of the harvest." These
were the seven weeks from the Passover to Pentecost, and were as
important for the ingathering of the crops as the rainy seasons for
their nourishment.

[Jer 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025)

It was not that the rains did not fall, or that the harvest weeks were
less bright; the good was there, but the wickedness of the community
blocked up the channels, through which it shou d have reached the
people. The lawlessness and injustice of the times kept the mass of the
people in poverty.

[Jer 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026)

Rather, he spieth about like the crouching down of fowlers; they have
set the fatal snare; "they catch men."

Trap - literally, "The destroyer;" it was probably a gin, which
strangled the birds caught in it.

[Jer 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027)

Deceit - The wealth gained by deceit and fraud.

[Jer 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028)

Fatness is admired in the East as a sign of wealth.

They shine - This word is used of the sleekness of the skin, soft and
smooth as ivory.

They overpass the deeds of the wicked - literally, "They have overpassed
words of wickedness," i. e., they go to excess in wickedness.

Yet they prosper - Or, that they (the orphans) may prosper, enjoy their
rights.

[Jer 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030)

Rather, A terrible "and horrible thing" has happened "in the land."

[Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031)

Bear rule by their means - Rather, "The priests" rule at their hands, i.
e., govern according to their false prophecies, guidance, and
directions.

My people love to have it so - False teaching lightens the yoke of God's
Law, and removes His fear from the conscience: and with this, man is
ready to be content.
