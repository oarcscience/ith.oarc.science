Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001)

[Mark 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 11:1</span></span>

See this passage illustrated in the notes at Mat. 21:1-16.

[Mar 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#004)

Two ways met - A crossroads. A public place, probably near the center of
the village.

[Mar 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#005)

What do ye, loosing the colt? - Or, why do ye do this? What authority
have you for doing it?

See this passage illustrated in the notes at Mat. 21:1-16.

[Mark 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 11:11</span></span>

See this passage explained in the notes at [Mat
21:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018).

[Mar 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011)

Into the temple - Not into the edifice properly called "the temple," but
into the "courts" which surrounded the principal edifice. Our Saviour,
not being of the tribe of Levi, was not permitted to enter into the holy
or most holy place; and when, therefore, it is said that he went into
the "temple," it is always to be understood of the "courts" surrounding
the temple. See the notes at [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).

And when he had looked round about upon all things - Having seen or
examined everything. He saw the abominations and abuses which he
afterward corrected. It may be a matter of wonder that he did not "at
once" correct them, instead of waiting to another day; but it may be
observed that God is slow to anger; that he does not "at once" smite the
guilty, but waits patiently before he rebukes and chastises.

The eventide - The evening; the time after three o'clock p. m. It is
very probable that this was before sunset. The religious services of the
temple closed at the offering of the evening sacrifice, at three
o'clock, and Jesus probably soon left the city.

[Mar 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013), [Mar
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#014)

Afar off - See the notes at [Mat
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019).

[Mar 11:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015)

See the notes at [Mat 21:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).

[Mar 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016)

Any vessel - Any vessel used in cooking, or connected with the sale of
their articles of merchandise.

[Mar 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#018)

All the people were astonished - He became popular among them. The
Pharisees saw that their authority was lessened or destroyed. They were
therefore envious of him, and sought his life.

His doctrine - His teaching. He taught with power and authority so great
that the multitudes were awed, and were constrained to obey.

[Mar 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021)

Thou cursedst - To curse means to devote to destruction. This is its
meaning here. It does not in this place imply blame, but simply that it
should be destroyed.

[Mar 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022)

Have faith in God - Literally, "Have the faith of God." This may mean,
have strong faith, or have confidence in God; a strong belief that he is
able to accomplish things that appear most difficult with infinite ease,
as the fig-tree was made to wither away by a word.

[Mar 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)

And when ye stand praying - When ye pray. It seems that the posture in
prayer was sometimes standing and sometimes kneeling. God looks upon
"the heart" rather than upon our position in worship; and if the heart
be right, any posture may be proper. It cannot be doubted, however, that
in private, in the family, and wherever it can be conveniently done, the
kneeling posture is more proper, as expressing more humility and
reverence, and more in accordance with Scripture examples. Compare [Psa
95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006); [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013); [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010); [Luk
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060); [Act
9:40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040). Yet a subject like this may be
made of too much consequence, and we should be careful that anxiety
about a mere form should not exclude anxiety about a far more important
matter - the state of the soul.

Forgive ... - See the notes at [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012), [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025).

[Mark 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 11:27</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 20:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023).
