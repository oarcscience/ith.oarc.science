### [Nehemiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 2:1</span></span>

Nisan was the name given by the Persian Jews to the month previously
called "Abib," the first month of the Jewish year, or that which
followed the vernal equinox. It fell four months after Chisleu [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001).

The twentieth year - As Artaxerxes ascended the throne in 465 B.C., his
20th year would correspond to 445-444 B.C.

[Nehemiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 2:2</span></span>

I was very sore afraid - A Persian subject was expected to be perfectly
content so long as he had the happiness of being with his king. A
request to quit the court was thus a serious matter.

[Nehemiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 2:3</span></span>

The city ... of my fathers' sepulchres - We may conclude from this that
Nehemiah was of the tribe of Judah, as Eusebius and Jerome say that he
was.

[Nehemiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 2:4</span></span>

I prayed to the God of heaven - Mentally and momentarily, before
answering the king.

[Nehemiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 2:6</span></span>

The queen - Though the Persian kings practiced polygamy, they always had
one chief wife, who alone was recognized as "queen." The chief wife of
Longimanus was Damaspia.

I set him a time - Nehemiah appears to have stayed at Jerusalem twelve
years from his first arrival [Neh
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014); but he can scarcely have
mentioned so long a term to the king. Probably his leave of absence was
prolonged from time to time.

[Nehemiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 2:8</span></span>

The king's forest - Rather, park. The word used פרדס pardês; compare
παράδεισος paradeisos, found only here, in [Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005), and in [Sol
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013)), is of Persian, or at any rate
of Aryan origin. The Persians signified by pariyadeza a walled
enclosure, ornamented with trees, either planted or of natural growth,
and containing numerous wild animals. The "paradise" here mentioned must
have been in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, and may have corresponded to
the earlier "gardens of Solomon."

The palace - Rather, "the fortress." The word in the original has the
double meaning of "palace" and "fortress," the fact being that in
ancient times palaces were always fortified. "The fortress which
pertained to the house (temple)" is first spoken of here. Under the
Romans it was called "Antonia."

[Nehemiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 2:10</span></span>

The name Sanballat is probably Babylonian the first element being the
same which commences "Sennacherib," namely, "Sin," the moon-God, and the
second balatu, "eminent" (?),which is found in the Assyrian name,
Bel-balatu. As a Horonite, he was probably a native of one of the
Bethhorons, the upper or the lower (see [Jos
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003), [Jos
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005); [Ch2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005)), and therefore born within the
limits of the old kingdom of Samaria. Tobiah seems to have been an
Ammonite slave, high in the favor of Sanballat, whom he probably served
as secretary [Neh 6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#017) and chief
adviser.

It grieved them - Compare Ezra 4:4-24; [Ezr
5:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006). The revival of Jerusalem as a
great and strong city, which was Nehemiah's aim, was likely to interfere
with the prosperity, or at any rate the eminence, of Samaria.

[Nehemiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 2:13</span></span>

The gate of the valley - A gate opening on the valley of Hinnom, which
skirted Jerusalem to the west and south. The exact position is
uncertain; as is also that of "the dragon well."

The dung port - The gate by which offal and excrements were conveyed out
of the city, and placed eastward of the valley-gate.

[Nehemiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 2:14</span></span>

The gate of the fountain - A gate on the eastern side of the Tyropoeon
valley, not far from the pool of Siloam (probably "the king's pool."
(Compare [Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015)).

[Nehemiah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 2:15</span></span>

The brook - The Kidron watercourse, which skirted the city on the east.

Turned back - i. e. he turned westward, and having made the circuit of
the city, re-entered by the valley-gate.

[Nehemiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 2:16</span></span>

The rulers - The principal authorities of the city, in the absence of
the special governor.

The rest that did the work - i. e. "the laboring class that (afterward)
actually built the wall."

[Nehemiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 2:18</span></span>

The king's words - These have not been given; but the royal permission
to restore the walls is implied in [Neh
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#005).

[Nehemiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 2:19</span></span>

Geshem the Arabian - The discovery that Sargon populated Samaria in part
with an Arab colony explains why Arabs should have opposed the
fortification of Jerusalem.
