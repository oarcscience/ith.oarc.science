### [Ezekiel Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 24:0</span></span>

In Ezek. 24, Ezekiel is commissioned to announce to his fellow-exiles
that the destruction of Jerusalem, so long foretold, was now in course
of execution, that the siege had actually begun. This he is to declare:

\(1\) by a parable - of the boiling pot,

\(2\) by a symbolic act - the abstaining from the usual outward mourning
for his wife's death.

[Ezekiel 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 24:1</span></span>

The prophecies in this chapter were delivered two years and five months
after those of the previous section [Eze
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001.md). The day mentioned here was the
very day on which Nebuchadnezzar completed his arrangements for the
siege, and closed in the city (marginal references). After the captivity
this day was regularly observed as a fast day [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md).

[Ezekiel 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 24:3</span></span>

A pot - Or, the caldron; with reference to [Eze
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md). The prophet indicates by the
figure utter destruction. The caldron is the city, the fire is the
surrounding army, the flesh and bones are the inhabitants shut in within
the walls.

[Ezekiel 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 24:4</span></span>

The pieces thereof - Or, that belong to it; i. e., the pieces which are
designed for the caldron, and belong to it as the inhabitants belong to
the city. The choice pieces are the choice members of the community [Eze
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 24:5</span></span>

Burn - Rather, as in margin; the bones would serve for fuel.

[Ezekiel 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 24:6</span></span>

Scum - Better, rust (and in [Eze
24:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011).md).

Bring it out piece by piece - It, the city; bring out the inhabitants,
one by one, clear the city of them, whether by death, exile, or
captivity.

Let no lot fall upon it - In the captivity of Jehoiakim and in that of
Jehoiachin, some were taken, others left. Now all shall be removed.

[Ezekiel 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 24:7</span></span>

The top of a rock - The blood was poured upon a naked, dry, rock where
it could not be absorbed or unnoticed.

[Ezekiel 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 24:10</span></span>

Consume ... spice it well - i. e., "dress the flesh, and make it froth
and bubble, that the bones and the flesh may be all boiled up together."

[Ezekiel 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 24:16</span></span>

The death of Ezekiel's wife took place in the evening of the same day
that he delivered the foregoing prophecy. This event was to signify to
the people that the Lord would take from them all that was most dear to
them; and - owing to the extraordinary nature of the times - quiet
lamentation for the dead, according to the usual forms of mourning,
would be impossible.

[Eze 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md)

The priest in general was to mourn for his dead ([Lev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001) ff.md); but Ezekiel was to be an
exception to the rule. The "tire" was the priest's mitre.

Eat not the bread of men - Food supplied for the comfort of the
mourners.

[Eze 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#023.md)

Pine away - Compare [Lev 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md). The
outward signs of grief were a certain consolation. Their absence would
indicate a heart-consuming sorrow.

[Eze 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md)

Ezekiel had been employed four years in foretelling the calamities about
to come to pass. He had been utterly disregarded by the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and received with apparent respect but with real incredulity
by those in exile. Now until the city had been actually taken, the voice
of prophecy should cease, so far as God's people were concerned. Hence
the intervening series of predictions relating to neighboring and
foreign nations Ezek. 25-32. After which the prophet's voice was again
heard addressing his countrymen in their exile. This accounts for the
apparently parenthetical character of the next eight chapters.
