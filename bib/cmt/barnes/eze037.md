### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 37:0</span></span>

In [Eze 37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001), Ezekiel sees in a
vision dead men raised to life; its meaning is given [Eze
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011). In it, the doctrine of the
Resurrection of the Body is at least implied. Such a figure would only
have force with those who were familiar with this idea (compare [Sa1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006); [Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025); [Psa
16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010); [Dan
12:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)). The vision was intended not
only to comfort the despairing children of Israel - prefiguring the
reinstatement of Israel now scattered and lifeless, as a community
restored to their home, and rein-vigorated with spiritual life - but
also to impress upon them the great truth of the Resurrection, which was
greatly developed in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, but found its
clear and unambiguous enunciation in the New. The prophecy concerns not
only the Israel after the flesh but also the Israel of God; it points to
a home in heaven and to a life of immortality.

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

The valley - The same word as "the plain" [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022); [Eze
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004). The "dry bones" represented the
Israelites dispersed abroad, destitute of life national and spiritual.

[Ezekiel 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 37:4</span></span>

Prophesy - Not in the sense of predicting what was to come to pass, but
simply in that of speaking under the inspiration of God. In [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005), not "I will cause," but I cause
or am causing.

[Ezekiel 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 37:7</span></span>

Bone to his bone - i. e., to its proper place in the frame.

[Ezekiel 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 37:9</span></span>

The wind - Rather, as in the margin and as in [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005). The bones are the bones of the
"slain," because the scene was one which was likely to occur in the time
of the Chaldaean invasion, and the fact of violent death reminded the
prophet of the miserable condition of the people.

[Ezekiel 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 37:11</span></span>

We are cut off for our parts - That is, "as for us, we are cut off." The
people had fallen into despair.

[Ezekiel 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 37:16</span></span>

A prophecy of the reunion of Israel and Judah, the incorporation of
Israel under one Ruler, the kingdom of Messiah upon earth and in heaven.

[Eze 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016)

One stick - So in the marginal reference the names of the tribes had
been written on rods or sticks.

For Judah ... - To the house of David had remained faithful, not only
Judah, but also Benjamin, Levi, and part of Simeon, and individual
members of various tribes [Ch2
11:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012). Compare the marginal
references.

Joseph ... Ephraim - Compare [Psa
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067); [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005) ff "Joseph" is the general name
here for the ten tribes, including "Ephraim," the chief tribe, and his
companions. Omit "for" before "all." "All the house of Israel" is here
the ten tribes.

[Eze 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019)

In the hand of Ephraim - Because Ephraim was the ruling tribe; the words
are contrasted with "in mine hand."

[Eze 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#020)

This sign was literally enacted in the presence of the people, not, like
some signs, merely in vision (see the [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001) note).

[Eze 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021)

The gathering together of the children of Israel was to take effect in
the first place in the return from Babylon, when the distinction of
Israel and Judah should cease. The full completion concerns times still
future, when all Israel shall come in to acknowledge the rule of Christ.

[Eze 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022)

One king - The restoration of Israel to their native soil will lead the
way to the coming of the promised King, the Son of David, who will
gather into His kingdom the true Israel, all who shall by faith be
acknowledged as the Israel of God. The reign of the One King David is
the reign of Christ in His kingdom, the Church.

[Eze 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025), [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026)

An enlargement of the promises. The kingdom is to be "forever," the
covenant "everlasting." This looks forward to the consummation of all
God's promises [Co1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024), [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028).

[Eze 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027)

This gives a final blessing reserved for God's accepted servants. The
tabernacle and temple were outward symbols of His presence. The
re-erection of the temple by Zerubbabel was the first step to a
restoration of the presence of God. The second step was the presence of
Christ, first in the flesh, then in His Church, and finally the eternal
presence of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem Rev. 21.
