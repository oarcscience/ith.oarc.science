### [2 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 25:1</span></span>

This chapter is evidently taken to a large extent from the same document
as Kings (see the marginal reference and the notes). At the same time it
contains large and important additions; e. g. [Ch2
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005.md), [Ch2
25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 25:5</span></span>

Three hundred thousand - Asa's army had been nearly twice as numerous,
amounting to 580, 000 [Ch2 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008.md). The
diminution was due, in part, to wars [Ch2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008.md), [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md); [Ch2
24:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023.md); in part, to the general
decadence of the kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 25:8</span></span>

If the present text is regarded as sound, this passage must be taken
ironically. But most recent commentators supply a second negative, and
render it: "But go thou alone, act, be strong for the battle - God shall
then not make thee to fall."

[2 Chronicles 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 25:10</span></span>

Such a dismissal could not fail to arouse great indignation. The
Israelites would suppose themselves dismissed because their good faith
was suspected. On the consequences of their indignation, see [Ch2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 25:11</span></span>

The children of Seir - i. e. the Edomites (see the marginal reference
"h").

[2 Chronicles 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 25:12</span></span>

The top of the rock - Rather, "the height of Selah" (or, Petra), near
which the battle was probably fought. On the cruel features of the
Edomite wars, see [Kg1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md); [Eze
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md); [Oba
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#014.md).

[2 Chronicles 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 25:13</span></span>

To revenge the insult [Ch2 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#010.md), the
troops of Joash proceeded southward and ravaged all the Jewish towns and
villages between the Israelite frontier and Bethboron. This invasion
probably took place while Amaziah was still in Edom.

[2 Chronicles 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 25:14</span></span>

The practice of carrying off the images of the gods from a conquered
country, or city, as trophies of victory, was common among the nations
of the East. Sometimes as with the Romans, the object was worship,
especially when the gods were previously among those of the conquering
country, and the images had the reputation of special sanctity.

[2 Chronicles 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 25:16</span></span>

Art thou made of the king's counsel? - A subtle irony: "Have I made thee
one of my council? If not what entitles thee to offer thy advice?"

For the fulfillment of the prophecy, see [Ch2
25:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#022.md), [Ch2
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#027.md).

[2 Chronicles 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 25:27</span></span>

After the time ... - The writer means that the violent death of Amaziah
followed on his apostasy, not closely in point of time - for it must
have been at least 15 years after [Ch2
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#025.md) - nor as, humanly speaking,
caused by it; but, in the way of a divine judgment, his death was a
complete fulfillment of the prophecy of [Ch2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md).
