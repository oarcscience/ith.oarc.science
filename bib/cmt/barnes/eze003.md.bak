### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

Before, there was a direct commission, now there is a symbolic action.
John has the same vision ([Rev 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008.md)
ff), but there that is expressed, which is here left to be inferred,
namely, that "as soon as he had eaten it his belly was bitter." The
sweetness in the mouth denoted that it was good to be a messenger of the
Lord (compare the margin reference), but the bitterness which
accompanied it, denoted that the commission brought with it much sorrow.

[Ezekiel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 3:6</span></span>

To many people - To various nations using diverse languages.

Surely - The thought is that expressed by our Saviour Himself (margin
reference). Some render it: "but I have sent thee unto these; they can
hearken" etc.

[Ezekiel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 3:8</span></span>

I have made ... thy forehead strong - I have given thee a strength
superior to theirs; a metaphor taken from horned animals.

[Ezekiel 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 3:9</span></span>

Adamant - Or, diamond [Jer 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md), which
was employed to cut flint. Ezekiel's firmness being that of a diamond,
he should cut a stroke home to the hardened hearts of a rebellious
people. For "though" read "for."

[Ezekiel 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 3:11</span></span>

Thy people - God's people.

[Ezekiel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 3:12</span></span>

I heard behind me - The commission having been given, and the prophet
transported to the place of his ministry, the chariot of the vision
passes away with the proper tokens [Eze
1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024.md). A voice from above the
firmament is now heard proclaiming the divine glory.

From his place - The place where the glory of the Lord had revealed
itself in the vision. The words are to be joined to "saying:" put a
comma after Lord.

[Ezekiel 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 3:13</span></span>

That touched - literally, touching. The living creatures in their flight
raised their wings, so as to touch each other.

[Ezekiel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 3:14</span></span>

Lifted me up - We are not to suppose that the prophet was miraculously
transported from one place to another in the land of his captivity.
Compare [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md); [Act
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039.md). He had been in an ecstatic
vision [Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md), and now guided by the
Spirit he goes forth among his countrymen.

The heat of my spirit - Full of the righteous indignation, which God
inspired, against the sin which he was to denounce.

But the hand - and "the hand." The Lord strengthened him for his
mission.

[Ezekiel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 3:15</span></span>

Tel-abib - , on the river Chebar was the chief seat of the Jewish exiles
in Babylonia. The name "Tel-abib" ("mount of ears of corn") was probably
given on account of its fertility.

I sat where they sat - Rather, "And I saw them sitting there and I sat
there."

Astonished - Rather, silent, with fixed and determined silence (compare
[Ezr 9:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003).md). "To be silent" was
characteristic of mourners [Lam 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028.md);
"to sit" their proper attitude [Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md); [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md); "seven days" the set time of
mourning [Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 3:16</span></span>

The Lord guards both Ezekiel and his countrymen from dwelling
exclusively on the national character of his mission. In the midst of
the general visitations, each individual was to stand as it were alone
before Him to render account of his doings, and to be judged according
to his works.

[Ezekiel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 3:17</span></span>

Watchman - The priests and ministers of the Lord were often so called.
Ezekiel is especially distinguished by this title [Eze
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#007.md). The duties of a watchman are
twofold,

\(1\) to wait and watch what God will order,

\(2\) to watch over and superintend the people.

Isaiah describes and censures unfaithful watchmen [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010.md).

[Ezekiel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 3:18</span></span>

This passage anticipates the great moral principle of divine government
Ezek. 18 that each man is individually responsible for his own actions,
and will be judged according to these and these alone.

[Eze 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020.md)

I lay a stumblingblock before him - I bring him to trial by placing
difficulties and temptations in his way (compare [Eze
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md); [Eze
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#012.md) margin; [Eze
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003).md). It is true that God tempts no
man in order to his destruction, but in the course of His Providence He
permits men to be tried in order that their faith may be approved, and
in this trial some who seem to be righteous fall.

Because thou ... his blood ... - So far as the prophet was concerned,
the neglect of his duty is reckoned as the cause of the seemingly
righteous man's fall.

His righteousness ... - Or, righteousnesses, i. e. acts of
righteousness. The "righteous" man here is one, who had hitherto done
the "acts of righteousness" prescribed by the Law, but when trial came
was shown to lack the "principle of righteousness."

[Eze 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#021.md)

The repetition of the word "righteous" is to be noted. There seems to be
an intimation that sin is alien to the character of a "righteous" man.
Compare [Jo1 3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md).

[Ezekiel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 3:23</span></span>

A fresh revelation of the glory of the Lord, to impress upon Ezekiel
another characteristic of his mission. Now he is to learn that there is
"a time to be silent" as well as "a time to speak," and that both are
appointed by God. This represents forcibly the authoritative character
and divine origin of the utterances of the Hebrew prophets.

[Ezekiel 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 3:24</span></span>

"Shut" in the privacy of his own chamber he is to receive a message from
Yahweh. This "shutting up," however, and the "bands" ([Eze
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025), used figuratively.md) were signs of
the manner in which Ezekiel's countrymen would close their ears,
hindering him as far as in them lay from delivering the message of the
Lord.

With this verse commences a series of symbolic actions enjoined to the
prophet in order to foretell the coming judgments of Jerusalem Ezek. 4;
5. Generally speaking symbolic actions were either literal and public,
or figurative and private. In the latter case they impressed upon the
prophet's mind the truth which he was to enforce upon others by the
description of the action as by a figure. Difficulties have arisen,
because interpreters have not chosen to recognize the figurative as well
as the literal mode of prophesying. Hence, some, who would have all
literal, have had to accept the most strange and unnecessary actions as
real; while others, who would have all figurative, have had arbitrarily
to explain away the most plain historical statement. There may be a
difference of opinion as to which class one or other figure may belong;
but after all, the determination is not important, the whole value of
the parabolic figure residing in the lesson which it is intended to
convey.

[Ezekiel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 3:26</span></span>

And I will make - Rather, Then will I "make." One action is the
consequence of the other. Because the people would silence the prophet,
God to punish them will close his mouth (compare [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md); [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014).md).

[Ezekiel 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 3:27</span></span>

He that heareth ... - The judicial blindness of which Ezekiel speaks had
already fallen upon the great body of the nation ([Eze
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004.md). Compare [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md); [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011).md).
