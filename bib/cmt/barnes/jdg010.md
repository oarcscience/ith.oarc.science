### [Judges Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

[Judges 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 10:1</span></span>

Defend - The marginal reading "to deliver," is far preferable. The word
is the same as in [Jdg 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016.md), [Jdg
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018.md); [Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md), [Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md), [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md), etc., and is the technical word
applied to the judges. Compare [Neh
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md) ("saviours who saved them," the
King James Version).

The term "there arose," also marks Tola as one of the Judges, properly
so called, raised by divine providence.

Tola and Puah - Both names of heads of houses in the tribe of Issachar
[Ch1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md); [Gen
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md).

Shamir - Not the same as that mentioned in [Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md), which was in the hill country
of Judah. Issaehar would seem from this to have extended into the
northern part of mount Ephraim.

[Judges 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 10:2</span></span>

Jair the Gileadite was probably the same person as is named in [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md); [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md), as having given the name of
"Havoth-jair" to certain villages in Bashan.

[Judges 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 10:6</span></span>

The gods of Syria - Or "Aram." In the times of the Judges the various
tribes of Aramites, or Syrians, were not compacted into one state, nor
were they until after the time of Solomon. The national gods of these
various Aramean tribes were probably the same; and their worship would
be likely to be introduced into the trans-Jordanic tribes. It has been
remarked that the Hebrew words for "to divine," "to practice magic,"
"idolatrous priests," and other like words, are of Syrian origin. The
Syriac ritual proved very attractive to king Ahaz [Kg2
16:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). For the national gods of the
Zidonians, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines, see [Kg1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md),[Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033.md); [Sa1
5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md).

[Judges 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 10:7</span></span>

The previous mention of the Philistines as oppressors of Israel [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md) seems to be restricted to the
south of Judah, when they cooperated with Moab. They appear to have
gradually increased in power until they reached their height in the time
of Saul. In the present instance they were probably in alliance with the
Ammonites, holding the western tribes in check, while the Ammonites
subdued those on the east of Jordan.

[Judges 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 10:8</span></span>

That year - Perhaps the closing year of the oppression, when the
Ammonites passed over the Jordan. For it was this crowning oppression
which brought the Israelites to repentance [Jdg
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010.md), [Jdg
10:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015.md), and so prepared the way for
the deliverance. Possibly in the original narrative from which this
portion of the Book of Judges is compiled, "that year" was defined.

The land of the Amorites - Namely, of Sihon king of the Amorites, [Num
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md); [Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md); [Jos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010.md); [Psa
135:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#011.md).

[Judges 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 10:11</span></span>

(See the marginal references). The Israelites were delivered from the
"Egyptians" at the Exodus; from the "Amorites" in the victories over
Sihon, and Og, and the five kings of the Amorites [Jos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md); from the "children of Ammon" by
Ehud; and from the "Philistines," by the hand of Shamgar (compare [Sa1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009).md).

[Judges 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 10:12</span></span>

The Zidonians - An allusion to the time of Barak, when the Zidonians
doubtless formed part of the great confederacy of Canaanites under Jabin
king of Hazor. See [Jos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md).

The Amalekites - In the time of Gideon (marginal reference).

The Maonites - Probably one of the tribes of the "children of the East,"
who came with the Midianites and Amalekites in the time of Gideon, and
may have been conspicuous for their hostility to Israel, and for the
greatness of their discomfiture, though the record has not been
preserved. The name is "Mehununs" in [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md).

[Judges 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 10:17</span></span>

The historian, having related the preliminary incidents, now comes to
the final issue which forms the subject matter of his narrative. On a
certain occasion, as on many previous ones, the Ammonites were encamped
in Gilead, with the intention of dispossessing the Israelites of the
whole country, or at least as far as the river Jabbok [Jdg
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md), and of invading the
West-Jordanic tribes. The children of Israel on the East of Jordan
assembled together to resist them, and pitched their camp in Mizpeh. The
narrative proceeds to detail what happened.

Mizpeh - , as its name, "watch-tower" or "look-out" indicates was
situated on a height of Mount Gilead, and was, as such, a strong post.
It is almost always written, "THE Mizpeh," or watch-tower. Four or five
places of the name occur in Scripture.

[Judges 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 10:18</span></span>

And the people and princes ... - The inhabitants of Gilead appear as a
separate and independent community, electing their own chief, without
any reference to the West-Jordanic tribes.
