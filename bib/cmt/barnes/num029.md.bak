### [Numbers Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 29:1</span></span>

The ordinance of the Feast of Trumpets was to be observed on the opening
day of that month within which the great Day of the Atonement and the
Feast of Tabernacles fell (compare [Lev
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023) ff.md). The special offering for
the day anticipated that of the great Day of Atonement.

[Numbers 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 29:7</span></span>

The offering on the great Day of Atonement was the same with that just
specified. The great ceremonies of the day are described in Lev. 16.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

Feast of tabernacles: compare [Lev
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033.md) ff. The offerings required at
this feast were the largest of all. It was especially one of
thankfulness to God for the gift of the fruits of the earth; and the
quantity and the nature of the offerings (see [Num
29:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007).md) were determined accordingly.

[Num 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#032.md)

Stress is laid on the number seven, the holy symbolic covenant number,
by way of intimation that the mercies of the harvest accrued by virtue
of God's covenant. The diminishing number of bullocks sacrificed on the
preceding days of the Feast (compare [Num
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#013.md), [Num
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#017), etc..md), is adjusted simply to
obtain the coincidence before us on the seventh day; but some have
thought that the gradual evanescence of the Law until the time of its
absorption in the Gospel is here presignified in the Law itself.

[Numbers 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 29:35</span></span>

The offerings prescribed for the closing day of the Feast of tabernacles
were the same with those appointed for the Feast of Trumpets and the Day
of Atonement. The solemnities of the month thus terminated, as

A whole, with the same sacrifices with which, three weeks before, they
had been introduced; and the Day of Atonement, even though succeeded by
the rejoicings of the Feast of tabernacles, thus left its impress on the
whole month.
