### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 2:1</span></span>

Enquired of the Lord - Through Abiathar, the high priest. The death of
Saul and Jonathan had entirely changed David's position, and therefore
he needed divine guidance how to act under the new circumstances in
which he was placed. Compare the marginal references.

Hebron was well suited for the temporary capital of David's kingdom,
being situated in a strong position in the mountains of Judah, amidst
David's friends, and withal having especially sacred associations (see
the marginal references note). It appears to have also been the center
of a district [Sa2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#003).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 2:4</span></span>

David had already been anointed by Samuel [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013). His first anointing indicated
God's secret purpose, his second the accomplishment of that purpose.
(Compare the case of Saul, [Sa1 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001);
[Sa1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014).) David was anointed again
king over Israel [Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003). The
interval between the anointing of the Lord Jesus as the Christ of God,
and His taking to Himself His kingdom and glory, seems to be thus
typified.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 2:8</span></span>

Mahanaim - See [Gen 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002). From [Sa2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012) it would seem to have been
Ish-bosheth's capital.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 2:9</span></span>

The Ashurites - If the tribe of Asher, the verse indicates the order in
which Abner recovered the different districts from the Philistines, and
added them to the dominions of Ish-bosheth, beginning with Gilead, and
then gradually adding, on the west of Jordan, first the territory of
Asher as far as Carmel and the whole plain of Esdraelon, and then the
country of Ephraim and Benjamin, being in fact all Israel, as
distinguished from Judah; and this reconquest may have occupied five
years. Ish-bosheth's reign over Israel may not have been reckoned to
begin until the conquest was complete.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 2:10</span></span>

Forty ... two - The numerals are somewhat strange. First, as regards the
40 years. Even assuming that Ish-bosheth's reign did not commence until
five and a half years after Saul's death, which must have been the case
if the two years in the text gives the true length of his reign, it is
startling to hear of Saul's younger son being 35 years old at his
father's death, born consequently some three years before his father's
accession, and five years older than David, the bosom friend of his
older brother Jonathan. The age, too, of Jonathan's child, Mephibosheth,
who was five years old at his father's death, would lead one to expect
rather a less age for his uncle. Next, as regards the two years. Since
David (compare [Sa2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#011); and marginal
references) reigned seven years in Hebron over Judah only, it follows,
if the two years in the text are correct, either that an interval of
five years elapsed between Ish-bosheth's death and David's being
anointed "king over all Israel," or that a like interval elapsed between
Saul's death and the commencement of Ish-bosheth's reign. Of the two the
latter is the more probable, and has the advantage of diminishing
Ish-bosheth's age by between five and six years. But the narrative in 2
Sam. 3; [Sa2 4:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001) of the "long war,"
of the birth of David's six sons, and of Abner's conspiracy and death,
seems to imply a longer time than two years, in which case both the
numerals would have to be corrected.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 2:12</span></span>

This expedition to Gibeon may have been for the purpose of shifting his
metropolis to his own tribe of Benjamin, and to his family place,
"Gibeah of Saul," close to Gibeon, with the further purpose of attacking
the kingdom of David. "To go out" [Sa2
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012) is a technical phrase for
going out to war [Sa1 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#030).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 2:13</span></span>

On the east of the hill (El-jib, the ancient Gibeon) is a copious
spring, which issues in a cave excavated in the limestone rock, so as to
form a large reservoir. In the trees further down are the remains of a
pool or tank of considerable size (120 feet by 110 feet). This is
doubtless "the pool of Gibeon."

Sat down - i. e. halted and encamped.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 2:14</span></span>

Play - (Compare [Jdg 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025); [Sa1
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#007)). Here, the word is applied to
the serious game of war, to be played by twelve combatants on each side,
with the two armies for spectators.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 2:16</span></span>

Compare Livy's history of the battle between the Horatii and Curiatii.
This combat, like that, may have been proposed as a means of avoiding
the effusion of blood of two nations united by consanguinity, and having
a common powerful enemy in the Philistines.

Helkath-hazzurim - i. e. "the part, field, or plat [Gen
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019) of the sharp edges or blades."
This seems, on the whole, the best explanation of this rather obscure
name.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 2:17</span></span>

Neither side had the advantage in the combat of twelve a side; hence,
the quarrel was fought out with great fierceness by the two armies, and
the victory was won by David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 2:21</span></span>

His armour - Rather, as in the margin; i. e. content thyself with the
spoil of some inferior soldier for a trophy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 2:23</span></span>

With the hinder end ... - i. e. the wooden end, which was more or less
pointed to enable the owner to stick it in the ground [Sa1
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007).

The fifth rib - The word so rendered here (and in marginal references)
means the abdomen, and is not etymologically connected with the Hebrew
for five, as the translation "fifth rib" supposes, but with a verb
meaning to be fat, or strong.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 2:24</span></span>

Ammah ... Giah - Local, and otherwise unknown names.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 2:27</span></span>

Joab's speech means either "unless thou hadst spoken (challenged us to
fight, [Sa2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014)), the people would
have returned from the pursuit of their brethren (many hours ago, even)
this morning;" or, "If thou hadst not spoken (asked for peace, [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026)), surely the people would have
returned, etc., in the morning, i. e. would not have ceased the pursuit
until the morning." The latter interpretation is the more accordant with
Joab's boastful character.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 2:29</span></span>

Through the plain - See [Sa1 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#024).
Bithron is unknown. From the expression all (the) Bithron, it seems
likely that it is a tract of country, intersected by ravines lying on
the east side of Jordan.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 2:32</span></span>

Joab, having stopped the pursuit, passed the night with his army on the
field of battle; the next morning he numbered the missing, and buried
the dead; they carried the body of Asahel to Bethlehem and buried him
there, and then joined David at Hebron. Hebron would be about 14 miles
from Bethlehem, or about five hours' march.
