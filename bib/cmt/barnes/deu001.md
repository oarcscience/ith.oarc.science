### [Deuteronomy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 1:1</span></span>

These verses are prefixed as a connecting link between the contents of
the preceding books and that of Deuteronomy now to follow. The sense of
the passage might be given thus: "The discourses of Moses to the people
up to the eleventh month of the fortieth year" (compare [Deu
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#003)) "have now been recorded." The
proper names which follow seem to belong to places where "words" of
remarkable importance were spoken. They are by the Jewish commentators
referred to the spots which witnessed the more special sins of the
people, and the mention of them here is construed as a pregnant rebuke.
The Book of Deuteronomy is known among the Jews as "the book of
reproofs."

On this side of Jordan - Rather, "beyond Jordan" (as in [Deu
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020), [Deu
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025)). The phrase was a standing
designation for the district east of Jordan, and at times, when Greek
became commonly spoken in the country, was exactly represented by the
proper name Peraea.

In the wilderness, in the plain - The former term denotes the Desert of
Arabia generally; the latter was the sterile tract ('Arabah,' [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004) note) which stretches along the
lower Jordan to the Dead Sea, and is continued thence to the Gulf of
Akaba.

Over against the Red Sea - Render it: "over against Suph." "Sea" is not
in the original text. "Suph" is either the pass Es Sufah near
Ain-el-Weibeh ([Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026) note), or
the name of the alluvial district (the [Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014) note).

Tophel is identified with Tufileh, the Tafyle of Burckhardt, still a
considerable place - some little distance southeast of the Dead Sea.
Paran is probably "Mount Paran" [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); or a city of the same name near
the mountain. Compare [Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006).

Laban is generally identified with Libnah [Num
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#020), and Hazeroth with Ain Hadherah
([Num 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034) note); but the position of
Dizahab is uncertain.

[Deu 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002)

For Kadesh see [Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026) note; and
for Horeb see [Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001).

[Deuteronomy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 1:4</span></span>

Astaroth - On this place compare [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005) and note.

In Edrei - These words should, to render the sense clear, come next
after "slain." The battle in which Sihon and Og were defeated took place
at Edrei.

[Deuteronomy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 1:5</span></span>

In the land of Moab - This district had formerly been occupied by the
Moabites, and retained its name from them: but had been conquered by the
Amorites. Compare [Num 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025), note;
[Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005), note.

Declare - Render, explain the Law already declared.

[Deuteronomy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 1:6</span></span>

The first and introductory address of Moses to the people is here
commenced. It extends to [Deu 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040);
and is divided from the second discourse by the [Deu
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004) :41-49. A summary of the address
is given in the chapter-headings usually found in English Bibles.

[Deuteronomy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 1:7</span></span>

To the mount of the Amorites - i. e. to the mountain district occupied
by the Amorites, reaching into the Negeb, and part of the territory
assigned to the tribe of Judah.

[Deuteronomy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 1:9</span></span>

This appointment of the "captains" (compare [Exo
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021) ff) must not be confounded with
that of the elders in [Num 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016) ff.
The former would number 78,600; the latter were 70 only.

A comparison between this passage and that in Exodus makes it obvious
that Moses is only touching on certain parts of the whole history,
without regard to order of time, but with a special purpose. This
important arrangement for the good government of the people took place
before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact
sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the
people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious
to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with
themselves!

[Deuteronomy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 1:19</span></span>

That great and terrible wilderness - Compare [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015). This language is such as people
would employ after having passed with toil and suffering through the
worst part of it, the southern half of the Arabah (see [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004) note); and more especially when
they had but recently rested from their marches in the plain of Shittim,
the largest and richest oasis in the whole district on the Eastern bank
near the mouth of the Jordan.

[Deuteronomy 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 1:22</span></span>

The plan of sending the spies originated with the people; and, as in
itself a reasonable one, it approved itself to Moses; it was submitted
to God, sanctioned by Him, and carried out under special divine
direction. The orator's purpose in this chapter is to bring before the
people emphatically their own responsibilites and behavior. It is
therefore important to remind them, that the sending of the spies, which
led immediately to their complaining and rebellion, was their own
suggestion.

The following verses to the end of the chapter give a condensed account,
the fuller one being in Num. 13-14, of the occurrences which led to the
banishment of the people for 40 years into the wilderness.

[Deuteronomy 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 1:37</span></span>

The sentence on Moses was not passed when the people rebelled during
their first encampment at Kadesh, but some 37 years later, when they had
re-assembled in the same neighborhood at Meribah (see the [Num
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013) note). He alludes to it here as
having happened not many months previously, bearing on the facts which
were for his purpose in pricking the conscience of the people.

[Deuteronomy 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">deu 1:41</span></span>

Ye were ready to go up into the hill - Rather, perhaps, "ye made light
of going up;" i. e. "ye were ready to attempt it as a trifling
undertaking." [Deu 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#043) shows the
issue of this spirit in action; compare marginal references.

[Deuteronomy 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 1:44</span></span>

The Amorites - In [Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045), it is
"the Amalekites and the Canaanites" who are said to have discomfited
them. The Amorites, as the most powerful nation of Canaan, lend their
name here, as in other passages (eg. [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007)) to the Canaanite tribes
generally.
