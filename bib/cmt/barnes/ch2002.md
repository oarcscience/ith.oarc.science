### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 2:3</span></span>

Huram, the form used throughout Chronicles (except [Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001).md) for the name both of the king
and of the artisan whom he lent to Solomon [Ch2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013.md); [Ch2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011.md), [Ch2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016.md), is a late corruption of the true
native word, Hiram (marginal note and reference).

[2 Chronicles 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 2:4</span></span>

The symbolic meaning of "burning incense" is indicated in [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md). Consult the marginal references
to this verse.

The solemn feasts - The three great annnual festivals, the Passover, the
Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), and the Feast of tabernacles Lev. 23:4-44;
Deut. 16:1-17.

[2 Chronicles 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 2:5</span></span>

See [Kg1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md) note. In Jewish eyes, at
the time that the temple was built, it may have been "great," that is to
say, it may have exceeded the dimensions of any single separate building
existing in Palestine up to the time of its erection.

Great is our God ... - This may seem inappropriate as addressed to a
pagan king. But it appears [Ch2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md) that Hiram acknowledged Yahweh
as the supreme deity, probably identifying Him with his own Melkarth.

[2 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 2:6</span></span>

Save only to burn sacrifice before him - Solomon seems to mean that to
build the temple can only be justified on the human - not on the divine
- side. "God dwelleth not in temples made with hands;" He cannot be
confined to them; He does in no sort need them. The sole reason for
building a temple lies in the needs of man: his worship must he local;
the sacrifices commanded in the Law had of necessity to be offered
somewhere.

[2 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 2:7</span></span>

See [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md), note; [Kg1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md), note.

Purple ... - "Purple, crimson, and blue," would be needed for the
hangings of the temple, which, in this respect, as in others, was
conformed to the pattern of the tabernacle (see [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md); [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001), etc..md). Hiram's power of "working
in purple, crimson," etc., was probably a knowledge of the best modes of
dyeing cloth these colors. The Phoenicians, off whose coast the murex
was commonly taken, were famous as purple dyers from a very remote
period.

Crimson - כרמיל karmı̂̂yl, the word here and elsewhere translated
"crimson," is unique to Chronicles and probably of Persian origin. The
famous red dye of Persia and India, the dye known to the Greeks as
κόκκος kokkos, and to the Romans as coccum, is obtained from an insect.
Whether the "scarlet" שׁני shânı̂y of Exodus ([Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004), etc..md) is the same or a different
red, cannot be certainly determined.

[2 Chronicles 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 2:10</span></span>

Beaten wheat - The Hebrew text is probably corrupt here. The true
original may be restored from marginal reference, where the wheat is
said to have been given "for food."

The barley and the wine are omitted in Kings. The author of Chronicles
probably filled out the statement which the writer of Kings has given in
brief; the barley, wine, and ordinary oil, would be applied to the
sustenance of the foreign laborers.

[2 Chronicles 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 2:11</span></span>

Josephus and others professed to give Greek versions of the
correspondence, which (they said) had taken place between Hiram and
Solomon. No value attaches to those letters, which are evidently
forgeries.

Because the Lord hath loved his people - Compare the marginal
references. The neighboring sovereigns, in their communications with the
Jewish monarchs, seem to have adopted the Jewish name for the Supreme
Being (Yahweh), either identifying Him (as did Hiram) with their own
chief god or (sometimes) meaning merely to acknowledge Him as the
special God of the Jewish nation and country.

[2 Chronicles 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 2:12</span></span>

The Lord ... that made heaven and earth - This appears to have been a
formula designating the Supreme God with several of the Asiatic nations.
In the Persian inscriptions Ormazd is constantly called "the great god,
who gave" (or made) "heaven and earth."

[2 Chronicles 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 2:13</span></span>

Of Huram my father's - A wrong translation. Huram here is the workman
sent by the king of Tyre and not the king of Tyre's father (see [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001) note.md). The words in the original
are Huram Abi, and the latter word is now commonly thought to be either
a proper name or an epithet of honor, e. g., my master-workman.

[2 Chronicles 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 2:14</span></span>

To find out every device - Compare [Exo
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004.md). The "devices" intended are plans
or designs connected with art, which Huram could invent on any subject
that was "put to him."

[2 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 2:17</span></span>

The strangers are the non-Israelite population of the holy land, the
descendants (chiefly) of those Canaanites whom the children of Israel
did not drive out. The reimposition of the bond-service imposed on the
Canaanites at the time of the conquest [Jdg
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md), [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md), [Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033.md), [Jdg
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035.md), but discontinued in the period
of depression between Joshua and Saul, was (it is clear) due to David,
whom Solomon merely imitated in the arrangements described in these
verses.

[2 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 2:18</span></span>

On the numbers, see the [Kg1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016.md)
note.

To set the people a work - Or, "to set the people to work" - i. e., to
compel them to labor. Probably, like the Egyptian and Assyrian overseers
of forced labor, these officers carried whips or sticks, with which they
quickened the movements of the sluggish.
