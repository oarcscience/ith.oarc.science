### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

There is a remarkable resemblance between this psalm and [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). Both are ascribed to the same
author, David; and each pursues the same line of thought - the folly and
wickedness of Atheism. They both show that the belief that there is no
God is not a harmless idea, or a mere speculation, but that it has
important consequences on the life, and is naturally connected with a
wicked life, [Psa 53:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003.md).

The difference in the two compositions is (a) in the title; and (b) in
the psalm itself.

\(a\) In the title. Both psalms are ascribed to David, and both are
dedicated to the "Chief Musician." But in the title to the psalm before
us, there is this addition: "Upon Mahalath, Maschil." On the meaning of
the term Maschil, see Introduction to [Psa
32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md). The term here would seem to
imply that the psalm was designed to give instruction on an important
subject, but why it is prefixed to this psalm, and not to the others, we
have no means of determining. The word, rendered "Mahalath" - מחלת
machălath - occurs only here and in the title to Ps. 88. It is supposed
by Gesenius to denote a stringed instrument, as a lute or guitar, that
was designed to be accompanied with the voice. DeWette renders it
"flute." Luther renders it "for a choir, to be sung by one another;"
that is, a responsive choir. The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate retain
the original word with no attempt to translate it. Prof. Alexander
renders it disease, because a form of the word "almost identical" occurs
[Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md); [Pro
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md); [Ch2
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015.md) meaning "disease," and he
supposes reference is to "the spiritual malady with which all mankind
are infected, and which is really the theme or subject of the
composition." It is true that there is a word - מחלה machăleh - similar
to this, meaning "disease," but it is also true that the word used here
is never employed in that sense, and equally true that such a
construction here is forced and unnatural. The obvious supposition is
that it refers to an instrument of music.

\(b\) The difference in the psalms themselves is mainly that in [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md) [Psa
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md) is omitted, and that in the other
parts of the psalm there are enlargements designed to illustrate or to
explain more fully the course of thought in the psalm. It is not known
by whom these changes were made. They are, as DeWette remarks, such as
could not have occurred by an error in transcribing, and they must have
been made by design. Whether the changes were made by the author, or by
someone who collected and arranged the psalms, and who, adopting the
main thoughts of [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), inserted
additions conveying new phases of thought, though without intending to
supersede the use of the original composition, it is not possible now to
determine. It is by no means an improbable supposition that the author
of the psalm - David - may have revised it himself, and made these
changes as expressing more fully his idea, while, as embodying valuable
thoughts, it was deemed not undesirable to retain the original psalm in
the collection as proper to be used in the service of God. Similar
changes occur in Ps. 18, as compared with 2 Sam. 22, where that psalm
occurs in the original form of composition. There is no evidence that
the alteration was made by a later writer; we may doubt whether a later
writer would alter a composition of David, and publish it under his
name.

For an analysis of the psalm, see Introduction to [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

The fool hath said in his heart ... - For the meaning of this verse, see
the notes at [Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). The only
change in this verse - a change which does not affect the sense - is the
substitution of the word "iniquity," in [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md), for "works," in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 53:2</span></span>

God looked down from heaven ... - See the notes at [Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md). The only change which occurs in
this verse is the substitution of the word אלהים 'Elohiym, rendered
"God," for "Yahweh," rendered Lord, in [Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md). The same change occurs also in
[Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md), [Psa
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md). It is to be observed, also, that
the word "Yahweh" does not occur in this psalm, but that the term used
is uniformly. אלהים 'Elohiym, God. In [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) both terms are found - the word
אלהים 'Elohiym three times [Psa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md), and the word יהוה Yahweh four
times, [Psa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md), [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md),[Psa
14:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md). It is impossible to account
for this change. There is nothing in it, however, to indicate anything
in regard to the authorship of the psalm or to the time when it was
written, for both these words are frequently used by David elsewhere.

[Psalms 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 53:3</span></span>

Every one of them is gone back - See the notes at [Psa
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md). The only variation here in the
two psalms is in the substitution of the word - סג sâg, for סור sûr -
words almost identical in form and in sense. The only difference in
meaning is, that the former word - the word used here - means "to draw
back," or "to go back;" the other, the word used in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), means "to go off, to turn
aside." Each of them indicates a departure from God; a departure equally
fatal and equally guilty, whether people turn "back" from following him,
or turn "aside" to something else. Both of these forms of apostasy occur
with lamentable frequency.

[Psalms 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 53:4</span></span>

Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? - See the notes at [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md). The only change in this verse is
in the omission of the word "all." This word, as it occurs in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) ("all the workers of
iniquity"), makes the sentence stronger and more emphatic. It is
designed to affirm in the most absolute and unqualified manner that none
of these workers of iniquity had any true knowledge of God. This has
been noticed by critics as the only instance in which the expression in
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) is stronger than in the
revised form of the psalm before us.

[Psalms 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 53:5</span></span>

There were they in great fear ... - Margin, as in Hebrew, "they feared a
fear." For the general meaning of the verse, see the notes at [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md). There is, however, an important
change introduced here - the most important in the psalm. The general
sentiment of two verses [Psa 14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md) in
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) is here compressed into
one, and yet with such an important change as to show that it was by
design, and apparently to adapt it to some new circumstance. The
solution of this would seem to be that the original form [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) was suited to some occasion
then present to the mind of the writer, and that some new event occurred
to which the general sentiment in the psalm might be easily applied (or
which would express that as well as could be done by an entirely new
composition), but that, in order to adapt it to this new purpose, it
would be proper to insert some expression more particularly referring to
the event.

The principal of these additions is found in the verse before us. In
[Psa 14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md), the language is, "There
were they in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous;
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge."
In the psalm before us, the language is, "There were they in great fear,
where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that
encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath
despised them." "Where no fear was." The reference here, as in [Psa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md), is to the fear or consternation
of the people of God on account of the designs and efforts of the
wicked. They were apprehensive of being overthrown by the wicked. The
design of the psalmist in both cases is to show that there was no
occasion for that fear. In [Psa 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005.md),
he shows it by saying that "God is in the congregation of the
righteous." In the psalm before us fie says expressly that there was no
ground for that fear - "where no fear was," - and he adds, as a reason,
that God had "scattered the bones" of them "that encamped against" them.
That is, though there seemed to be occasion for fear - though those
enemies were formidable in numbers and in power - yet God was their
friend, and he had now showed them that they had no real occasion for
alarm by dispersing those foes.

For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee - Of
the besieger. This, as already intimated, would seem to have been
introduced in order to adapt the psalm to the particular circumstances
of the occasion when it was revised. From this clause, as well as
others, it appears probable that the particular occasion contemplated in
the revision of the psalm was an attack on Jerusalem, or a siege of the
city - an attack which had been repelled, or a siege which the enemy had
been compelled to raise. That is, they had been overthrown, and their
bones had been scattered, unburied, on the ground. The whole language of
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), thus modified, would be
well suited to such an occurrence. The general description of atheism
and wickedness in [Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) would be
appropriate in reference to such an attempt on the city - for those who
made the attack might well be represented as practically saying that
there was no God; as being corrupt and abominable; as bent on iniquity;
as polluted and defiled; and as attempting to eat up the people of God
as they eat bread; and as those who did not call upon God. The verse
before us would describe them as discomfited, and as being scattered in
slaughtered heaps upon the earth.

Thou hast put them to shame - That is, they had been put to shame by
being overthrown; by being unsuccessful in their attempt. The word
"thou" here must be understood as referring to God.

Because God hath despised them - He has wholly disapproved their
character, and he has "despised "their attempts; that is, he has shown
that they were not formidable or to be feared. They were efforts which
might be looked on with contempt, and he had evinced this by showing how
easily they could be overthrown.

[Psalms 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 53:6</span></span>

Oh that the salvation of Israel ... - The only change here from [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md) is that the word אלהים 'Elohiym,
God, is substituted for "Jehovah," Lord, and that the word rendered
"salvation" is here in the plural. On the supposition that the psalm was
adapted to a state of things when the city had been besieged, and the
enemy discomfited, this language would express the deep and earnest
desire of the people that the Lord would grant deliverance. Perhaps it
may be supposed, also, that at the time of such a siege, and while the
Lord interposed to save them from the siege, it was also true that there
was some general danger hanging over the people; that even the nation
might be described as in some sense "captive;" or that some portions of
the land were subject to a foreign power. The desire expressed is, that
the deliverance might be complete, and that the whole land might be
brought to the possession of liberty, and be rescued from all foreign
domination. That time, when it should arrive, would be the occasion of
universal rejoicing.
