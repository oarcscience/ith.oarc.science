### [Psalms Chapter 102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 102:0</span></span>

This psalm purports, in the title, to be a "Prayer of the afflicted,
when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord."
It is a prayer, made up of earnest supplications, as of one who was in
great affliction, whether he refers to his own individual sorrows, or
whether he speaks as one of the people. The word "afflicted," means here
a suffering one; one who is in trouble. The word is in the singular
number, and is one which is often applied to a person who is in trouble
- whatever may be the nature of that trouble. The word rendered
"overwhelmed" means properly to cover as with a garment; to clothe; and
then, to be covered with darkness, affliction, grief, [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md). This is the meaning here. It
denotes a state where the soul was enshrouded in gloom and sorrow. The
word rendered "complaint," means properly meditation; then, moaning;
then, the expression of sorrow. It does not necessarily mean, as the
word does with us, "finding fault," or expressing dissatisfaction, but
it rather denotes that deep sorrow which finds utterance in low and
plaintive sounds; not in boisterous and loud outcry, but in subdued
notes - in sounds uttered not because one wishes to complain, but
because the sorrow is such that it will find vent. Compare [Sa1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016.md); [Kg1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027.md); [Job
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#013.md); [Job
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md); [Job
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md); [Job
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004.md); [Psa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002.md); [Psa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001) (Hebrew.md).

On what occasion, or by whom, this psalm was composed, it is not
possible now to ascertain. Hengstenberg and Prof. Alexander suppose that
it was by David. It seems more probable, however, from [Psa
102:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), that it was in the time of
the captivity, and was in view of the troubles of that long and weary
exile, and that the psalmist speaks not of individual and personal
troubles, but speaks as one of the people - as one in exile with others
who had been long held in captivity, and who sighed for deliverance, and
for a restoration to their native land. In the midst of these troubles,
which are so tenderly described in the first eleven verses, he saw
encouraging evidences that the Lord was about to manifest his mercy, and
to restore the people to their native land; and he pleads most earnestly
with God, on the ground that he was faithful and unchanging, that he
would thus interpose and accomplish the earnest desire of his afflicted
people. The "language," indeed, in the psalm, is that of an individual,
and the author of the psalm speaks of his own personal sorrows, but it
may be as one among many who were equally crushed and overwhelmed, so
that the language used to represent his sorrow may describe the sorrows
experienced by others in the same circumstances. Beyond all question,
the language used in the psalm would express the feelings of many a
pious Hebrew in the time of the exile, the sorrow - the sadness - the
cherished hopes - the prayers - of many a one in that prolonged and
painful captivity.

The psalm may be divided into three parts:

I. A description of the sorrows of the author of the psalm, as
representative of the condition and feelings of the exiles, [Psa
102:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md). In this, the language of
lamentation and complaint predominates.

II\. The grounds of hope - the indications of deliverance - the
evidences that God was about to show favor to his people, and to restore
them to their own country - that the time, the set time, to favor Zion
was about to come, [Psa 102:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md).

III\. The confidence of the psalmist in God, on the ground of his
unchangeableness: on the fact that God is always the same; that his
promises must be sure; that his purposes must be accomplished; that the
very heavens and the earth would change - that the skies would grow old
like a garment and pass away - but that God did not, would not change.
All that he had spoken must be true; all that he had purposed must be
accomplished; all that he had promised must come to pass, [Psa
102:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

Hear my prayer, O Lord - The prayer which I offer in view of my personal
trials; the prayer which I offer as one of an afflicted people. Compare
[Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md); [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md); [Psa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md).

And let my cry come unto thee - My prayer, accompanied with an outward
expression of my earnestness. It was not a silent, or a mental prayer;
it was a loud and earnest cry. [Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md); [Psa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md), [Psa
18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md); [Psa
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002.md); [Psa
72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md); [Job
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md); [Job
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 102:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 102:2</span></span>

Hide not thy face from me - The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render
this, "Do not turn away thy face from me." The sense is essentially the
same. The prayer is, that God would not refuse to look graciously upon
him; that he would turn his attention to him; that he would regard his
supplications. See the notes at [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md); compare [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md); [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md); [Job
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024.md); [Job
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md); [Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017.md).

In the day when I am in trouble - When sorrows come upon me; when I need
thy gracious help. Literally, "When there is distress to me."

Incline thine ear unto me - See [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md), note; [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md), note; compare [Psa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md); [Psa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001.md); [Psa
86:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#006.md); [Psa
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012.md).

In the day when I call, answer me speedily - Grant at once my requests;
give me immediate evidence that my prayer is heard. The psalmist
believed in an immediate answer to prayer. He often had evidence that
his prayer was answered at once; his mind became calm; he had comfort
and peace; he obtained the blessing which he earnestly sought. No one
can doubt that prayer may be answered at once; no one who prays can fail
to find such answers in his own case, in his peace, his calmness, his
joy. In multitudes of cases blessings are granted in such a way that
there can be no doubt that they have come in answer to prayer. Compare
the notes at [Dan 9:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 102:3</span></span>

For my days are consumed like smoke - Margin, "into smoke." Literally,
"in smoke." That is, They vanish as smoke; they pass away and become
nothing; they are spent in affliction, and seem to accomplish nothing.
The idea is, that in his affliction he seemed to accomplish none of the
ends of life. His life seemed to be wasted. This is often the feeling in
trial: and yet in trial a man may be more useful, he may do more to
accomplish the real ends of life, he may do more to illustrate the power
and excellence of religion, than he ever did in the days of prosperity.

And my bones are burned as an hearth - Or rather, as faggots or fuel.
Literally, "They are burned as a burning." The idea is, that in his
troubles, his very bones, the most solid and substantial part of
himself, seemed to be consumed and to waste away. See the notes at [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 102:4</span></span>

My heart is smitten - Broken; crushed with grief. We now speak of "a
broken heart." Even death is often caused by such excessive sorrow as to
crush and break the heart.

And withered like grass - It is dried up as grass is by drought, or as
when it is cut down. It loses its support; and having no strength of its
own, it dies.

So that I forget to eat my bread - I am so absorbed in my trials; they
so entirely engross my attention, that I think of nothing else, not even
of those things which are necessary to the support of life. Grief has
the effect of taking away the appetite, but this does not seem to be the
idea here. It is that of such a complete absorption in trouble that
everything else is forgotten.

[Psalms 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 102:5</span></span>

By reason of the voice of my groaning - By suffering and trouble, so
great as to produce groaning, my flesh is wasted away.

My bones cleave to my skin - Margin, "flesh." The Hebrew word means
"flesh." The effect described is that of a wasting away or an emaciation
of flesh from deep distress, so that the bones became prominent, and had
nothing to hide them from view; so that they seemed to adhere fast to
the flesh itself. See the notes at [Job
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 102:6</span></span>

I am like a pelican of the wilderness - A bird in the midst of
desolation becomes a striking image of loneliness and distress. The word
rendered "pelican" - קאת qâ'ath - is supposed to have been a name given
to the pelican from the idea of vomiting, as it "vomits the shells and
other substances which it has too voraciously swallowed." The word
occurs in the following places, where it is rendered as here "pelican:"
[Lev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018.md); [Deu
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#017.md); and in [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md), where it is rendered
"cormorant." The following description, taken from the "Land and the
Book," vol. i. p. 403, by Dr. Thomson, will illustrate this passage.
Speaking of the outlet of the Huleh, and the region of the exit of the
Jordan from that lake in its course toward the sea of Tiberias, he says,
"Here only have I seen the pelican of the wilderness, as David calls it.
I once had one of them shot just below this place, and, as it was merely
wounded in the wing, I had a good opportunity to study its character. It
was certainly the most sombre, austere bird I ever saw. It gave one the
blues merely to look at it. David could find no more expressive type of
solitude and melancholy by which to illustrate his own sad state. It
seemed as large as a half-grown donkey, and when fairly settled on its
stout legs, it looked like one. The pelican is never seen but in these
unfrequented solitudes, and to this agree all the references to it in
the Bible."

I am like an owl of the desert - The owl is a well-known bird which
dwells in solitudes and old ruins, and which becomes, alike by its
seeking such places of abode, by its appearance, and by its doleful cry,
the very emblem of desolation.

[Psalms 102:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 102:7</span></span>

I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house-top - That is, I am
"sleepless;" trouble drives sleep from my eyes, and I am kept awake at
night - a common effect of grief. The following remarks, copied from the
"Land and the Book" (i. 54, 55), will furnish all the illustration
needful of this verse. "They are a tame, troublesome, and impertinent
generation, and nestle just where you don't want them. They stop up your
stove and waterpipes with their rubbish, build in the windows and under
the beams of the roof, and would stuff your hat full of stubble in half
a day if they found it hanging in a place to suit them ... . When one of
them has lost its mate - a matter of everyday occurrence - he will sit
on the house-top alone, and lament by the hour his sad bereavement."

[Psalms 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 102:8</span></span>

Mine enemies reproach me all the day - Continually. They reproach me as
one of thy people; or, I bear reproaches in common with others, and it
becomes to me a personal matter, so entirely are my feelings and
interests identified with those of thy people. Perhaps there were also,
mingled with this, personal reproaches and calumnies.

And they that are mad against me - Angry; excited even to madness.

Are sworn against me - literally, "swear by me," or against me. The
meaning is, that they have conspired together under the solemnity of an
oath to do me harm. It is not the wrath of an individual that I am to
meet, but the combined wrath of those who act under the solemnities of
an oath. Compare [Act 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 102:9</span></span>

For I have eaten ashes like bread - I have seated myself in ashes in my
grief (compare [Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md); [Job
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md); [Isa
58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005.md); [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md); [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md); [Dan
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003.md); [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021).md); and ashes have become, as it
were, my food. The ashes in which he sat had been mingled with his food.

And mingled my drink with weeping - Tears have fallen into the cup from
which I drank, and have become a part of my drink. The idea is, that he
had shed copious tears; and that even when he took his food, there was
no respite to his grief.

[Psalms 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 102:10</span></span>

Because of thine indignation and thy wrath - Hebrew, "From the face of
thine indignation," etc. That is - he regarded all his sufferings as
proof of the indignation and wrath of God against him. See [Psa
90:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#007.md).

For thou hast lifted me up - In former times. Thou hadst given me
prosperity; thou hadst given me an elevated and honorable place among
men.

And cast me down - Thou hast brought me into a low condition, and I feel
it all the more from the fact that I had enjoyed prosperity. Compare the
notes at [Psa 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007.md). The passage,
however, is susceptible of another interpretation: "Thou hast lifted me
up, and cast me away." That is, Thou hast lifted me from the ground as a
storm or tempest takes up a light thing, and hast whirled me away. This
idea occurs in [Isa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018.md). See the
notes at that passage. The former, however, seems to me to be the more
correct interpretation.

[Psalms 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 102:11</span></span>

My days are like a shadow that declineth - The shadow made by the gnomon
on a sun-dial, which marks the hours as they pass. See [Kg2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#010.md). The idea is that the shadow
made by the descending sun was about to disappear altogether. It had
become less distinct and clear, and it would soon vanish. It would seem
from this, that the dial was so made that the shadow indicating the hour
ascended when the sun ascended, and declined when the sun went down. See
the notes at [Isa 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#008.md).

And I am withered like grass - See the notes at [Psa
102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever - Though my condition has been
changed, though I have been cast down from an exalted position, though
kingdoms rise and fall, yet thou art unchanged. Thy purposes will abide.
Thy promises will be fulfilled. Thy character is the same. As thou hast
been the hearer of prayer in past times, so thou art now. As thou hast
interposed in behalf of thy people in other ages, so thou wilt now. As
thy people in affliction have been permitted to come to thee, so they
may come to thee now. The psalmist here brings to his own mind, as an
encouragement in trouble, as we may at all times, the fact that God is
an unchanging God; that he always lives; that he is ever the same. We
could have no ground of hope if God changed; if he formed purposes only
to abandon them; if he made promises only to disregard them; if today he
were a Being of mercy and goodness, and tomorrow would be merely a Being
of justice and wrath. This argument is enlarged upon in [Psa
102:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md).

And thy remembrance unto all generations - Thy memory; or, the
remembrance of thee. My days are like a shadow. I shall pass away, and
be forgotten. No one will recollect me; no one will feel any interest in
remembering that I have ever lived (see the notes at [Psa
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012).md). But while one knows that this
must be so in regard to himself and to all other people - that he and
they are alike to be forgotten - he may also feel that there is One who
will never be forgotten. God will never pass away. He will be always the
same. All the hopes of the church - of the world - are based on this. It
is not on man - on any one individual - on any number of people - for
they will all alike pass away and be forgotten; but one generation of
people after another, to the end of time, may call on God, and find him
an ever-living, an unchanged and unchangeable protector and friend.

[Psalms 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 102:13</span></span>

Thou shalt arise - Thou wilt come forth - as if God had been inattentive
or inactive.

And have mercy upon Zion - That is, Upon Jerusalem - represented as in a
state of desolation. God would at length pity her, and interpose in her
behalf.

For the time to favor her - Implying that there was an appointed time to
favor her, or to bring her troubles to an end.

Yea, the set time is come - The word used here - מועד mô‛êd - means
properly an appointed season - a designated moment. It refers to some
purpose or appointment in regard to anything that is to be done, as in
[Sa1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md), [Sa1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011.md); [Sa2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005.md); [Gen
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#021.md); or to a fixed period, as when
certain things are to be done, certain festivals to be held regularly at
a certain season of the year, [Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md); [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md); [Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md); [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md); [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md), [Lev
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md),[Lev
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#037.md), [Lev
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#044.md). Here it means that there was
some period fixed in the Divine Mind when this was to occur, or a
definite time when it had been predicted or promised that it would
occur. The language is such as would be applicable to the captivity in
Babylon, concerning which there was a promise that it should continue
but seventy years. If the psalm refers to that, then the meaning is that
there were indications in the course of events that that period was
about to arrive. Compare the notes at [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md). What those indications were in
this case, the psalmist immediately states, [Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md). It may be remarked here, that
there are usually some previous intimations or indications of what God
is about to do. "Coming events cast their shadows before." Even the
divine purposes are accomplished usually in connection with human
agency, and in the regular course of events; and it is frequently
possible to anticipate that God is about to appear for the fulfillment
of his promises. So it was in the coming of the Saviour. So it was in
the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. So it is when God is about
to revive religion in a church. So it is, and will be, in regard to the
conversion of the world.

[Psalms 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 102:14</span></span>

For thy servants take pleasure in her stones - Those who profess to be
thy servants; thy friends. This was the "evidence" to the mind of the
psalmist that God was about to visit his people, and to rebuild
Jerusalem. It was an "awakened interest" among the professed people of
God, leading them to manifest their love for Zion, and for all that
pertained to her - a love for the very stones that lay in
undistinguished heaps where the city once stood - the piles of rubbish
where the walls and dwellings had once been. The people of God in their
captivity began to look with strong interest on these very ruins, and
with an earnest wish that from these ruins the city may again arise, and
the walls be rebuilt.

And favor the dust thereof - literally, pity - or, show compassion for.
They no longer look with indifference on these ruins of Zion. They look
with a tender heart on the very dust of those ruins. They feel that a
wrong has been done to Zion; they ardently desire its restoration to its
former splendor and glory. They long for a return to it as to their
home. They are weary with their captivity, and they are anxiously
waiting for the time when they may revisit their native land. This would
seem to refer to an awakened interest on the subject, caused perhaps in
part by the fact that it could be ascertained (see [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md) that the period of the captivity
was about to end, and partly by an influence on their hearts from on
high, awakening in them a deeper love for Zion - a revival of pure
religion. The practical truth taught here is, that an indication of a
coming revival of religion is often manifested by the increased
attention to the subject among its professed friends; by the desire in
their hearts that it may be so; by tenderness, pity, compassion among
them in view of abounding desolations, the coldness of the church, and
the prevalence of iniquity; by their looking with interest on that which
had before been neglected, like shapeless ruins - the prayer-meeting,
the communion, the sanctuary; by a conscious returning love in their
hearts for all that pertains to religion, however unimportant it may be
in the eyes of the world, or however it may be despised. A surrounding
world would look with unconcern on the ruins of Jerusalem; a friend of
God, in whose heart religion was revived, would look with the most
tender concern even on that rubbish, and those ruins. So it is in a
revival of religion, when God is about to visit his church in mercy.
Everything in regard to the church becomes an object of deep interest.

[Psalms 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 102:15</span></span>

So the heathen - The nations. That is, The surrounding people, who hear
what thou hast done for thy people, will see the evidence that thou art
God, and learn to love and worship thee.

Shall fear the name of the Lord - Shall reverence and honor thee.

And all the kings of the earth thy glory - The sovereigns of the earth
will be especially affected and impressed with thy majesty. If this
refers to the return from the captivity at Babylon, then it means that
that event would be particularly suited to impress the minds of the
rulers of the world, as showing that God had all nations under his
control; that he could deliver a captive people from the grasp of the
mighty; that he was the friend of those who worshipped him, and that he
would frown on oppression and wrong.

[Psalms 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 102:16</span></span>

When the Lord shall build up Zion - The Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate,
and Luther, vender this, "Because the Lord hath built up Zion." This
also is the most natural and correct translation of the Hebrew. The
reference, however, may be to the future. The psalmist may throw himself
into the future, and - standing there - he may describe things as they
will appear then - as already done.

He shall appear in his glory - The idea is that the building up of Zion
would be an occasion in which God would manifest his glory. In reference
to the restoration of his people from bondage; in rebuilding Zion, then
in ruins; in restoring the splendor of the place where he had been so
long worshipped, he would display his true character as a God of glory,
truth, power, and goodness. As applied to the church in general, this
would mean that when God comes to revive religion, to visit his people,
to recover them from their backslidings, to convert and save sinners, he
appears in his appropriate character as the God of his people - as a
glorious God. Then the perfections of his nature are most illustriously
displayed; then he appears in his true character, as a God of mercy,
grace, and salvation. There is no scene on earth where the character of
God is more gloriously exhibited than in a revival of true religion.

[Psalms 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 102:17</span></span>

He will regard the prayer - literally, "He looks upon," or "he 'turns
himself' to their prayer." He does not any longer seem to turn away from
them and disregard them. He shows by thus building up Zion that he does
regard prayer; that he hears the supplications of his people. There is
no higher proof that prayer is heard than that which is often furnished
in a revival of pure religion. All such revivals, like that on the day
of Pentecost ([Act 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001) ff.md), are
usually preceded, as that was [Act
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md), by special prayer; in those
revivals there are often most manifest and clear answers to prayer for
the conversion of individuals; to prayer for a blessing on a preached
gospel; to prayer for particular relatives and friends.

Of the destitute - literally, "of the poor." The word - ערער ‛ar‛âr -
occurs only here and in [Jer 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md),
where it is rendered "heath:" "He shall be like the 'heath' in the
desert." The word, according to its etymology, means "naked;" then,
poor, stripped of everything, impoverished, wholly destitute. It would
thus be eminently applicable to the poor exiles in Babylon; it is as
applicable to sinners pleading with God, and to the people of God
themselves, destitute of everything like self-righteousness, and feeling
that they have nothing in themselves, but that they are wholly dependent
on the mercy of God. Compare [Rev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md).

And not despise their prayer - Not treat it with contempt; not pass it
by unheard. This is stated as one of the reasons why the nations would
be struck with awe - that God, the infinite God, would hear the prayers
of those who were so poor, so powerless, so friendless. There is, in
fact, nothing more suited to excite wonder than that God does hear the
prayer of poor, lost, sinful man.

[Psalms 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 102:18</span></span>

This shall be written for the generation to come - It shall be recorded
for the instruction and encouragement of future ages. The fact that God
has heard the prayer of his people in a time of trial shall be so
recorded and remembered that it may be referred to in similar
circumstances in all time to come, for he is an unchanging God. What he
has done now, he will always be willing to do hereafter.

And the people which shall be created - Future generations. Each
successive generation is in fact a new "creation;" each individual is
also; for the essential idea in creation is that of bringing something
into existence where there was nothing before. There is a "beginning" of
existence in every human being. Man is not in any proper sense a
"development" from former being, nor is his life merely a "continuance"
of something which existed before.

Shall praise the Lord - Shall praise the Lord for what he has now done;
shall learn, from the great principles now illustrated in regard to his
administration, to praise him.

[Psalms 102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 102:19</span></span>

For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary - From his high
and holy dwelling-place, in heaven. The word here rendered "looked
down," means, in Kal, to lay upon or over; then, in Niphil, to lie out
over anything, to project; and then, to bend forward. It then means to
bend or incline forward with an intention to look at anything, as from a
window, [Gen 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008.md). Compare [Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md). See also [Psa
85:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#012.md), note; [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md), note.

From heaven did the Lord behold the earth - Did he look abroad over all
the world.

[Psalms 102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 102:20</span></span>

To hear the groaning of the prisoner - Meaning here, probably, the
captives in Babylon; those who were held as prisoners there, and who
were subjected to such hardships in their long captivity. See the notes
at [Psa 79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md).

To loose those that are appointed to death - Margin, as in Hebrew, "the
children of death." Compare the notes at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). This may mean either those who
were sentenced to death; those who were sick and ready to die; or those
who, in their captivity, were in such a state of privation and suffering
that death appeared inevitable. The word rendered "loose" means,
properly, to "open," applied to the mouth, for eating, [Eze
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#002.md); or in song, [Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md); or for speaking, [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md); - or the ear, [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md); or the hand, [Deu
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#008.md); or the gates of a city, a door,
etc., [Deu 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#011.md). Them it means to set
free, as by opening the doors of a prison, [Isa
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017.md); [Job
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014.md). Here it means to "set free," to
deliver. Compare [Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 102:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 102:21</span></span>

To declare the name of the Lord in Zion ... - That his name might be
declared in Zion, or that his praise might be set up in Jerusalem again.
That is, that his people might be returned there, and his praise be
celebrated again in the holy city.

[Psalms 102:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 102:22</span></span>

When the people are gathered together - When they shall be brought from
their dispersion in distant lands; when they shall assemble again in the
city of their fathers, and when public worship shall be celebrated there
as in former ages.

And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord - The Septuagint and the Latin
Vulgate render this, "kings." The reference must be to the time when
those of other lands - kings and their people - would be converted to
the true religion; when the Gentiles as well as the Jews, then one
undistinguished people, would be brought to the knowledge of the true
God, and would unite in his worship. See the notes at Isa. 60. All of
all lands, will yet praise the Lord "as if" they were one great
congregation, assembled in one place. Thus, though separate, they will
with united feeling recount the mercy and goodness of God to his people
in past times.

[Psalms 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 102:23</span></span>

He weakened my strength in the way - Margin, as in Hebrew, "afflicted."
The idea is, that God had taken his strength away; he had weakened him -
humbled him - brought him low by sorrow. The word "way" refers to the
course which he was pursuing. In his journey of life God had thus
afflicted - humbled - prostrated him. The psalmist here turns from the
exulting view which he had of the future [Psa
102:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021.md), and resumes his complaint -
the remembrance of his troubles and sorrows [Psa
102:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md). He speaks, doubtless, in the
name of his people, and describes troubles which were common to them
all. Perhaps the allusion to his troubles here may be designed, as such
a recollection should do, to heighten his sense of the goodness and
mercy of God in the anticipated blessings of the future.

He shortened my days - Compare [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md); [Psa
89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045.md). That is, He seemed to be about
to cut me off from life, and to bring me to the grave. The psalmist felt
so confident that he would die - that he could not endure these
troubles, but must sink under them, that he spoke as if it were already
done. Compare [Psa 6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 102:24</span></span>

I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days - This was
the burden of my prayer, for this I earnestly pleaded. See [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009.md); [Isa
38:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md), [Isa
38:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md). The word used here means "to
cause to ascend or go up" and the expression might have been translated,
"Cause me not to ascend." The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate render
it, "Call me not away." Dr. Horsley," Carry me not off." In the word
there may be an allusion - an obscure one, it is to be admitted - to the
idea that the soul ascends to God when the body dies. The common idea in
the Old Testament is that it would descend to the regions of the
departed spirits - to Sheol. It is plain, however, that there was
another idea - that the soul would ascend at once to God when death
occurred. Compare [Ecc 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md); [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). The word rendered "in the midst"
means properly in the half; as if life were divided into two portions.
Compare [Psa 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md).

Thy years are throughout all generations - Thou dost not die; thou art
ever the same, though the generations of people are cut off. This seems
to have been said here for two reasons:

\(1\) As a ground of consolation, that God was ever the same; that
whatever might happen to people, to the psalmist himself, or to any
other man, God was unchanged, and that his great plans would be carried
forward and accomplished;

\(2\) As a reason for the prayer. God was eternal. He had an immortal
existence. He could not die. He knew, in its perfection, the blessedness
of "life" - life as such; life continued; life unending. The psalmist
appeals to what God himself enjoyed - as a reason why life - so great a
blessing - should be granted to him a little longer. By all that there
was of blessedness in the life of God, the psalmist prays that that
which was in itself - even in the case of God - so valuable, might yet a
little longer be continued to "him."

[Psalms 102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 102:25</span></span>

Of old - See this passage fully explained in the notes at [Heb
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md). In the beginning; at the
first. The phrase used here means literally "to the face;" then,
"before" in the order of time. It means here, long ago; of olden time;
at the beginning. The meaning is, that the years of God had stretched
through all the generations of people, and all the changes which had
occurred upon the earth; that at the very beginning he existed, and that
he would continue to exist to the very close, unchangeably the same.

[Psalms 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 102:28</span></span>

The children of thy servants shall continue - The descendants of those
that serve and obey thee. This represents the confident expectation of
the psalmist that, as God was unchangeable, all his promises toward his
people would be fulfilled, even though the heavens and the earth should
pass away. God was the same. His word would not fail. His promises were
sure. Compare [Mat 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018.md); [Mat
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md). The word rendered "continue,"
means to dwell, as in a habitation; then, to abide. It stands opposed to
a wandering, nomadic life, and indicates permanency.

And their seed shall be established before thee - The word used here
means properly to stand erect; then to set up, to erect, to place, to
found, to make firm, as a city, [Psa
107:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#036.md); the earth, [Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md); the heavens, [Pro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md). It means here that they would be
firmly and permanently established: that is, the church of God would be
permanent in the earth. It would not be like the generations of people
that pass away. It would not be like the nomadic tribes of the desert
that have no fixed habitation, and that wander from place to place. It
would not be even like the heavens that might put on new forms, or
wholly pass away: it would be as enduring and changeless as God himself;
it would, in its proper form, endure forever. As God is eternal and
unchangeable, so would the safety and welfare of his people be.
