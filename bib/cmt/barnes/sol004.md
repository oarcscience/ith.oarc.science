### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 4:0</span></span>

The king in a lyric song of five stanzas commends the beauty of the
bride:

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 4:1</span></span>

Thou hast doves' eyes ... - Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil. So
also in [Sol 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003); [Sol
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#007); [Isa
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002), "veil" is better than "locks."

That appear from ... - Or, "that couch upon Mount Gilead." The point of
comparison seems to be the multitudinousness of the flocks seen browsing
on the verdant slopes of the rich pasture-lands [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 4:2</span></span>

Whereof ... - Or, "all of them are equal pairs, and none is bereft among
them," i. e., none has lost her mate. The points of comparison in this
simile are of course brilliant whiteness, regularity, and completeness
of number.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 4:3</span></span>

Thy speech is comely - Perhaps, "thy mouth," i. e., the organ of speech.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 4:4</span></span>

The "tower of David" may be that mentioned in [Neh
3:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025); [Mic
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008). For the custom of hanging shields
and other weapons in and upon buildings suited for the purpose, see [Eze
27:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 4:7</span></span>

Section 4:7-5:1: The king meeting the bride in the evening of the same
day, expresses once more his love and admiration in the sweetest and
tenderest terms and figures. He calls her now "bride" (spouse, [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008)) for the first time, to mark it as
the hour of their espousals, and "sister-bride" (spouse, [Sol
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009), [Sol
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012); [Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001)), to express the likeness of
thought and disposition which henceforth unites them. At the same time
he invites her to leave for his sake her birthplace and its mountain
neighborhood, and live henceforth for him alone.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 4:8</span></span>

The order and collocation of words in the Hebrew is grand and
significant. With me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon thou
shalt come, shalt look around (or wander forth) from the height
(literally "head") of Amana, from the height of Shenir and Hermon, from
dens of lions, from mountain-haunts of leopards. It is evidently a
solemn invitation from the king in the sense of [Psa
45:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010). Four peaks in the same
mountain-system are here named as a poetical periphrasis for northern
Palestine, the region in which is situated the native home of the bride.

\(1\) Amana (or Abana, [Kg2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012)),
that part of the Anti-libanus which overlooks Damascus.

\(2\) Shenir or Senir, another peak of the same range (according to [Deu
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009), the Amorite name for Hermon, but
spoken of here and in [Ch1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023) as
distinct from it).

\(3\) Hermon, the celebrated mountain which forms the culminating point
of the Anti-libanus, on the northeastern border of the holy land.

\(4\) Lebanon, properly the western range overlooking the Mediterranean,
but here used as a common designation for the whole mountain system.

Leopards are still not unfrequently seen there, but the lion has long
since disappeared.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 4:9</span></span>

The similes employed refer to the graces of adornment, speech, and
gesture, as expressions of inward character and sentiment.

[Sol 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009)

With one of thine eyes - Rather, with one look of thine.

[Sol 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011)

Honeycomb - literally, Thy lips distill a dropping (of pure honey).
Compare the marginal references.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 4:12</span></span>

The loveliness and purity of the bride are now set forth under the image
of a paradise or garden fast barred against intruders, filled with
rarest plants of excellent fragrance, and watered by abundant streams.
Compare [Pro 5:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015).

[Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012)

A fountain sealed - i. e., A well-spring covered with a stone [Gen
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003), and sealed with "the king's own
signet" ([Dan 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017); compare [Mat
27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066)).

[Sol 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013)

Orchard - This is the renderlng here and in [Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005) of "pardes" (see [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008) note). The pomegranate was for the
Jews a sacred fruit, and a characteristic product of the land of promise
(compare [Exo 28:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#033); [Num
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#005); [Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008); [Kg1
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#018), [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020)). It is frequently mentioned in
the Song, and always in connection with the bride. It abounds to this
day in the ravines of the Lebanon.

Camphire - Cyprus. See [Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014) note.

[Sol 4:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013)

Seven kinds of spices (some of them with Indian names, e. g. aloes,
spikenard, saffron) are enumerated as found in this symbolic garden.
They are for the most part pure exotics which have formed for countless
ages articles of commerce in the East, and were brought at that time in
Solomon's ships from southern Arabia, the great Indian Peninsula, and
perhaps the islands of the Indian Archipelago. The picture here is best
regarded as a purely ideal one, having no corresponding reality but in
the bride herself. The beauties and attractions of both north and south
- of Lebanon with its streams of sparkling water and fresh mountain air,
of Engedi with its tropical climate and henna plantations, of the
spice-groves of Arabia Felix, and of the rarest products of the distant
mysterious Ophir - all combine to furnish one glorious representation,
"Thou art all fair!"

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 4:16</span></span>

The bride's brief reply, declaring her affection for the king and
willingness to belong to him.
