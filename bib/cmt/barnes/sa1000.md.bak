Introduction to Samuel

The double name of these Books, the first and second book of samuel , as
they are called in the printed Hebrew Bible, and the first and second
book of kings, as they are called in the Vulgate, well marks the two
principal features which characterize them. They contain the record of
the life and ministry of samuel, the great prophet and judge of Israel,
and they also contain the record of the rise of the kingdom of Israel.
If again the Books of Samuel are taken as forming one history with the
Books of Kings (the present line of division between 2 Samuel and 1
Kings being an arbitrary one), then the division into four Books of
Kings is a natural one. But if these books are looked upon rather as an
isolated history, then the name of Samuel is properly affixed to them,
not only because he stands out as the great figure of that age, but
because his administration of the affairs of Israel was the connecting
link, the transitional passage, from the rule of the judges to the reign
of the kings, distinct from each, but binding the two together.

The important place to be filled by Samuel in the ensuing history is
seen at once in the opening chapters of the book which bears his name.
Further, the fact that Samuel's birth of her that had been barren is
represented in Hannah's song as typical of the triumphs of the Church
and of the Kingdom of Christ, is another indication of the very
distinguished place assigned to Samuel in the economy of the Old
Testament, borne out by the mention of him in such passages as [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md); [Act
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md). Though however, Samuel's
personal greatness is thus apparent, it is no less clearly marked that
his place is one not of absolute but of relative importance. When we
view the history as a whole, the eye does not rest upon Samuel, and stop
there, but is led on to the throne and person of David as typical of the
Kingdom and Person of Christ. An incidental mark of this subordination
may be seen in the fact that the Books of Samuel are really a
continuation of the Book of Ruth; a Book which derived its significance
from its containing a history of David's ancestors and genealogy.
Clearly, therefore, in the mind of the sacred historian, the personal
history of Samuel was only a link to connect DAVID with the Patriarchs,
just as the subsequent history connects David himself with our Lord
JESUS CHRIST.

But a still more remarkable and conclusive proof of the same
subordination may be found in the circumstance, that it is only the
closing years of Saul's reign of which any account whatever is given in
this Book. For after having related a few facts connected with the
beginning of Saul's reign, the historian passes over some 20 or 30 years
[Act 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md) to relate an occurrence in
the last quarter of Saul's reign, God's rejection of Saul from the
kingdom, and His choice of "a man after His own heart" to be king in
Saul's room [Sa1 13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md).

The contents of the Books of Samuel consist mainly of three portions,

\(1\) the history of Samuel's life and judgeship from 1 Sam. 1-12:
inclusive;

\(2\) the history of Saul's reign from 1 Sam. 13:1-15:35;

\(3\) the history of David from [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md) to the end of the second Book;
this latter portion not being completed until [Kg1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#011.md).

The sources from which the narrative is derived, were probably:

\(1\) the Book of Jasher [Sa2 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#018.md);

\(2\) David's Psalms 2 Sam. 22; 23;

\(3\) the Chronicles of king David [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md);

\(4\) the Book of Samuel the Seer;

\(5\) the Book of Nathan the Prophet;

\(6\) the Book of Gad the Seer [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029.md); [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029.md);

\(7\) the national collection of genealogies.

Those sections which give full details of the sayings and doings of
Samuel, are conjectured to be extracted from "the Book of Samuel the
seer" (e. g. i - xii). Those sections which contain narratives in which
Nathan bears a part 2 Sam. 7; 11; 12; 1 Kings 1; 2 may be referred to
the "Book of Nathan the seer." Such passages as 2 Sam. 21; [Sa2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#005.md); 24; etc., are pretty certainly
from the Book of Gad the Seer. We seem to see extracts from the
Chronicles of the kingdom in such passages as [Sa1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md); [Sa1
11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md), [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md); [Sa1
14:47-52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md); [Sa2
2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md); [Sa2
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001.md); [Sa2
5:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md); 8; [Sa2
20:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023.md); [Sa2
21:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#015.md); 23:8-39; while the song of
Hannah [Sa1 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md), the elegy on the
death of Abner [Sa2 3:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033.md), and the
two Psalms 2 Sam. 22; [Sa2 23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md), may
as well as the elegy on Saul and Jonathan, be taken from the Book of
Jasher.

It is difficult to decide when the final arrangement of the Books of
Samuel, in their present shape, was made. The series of historical books
from Judges to the end of 2 Kings is formed on one plan, so that each
book is a part of a connected whole. This would point to the time of
Jeremiah the prophet, as that when the whole historical series from
judges to kings inclusive was woven into one work. In his use of the
work of contemporary writers, the final compiler left out large portions
of the materials before him.

The chief quotations and resemblances from the Books of Samuel in the
New Testament are found in the writings of Luke and Paul. The title THE
CHRIST ("the anointed"), given to the Lord Jesus [Mat
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016.md); [Mat
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md); [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md); [Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026.md); [Joh
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md), [Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041.md); [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md); [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md), is first found in [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); and the other designation of the
Saviour as the SON OF DAVID [Mat 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027.md);
[Mat 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022.md); [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md), [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md); [Mat
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md), is derived from [Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md). In these books are passages
which occur in duplicate elsewhere, chiefly in the Books of Chronicles
and Psalms; and a careful comparison of these duplicate passages throws
great light upon the manner in which the sacred historians used existing
materials, incorporating them word for word, or slightly altering them
for the sake of explanation, as seemed most expedient to them. It
illustrates also the errors and fluctuations of scribes in transcribing
manuscripts, especially in regard to proper names.

For these duplicate passages, and also on the chief quotations from
other books in the Old Testament, consult the marginal references. The
style of the Books of Samuel is clear, simple, and forcible, and the
Hebrew remarkably pure and free from Chaldaisms. The chief difficulties
are the geographical statements of 1 Sam. 9; 10; the very difficult poem
in [Sa2 23:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); and the account of the
mighty men which follows it, 2 Sam. 23:8-39. There are also some
manifest corruptions of the text; but contradictions or disagreements of
any kind in the statements of the Books of Samuel, as compared with each
other, or with the Books of Chronicles, do not exist.

The time included in the history of these books cannot be exactly
defined, from the lack of any systematic chronology in them. But it may
be estimated roughly at about 130 years, made up of the following
subdivisions, the precise length of the first of which is a matter of
conjecture:

Events Years The life of Samuel up to Saul's election to be king [Sa1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md), [Sa1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005.md) 50 Saul's reign [Act
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md) 40 David's reign [Sa2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md) 40 Total 130
