### [Ezra Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 10:1</span></span>

Before the house of God - i. e., in front of the temple, praying toward
it [Kg1 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030.md), [Kg1
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035.md); [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md), and thus in the sight of all the
people who happened at the time to be in the great court.

[Ezra 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 10:2</span></span>

Jehiel was one of those who had taken an idolatrous wife [Ezr
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#026.md); and Shechaniah had therefore
had the evil brought home to him.

[Ezra 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 10:3</span></span>

Let it be done according to the law - i. e., let a formal "bill of
divorcement" be given to each foreign wife, whereby she will be restored
to the condition of an unmarried woman, and be free to marry another
husband (see [Deu 24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001).md). The
facility of divorce among the Jews is well-known. According to many of
the rabbis, a bill of divorcement might he given by the husband for the
most trivial cause. Thus, no legal difficulty stood in the way of
Shechaniah's proposition; and Ezra regarded it as necessary for the
moral and religious welfare of the people.

[Ezra 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 10:6</span></span>

The "chamber of Johanan" was probably one of those attached externally
to the temple (see [Kg1 6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md).
Eliashib was the grandson of Jeshua [Ezr
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), and was high priest under
Nehemiah [Neh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md). He could assign
chambers in the temple to whomever he pleased (see [Neh
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004).md).

[Ezra 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 10:8</span></span>

Separated from the congregation - i. e., "excommunicated" (compare [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Num
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#020), etc..md). The power assigned to
Ezra is stated in [Ezr 7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025.md).

[Ezra 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 10:9</span></span>

It was the ninth month - Or, our December, a time when rain fails
heavily in Palestine: four months, therefore, after Ezra's arrival in
Jerusalem (compare [Ezr 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009).md).

The street - Rather, "the court," the "broad," "spacious, place"
(compare the [Ch2 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#004) note.md).

[Ezra 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 10:15</span></span>

Some translate it: "Nevertheless, Jonathan the son of Asahel and
Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this." The opposition was useless
[Ezr 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#016.md).

[Ezra 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 10:17</span></span>

The business occupied the commission full two months. In some cases, it
may be presumed, they had to summon persons before them who did not wish
to part with their foreign wives; in all, they had to assure themselves
that the wives were foreign; finally, they had in every case where they
decreed a divorce to make out the "writing of divorcement" [Ezr
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003.md).

[Ezra 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 10:18</span></span>

Compare with the list in Ezra 2.

[Ezr 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#019.md)

They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare
the marginal references).

[Ezr 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#044.md)

The guilty persons, it would seem, were 113 in number. They comprised 4
members of the high priest's family, 13 other priests, 10 Levites, and
86 lay Israelites belonging to at least 10 distinct families. The fact
noted in the second clause of the verse must have increased the
difficulity of Ezra's task.
