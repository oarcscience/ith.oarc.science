### [Numbers Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 20:1</span></span>

Num. 20 and Num. 21 narrate the journey of the people from Kadesh round
Mount Seir to the heights of Pisgah, near the Jordan, and the various
incidents connected with that journey (compare [Num
33:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#037).md). This formed the third and
last stage of the progress of Israel from Sinai to Canaan, and took
place in the fortieth year of the Exodus.

The incidents are apparently not narrated in a strictly chronological
order (see [Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).md). The leading
purpose of Num. 20 seems to be to narrate the loss by the people of
their original leaders before their entrance into the land of promise.

Even the whole congregation - This emphatic expression (compare [Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026.md); [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001).md) points to a re-assembling of the
people for the purpose of at last resuming the advance to the promised
land. During the past 38 years the "congregation" had been bracken up.
No doubt round the tabernacle there had continued an organised camp
consisting of the Levites and others, which had been moved from time to
time up and down the country (compare Num. 33:18-36). But the mass of
the people had been scattered over the face of the wilderness of Paran,
and led a nomadic life as best suited the pasturage of the cattle;
trafficking in provisions with surrounding tribes (compare [Deu
2:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md); [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014).md); and availing themselves of the
resources of a district which were in ancient times vastly greater than
they now are.

These natural resources were supplemented, where needful, by miraculous
aid. The whole guidance of Israel through the wilderness is constantly
referred to God's special and immediately superintending care ([Deu
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md) following; [Deu
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md); [Neh
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021.md); [Isa
63:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md); [Amo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010), etc..md).

Yet though God's extraordinary bounty was vouchsafed to them, it is
probable that this period was, among the perishing generation at all
events, one of great religious declension, or even apostasy. To it must
no doubt be referred such passages as [Eze
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#015.md) ff; [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md) following; [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md).

Into the desert of Zin - The northeastern part of the wilderness of
Paran (or, now definitely fixed by Palmer as the southeastern corner of
the desert of Et-Tih, between Akabah and the head of Wady Garaiyeh.) The
place of encampment was no doubt adjacent to the spring of Kadesh.

In the first month - i. e. of the fortieth year of the Exodus.

[Numbers 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 20:2</span></span>

The language of the murmurers is noteworthy. It has the air of a
traditional remonstrance handed down from the last generation. Compare
marginal references.

[Numbers 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 20:8</span></span>

Take the rod - That with which the miracles in Egypt had been performed
([Exo 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#008.md) ff; [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md) ff; [Exo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005) ff, etc..md), and which had been used
on a similar occasion at Rephidim ([Exo
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#005) following.md). This rod, as the
memorial of so many divine interpositions, was naturally laid up in the
tabernacle, and is accordingly [Num
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#009.md) described now as taken by Moses
"from before the Lord."

[Numbers 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 20:11</span></span>

The command [Num 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md) was "Speak ye
unto the rock." The act of smiting, and especially with two strokes,
indicates violent irritation on the part of Moses; as does also his
unseemly mode of addressing the people: "Hear now, ye rebels." The form
too of the question, "must we, etc.," directs the people not, as ought
to have been the case, to God as their deliverer, but to Moses and Aaron
personally. In fact the faithful servant of God, worn out by the
reiterated perversities of the people, breaks down; and in the actual
discharge of his duty as God's representative before Israel, acts
unworthily of the great function entrusted to him. Thus, Moses did not
"sanctify God in the eyes of the children of Israel." Aaron might have
checked the intemperate words and acts of Moses, and did not. Hence, God
punishes both by withdrawing them from their work for Him, and handing
over its accomplishment to another.

[Numbers 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 20:13</span></span>

The water of Meribah - i. e. "Strife." The place is called "Meribah in
Kadesh" [Num 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md), and
"Meribah-Kadesh" [Deu 32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md). to
distinguish it from the "Meribah" of [Exo
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md) ff.

And he was sanctified in them - An allusion doubtless to the name
"Kadesh" (holy), which though not now bestowed, acquired a new
significance from the fact that God here vindicated His own sanctity,
punishing Moses and Aaron who had trespassed against it.

[Numbers 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 20:14</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. It appears from comparing [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md) with [Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038.md), that the host must have
remained in Kadesh some three or four months. No doubt time was required
for re-organization. In order to gain the banks of Jordan by the
shortest route they had to march nearly due east from Kadesh, and pass
through the heart of the Edomite mountains. These are lofty and
precipitous, traversed by two or three narrow defiles. Hence, the
necessity of the request in [Num
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#017.md).

Thy brother - An appeal to the Edomites to remember and renew the old
kindnesses of Jacob and Esau Gen. 33:1-17.

It appears from [Jdg 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#017.md) that a
similar request was addressed to the Moabites.

[Numbers 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 20:16</span></span>

An angel - See [Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md), note; [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md), note. The term is to be
understood as importing generally the supernatural guidance under which
Israel was.

[Numbers 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 20:20</span></span>

The Israelites, without awaiting at Kadesh the return of their
ambassador, commenced their eastward march. At the tidings of their
approach the Edomites mustered their forces to oppose them; and on
crossing the Arabah they found their ascent through the mountains
barred. The notice of this is inserted here to complete the narrative;
but in order of time it comes after the march described in [Num
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md).

[Numbers 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 20:22</span></span>

Mount Hor - The modern Jebel Harun, situated on the eastern side of the
Arabah, and clause to Petra. This striking mountain, rising on a dark
red bare rock, to a height of near 5,000 feet above the Mediterranean,
is remarkable far and near for its two summits, on one of which is still
shown a small square building, crowned with a dome, called the Tomb of
Aaron.

[Numbers 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 20:26</span></span>

The priestly garments, wherewith Moses had invested Aaron [Lev
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#007.md), were put upon Eleazar by way of
solemn transference of Aaron's office to him; compare [Kg1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019.md).
