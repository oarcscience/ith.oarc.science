### [Numbers Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 34:2</span></span>

The land of Canaan - The name Canaan is here restricted to the territory
west of the Jordan.

[Numbers 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 34:3</span></span>

The southern boundary commenced at the Dead Sea. The broad and desolate
valley by which the depressed bed of that sea is protected toward the
south, is called the Ghor. A deep narrow glen enters it at its southwest
corner; it is called Wady-el-Fikreh, and is continued in the same
southwestern direction, under the name of Wady el-Marrah; a wady which
loses itself among the hills belonging to "the wilderness of Zin;" and
Kadesh-barnea (see [Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026) note.md),
which is "in the wilderness of Zin," will be, as the text implies, the
southernmost point of the southern boundary. Thence, if Kadesh be
identical with the present Ain el-Weibeh, westward to the river, or
brook of Egypt, now Wady el-Arish, is a distance of about seventy miles.
In this interval were Hazar-addar and Azmon; the former being perhaps
the general name of a district of Hazerim, or nomad hamlets (see [Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023).md), of which Adder was one: and
Azmon, perhaps to be identified with Kesam, the modern Kasaimeh, a group
of springs situate in the north of one of the gaps in the ridge, and a
short distance west of Ain el-Kudeirat.

(Others consider the boundary line to have followed the Ghor along the
Arabah to the south of the Azazimeh mountains, thence to Gadis round the
southeast of that mountain, and thence to Wady el-Arish.)

[Numbers 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 34:7</span></span>

The northern border. On the "Mount Hor," compare [Num
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md) note. Here the name denotes the
whole western crest of Mount Lebanon, 80 miles in length, commencing
east of Zidon, and terminating with the point immediately above the
entrance of Hamath (compare [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021).md). The extreme point in the
northern border of the land was the city of Zedad (Sadad), about 30
miles east of the entrance of Hamath. Hence, the border turned back
southwestward to Ziphron (Zifran), about 40 miles northeast of Damascus.
Hazar-enan may be conjecturally identified with Ayun ed-Dara, a fountain
situate in the very heart of the great central chain of Antilibanus.

[Numbers 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 34:10</span></span>

Shepham, the first point after Hazar-enan, is unknown. The name Riblah
is by some read Har-bel, i. e., "the Mountain of Bel;" the
Har-baal-Hermon of [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md). No more
striking landmark could be set forth than the summit of Hermon, the
southernmost and by far the loftiest peak of the whole Antilibanus
range, rising to a height of 10,000 feet, and overtopping every other
mountain in the Holy land. Ain, i. e. the fountain, is understood to be
the fountain of the Jordan; and it is in the plain at the southwestern
foot of Hermon that the two most celebrated sources of that river, those
of Daphne and of Paneas, are situate.

The "sea of Chinnereth" is better known by its later name of Gennesaret,
which is supposed to be only a corruption of Chinnereth. The border ran
parallel to this sea, along the line of hill about 10 miles further
east.

[Numbers 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 34:16</span></span>

Of the representatives now selected through Moses beforehand, who were
all princes, i. e. heads of chief families, in their respective tribes
(see [Num 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#002).md), Caleb alone, of the
tribe of Judah, is otherwise known to us (see [Num
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004) ff.md). The order in which the
tribes are named is peculiar to this passage. If they be taken in pairs,
Judah and Simeon, Benjamin and Dan, Manasseh and Ephraim, Zebulun and
Issachar, Asher and Naphtali, the order of the pairs agrees with the
order in which the allotments in the Holy land, taken also in couples,
followed each other in the map from south to north.
