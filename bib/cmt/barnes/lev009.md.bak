### [Leviticus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 9:1</span></span>

[Lev 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

On the eighth day - i. e., on the first day after the week of
consecration.

[Lev 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002.md)

A young calf - A bull calf, which might have been what we should call a
yearling ox.

[Lev 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003.md)

A kid of the goats - A shaggy he-goat. See [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023.md) note.

[Lev 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#006.md)

The glory of the Lord - Compare [Exo
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#007.md).

[Leviticus 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 9:7</span></span>

It is to be remarked that Aaron offers no peace-offering for himself. It
was enough that he should participate in the peace-offerings of the
consecration [Lev 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031.md), and in the two
peace-offerings about to be sacrificed for the people.

His sin-offering was probably regarded not so much as a sacrifice for
his own actual sins as a typical acknowledgment of his sinful nature and
of his future duty to offer for his own sins and those of the People.
See marginal references. "The law maketh men high priests which have
infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the
Son, who is consecrated (in the margin perfected, see [Lev
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#022) note.md) forevermore, [Heb
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md).

[Leviticus 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 9:9</span></span>

Aaron did not act according to the ordinary Law [Lev
4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005.md), [Lev
4:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#016.md), but as Moses had done in the
sin-offering of the consecration ceremony ([Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015.md); compare also [Lev
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#025.md), [Lev
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#030.md), [Lev
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#034).md). The probable reason of this was
that he had not yet been formally introduced as the high priest into the
holy place of the tabernacle.

Brought the blood - They most likely held the basons in which the blood
was received as it ran from the victim, and then handed them to their
father. See [Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md).

[Leviticus 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 9:15</span></span>

In this first complete series of offerings made by the high priest, the
sacrifices take their appointed order; first, the sin-offering to make
atonement; then the burnt-offering, to signify the surrender of the
body, soul and spirit to Yahweh in heaven; and lastly the
peace-offering, to show forth the communion vouchsafed to those who are
justified and sanctified. See [Lev
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md) note.

[Leviticus 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 9:22</span></span>

Aaron having completed the offerings, before he came down from the stage
surrounding the altar on which the priests used to stand to officiate
(see [Exo 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#008).md), turned toward the
people, and blessed them; probably using the form which became the
established one for the priests [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md), and which is still maintained
in the synagogues.

[Leviticus 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 9:23</span></span>

Aaron, having now gone through the cycle of priestly duties connected
with the brass altar, accompanies Moses into the tent of Meeting. It was
reasonable that Moses, as the divinely appointed leader of the nation,
should induct Aaron into the tabernacle.

Blessed the people - This joint blessing of the mediator of the Law and
the high priest was the solemn conclusion of the consecration and
Inauguration. (Compare [Ch2 6:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#003)..md)
According to one tradition, the form used by Moses and Aaron resembled
[Psa 90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017.md). But another form is given
in the Targum of Palestine, "May your offerings be accepted, and may the
Lord dwell among you and forgive you your sins."

[Leviticus 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 9:24</span></span>

The very ancient Jewish tradition has been widely adopted that the
sacred fire of the altar originated in this divine act, and that it was
afterward preserved on the altar of the tabernacle until the dedication
of the temple, when fire again "came down from heaven." [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md). But according to the sacred
narrative the altar-fire had been lighted in a natural way before this
occasion. (Compare [Lev 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#016.md); [Lev
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#010.md), [Lev
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#013.md), etc.; [Exo
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#029)..md) It would therefore seem that
the fire which "came out from before the Lord" manifested itself,
according to the words of [Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md),
not in kindling the fuel on the altar, but in the sudden consuming of
the victim. For the like testimony to the acceptance of a sacrifice, see
[Jdg 13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md); [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038.md); [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md), and probably [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md). The phrase to turn a sacrifice to
ashes, became equivalent to accepting it ([Psa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003), see the margin.md). The fire of the
altar was maintained in accordance with [Lev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013.md).
