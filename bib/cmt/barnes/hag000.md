Introduction to Haggai

Haggai ישׁישׁי yeshı̂yshây, the termination "-ai" is more frequently an
abbreviation of the name of God which enters so largely into Hebrew
names, as indeed we have חגיה chaggı̂yâh, [Ch1
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#030.md). And this occurs not only, when
the first part of the word is a verb, אחסבי 'ăchassebay, יהדי yehedday,
יהמי yı̂hemay, יעני ya‛enay, יעשׂי ya‛ăs'ay, אחזי 'achezay, ישׁמרי
yı̂shemeray, יריבי yerı̂ybay, יאתרי ye'ateray (as Kohler observes p. 2.),
but when it is a noun, as מתני matenay, הדי hı̂dday, אמתי 'ămı̂tay, שׁלמי
shalemay, צלתי tsı̂lletay (coll. מתניה mattaneyâh, and מתניהוּ
mattaneyâhû), שׁמשׁי shı̂meshay, Ezra 4. פעלתי pe‛ulletay [Ch1
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#005.md) perhaps שׁבתי shabbetay, שׁטרי
shı̂ṭeray or again אתי 'ı̂ttay.) is the oldest of the three-fold band, to
whom, after the captivity, the Word of God came, and by whom He
consecrated the beginnings of this new condition of the chosen people.

He gave them these prophets, connecting their spiritual state after
their return with that before the captivity, not leaving them wholly
desolate, nor Himself without witness. He withdrew them about 100 years
after, but some 420 years before Christ came, leaving His people to
yearn the more for Him, of whom all the prophets spoke. Haggai himself
seems to have almost finished his earthly course, before he was called
to be a prophet; and in four months his office was closed. He speaks as
one who had seen the first house in its glory [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md), and so was probably among the
very aged men, who were the links between the first and the last, and
who laid the foundation of the house in tears [Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md). After the first two months
Zechariah first prophesies in the 8th month [Zac
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md).

Haggai resumes at the close of the 9th month and there ends [Hag
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md), [Hag
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md). On the same day in the 11th
month, the series of visions were given to Zechariah [Zac
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007)..md) of his office, Zechariah, in
early youth, was raised up to carry on his message; yet after one brief
prophecy was again silent, until the aged prophet had ended the words
which God gave him. Yet in this brief space he first stirred up the
people in one month to rebuild the temple , prophesied of its glory
through the presence of Christ [Hag
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001.md), yet taught that the presence of
what was holy sanctified not the unholy, [Hag
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md). and closes in Him who, when
heaven and earth shall be shaken, shall abide, and they whom God hath
chosen in Him. [Hag 2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020)..md)

It has been the custom of critics, in whose eyes the prophets were only
poets , to speak of the style of Haggai as "tame, destitute of life and
power," showing "a marked decline in" what they call "prophetic
inspiration." The style of the sacred writers is, of course, conformed
to their mission. prophetic descriptions of the future are but
incidental to the mission of Haggai. Preachers do not speak in poetry,
but set before the people their faults or their duties in vivid earnest
language. Haggai sets before the people vividly their negligence and its
consequences; he arrests their attention by his concise questions; at
one time retorting their excuses [Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md); at another asking them abruptly,
in God's name, to say why their troubles came [Hag
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md).

Or he puts a matter of the law to the priests, that they may draw the
inference, before he does it himself [Hag
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012.md). Or he asks them, what human
hope had they [Hag 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md), before he
tells them of the divine. Or he asks them (what was in their heart), "Is
not this house poor?" [Hag 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md) before
he tells them of the glory in store for it. At one time he uses heaped
and condensed antitheses [Hag 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md), to
set before them one thought; at another he enumerates, one by one, how
the visitation of God fell upon all they had [Hag
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#011.md), so that there seemed to be no
end to it. At another, he uses a conciseness, like John Baptist's cry,
"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," in his repeated [Hag
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005.md). "Set your heart to your ways;"
and then, with the same idiom, "set your heart" [Hag
2:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015.md) namely, to God's ways, what He
had done upon disobedience, what He would do upon obedience. He bids
them work for God, and then he expresses the acceptableness of that work
to God, in the three words [Hag 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008.md),
"And-I-will-take-pleasure in-it and-will-be-glorified." When they set
themselves to obey, he encouraged them with the four words [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md), "I with-you saith the-Lord."
This conciseness must have been still more impressive in his words, as
delivered . We use many words, because our words are weak. Many of us
can remember how the house of lords was hushed, so hear the few low, but
sententious words of the aged general and statesman. But conceive the
suggestive eloquence of those words, as a whole sermon, "Set your-heart
on-your-ways."

Of distant prophecies there are only two [Hag
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md), [Hag
2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021.md), so that the portion to be
compared with the former prophets consists but of at most 7 verses. In
these the language used is of the utmost simplicity. Haggai had only one
message as to the future to convey, and he enforced it by the repeated
use of the same word , that temporal things should be shaken, the
eternal should remain, as Paul sums it up [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md). He, the long-yearned for, the
chosen of God, the signet on His hand, should come; God would fill that
house, so poor in their eyes, with glory, and there would He give peace.
Haggai had an all-containing but very simple message to give from God.
Any ornament of diction would but have impaired and obscured its
meaning. The two or three slight idioms, noticed by one after another,
are, though slight, forcible.

The office of Haggai was mainly to bring about one definite end, which
God, who raised him up and inspired him, accomplished by him. It is in
the light of this great accomplishment of the work entrusted to him on
the verge of man's earthly course, that his power and energy are to be
estimated. The words which are preserved in his book are doubtless (as
indeed was the case as to most of the prophets) the representatives and
embodiment of many like words, by which, during his short office, he
roused the people from their dejection indifference and irreligious
apathy, to the restoration of the public worship of God in the
essentials of the preparatory dispensation.

Great lukewarmness had been shown in the return. The few looked
mournfully to the religious center of Israel, the ruined temple, the
cessation of the daily sacrifice, and, like Daniel [Dan
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md), "confessed" their "sin and the
sin of their people Israel, and presented their supplication before the
Lord their God for the holy mountain of their God." The most part
appear, as now, to have been taken up with their material prosperity,
and, at best, to have become injured to the cessation of their symbolic
worship, connected, as it was, with the declaration of the forgiveness
of their sins. Then too, God connected His declaration of pardon with
certain outward acts: they became indifferent to the cessation of those
acts, because few returned. The indifference was even remarkable among
those, most connected with the altar. Of the 24 1 Chr. 24:3-19. orders
of priests, only 16, 4 orders [Ezr
2:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md). returned; of the Levites,
only 74 individuals [Ezr 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md); while
of those assigned to help them, the Nethinim and the children of
Solomon's servants, there were 392 [Ezr
2:58](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#058.md).

This coldness continued at the return of Ezra. The edict of Artaxerxes
[Ezr 7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013.md), as suggested by Ezra,
was more pious than those appointed to the service of God. In the first
instance, no Levite answered to the invitation [Ezr
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md); on the special urgency and
message of Ezra [Ezr 8:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018.md), "by the
good hand of God upon us they brought us a man of understanding," of the
sons of Levi; some 3 or 4 chief Levites; their sons and brethren; in
all, 38; but of the Nethinim, nearly six times as many, 220 [Ezr
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020.md). These who thought more of
temporal prosperity than of their high spiritual nobility and
destination, had flourished doubtless in that exile as they have in
their present homelessness, as "wanderers among the nations." Haman
calculated apparently on being able to "pay out" of their spoils "ten
thousand talents of silver ([Est 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009.md).
Ahasuerus apparently, in acceding to Haman's proposal, made over to him
the lives and property of the Jews. The silver is given unto thee the
people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. [Est
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#011).md). The Jew's property, was
confiscated with their lives. On the contrary, it was noticed, that the
Jews, when permitted to defend their lives, did not lay their hands on
the prey, which, by the king's decree, was granted to them, with
authority to take the lives of those who should assault them. [Est
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011.md); [Est
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010.md), [Est
9:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#015)..md) some 300,000,000 British
pounds, two-thirds of the annual revenue of the Persian Empire "into the
king's treasuries."

The numbers who had returned with Zerubbabel had been (as had been
foretold of all restorations) only "a remnant." There were 42,360 free
men, with 7,337 male or female slaves [Ezr
2:64-65](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064.md); [Neh
7:66-67](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066.md). In the time of Augustus, it
was no uncommon thing for a person to have 200 slaves (Hor. Sat. i. 9.
11) it is said that very many Romans possessed 10,000 or 20,000 slaves.
Athenaeus vi. p. 272). The whole population which returned was not more
than 212,000, free men and women and children. The proportion of slaves
is about 112, since in their case adults of both sexes were counted. The
enumeration is minute, giving the number of their horses, mules, camels,
asses. . The chief of the fathers however were not poor, since (though
unspeakably short of the wealth, won by David and consecrated to the
future temple) they [Ezr 2:68-69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068.md)
offered freely for the house of God, to set it up in its place, a sum
about 117,100 British pounds of our money. They had, beside, a grant
from Cyrus, which he intended to cover the expenses of the building, the
height and breadth whereof were determined by royal edict [Ezr
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003.md).

The monarch, however, of an eastern empire had, in proportion to its
size, little power over his subordinates or the governors of the
provinces, except by their recall or execution, when their oppressions
or peculations notably exceeded bounds. The returned colony, from the
first, were in fear of the nations, "the peoples of those countries"
[Ezr 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md), their old enemies probably;
and the first service," the altar to offer burnt-offerings thereon," was
probably a service of fear rather than of love, as it is said [Ezr
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003.md), "they set up the altar upon its
bases, for it was in fear upon them from the peoples of the lands, and
they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto the Lord." They hoped
apparently to win the favor of God, that He might, as of old, protect
them against their enemies. However, the work was carried on [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md) "according to the grant that they
had of Cyrus king of Persia" and the foundations of the temple were laid
amidst mixed joy at the carrying on of the work thus far, and sorrow at
its poverty, compared to the first temple [Ezr
3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md).

The hostility of the Samaritans discouraged them. Mixed as the religion
of the Samaritans was - its better element being the corrupt religion of
the ten tribes, its worse the idolatries of the various nations, brought
there in the reign of Esarhaddon - the returned Jews could not accept
their offer to join in their worship, without the certainty of
admitting, with them, the idolatries, for which they had been punished
so severely. For the Samaritans pleaded the identity of the two
religions [Ezr 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002.md), "Let us build with
you, for we serve your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since
the days of Esarhaddon which brought us up hither." But in fact this
mixed worship, in which [Kg2 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033.md)
they feared the Lord and served their own gods, came to this, that [Kg2
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#034.md) "they feared not the Lord,
neither did they after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded
the children of Jacob." For God claims the undivided allegiance of His
creatures "these [Kg2 17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md), feared
the Lord and served their graven images, both their children and their
children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day." But
this worship included some of the most cruel abominations of pagandom,
the sacrifice of their children to their gods [Kg2
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031.md).

The Samaritans, thus rejected, first themselves harassed the Jews in
building, apparently by petty violence, as they did afterward in the
rebuilding of the walls by Nehemiah "The people of the land weakened the
hands of the people of Judah, and wore them out in building." This
failing, they [Ezr 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005.md) "hired
counselors" (doubtless at the Persian court), to "frustrate their
purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, until the reign of Darius
king of Persia." The object of the intrigues was probably to intercept
the supplies, which Cyrus had engaged to bestow, which could readily be
effected in an eastern court without any change of purpose or any
cognizance of Cyrus.

In the next reign of Ahashverosh (i. e., Khshwershe, a title of honor of
Cambyses) [Ezr 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006.md) they wrote
accusations against the Jews, seemingly without any further effect,
since none is mentioned. Perhaps Cambyses, in his expedition to Egypt,
knew more of the Jews, than the Samaritans thought, or he may have
shrunk from changing his father's decree, contrary to the fundamental
principles of Persism, not to alter any decree, which the sovereign
(acting, as he was assumed to do, under the influence of Ormuzd) had
written. Pseudo-Smerdis (who doubtless took the title of honor,
Artachshatr) may, as an impostor, have well been ignorant of Cyrus'
decree, to which no allusion is made [Ezr
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007.md). From him the Samaritans, through
Rehum the chancellor, obtained a decree prohibiting, until further
notice, the rebuilding of the city. The accusers had overreached
themselves, for the ground of their accusation was, the former
rebellions of the city [Ezr 4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012.md),
[Ezr 4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#015.md); the prohibition
accordingly extended only to the city [Ezr
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#019.md), [Ezr
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#021.md), not to the temple.

However, having obtained the decree, they were not scrupulous about its
application, and "made" the Jews "to cease [Ezr
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#023.md) by arm and power," the governor
of the Jews being apparently unable, the governor of the
cis-Euphratensian provinces being unwilling, to help. As this, however,
was, in fact, a perversion of the decree, the Jews were left free to
build, and in the second year of Darius Hystaspis [Ezr
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md), "Haggai, and then Zechariah,
prophesied in the name of the God of Israel" to Zerubbabel, the native
governor, and Joshua the high priest, "and the Jews in Judah and
Jerusalem; and they began to build the house of God in Jerusalem." Force
was no longer used. Those engaged in building appealed to the edict of
Cyrus; the edict was found at Ecbatana [Ezr
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md), and the supplies which Cyrus had
promised, were again ordered. The difficulty was at the commencement.
The people had been cowed perhaps at first by the violence of Rehum and
his companions; but they had acquiesced readily in the illegal
prohibition, and had [Hag 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md) run each
to his own house, some of them to their [Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md) "ceiled houses."

All, employers or employed, were busy on their husbandry. But nothing
flourished. The laborers' wages disappeared, as soon as gained [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md). East and west wind alike brought
disease to their grain; both, as threatened upon disobedience in the law
[Deu 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#022.md). The east wind scorched and
dried it up ; the warm west wind turned the ears yellow and barren; the
hail smote the vines, so that when the unfilled and mutilated clusters
were pressed out, only two-fifths of the hoped-for produce was yielded;
and of the grain, only one half [Hag
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016.md).

In the midst of this, God raised up an earnest preacher of repentance.
Haggai was taught, not to promise anything at the first, but to set
before them, what they had been doing, and what was its result [Hag
2:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005.md). He sets it before them in
detail; tells them that God had so ordered it for their neglect of His
service, and bids them to amend. He bids them quit their accustomed
ways; "go up into the mountain; bring wood; build the house." Conceive
in Christian England, after some potato disease, or
foot-and-mouth-disease (in Scriptural language "a murrain among the
cattle"), a preacher arising and bidding them, consider your ways, and
as the remedy, not to look to any human means, but to do something,
which would please Almighty God; and not preaching only but effecting
what he preached. Yet such was Haggai. He stood among his people, his
existence a witness of the truth of what he said; himself one, who had
lived among the outward splendors of the former temple; a contemporary
of those, who said [Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md), "the
temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are
these;" who had held it to be impossible that Judah should be carried
captive; who had prophesied the restoration of the vessels of God [Jer
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md); [Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md), which had been carried away,
not, as God foretold, after the captivity, but as an earnest that the
fuller captivity should not be [Jer
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md); yet who had himself, according
to the prophecies of the prophets of those days, been carried into
captivity, and was now a part of that restoration which God had
promised.

He stood among them "in gray-haired might," bade them do, what he bade
them, in the name of God, to do; and they did it. When they had set
about the work, he assured them of the presence of God with them [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md). A month later, when they were
seemingly discouraged at its poorness, he promised them in God's name,
that its glory would be greater than that of Solomon's [Hag
2:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md). Three days after, in contrast
with the visitations up to that time, while there was as yet no token of
any change, he promised them in the name of God [Hag
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019.md), "From this day will I bless
you."

He himself apparently saw only the commencement of the work, for his
prophecies lay within the second year of Darius and the temple was not
completed until the sixth [Ezr 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md).
Even the favorable rescript of Darius must have arrived after his last
prophecy, since it was elicited by the inquiry of the governor,
consequent upon the commenced rebuilding [Ezr
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md), only three months before his
office closed [Hag 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015.md); [Hag
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md), [Hag
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#020.md).

While this restoration of the public worship of God in its intregrity
was his main office, yet he also taught by parable [Hag
2:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#010.md) that the presence of what was
outwardly holy did not, in itself, hallow those, among whom it was; but
was itself unhallowed by inward unholiness.

Standing, too, amid the small handful of returned exiles, not,
altogether, more than the inhabitants of Sheffield, he foretold, in
simple all-comprehending words, that central gift of the Gospel [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md), "In this place will I give peace,
saith the Lord." So had David, the sons of Korah, Micah, Isaiah, Ezekiel
prophesied [Psa 72:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md); [Psa
85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md), [Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md); [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md); [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Isa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md); [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md); [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md); [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md); [Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010.md), [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md); [Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012.md); [Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md); [Eze
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md), but the peace was to come, not
then, but in the days of the Messiah. Other times had come, in which the
false prophets had said [Jer 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md);
[Jer 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md); [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md), "Peace, peace, when there was
no peace;" when God had taken away His peace from [Jer
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005.md); "this people." And now, when the
chastisements were fulfilled, when the land lay desolate, when every
house of Jerusalem lay burned with fire [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md) and the "blackness of ashes"
alone "marked where they stood;" when the walls were broken down so
that, even when leave was given to rebuild them, it seemed to their
enemies a vain labor to [Neh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002.md);
"revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish which were burned;" when
[Neh 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md) "the place of their fathers'
sepulchres lay waste, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire;"
when, for their sakes, Zion was [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md) "plowed as a field" and
"Jerusalem was become heaps" - let any one picture to himself the
silver-haired prophet standing, at first, alone, rebuking the people,
first through their governor and the high priest, then the collected
multitude, in words, forceful from their simplicity, and obeyed! And
then let them think whether anything of human or even divine eloquence
was lacking, when the words flew straight like arrows to the heart, and
roused the people to do at once, amid every obstacle, amid every
down-heartedness or outward poverty, that for which God sent them. The
outward ornament of words would have been misplaced, when the object was
to bid a downhearted people, in the name of God, to do a definite work.
Haggai sets before his people cause and effect; that they denied to God
what was His, and that God denied to them what was His to give or to
withhold. His sermon was, in His words whom he foretold; "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be
added unto you." He spoke in the name of God, and was obeyed.

"The Holy Spirit, who spake by the mouth of the prophets, willed that he
by a foreboding name should be called Haggai, i. e., 'festive,'
according to the subject whereof He should speak by his mouth. Yet was
there not another festiveness in the prophet's heart, than the joy which
he had or could have with the people, from the rebuilding of that temple
made with hands, again to be defiled and burned with fire irrecoverably?
Be it that the rebuilding of that temple, which he saw before him, was a
matter of great festive joy; yet not in or for itself, but for Him, the
festive joy of saints and angels and men, Christ; because when the
temple should be rebuilt, the walls also of the city should be rebuilt
and the city again inhabited and the people be united in one, of whom
Christ should be born, fulfilling the truth of the promise made to
Abraham and David and confirmed by an oath. So then we, by aid of the
Holy Spirit, so enter upon what Haggai here speaketh, as not doubting
that he altogether aimeth at Christ. And so may we in some sort be
called or be Haggais, i. e., 'festive,' by contemplating that same,
which because he should contemplate, he was, by a divine foreboding,
called Haggai."
