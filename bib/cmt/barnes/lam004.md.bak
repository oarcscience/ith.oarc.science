### [Lamentations Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 4:0</span></span>

In this poem Lam. 4 the distinctive idea is, that the miseries [Lam
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md) which have befallen Judah are
the punishment of her sin [Lam
4:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md), and will therefore end - when
chastisement has had its proper effect - in her restoration [Lam
4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md).

[Lamentations 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 4:1</span></span>

The stones of the sanctuary - Or, the hallowed stones, literally stones
of holiness, a metaphor for the people themselves. The actual stones of
the temple would not be thus widely thrown about as to be seen
everywhere, but the prophet has already affirmed this of the young
children dying of hunger (compare [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019).md).

[Lamentations 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 4:2</span></span>

The precious sons of Zion - The whole nation was consecrated to God, and
formed "a kingdom of priests" [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md) : in this respect, a type of the
Christian Church [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

Comparable to fine gold - literally, "weighed with" solid gold, and so
equal to their weight in it. With this is contrasted the hollow pitcher
easily broken, and made of materials of no intrinsic value.

[Lamentations 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 4:3</span></span>

Sea monsters - Rather, jackals.

Their young ones - "Their" whelps. The term is applied only to the young
of dogs, lions, and the like.

[Lamentations 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 4:5</span></span>

They that were brought up in scarlet - literally, "those that were
carried upon scarlet;" young children in arms and of the highest birth
now lie on the dirt-heaps of the city.

[Lamentations 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 4:6</span></span>

Rather, "For" the iniquity "of the daughter of my people was greater
than" the sin "of Sodom." The prophet deduces this conclusion from the
greatness of Judah's misery (compare [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md); see also [Luk
13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001).md).

No hands stayed on her - Or, "no hands were round about her." Sodom's
sufferings in dying were brief: there were no starving children, no
mothers cooking their offspring for food.

[Lamentations 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 4:7</span></span>

The Nazarites from their temperance were remarkable for health and
personal beauty, besides being held in religious veneration.

Rubies - Or, corals.

Their polishing was of sapphire - Or, their shape was "a sapphire." The
allusion is no longer to color, but to form. Their shape was exact and
faultless as the cutting of a precious stone.

[Lamentations 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 4:8</span></span>

Their visage ... - Their form (their whole person, see [Sa1
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#014).md)... as in the margin. See [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md).

It is withered, it is become like a stick - Or, It has become dry like a
piece of wood.

[Lamentations 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 4:10</span></span>

Pitiful - i. e. tender-hearted, compassionate. meat is used for food
[Psa 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md). What is here stated
actually occurred during the siege of Jerusalem by Titus.

[Lamentations 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 4:12</span></span>

Though Jerusalem had been several times captured [Kg1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md); [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md); [Kg2
23:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md), yet it had been so strongly
fortified by Uzziah and his successors as to have been made virtually
impregnable. Its present capture by Nebuchadnezzar had cost him a year
and a half's siege.

[Lamentations 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 4:13</span></span>

The blood of the just - Jer. 26:7-24 exhibits priests and prophets as
the prime movers in an attempt to silence the word of God by putting
Jeremiah to death. Compare the margin reference to Matthew.

[Lamentations 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 4:14</span></span>

They have wandered - God's ministers, consecrated to His service,
wandered through the city blinded by the insatiable lust of slaughter.
It was a pollution to touch their garments.

[Lamentations 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 4:15</span></span>

Men cried to these priests, "Away! Unclean! Away! Away! Touch not."
"Unclean" was the cry of the leper whenever he appeared in public: here
it is the warning shout of those who meet the murderers.

When they fled away and wandered - These priests fled away from the
city, but with uncertain steps, not knowing where to find refuge. They
find themselves abhorred abroad as well as at home.

It is quite possible that this verse records a real occurrence, if not
during the siege, at all events during the last years of Zedekiah's
reign.

[Lamentations 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 4:16</span></span>

Literally, The countenance of Yahweh hath scattered them, has driven
these outlawed priests here and there, "and He will no more regard them"
with favor.

[Lamentations 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 4:17</span></span>

A rapid sketch of the last days of the siege and the capture of the
king.

[Lam 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)

Rather, "Still do our eyes waste away looking for our vain help."

In our watching - Or, "on our watchtower."

[Lam 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md)

Or, They hunted "our steps that we could not go out into the streets. To
hunt" means here to lie in ambush, and catch by snares; and the streets
are literally "the wide places," especially at the gates. Toward the end
of the siege the towers erected by the enemy would command these places.

[Lam 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md)

Our persecutors are ... - Our pursuers ([Lam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003) note.md) "were swifter thorn the
eagles of heaven."

They pursued us - Or, they chased us.

Mountains ... wilderness - The route in going from Jerusalem to Jericho
leads first over heights, beginning with the Mount of Olives, and then
descends into the plain of the Ghor.

[Lam 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md)

The breath of our nostrils - Zedekiah is not set before us as a vicious
king, but rather as a man who had not strength enough of character to
stem the evil current of his times. And now that the state was fallen he
was as the very breath of life to the fugitives, who would have no
rallying point without him.

In their pits - The words are metaphorical, suggesting that Zedekiah was
hunted like a wild animal, and driven into the pitfall.

[Lamentations 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 4:21</span></span>

The prophet ends his elegy with the language of Messianic hope. The
earthly king had fallen [Lam 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md); but
Israel cannot really perish. First then Edom, the representative of the
Church's foes, is ironically told to rejoice. Rejoice she did at the
capture of Jerusalem Jer. 49:7-22; but her punishment is quickly to
follow.

[Lam 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022.md)

The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished - literally, Thy
iniquity is ended. This is the result of Judah having borne her
punishment. And as it is not just to punish twice for the same thing,
therefore Jeremiah adds, "He will not send thee again into captivity;"
not meaning that under all circumstances Judah would have immunity from
exile; - for that would depend upon her future conduct: but that her
present guilt being expiated, she would have nothing to fear on its
account.

He will discover thy sins - See the margin. As Edom rejoices when the
Church is chastised, so is the day of the Church's triumph that also on
which the wicked meet with retribution.
