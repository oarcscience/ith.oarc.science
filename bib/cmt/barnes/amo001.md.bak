### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen - "Amos begins by setting
forth his own nothingness, and withal the great grace of his Teacher and
Instructor, the Holy Spirit, referring all to His glory." He, like
David, Peter, Paul, Matthew, was one of "the weak things of the world,
whom God chose to confound the mighty." He was himself a herdsman only
"among herdsmen;" but the words which he spake were not his own. They
were words which he saw, not with eyes of flesh, but "with that vision
wherewith words can be seen, the seer's vision in the mind." They were
"words concerning," or rather "upon Israel," heavy words coming upon the
heavy transgressions of Israel. The Hebrew word "saw" is not of mere
sight, but of a vision given by God. Amos only says that they were "his"
words, in order immediately to add, that they came to him from God, that
he himself was but the human organ through which God spake.

Two years before the earthquake - This earthquake must plainly have been
one of the greatest, since it was vividly in people's memories in the
time of Zechariah, and Amos speaks of it as "the earthquake." The
earthquakes of the east, like that of Lisbon, destroy whole cities. In
one, a little before the birth of our Lord , "some ten thousand were
buried under the ruined houses." This terrific earthquake (for as such
Zechariah describes it) was one of the preludes of that displeasure of
God, which Amos foretold. A warning of two years, and time for
repentance, were given, "before the earthquake" should come, the token
and beginning of a further shaking of both kingdoms, unless they should
repent. In effect, it was the first flash of the lightning which
consumed them.

[Amos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 1:2</span></span>

The Lord will roar - Amos joins on his prophecy to the end of Joel's, in
order at once in its very opening to attest the oneness of their
mission, and to prepare people's minds to see, that his own prophecy was
an expansion of those words, declaring the nearer and coming judgments
of God. Those nearer judgments, however, of which he spake, were but the
preludes of the judgments of the Great Day which Joel foretold, and of
that last terrible voice of Christ, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah," of
whom Jacob prophesies; "He couched, He lay down as a lion, and as a
young lion; who shall raise Him up?" [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md). God is said to "utter His" awful
"voice from Zion and Jerusalem," because there He had set His Name,
there He was present in His Church. It was, as it were, His own place,
which He had hallowed by tokens of His presence, although "the heaven
and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him." In the outset of his
prophecy, Amos warned Israel, that there, not among themselves in their
separated state, God dwelt. Jeremiah, in using these same words toward
Judah, speaks not of Jerusalem, but of heaven; "The Lord shall roar from
on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation" [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md). The prophecy is to the ten
tribes or to the pagan: God speaks out of the Church. He uttereth His
Voice out of Jerusalem, as He saith, "Out of Zion shall go forth, the
law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), "where was the Temple and the
worship of God, to shew that God was not in the cities of Israel, that
is, in Dan and Bethel, where were the golden calves, nor in the royal
cities of Samaria and Jezreel, but in the true religion which was then
in Zion and Jerusalem."

And the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn - Perhaps, with a
feeling for the home which he had loved and left, the prophet's first
thought amid the desolation which he predicts, was toward his own
shepherd-haunts. The well-known Mount Carmel was far in the opposite
direction in the tribe of Asher. Its name is derived from its richness
and fertility, perhaps "a land of vine and olive yards." In Jerome's
time, it was "thickly studded with olives, shrubs and vineyards." "Its
very summit of glad pasturcs."

It is one of the most striking natural features of Palestine. It ends a
line of hills, 18 miles long, by a long bold headland reaching out far
into the Mediterranean, and forming the south side of the Bay of Acco or
Acre. Rising 1,200 feet above the sea , it stands out "like some
guardian of its native strand;" yet withal, it was rich with every
variety of beauty, flower, fruit, and tree. It is almost always called
"the Carmel," "the rich garden-ground." From its neighborhood to the
sea, heavy dews nightly supply it with an ever-renewed freshness, so
that in mid-summer it is green and flowery . Travelers describe it, as
"quite green, its top covered with firs and oaks, lower down with olives
and laurels, and everywhere excellently watered." "There is not a
flower," says Van de Velde , "that I have seen in Galilee or on the
plains along the coasts, that I do not find here again on Carmel. It is
still the same fragrant lovely mountain as of old." : "Its varied world
of flowers attracts such a number of the rarer vari-colored insects that
a collector might for a whole year be richly employed." "It is a natural
garden and repository of herbs."

Its pastures were rich, so as to equal those of Bashan. "It gives rise
to a number of crystal streams, the largest of which gushes from the
spring of Elijah" [Jer 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md); [Nah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md). It had abundant supplies in
itself. If it too became a desert, what else would be spared? "If they
do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" [Luk
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md). All, high and low, shall be
stricken in one common desolation; all the whole land, fromm "the
pastures of the shepherds" in the south to Mount Carmel in the North.
And this, as soon as God had spoken. "He spake, and it was made." So
now, contrariwise, He uttercth His Voice, and Carmel hath languished.
Its glory hath passed away, as in the twinkling of an eye. God hath
spoken the word, and it is gone.

What depended on God's gifts, abides; what depended on man, is gone.
There remains a wild beauty still; but it is the beauty of natural
luxuriance. "All," says one who explored its depths , "lies waste; all
is a wilderness. The utmost fertility is here lost for man, useless to
man. The vineyards of Carmel, where are they now? Behold the long rows
of stones on the ground, the remains of the walls; they will tell you
that here, where now with difficulty you force your way through the
thick entangled copse, lay, in days of old, those incomparable vineyards
to which Carmel owes its name."

[Amos 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 1:3</span></span>

The order of God's threatenings seems to have been addressed to gain the
hearing of the people. The punishment is first denounced upon their
enemies, and that, for their sins, directly or indirectly, against
themselves, and God in them. Then, as to those enemies themselves, the
order is not of place or time, but of their relation to God's people. It
begins with their most oppressive enemy, Syria; then Philistia, the old
and ceaseless, although less powerful, enemy; then Tyre, not an
oppressor, as these, yet violating a relation which they had not, the
bonds of a former friendship and covenant; malicious also and
hardhearted through covetousness. Then follow Edom, Ammon, Moab, who
burst the bonds of blood also. Lastly and nearest of all, it falls on
Judah, who had the true worship of the true God among them, but despised
it. Every infliction on those like ourselves finds an echo in our own
consciences. Israel heard and readily believed God's judgments upon
others. It was not tempted to set itself against believing them. How
then could it refuse to believe of itself, what it believed of others
like itself? "Change but the name, the tale is told of thee ," was a
pagan saying which has almost passed into a proverb. The course of the
prophecy convicted "them," as the things written in Holy Scripture "for
our ensamples" convict Christians. "If they" who "sinned without law,
perished without law" [Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md), how
much more should they who "have sinned in the law, be judged by the
law." God's judgments rolled round like a thunder-cloud, passing from
land to land, giving warning of their approach, at last to gather and
center on Israel itself, except it repent. In the visitations of others,
it was to read its own; and that, the more, the nearer God was to them.
"Israel" is placed the last, because on it the destruction was to fall
to the uttermost, and rest there.

For three transgressions and for four - These words express, not four
transgressions added to the three, but an additional transgression
beyond the former, the last sin, whereby the measure of sin, which
before was full, overflows, and God's wrath comes. So in other places,
where the like form of words occurs, the added number is one beyond, and
mostly relates to something greater than all the rest. So, "He shall
deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch
thee" [Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md). The word, "yea,"
denotes, that the seventh is some heavier trouble, beyond all the rest,
which would seem likely to break endurance. Again, "give a portion to
seven, and also to eight" [Ecc 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md).
Seven is used as a symbol of a whole, since "on the seventh day God
rested from all which He had made," and therefore the number seven
entered so largely into the whole Jewish ritual. All time was measured
by seven.

The rule then is; "give without bounds; when that whole is fulfilled,
still give." Again in that series of sayings in the book of Proverbs
Prov. 30, the fourth is, in each, something greater than the three
preceding. "There are three" things that "are never satisfied;" yea,
"four" things "say not," it is "enough" [Pro
30:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md). The other things cannot be
satisfied; the fourth, fire, grows fiercer by being fed. Again, "There
be three" things "which go well; yea, four are comely in going" [Pro
30:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#029.md). The moral majesty of a king
is obviously greater than the rest. So "the handmaid which displaceth
her mistress" [Pro 30:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021.md) is more
intolerable and overbearing than the others. The art and concealment of
man in approaching a maiden is of a subtler kind than things in nature
which leave no trace of themselves, the eagle in the air, the serpent on
the rock, the ship in its pathway through the waves [Pro
30:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md). Again, "Sowing discord among
brethren" [Pro 6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md), has a special
hatefulness, as not only being sin, but causing widewasting sin, and
destroying in others the chief grace, love. Soul-murder is worse than
physical murder, and requires more devilish art.

These things - Job says, "worketh God twice and thrice with man, to
bring back his soul from the pit" [Job
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029.md). The last grace of God, whether
sealing up the former graces of those who use them, or vouchsafed to
those who have wasted them, is the crowning act of His love or
forbearance.

In pagan poetry also, as a trace of a mystery which they had forgotten,
three is a sacred whole; from where "thrice and fourfold blessed" stands
among them for something exceeding even a full and perfect blessing, a
super-abundance of blessings.

The fourth transgression of these pagan nations is alone mentioned. For
the prophet had no mission to "them;" he only declares to Israel the
ground of the visitation which was to come upon them. The three
transgressions stand for a whole sum of sin, which had not yet brought
down extreme punishment; the fourth was the crowning sin, after which
God would no longer spare. But although the fourth drew down His
judgment, God, at the last, punishes not the last sin only, but all
which went before. In that the prophet says, not, "for the fourth," but
"for three transgressions and for four," he expresses at once, that God
did not punish until the last sin, by which "the iniquity" of the sinful
nation became "full" [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md), and
that, "then," He punished for all, for the whole mass of sin described
by the three, and for the fourth also. God is longsuffering and ready to
forgive; but when the sinner finally becomes a "vessel of wrath" [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md), He punishes all the earlier
sins, which, for the time, He passed by.

Sin adds to sin, out of which it grows; it does not overshadow the
former sins, it does not obliterate them, but increases the mass of
guilt, which God punishes. When the Jews killed the Son, there, "came
on" them "all the righteous bloodshed upon the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias" [Mat
23:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md); [Luk
11:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050.md). All the blood of all the
prophets and servants of God under the Old Testament came upon that
generation. So each individual sinner, who dies impenitent, will be
punished for all which, in his whole life, he did or became, contrary to
the law of God. Deeper sins bring deeper damnation at the last. So Paul
speaks of those who "treasure up to" themselves "wrath against the Day
of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God" [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md). As good people, by the grace of
God, do, through each act done by aid of that grace, gain an addition to
their everlasting reward, so the wicked, by each added sin, add to their
damnation.

Of Damascus - Damascus was one of the oldest cities in the world, and
one of the links of its contact. It lay in the midst of its plain, a
high table-land of rich cultivation, whose breadth, from Anti-libanus
eastward, was about half a degree. On the west and north its plain lay
sheltered under the range of Anti-libanus; on the east, it was protected
by the great desert which intervened between its oasis-territory and the
Euphrates. Immediately, it was bounded by the three lakes which receive
the surplus of the waters which enrich it. The Barada (the "cold")
having joined the Fijeh, (the traditional Pharpar" , a name which well
designates its tumultuous course ), runs on the north of, and through
the city, and then chiefly into the central of the three lakes, the
Bahret-el-kibliyeh, (the "south" lake;) thence, it is supposed, but in
part also directly, into the Bahret-esh-Shurkiyeh (the "east" lake ).
The 'Awaj (the "crooked") (perhaps the old Amana, "the never-failing,"
in contrast with the streams which are exhausted in irrigation) runs
near the old south boundary of Damascus , separating it probably from
the northern possessions of Israel beyond Jordan, Bashan (in its widest
sense), and Jetur or Ituraea. The area has been calculated at 236 square
geographical miles .

This space rather became the center of its dominions, than measured
their extent. But it supported a population far beyond what that space
would maintain in Europe. Taught by the face of creation around them,
where the course of every tiny rivulet, as it burst from the rocks, was
marked by a rich luxuriance , the Damascenes of old availed themselves
of the continual supply from the snows of Hermon or the heights of
Anti-libanus, with a systematic diligence , of which, in our northern
clime, as we have no need, so we have no idea. "Without the Barada,"
says Porter , "the city could not exist, and the plain would be a
parched desert; but now aqueducts intersect every quarter, and fountains
sparkle in almost every dwelling, while innumerable canals extend their
ramifications over the vast plain, clothing it with verdure and beauty.
Five of these canals are led off from the river at different elevations,
before it enters the plain. They are carried along the precipitous banks
of the ravine, being in some places tunnelled in the solid rock. The two
on the northern side water Salahiyeh at the foot of the hills about a
mile from the city, and then irrigate the higher portions of the plain
to the distance of nearly twenty miles. Of the three on the south side,
one is led to the populous village Daraya, five miles distant; the other
two supply the city, its suburbs, and gardens."

The like use was made of every fountain in every larger or lesser plain.
Of old it was said , "the Chrysorrhoas (the Barada) "is nearly expended
in artificial channels." : "Damascus is fertile through drinking up the
Chrysorrhoas by irrigation." Fourteen names of its canals are still
given ; and while it has been common to select 7 or 8 chief canals, the
whole have been counted up even to 70 . No art or labor was thought too
great. The waters of the Fijeh were carried by a great aqueduct
tunnelled through the side of the perpendicular cliff . Yet this was as
nothing. Its whole plain was intersected with canals, and tunneled
below. : "The waters of the river were spread over the surface of the
soil in the fields and gardens; underneath, other canals were tunnelled
to collect the superfluous water which percolates the soil, or from
little fountains and springs below. The stream thus collected is led off
to a lower level, where it comes to the surface. : "The whole plain is
filled with these singular aqueducts, some of them running for 2 or 3
miles underground. Where the water of one is diffusing life and verdure
over the surface, another branch is collecting a new supply." "In former
days these extended over the whole plain to the lakes, thus irrigating
the fields and gardens in every part of it."

Damascus then was, of old, famed for its beauty. Its white buildings,
embedded in the deep green of its engirdling orchards, were like
diamonds encircled by emeralds. They reach nearly to Anti-libanus
westward , "and extend on both sides of the Barada some miles eastward.
They cover an area at last 25 (or 30) miles in circuit, and make the
environs an earthly Paradise." Whence the Arabs said , "If there is a
garden of Eden on earth, it is Damascus; and if in heaven, Damascus is
like it on earth." But this its beauty was also its strength. "The
river," says William of Tyre , "having abundant water, supplies orchards
on both banks, thick-set with fruit-trees, and flows eastward by the
city wall. On the west and north the city was far and wide fenced by
orchards, like thick dense woods, which stretched four or live miles
toward Libanus. These orchards are a most exceeding defense; for from
the density of the trees and the narrowness of the ways, it seemed
difficult and almost impossible to approach the city on that side." Even
to this day it is said , "The true defense of Damascus consists in its
gardens, which, forming a forest of fruit-trees and a labyrinth of
hedges, walls and ditches, for more than 7 leagues in circumference,
would present no small impediment to a Mussulman enemy."

The advantage of its site doubtless occastoned its early choice. It lay
on the best route from the interior of Asia to the Mediterranean, to
Tyre, and even to Egypt. Chedorlaomer and the four kings with him,
doubtless, came that way, since the first whom they smote were at
Ashteroth Karnaim [Gen 14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md) in
Jaulan or Gaulonitis, and thence they swept on southward, along the west
side of Jordan, smiting, as they went, first the "Zuzim," (probably the
same as the Zamzummim [Deu 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#002) O.md) in
Ammonitis; then "the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim" in Moab Deut. 9,
11, then "the Horites in Mount Seir unto Elparan" (probably Elath on the
Gulf called from it.) They returned that way, since Abraham overtook
them at Hobah near Damascus [Gen
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#015.md). Damascus was already the chief
city, through its relation to which alone Hobah was known. It was on the
route by which Abraham himself came at God's command from Haran (Charrae
of the Greeks) whether over Tiphsaeh ("the passage," Thapsacus) or
anymore northern passage over the Euphrates. The fact that his chief and
confidential servant whom he entrusted to seek a wife for Isaac, and who
was, at one time, his heir, was a Damascene [Gen
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), implies some intimate
connection of Abraham with Damascus. At the time of our era, the name of
Abraham was still held in honor in the country of Damascus ; a village
was named from him "Abraham's dwelling;" and a native historian Nicolas
said, that he reigned in Damascus on his way from the country beyond
Babylon to Canaan. The name of his servant "Eliezer" "my God is help,"
implies that at this time too the servant was a worshiper of the One
God. The name Damascus probably betokened the strenuous , energetic
character of its founder.

Like the other names connected with Aram in the Old Testament , it is,
in conformity with the common descent from Aram, Aramaic. It was no part
of the territory assigned to Israel, nor was it molested by them.
Judging, probably, of David's defensive conquests by its own policy, it
joined the other Syrians who attacked David, was subdued, garrisoned,
and became tributary [Sa2 8:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#005.md). It
was at that time probably a subordinate power, whether on the ground of
the personal eminence of Hadadezer king of Zobah, or any other.
Certainly Hadadezer stands cut conspicuously; the Damascenes are
mentioned only subordinately.

Consistently with this, the first mention of the kingdom of Damascus in
Scripture is the dynasty of Rezon son of Eliada's, a fugitive servant of
Hadadezer, who formed a marauding band, then settled and reigned in
Damascus [Kg1 11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md). Before this,
Scripture speaks of the people only of Damascus, not of their kings. Its
native historian admits that the Damascenes were, in the time of David,
and continued to be, the aggressors, while he veils over their repeated
defeats, and represents their kings, as having reigned successively from
father to son, for ten generations, a thing unknown probably in any
monarchy. : "A native, Adad, having gained great power, became king of
Damascus and the rest of Syria, except Phoenicia. He, having carried war
against David, king of Judaea, and disputed with him in many battles,
and that finally at the Euaphrates where he was defeated, had the
character of a most eminent king for prowess and valor. After his death,
his descendants reigned for ten generations, each receiving from his
father the name (Hadad) together with the kingdom, like the Ptolemies of
Egypt. The third, having gained the greatest power of all, seeking to
repair the defeat of his grandfather, warring against the Jews, wasted
what is now callcd Samaritis." They could not brook a defeat, which they
had brought upon themselves.

Rezon renewed, throughout the later part of Solomon's reign, the
aggression of Hadad. On the schism of the ten tribes, the hostility of
Damascus was concentrated against Israel who lay next to them. Abijam
was in league with the father of Benhadad [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019.md). Benhadad at once broke his
league with Baasha at the request of Asa in his later mistrustful days
[Ch1 16:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002.md), and turned against Baasha
([Ch1 16:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002.md) and [Kg1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020).md). From Omri also Benhadad I took
cities and extorted "streets," probably a Damascus quarter, in Samaria
itself [Kg1 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md). Benhadad II had
"thirty-two" vassal "kings" [Kg1 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md),
[Kg1 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024.md), (dependent kings like
those of Canaan, each of his own city and little territory,) and led
them against Samaria, intending to plunder it [Kg1
20:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#006.md), and, on occasion of the
plundering, probably to make it his own or to destroy it. By God's help
they were twice defeated; the second time, when they directly challenged
the power of God [Kg1 20:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022.md), [Kg1
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028.md), so signally that, had not Ahab
been flattered by the appeal to his mercy [Kg1
20:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031.md), Syria would no more have
been in a condition to oppress Israel. Benhadad promised to restore the
cities which his father had taken from Israel, and to make an
Israel-quarter in Damascus [Kg1 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md).

If this promise was fulfilled, Ramoth-Gilead must have been lost to
Syria at an earlier period, since, three years afterward, Ahab perished
in an attempt, by aid of Jehoshaphat, against the counsels of God, to
recover it 1 Kings 22. Ramoth-Gilead being thus in the hands of Syria,
all north of it, half of Dan and Manasseh beyond Jordan, must also have
been conquered by Syria. Except the one great siege of Samaria, which
brought it to extremities and which God dissipated by a panic which He
infused into the Syrian army [Kg2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md).
Benhadad and Hazael encouraged only marauding expeditions against Israel
during the 14 years of Ahaziah and Jehoram. Benhadad was, according to
Assyrian inscriptions defeated thrice, Hazael twice, by Shalmanubar king
of Assyria . Benhadad appears to have acted on the offensive, in
alliance with the kings of the Hittites, the Hamathites and Phoenicians
; Hazael was attacked alone, driven to take refuge in Anti-libanus, and
probably became tributary .

Assyrian chronicles relate only Assyrian victories. The brief notice,
that through Naaman "the Lord gave deliverance to Syria" [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md), probably refers to some signal
check which Assyria received through him. For there was no other enemy,
from whom Syria had to be "delivered." Subsequently to that retreat from
Samaria, he even lost Ramoth [Kg2
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md) to Jehoram after a battle
before it [Kg2 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md), in which Jehoram
was wounded. It is a probable conjecture that Jehu, by his political
submission to Assyria, drew on himself the calamities which Elisha
foretold. Hazael probably became the instrument of God in chastening
Israel, while he was avenging Jehu's submission to a power whom he
dreaded and from whom he had suffered. Israel, having lost the help of
Judah, became the easier prey. Hazael not only took from Israel all east
of Jordan [Kg2 10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), but made the
whole open country unsafe for the Israelites to dwell in.

Not until God "gave Israel a saviour," could they "dwell in their tents
as beforetime" [Kg2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005.md). Hazael
extended his conquests to Gath [Kg2
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017.md), intending probably to open a
connecting line with Egypt. "With a small company of men" he defeated a
large army of Judah [Ch2 24:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023.md).
Joash, king of Judah, bought him off, when advancing against Jerusalem,
with everything of gold, consecrated or civil, in the temple or in his
own treasures [Kg2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018.md). Jehoash
recovered from Benhadad III the cities this side Jordan [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md); Jeroboam II, all their lost
territories and even Damascus and Hamath [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md). Yet after this, it was to
recover its power under Rezin, to become formidable to Judah, and,
through its aggressions on Judah, to bring destruction on itself. At
this time, Damascus was probably, like ourselves, a rich, commercial, as
well as warlike, but not as yet a manufacturing (see the note at [Amo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012).md) nation. Its wealth, as a great
emporium of transit-commerce, (as it is now) furnished it with sinews
for war. The "white wool" [Eze 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#018.md),
in which it traded with Tyre, implies the possession of a large outlying
tract in the desert, where the sheep yield the whitest wool. It had then
doubtless, beside the population of its plain, large nomadic hordes
dependent upon it.

I will not turn away the punishment thereof - Literally, "I will not
turn it back." What was this, which God would not turn back? Amos does
not express it. Silence is often more emphatic than words. Not naming
it, he leaves it the rather to be conceived of by the mind, as something
which had been of old coming upon them to overwhelm them, which God had
long stayed back, but which, since He would now stay it no longer, would
burst in, with the more terrific and overwhelming might, because it had
been restrained before. Sin and punishment are by a great law of God
bound together. God's mercy holds back the punishment long, allowing
only some slight tokens of His displeasure to show themselves, that the
sinful soul or people may not be unwarned. When He no longer withholds
it, the law of His moral government holds its course. "Seldom," said
pagan experience , "hath punishment with lingering foot parted with the
miscreant, advancing before."

Because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron -
The instrument, Jerome relates here, was "a sort of wain, rolling on
iron wheels beneath, set with teeth; so that it both threshed out the
grain and bruised the straw and cut it in pieces, as food for the
cattle, for lack of hay." A similar instrument, called by nearly the
same name, is still in use in Syria and Egypt. Elisha had foretold to
Hazael his cruelty to Israel; "Their strong holds thou wilt set on fire,
and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their
children, and rip up their women with child" [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md). Hazael, like others gradually
steeped in sin, thought it impossible, but did it. In the days of Jehu,
"Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel from Jordan eastward; all
the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites,
from Arorer which is by the River Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan" [Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); in those of Jehoahaz, Jehu's
son, "he oppressed them, neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz
but fifty horsemen and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, for the
king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by
threshing" [Kg2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md). The death here
spoken of, although more ghastly, was probably not more severe than many
others; not nearly so severe as some which have been used by Christian
Judicatures. It is mentioned in the Proverbs, as a capital punishment
[Pro 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md); and is alluded to as such
by Isaiah [Isa 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md). David had had,
for some cause unexplained by Holy Scripture, to inflict it on the
Ammonites [Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md); [Ch1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003.md). Probably not the punishment in
itself alone, but the attempt so to extirpate the people of God brought
down this judgment on Damascus.

Theodoret supposes the horrible aggravation, that it was thus that the
women with child were destroyed with their children, "casting the
aforesaid women, as into a sort of threshing-floor, they savagely
threshed them out like ears of grain with saw-armed wheels."

Gilead is here doubtless to be taken in its widest sense, including all
the possessions of Israel, east of Jordan, as, in the account of
Hazael's conquests, "all the land of Gilead" [Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md) is explained to mean, all
which was ever given to the two tribes and a half, and to include Gilead
proper, as distinct from Basan. In like way Joshua relates, that "the
children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the ha! f tribe of
Manasseh returned to go into the country of Gilead, to the land of their
possessions" [Jos 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009.md). Throughout
that whole beautiful tract, including 2 12 degrees of latitude, Hazael
had carried on his war of extermination into every peaceful village and
home, sparing neither the living nor the unborn.

[Amos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 1:4</span></span>

And I will send a fire on the house of Hazael - The fire is probably at
once material fire, whereby cities are burned in war, since he adds, "it
shall devour the palaces of Benhadad," and also stands as a symbol of
all other severity in war as in the ancient proverb, "a fire is gone out
from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it hath consumed Ar of
Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon" [Num
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#028.md); and again of the displeasure of
Almighty God, as when He says, "a fire is kindled in Mine anger, and it
shall burn unto the lowest hell" [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md). For the fire destroys not the
natural buildings only, but "the house of Hazael," that is, his whole
family. In these prophecies, a sevenfold vengeance by fire is denounced
against the seven people, an image of the eternal fire into which all
iniquity shall be cast.

The palaces of Benhadad - Hazael, having murdered Benhadad his master
and ascended his throne, called Iris son after his murdered master,
probably in order to connect his own house with the ancient dynasty.
Benhadad, that is, son or worshiper of the idol "Hadad," or "the sun,"
had been the name of two of the kings of the old dynasty. Benhadad III
was at this time reigning. The prophet foretells the entire destruction
of the dynasty founded in blood. The prophecy may have had a fulfillment
in the destruction of the house of Hazael, with whose family Rezin, the
king of Syria in the time of Ahaz, stands in no known relation. Defeats,
such as those of Benhadad III by Jeroboam II who took Damascus itself,
are often the close of an usurping dynasty. Having no claim to regard
except success, failure vitiates its only title. The name Hazael, "whom
God looked upon," implies a sort of owning of the One God, like Tab-el,
"God is good," El-iada', "whom God knoweth," even amid the idolatry in
the names, Tab-Rimmon, "good is Rimmon;" Hadad-ezer, "Hadad is help;"
and Hadad, or Benhadad. Bad men abuse every creature, or ordinance, or
appointment of God. It may be then that, as Sennacherib boasted, "am I
now come up without the Lord against this land" to destroy it? the Lord
said unto me, Go up against this land and destroy it" [Isa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#010.md); so Hazael made use of the
prophecy of Elisha, to give himself out as the scourge of God, and
thought of himself as one "on whom God looked."

Knowledge of futurity is an awful gift. As "Omniscience alone can wield
Omnipotence," so superhuman knowledge needs superhuman gifts of wisdom
and holiness. Hazael seemingly hardened himself in sin by aid of the
knowledge which should have been his warning. Probably he came to
Elisha, with the intent to murder his master already formed, in case he
should not die a natural death; and Elisha read him to himself. But he
very probably justified himself to himself in what he had already
purposed to do, on the ground that Elisha had foretold to him that he
should be king over [Kg2 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013.md), and, in
his massacres of God's people, gave himself out as being, what he was,
the instrument of God. "Scourges of God" have known themselves to be
what they were, although they themselves were not the less sinful, in
sinfully accomplishing the Will of God (see the note at [Hos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004).md). We have heard of a Christian
Emperor, who has often spoken of his "mission," although his "mission"
has already cost the shedding of much Christian blood.

[Amos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 1:5</span></span>

I will also break the bar of Damascus - In the East, every city was
fortified; the gates of the stronger cities were cased in iron, that
they might not be set on fire by the enemy; they were fastened within
with bars of brass [Kg1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md) or iron
([Psa 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md); [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md); compare [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md); [Jer
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003) O.md). They were flanked with
towers, and built over, so that what was naturally the weakest point and
the readiest access to an enemy became the strongest defense. In Hauran
the huge doors and gates of a single stone 9 and 10 feet high , and 1 12
foot thick , are still extant, and "the place for the ponderous bars,"
proportioned to such gates, "may yet be seen." The walls were loosened
with the battering-ram, or scaled by mounds: the strong gate was seldom
attacked; but, when a breach was made, was thrown open from within. The
"breaking of the bar" laid open the city to the enemy, to go in and come
out at his will. The whole strength of the kingdom of Damascus lay in
the capital. It was itself the seat of the empire and was the empire
itself. God says then, that He Himself would shiver all their means of
resistance, whatever could hinder the inroad of the enemy.

And cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven - Literally, "from the
vale of vanity," the "Bik'ah" being a broad vale between hills . Here it
is doubtless the rich and beautiful valley, still called el-bukaa by the
Arabs, La Boquea by William of Tyre , lying between Lebanon and
Anti-libanus, the old Coele-Syria in its narrowest sense. It is, on high
ground, the continuation of that long deep valley which, along the
Jordan, the Dead sea, and the Arabah, reaches to the Red Sea. lts
extreme length, from its southern close at Kal'at-esh-shakif to Hums
(Emesa) has been counted at 7 days journey ; it narrows toward its
southern extremity, expands at its northern, yet it cannot any how be
said to lose its character of a valley until 10 miles north of Riblah .

Midway, on its ," was Baalbek, or Heliopolis, where the Egyptian worship
is said to have been brought of old times from their "city of the sun ."
Baalbek, as the ruins still attest, was full of the worship of the sun.
But the whole of that beautiful range, "a magnificent vista" , it has
been said, "carpeted with verdure and beauty" , "a gem lying deep in its
valley of mountains," was a citadel of idolatry. The name Baal-Hermon
connects Mount Hermon itself, the snow-capped height which so towers
over its southeast extremity, with the worship of Baal or the sun, and
that, from the time of the Judges [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md). The name Baal-gad connects "the
valley of Lebanon," that is, most probably the south end of the great
valley, with the same worship, anterior to Joshua [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md); [Jos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md); [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md).

The name Baalbek is probably an abbreviation of the old name,
Baal-bik'ah , "Baal of the valley," in contrast with the neighboring
Baalhermon. : "The whole of Hermon was girded with temples." : "Some
eight or ten of them cluster round it," and, which is more remarkable,
one is built" to catch the first beams of the sun rising over Hermon;"
and temples on its opposite sides face toward it, as a sort of center .

In Jerome's time, the pagan still reverenced a celebrated temple on its
summit . On the crest of its central peak, 3,000 feet above the glen
below, in winter inaccessible, beholding far asunder the rising and the
setting sun on the eastern desert and in the western sea, are still seen
the foundations of a circular wall or ring of large stones, a rude
temple, within which another of Grecian art was subsequently built . "On
three other peaks of the Anti-libanus range are ruins of great
antiquity" . : "The Bukaa and its borders are full of the like
buildings."

"Lebanon, Anti-lebanon and the valleys between are thronged with ancient
temples" . Some indeed were Grecian, but others Syro-Phoenician. The
Grecian temples were probably the revival of Syro-Phoenician. The
"massive substructions of Baalbek are conjectured to have been those of
an earlier temple." The new name "Heliopolis" only substituted the name
of the object of worship (the sun) for its title Lord. The pagan
emperors would not have lavished so much and such wondrous cost and
gorgeous art on a temple in Coele-Syria, had not its pagan celebrity
recommended it to their superstition or their policy. On the west side
of Lebanon at Afca, (Apheca) was the temple of Venus at the source of
the River Adonis , a center of the most hateful Syrian idolatry , "a
school of misdoing for all profligates."

At Heliopolis too, men "shamelessly gave their wives and daughters to
shame." The outburst of paganism there in the reign of Julian the
Apostate shows how deeply rooted was its idolatry. Probably then, Amos
pronounces the sentence of the people of that whole beautiful vale, as
"valley of vanity" or "iniquity" , being wholly given to that worst
idolatry which degraded Syria. Here, as the seat of idolatry, the chief
judgments of God were to fall. Its inhabitants were to be cut off, that
is, utterly destroyed; on the rest, captivity is the only sentence
pronounced. The Assyrian monarchs not unfrequently put to death those
who despised their religion , and so may herein have executed blindly
the sentence of God.

From the house of Eden - A Proper, but significant, name, "Beth-Eden,"
that is, "house of pleasure." The name, like the Eden of Assyria [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012.md); [Isa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012.md); [Eze
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023.md), is, in distinction from man's
first home, pronounced "EH-den," not "EE-den" . Two places near, and one
in, the Bik'ah have, from similarity of name, been thought to be this
"house of delight."

1\. Most beautiful now for situation and climate, is what is probably
mispronounced Ehden; a Maronite Village "of 4 or 500 families, on the
side of a rich highly-cultivated valley" near Beshirrai on the road from
Tripolis to the Cedars. Its climate is described as a ten months spring
; "the hills are terraced up to their summits;" and every place full of
the richest, most beautiful, vegetation; "grain is poured out into the
lap of man, and wine into his cup without measure." "The slopes of the
valleys, one mass of verdure, are yet more productive than the hills;
the springs of Lebanon gushing down, fresh, cool and melodious in every
direction ." The wealthier families of Tripoli still resort there for
summer, "the climate being tempered by the proximity of the
snow-mountains, the most luxuriant vegetation favored by the soft airs
from the sea . "It is still counted" the Paradise of Lebanon."

2\. Beit-el-Janne, literally, "house of Paradise," is an Arabic
translation of Beth-Eden. It "lies under the root of Libanus, (Hermon)
gushing forth clear water, whence," says WilIiam of Tyre , "it is called
'house of pleasure.'" It lies in a narrow valley, where it widens a
little, about 34 of an hour from the plain of Damascus , and about 27
miles from that city on the way from Banias. : "Numerous rock-tombs,
above and around, bear testimony to the antiquity of the site." It gives
its name to the Jennani (Paradise River), one of two streams which form
the second great river near Damascus, the Awadj.

3\. The third, the Paradisus of the Greeks, one of the three towns of
Laodicene , agrees only accidentally with the Scripture name, since
their Paradisus signifies not an earthly Paradise, but a "hunting-park."
For this the site is well suited; but in that country so abounding in
water, and of soil so rich that the earth seems ready, on even slight
pains of man, to don itself in luxuriant beauty, what probably is the
site of the old Paradisus, is hopelessly barren Beth-Eden may have been
the residence of one of the subordinate kings under the king of
Damascus, who was to be involved in the ruin of his suzerain; or it may
have been a summer-residence of the king of Damascus himself, where, in
the midst of his trust in his false gods, and in a Paradise, as it were,
of delight, God would cut him off altogether. Neither wealth nor any of
a man's idols protect against God. As Adam, for sin, was expelled from
Paradise, so the rulers of Damascus from the place of their pleasure and
their sin.

And the people of Syria shall go into captivity - Syria or Aram perhaps
already included, under the rule of Damascus, all the little kingdoms on
this side of the Euphrates, into which it had been formerly sub-divided.
At least, it is spoken of as a whole, without any of the additions which
occur in the earlier history, Aram-beth-rehob, Aramzobah, Aram-Maachah.
Before its captivity Damascus is spoken of as "the head of Syria" [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md).

Into Kir - Kir has been identified:

\(1\) with the part of Iberia near the River Kur which unites with the
Araxes, not far from the Caspian, to the north of Armenia;

\(2\) a city called by the Greeks Kourena or Kourna on the River Mardus
in southern Media;

\(3\) a city, Karine , the modern Kerend .

The first is the most likely, as the most known; the Kur is part
probably of the present name Kurgistan, our "Georgia." Armenia at least
which lay on the south of the River Kur, is frequently mentioned in the
cuneiform inscriptions, as a country where the kings of Assyria warred
and conquered . The two parricide sons of Sennacherib are as likely to
have fled [Isa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038.md) to a distant
portion of their father's empire, as beyond it. Their flight there may
have been the ground of Esarhaddon's war against it . It has at all
times afforded a shelter to those expelled from others' lands . The
domestic, though late, traditions of the Armenians count as their first
inhabitants some who had fled out of Mesopotamia to escape the yoke of
Bel, king of Babylon . Whatever be the value of particular traditions,
its mountain-valleys form a natural refuge to fugitives.

On occasion of some such oppression, as that from which Asshur fled
before Nimrod , Aram may have been the first of those who took shelter
in the mountains of Armenia and Georgia, and thence spread themselves,
where we afterward find them, in the lowlands of Mesopotamia. The name
Aram, however, is in no way connected with Armenia, which is itself no
indigenous name of that country, but was probably formed by the Greeks,
from a name which they heard . The name Aram, "lofty," obviously
describes some quality of the son of Shem, as of others who bore the
name . Contrariwise, Canaan, (whether or no anticipating his future
degraded character as partaking in the sin of Ham) may signify
"crouching." But neither has Aram any meaning of "highland," nor Canaan
of "lowland," as has of late been imagined. .

From Kir the forefathers of the Syrians had, of their own will, been
brought by the good all-disposing Providence of God; to Kir should the
Syrians, against their will, be carried back. Aram of Damascus had been
led to a land which, for its fertility and beauty, has been and is still
praised as a sort of Paradise. Now, softened as they were by luxury,
they were to be transported back to the austere though healthy climate,
from where they had come. They had abused the might given to them by
God, in the endeavor to uproot Israel; now they were themselves to be
utterly uprooted. The captivity which Amos foretells is complete; a
captivity by which (as the word means) the land should be bared of its
inhabitants. Such a captivity he foretells of no other, except the ten
tribes. He foretells it absolutely of these two nations alone , of the
king and princes of Ammon [Amo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md),
not of Tyre, or the cities of Philistia, or Edom, or Ammon, or Moab. The
punishment did not reach Syria in those days, but in those of Rezin who
also oppressed Judah. The sin not being cut off; the punishment too was
handed down.

Tiglath-pileser carried them away, about 50 years after this, and killed
Rezin [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md). In regard to these
two nations, Amos foretells the captivity absolutely. Yet at this time,
there was no human likelihood, no ground, except of a divine knowledge,
to predict it of these two nations especially. They went into captivity
too long after this for human foresight to predict it; yet long enough
before the captivity of Judah for the fulfillment to have impressed
Judah if they would. The transportation of whole populations, which
subsequently became part of the standing policy of the Persian and of
the later Assyrian Empires, was not, as far as we know, any part of
Eastern policy at the time of the prophet. Sesostris, the Egyptian
conqueror, some centuries before Amos, is related to have brought
together "many men," "a crowd," from the nations whom he had subdued,
and to have employed them on his buildings and canals.

Even this account has received no support from the Egyptian monuments,
and the deeds ascribed by the Greeks to Sesostris have been supposed to
be a blending of those of two monarchs of the xix. Dynasty, Sethos I and
Raamses II, interwoven with those of Ousartesen III (Dynasty xii.) and
Tothmosis III (Dyn. xviii). But the carrying away of tiny number of
prisoners from fields of battle is something altogether different from
the political removal of a nation. It had in it nothing systematic or
designed. It was but the employment of those whom war had thrown into
their hands, as slaves. The Egyptian monarchs availed themselves of this
resource, to spare the labor of their native subjects in their great
works of utility or of vanity. But the prisoners so employed were but a
slave population, analogous to those who, in other nations, labored in
the mines or in agriculture.

They employed in the like way the Israelites, whom they had received
peacefully. Their earlier works were carried on by native labor . After
Tothmosis III, in whose reign is the first representation of prisoners
employed in forced labor , they could, during their greatness, spare
their subjects. They imported labor, not by slave trade, but through
war. Nubia was incorporated with Egypt , and Nubian prisoners were, of
course, employed, not in their own country but in the north of Egypt;
Asiatic prisoners in Nubia . But they were prisoners made in a campaign,
not a population; a foreign element in Egyptian soil, not an interchange
of subject-populations. Doubtless, "the mixed multitude" [Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md), which "went up with" Israel
from Egypt, were in part these Asiatic captives, who had been subjected
to the same hard bondage.

The object and extent of those forced transportations by the later
Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians were altogether different. Here the
intention was to remove the people from their original seat, or at most
to leave those only who, from their fewness or poverty, would be in no
condition to rebel. The cuneiform inscriptions have brought before us,
to a great extent, the records of the Assyrian conquests, as given by
their kings. But whereas the later inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib,
Esarhaddon, mention repeatedly the deportation of populations, the
earlier annals of Asshurdanipal or Asshurakhbal relate the carrying off
of soldiers only as prisoners, and women as captives . They mention also
receiving slaves as tributes, the number of oxen and sheep, the goods
and possessions and the gods of the people which they carry off .

Else the king relates, how he crucified or impaled or put to death men
at arms or the people generally, but in no one of his expeditions does
he mention any deportation. Often as modern writers assume, that the
transportation of nations was part of the hereditary policy of the
Monarchs of Asia, no instances before this period have been found. It
appears to have been a later policy, first adopted by Tiglath-pileser
toward Damascus and east and north Palestine, but foretold by the
prophet long before it was adopted. It was the result probably of
experience, that they could not keep these nations in dependence upon
themselves while they left them in their old abodes. As far as our
knowledge reaches, the prophet foretold the removal of these people, at
a time when no instance of any such removal had occurred.

[Amos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 1:6</span></span>

Gaza - Was the southernmost city of the Philistines, as it was indeed of
Canaan [Gen 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019.md) of old, the last
inhabited place at the beginning of the desert, on the way from
Phoenicia to Egypt . Its situation was wonderfully chosen, so that,
often as a Gaza has been destroyed, a new city has, if even after long
intervals, risen up again in the same immediate neighborhood . The
fragments of the earlier city became materials for the later. It was
first Canaanite [Gen 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019.md); then
Philistine; then, at least after Alexander, Edomite ; after Alexander
Janneus, Greek ; conquered by Abubekr the first Khalif, it became
Arabian; it was desolated in their civil wars, until the Crusaders
rebuilt its fort ; then again, Muslim. In the earliest times, before the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Gaza was the south angle of the
border of the Canaanites, from where it turned to the south of the Dead
Sea. Even then it was known by its name of strength, 'Azzah "the
strong," like our "Fort."

For a time, it stood as an island-fort, while the gigantic race of the
Avvim wandered, wilder probably than the modern Bedaween, up to its very
gates. For since it is said, "the Avvim dwelt in open villages as far as
Gaza" [Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md); plainly they did not
dwell in Gaza itself, a fortified town. The description assigns the
bound of their habitations, up to the furthest town on the southeast,
Gaza. They prowled around it, infested it doubtless, but did not conquer
it, and were themselves expelled by the Caphtorim. The fortress of the
prince of Gaza is mentioned in the great expedition of Tothmosis III ,
as the conquest of Ashkelon was counted worthy of mention in the
monuments of Raamses II . It was strengthened doubtless by giving refuge
to the Anakim, who, after Joshua had expelled them "from Hebron" and
neighboring cities, "and the mountains of Judah and Israel, remained in
Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod" [Jos
11:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021.md).

Its situation, as the first station for land-commerce to and from Egypt,
whether toward Tyre and Sidon, or Damascus and the upper Euphrates, or
toward Petra, probably aggrandized it early. Even when the tide of
commerce has been diverted into other channels, its situation has been a
source of great profit. A fertile spot, touching upon a track through a
desert, it became a mart for caravans, even those which passed, on the
pilgrim-route to Mekka, uniting traffic with their religion. Where the
five cities are named together as unconquered, Gaza is mentioned first,
then Ashdod [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md). Samson, after
he had betrayed his strength, was "brought down to Gaza" [Jdg
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021.md), probably as being their
strongest fortress, although the furthest from "the valley of Sorek ,"
where he was ensnared.

There too was the vast temple of Dagon, which became the burying-place
of so many of his worshipers. In Solomon's reign it was subject to
Israel [Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md). After the Philistine
inroad in the time of Ahaz [Ch2 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md),
and their capture of towns of Judah in the south and the low country,
Shephelah, Hezekiah drove them back as far as Gaza [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md), without apparently taking it.
Its prince was defeated by Sargon , whose victory over Philistia Isaiah
foretold [Isa 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029.md). Sennacherib gave
to its king, together with those of Ascalon and Ekron , "fortified and
other towns which" he "had spoiled," avowedly to weaken Judah; "so as to
make his (Hezekiah's) country small;" probably also as a reward for
hostility to Judah. Greek authors spcak of it, as "a very large city of
Syria" , "a great city" . Like other cities of old, it was, for fear of
pirates, built at some distance from the sea (Arrian says "2 12 miles"),
but had a port called, like that of Asealea , Maiuma , which itself too
in Christian times became a place of importance .

Because they carried away the whole captivity - Literally, "a complete
captivity;" complete, but for evil; a captivity in which none were
spared, none left behind; old or young, woman or child; but a whole
population (whatever its extent) was swept away. Such an inroad of the
Philistines is related in the time of Jehoram [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md).

To deliver them up to Edom - Literally, "to shut them up to Edom," in
the power of Edom, their bitter enemy, so that they should not be able
to escape, nor be restored. The hands, even if not the land, of Edom
were already dyed in the blood of Jacob "their brother" [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019.md). "Any whither but there,"
probably would cry the crowd of helpless captives. It was like driving
the shrinking flock of sheep to the butcher's shambles, reeking with the
gore of their companions. Yet therefore were they driven there to the
slaughter. Open markets there were for Jewish slaves in abundance. "Sell
us, only not to slaughter." "Spare the greyheaded;" "spare my child,"
would go up in the ears of those, who, though enemies, understood their
speech. But no! Such was the compact of Tyre and Philistia and Edom
against the people of God. Not one was to be spared; it was to be "a
complete captivity;" and that, to Edom. The bond was fulfilled. "Whoso
stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he too shall cry and shall not
be heard" [Pro 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013.md). Joel mentions
the like sin of the Philistines and Phoenicians, and foretold its
punishment [Joe 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004.md). That in the
reign of Jehoram is the last which Scripture mentions, but was not
therefore, of necessity or probably, the last. Holy Scripture probably
relates only the more notable of those border-raids. Unrepented sin is
commonly renewed. Those strong Philistine fortresses must have given
frequent, abundant opportunity for such inroads; as now too it is said
in Arabia, "the harvest is to the stronger;" and while small protected
patches of soil in Lebanon, Hauran, etc. are cultivated, the open
fertile country often lies uncultivated , since it would be cultivated
only for the marauder. Amos renews the sentence of Joel, forewarning
them that, though it seemed to tarry, it would come.

[Amos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 1:7</span></span>

But - Literally, "and." Thus had Gaza done, and thus would God do; "I
will send a fire upon Gaza." The sentence on Gaza stands out, probably
in that it was first in power and in sin. It was the merchant-city of
the five; the caravans parted from it or passed through it; and so this
sale of the Jewish captives was ultimately effected through them. First
in sin, first in punishment. Gaza was strong by nature and by art. "The
access to it also," Arrian notices , "lay through deep sand." We do not
hear of its being taken, except in the first times of Israel under the
special protection of God [Jdg 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md),
[Jdg 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md), or by great conquerors. All
Philistia, probably, submitted to David; we hear of no special conquest
of its towns [Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md). Its siege cost
Alexander 2 months , with all the aid of the engines with which he had
taken Tyre, and the experience which he had there gained. The Egyptian
accounts state, that when besieged by Tothmosis III it capitulated .
Thenceforth, it had submitted neither to Egypt nor Assyria. Yet Amos
declared absolutely, that Gaza should be destroyed by fire, and it was
so. Sennacherib first, then, after Jeremiah had foretold anew the
destruction of Gaza, Ashkelon, and the Philistines, Pharaoh Necho "smote
Gaza" [Jer 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md). Yet who, with human
foresight only, would undertake to pronounce the destruction of a city
so strong?

[Amos 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 1:8</span></span>

And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod - Ashdod, as well as
Ekron, have their names from their strength; Ashdod, "the mighty," like
Valentia; Ekron, "the firm-rooted." The title of Ashdod implied that it
was powerful to inflict as to resist. It may have meant, "the waster."
It too was eminent in its idolatry. The ark, when taken, was first
placed in its Dagon-temple [Sa1 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md);
and, perhaps, in consequence, its lord is placed first of the five, in
recounting the trespass-offerings which they sent to the Lord [Sa1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#017.md). Ashdod (Azotus in the New
Testament now a village, Esdud or Shdood ), lay 34 or 36 miles from Gaza
, on the great route from Egypt northward, on that which now too is most
used even to Jerusalem. Ashkelon lay to the left of the road, near the
sea, rather more than halfway.

Ekron (Akir, now a village of 50 mud-houses ), lay a little to the right
of the road northward from Gaza to Lydda (in the same latitude as
Jamnia, Jabneel) on the road from Ramleh to Belt Jibrin
(Eleutheropolis). Ekron, the furthest from the sea, lay only 15 miles
from it. They were then a succession of fortresses, strong from their
situation, which could molest any army, which should come along their
coast. Transversely, in regard to Judah, they enclosed a space parallel
to most of Judah and Benjamin. Ekron, which by God's gift was the
northern line of Judah [Jos 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md), is
about the same latitude as Ramah in Benjamin; Gaza, the same as Carmel
(Kurmul). From Gaza lay a straight road to Jerusalem; but Ashkelon too,
Ashdod, and Ekron lay near the heads of valleys, which ran up to the
hill-country near Jerusalem .

This system of rich valleys, in which, either by artificial irrigation
or natural absorption, the streams which ran from the mountains of Judah
westward fertilized the grainfields of Philistia, aforded equally a
ready approach to Philistine marauders into the very heart of Judah. The
Crusaders had to crown with castles the heights in a distant circle
around Ashkelon , in order to restrain the incursions of the Muslims.
(In such occasions doubtless, the same man-stealing was often practiced
on lesser scales, which here, on a larger scale, draws down the sentence
of God. Gath, much further inland, probably formed a center to which
these maritime towns converged, and united their system of inroads on
Judah.

These five cities of Philistia had each its own petty king (Seren, our
"axle"). But all formed one whole; all debated and acted together on any
great occasion; as in the plot against Samson [Jdg
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005.md), [Jdg
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#008.md), [Jdg
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#018.md), the sacrifice to Dagon in
triumph over him, where they perished [Jdg
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023.md), [Jdg
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#027.md), [Jdg
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#030.md); the inflictions on account of
the ark [Sa1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md), [Sa1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011.md); [Sa1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004.md), [Sa1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#012.md), [Sa1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#016.md), [Sa1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md); the great attack on Israel [Sa1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007.md), which God defeated the Mizpeh;
the battle when Saul fell, and the dismissal of David [Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002.md), [Sa1
31:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#006.md); [Ch1
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#019.md). The cities divided their
idolatry also, in a manner, between them, Ashdod being the chief seat of
the worship of Dagon , Ashkelon, of the corresponding worship of Derceto
, the fish-goddess, the symbol of the passive principle in
re-production. Ekron was the seat of the worship of Baalzebub and his
oracle, from where he is called "the god of Ekron" [Kg2
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md), [Kg2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#016.md).

Gaza, even after it had become an abode of Greek idolatry and had seven
temples of Greek gods, still retained its worship of its god Marna ("our
Lord") as the chief . It too was probably "nature" and to its worship
they were devoted. All these cities were as one; all formed one state;
all were one in their sin; all were to be one in their punishment. So
then for greater vividness, one part of the common infliction is related
of each, while in fact, according to the custom of prophetic diction,
what is said of each is said of all. King and people were to be cut off
from all; all were to be consumed with fire in war; on all God would, as
it were, "turn" (literally, "bring back") His Hand, visiting them anew,
and bringing again the same punishment upon them. In truth these
destructions came upon them, again and again, through Sargon, Hezekiah,
Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, the Maccabees.

Ashdod - Uzziah about this time "brake down its walls and built cities
about" [Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md) it, to protect his
people from its inroads. It recovered, and was subsequently besieged and
taken by Tartan, the Assyrian General under Sargon [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001) (about 716 b.c..md). Somewhat later,
it sustained the longest siege in man's knowlege, for 29 years, from
Psammetichus king of Egypt (about 635 b.c.). Whence, probably Jeremiah,
while he speaks of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, mentions "the remnant of
Ashdod" [Jer 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) only. Yet, after
the captivity, it seems to have been the first Philistine city, so that
the Philistines were called Ashdodites [Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md), and their dialect Ashdodite [Neh
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#024.md). They were still hostile to the
Jews [Neh 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md). The war, in which Judas
Maccabaeus spoiled Ashdod and other Philistine cities (1 Macc. 5:68),
was a defensive war against a war of extermination. "The nations round
about" (1 Macc. 5:1, 2), it is said at the beginning of the account of
that year's campaign, "thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that
was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the
people." Jonathan, the brother of Judas, "set fire to Azotus and the
cities round about it (1 Macc. 10:82, 84), after a battle under its
walls, to which his enemies had challenged him. The temple of Dagon in
it was a sort of citadel (1 Macc. 10:83).

Ashkelon is mentioned as a place of strength, taken by the great
conqueror, Raamses II. Its resolute defense and capture are represented,
with its name as a city of Canaanites, on a monument of Karnac . Its
name most naturally signifies "hanging." This suits very well with the
site of its present ruins, which "hang" on the side of the theater or
arc of hills, whose base is the sea. This, however, probably was not its
ancient site (see the note at [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004).md). Its name occurs in the wars of
the Maccabees, but rather as submitting readily (1 Macc. 10:86; 11:60).
Perhaps the inhabitants had been changed in the intervening period.
Antipater, the Edomite father of Herod, courted, we are told , "the
Arabs and the Ascalonites and the Gazites." "Toward the Jews their
neighbors, the inhabitants of the Holy land," Philo says to the Roman
emperor, "the Ascalonites have an irreconcilable aversion, which will
come to no terms." This abiding hatred burst out at the beginning of the
war with the Romans, in which Jerusalem perished. The Ascalonites
massacred 2500 Jews dwelling among them . The Jews "fired Ascalon and
utterly destroyed Gaza" .

Ekron was apparently not important enough in itself to have any separate
history. We hear of it only as given by Alexander Bales "with the
borders thereof in possession" (1 Macc. 10:89) to Jonathan the Maccabee.
The valley of Surar gave the Ekronites a readier entrance into the
center of Judaea, than Ascalon or Ashdod had. In Jerome's time, it had
sunk to "a very large village."

The residue of the Philistines shall perish - This has been thought to
mean "the rest" (as in [Jer 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md); [Neh
7:72](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#072).md) that is, Gath, (not mentioned by
name anymore as having ceased to be of any account (see the note at [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003)).md) and the towns, dependent on
those chief cities . The common (and, with a proper name, universal )
meaning of the idiom is, "the remnant," those who remain over after a
first destruction. The words then, like those just before, "I will bring
again my hand against Ekron," foretell a renewal of those first
judgments. The political strength which should survive one desolation
should be destroyed in those which should succeed it. In tacit contrast
with the promises of mercy to the remnant of Judah (see above the note
at [Joe 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032).md), Amos foretells that
judgment after judgment should fall upon Philistia, until the
Philistines ceased to be anymore a people; as they did.

[Amos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 1:9</span></span>

The last crowning sin, for which judgment is pronounced on Tyre, is the
same as that of Philistia, and probably was enacted in concert with it.
In Tyre, there was this aggravation, that it was a violation of a
previous treaty and friendship. It was not a covenant only, nor previous
friendliness only; but a specific covenant, founded on friendship which
they forgat and brake. If they retained the memory of Hiram's contact
with David and Solomon, it was a sin against light too. After David had
expelled the Jebusites from Jerusalem, "Hiram King of Tyre sent
messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons; and they
built David a house" [Sa2 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md). The
Philistines contrariwise invaded him [Sa2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md). This recognition of him by Hiram
was to David a proof, "that the Lord had established him king over
Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people, Israel's
sake" [Sa2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012.md).

Hiram seems, then, to have recognized something super-human in the
exaltation of David. "Hiram was ever a lover of David" [Kg1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md). This friendship he continued to
Solomon, and recognized his God as "the" God. Scripture embodies the
letter of Hiram; "Because the Lord hath loved his people, He hath made
thee king over them. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, that made heaven
and earth, who hath given to David a wise son - that he might build are
house for the Lord" . He must have known then the value which the pious
Israelites attached to the going up to that temple. A later treaty,
offered by Demetrius Nicator to Jonathan, makes detailed provision that
the Jews should have "the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and the
solemn days and the three days before the feast and the three days after
the feast, as days of immunity and freedom."

The three days before the feast were given, that they might go up to the
feast. Other treaties guarantee to the Jews religious privileges . A
treaty between Solomon and Hiram, which should not secure any religious
privileges needed by Jews in Hiram's dominion, is inconceivable. But
Jews were living among the Zidonians (see the note at [Joe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006).md). The treaty also, made between
Hiram and Solomon, was subsequent to the arrangement by which Hiram was
to supply cedars to Solomon, and Solomon to furnish the grain of which
Hiram stood in need [Kg1 5:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007.md). "The
Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him" [Kg1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md); and, as a fruit of that wisdom,
"there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
covenant." The terms of that covenant are not there mentioned; but a
covenant involves conditions. it was not a mere peace; but a distinct
covenant, sanctioned by religious rites and by sacrifice.

"This brotherly covenant Tyre remembered not," when they delivered up to
Edom "a complete captivity," all the Jews who came into their hands. It
seems then, that that covenant had an special provision against selling
them away from their own land. This same provision other people made for
love of their country or their homes; the Jews, for love of their
religion. This covenant Tyre remembered not, but brake. They knew
doubtless why Edom sought to possess the Israelites; but the
covetousness of Tyre fed the cruelty of Edom, and God punished the
broken appeal to Himself.

[Amos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 1:10</span></span>

I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre - Tyre had long ere this become
tributary to Assyria. Asshur-ban-ipal (about 930 b.c.,) records his
"taking tribute from the kings of all the chief Phoenician cities as
Tyre, Sidon, Biblus and Aradus" . His son Shalmanubar records his taking
tribute from them in his 21st year about 880, b.c.), as did Ivalush III
, and after this time Tiglath-pileser II , the same who took Damascus
and carried off its people, as also the east and north of Israel. The
Phoenicians had aided Benhadad, in his unsuccessful war or rebellion
against Shalmanubar , but their city had received no hurt. There was
nothing, in the time of Amos, to indicate any change of policy in the
Assyrian conquerors.

They had been content hitherto with tribute from their distant
dependencies; they had spared them, even when in arms against them. Yet
Amos says absolutely in the name of God, "I will send a fire upon the
wall of Tyre," and the fire did fall, first from Shalamaneser or Sargon
his successor, and then from Nebuchadnezzar. The Tyrians (as is men's
custom) inserted in their annals their successes, or the successful
resistance which they made for a time. They relate that , "Elulaeus,
king of Tyre, reduced the Kittiaeans (Cypriotes) who had revolted. The
king of Assyria invaded all Phoenicia, and returned, having made peace
with all. Sidon and Ace and old Tyre, and many other cities revolted
from the Tyrians, and surrendered to the king of Assyria. Tyre then not
obeying, the king returned against them, the Phoenicians manning 60
ships for him." These, he says, were dispersed, 500 prisoners taken; the
honor of Tyre intensified. "The king of Assyria, removing, set guards at
the river and aqueducts, to hinder the Tyrians from drawing water. This
they endured for 5 years, drinking from the wells sunk."

The Tyrian annalist does not relate the sequel. He does not venture to
say that the Assyrian King gave up the siege, but, having made the most
of their resistance, breaks off the account. The Assyrian inscriptions
say, that Sargon took Tyre , and received tribute from Cyprus, where a
monument has been found, bearing the name of Sargon . It is not probable
that a monarch who took Samaria and Ashdod, received tribute from Egypt,
the "Chief of Saba," and "Queen of the Arabs," overran Hamath, Tubal,
Cilicia, Armenia, reduced Media, should have returned baffled, because
Tyre stood out a blockade for 5 years. Since Sargon wrested from Tyre
its newly-recovered Cyprus, its insular situation would not have
protected itself. Nebuchadnezzar took it after a 13 years' siege ([Eze
26:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007), see the notes at Isa. 23.md).

[Amos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 1:11</span></span>

Edom - God had impressed on Israel its relation of brotherhood to Edom.
Moses expressed it to Edom himself , and, after the suspicious refusal
of Edom to allow Israel to march on the highway through his territory,
he speaks as kindly of him, as before; "And when we passed by from our
brethren, the children of Esau" [Deu
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008.md). It was the unkindness of worldly
politics, and was forgiven. The religious love of the Egyptian and the
Edomite was, on distinct grounds, made part of the law. "Thou shalt not
abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an
Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land" [Deu
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md). The grandchild of an Egyptian or
of an Edomite was religiously to become as an Israelite [Deu
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md). Not a foot of Edomite territory
was Israel to appropriate, however provoked. It was God's gift to Edom,
as much as Canaan to Israel. "They shall be afraid of you, and ye shall
take exceeding heed to yourselves. Quarrel not with them, for I will
give you, of their land, no, not so much as the treading of the sole of
the foot, for I have given Mount Seir unto Esau for a possession" [Deu
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md).

From this time until that of Saul, there is no mention of Edom; only
that the Maonites and the Amalekites, who oppressed Israel [Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md); [Jdg
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012.md), were kindred tribes with Edom.
The increasing strength of Israel in the early days of Saul seems to
have occasioned a conspiracy against him, such as Asaph afterward
complains of; "They have said, come and let us cut them off from being a
nation, that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they
have consulted together with one consent, they are confederate against
Thee; the tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites; of Moab and the
Hagarenes; Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre; Assur also is joined with them; they have been an
arm to the children of Lot" [Psa
83:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004.md). Such a combination began
probably in the time of Saul. "He fought against all his enemies on
every side; against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against
the king of Edom, and against the Philistines" [Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md).

They were "his enemies," and that, round about, encircling Israel, as
hunters did their prey. "Edom," on the south and southeast; "Moab" and
"Ammon" on the east; the Syrians of "Zobah" on the north; the
Philistines on the west enclosed him as in a net, and he repulsed them
one by one. "Whichever why he turned, he worsted" them. It follows "he
delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them" [Sa1
14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048.md). The aggression was from Edom,
and that in combination with old oppressors of Israel, not from Saul .
The wars of Saul and of David were defensive wars. Israel was recovering
from a state of depression, not oppressing. "The valley of salt" [Sa2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013.md), where David defeated the
Edomites, was also doubtless within the borders of Judah, since "the
city of salt" was [Jos 15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md); and the
valley of salt was probably near the remarkable "mountain of salt," 5 56
miles long, near the end of the Dead Sea , which, as being Canaanite,
belonged to Israel. It was also far north of Kadesh, which was "the
utmost boundary" of Edom [Num 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md).

From that Psalm too of mingled thanksgiving and prayer which David
composed after the victory, "in the valley of salt" ([Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) title.md), it appears that, even
after that victory, David's army had not yet entered Edom. "Who will
bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?" [Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md). That same Psalm speaks of
grievous suffering before, "in" which God had "cast" them "off" and
"scattered" them; "made the earth tremble and cleft it;" so that "it
reeled" [Psa 60:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001.md), [Psa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010.md). Joab too had "returned" from
the war in the north against the Syrians of Mesopotamia, to meet the
Edomites. Whether in alliance with the Syrians, or taking advantage of
the absence of the main army there, the Edomites had inflicted some
heavy blow on Israel; a battle in which Abishai killed 18,000 men [Ch1
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md) had been indecisive. The
Edomites were relpalsed by the rapid counter-march of Joab. The victory,
according to the Psalm, was still incomplete [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md), [Ch1
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#005.md), [Ch1
18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009.md). David put "garrisons in Edom"
[Sa2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md), to restrain them from
further outbreaks. Joab avenged the wrong of the Edomites, conformably
to his character [Kg1 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#016.md); but the
fact that "the captain of the host" had "to go up to bury the slain"
([Kg1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md). It should be rendered,
not, after he had slain, but, and he killed, etc.), shows the extent of
the deadly blow, which he so fearfully avenged.

The store set by the king of Egypt on Hadad, the Edomite prince who fled
to him [Kg1 11:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md), shows how gladly
Egypt employed Edom as an enemy to Israel. It has been said that he
rebelled and failed . Else it remained under a dependent king appointed
by Judah, for 1 12 century ([Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047.md); [Kg2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009) ff.md). One attempt against Judah is
recorded [Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md), when those of
Mount Seir combined with Moab and Ammon against Jehoshaphat after his
defeat at Ramoth-gilead. They had penetrated beyond Engedi [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md), [Ch2
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#016.md), [Ch2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md), on the road which Arab
marauders take now , toward the wilderness of Tekoa, when God set them
against one another, and they fell by each other's hands [Ch2
20:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md). But Jehoshaphat's prayer at
this time evinces that Israel's had been a defensive warfare. Otherwise,
he could not have appealed to God, "the children of Ammon and Moab and
mount Seir, whom Thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out
of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not,
behold, they reward us, to come to cast us out of Thy possession, which
Thou hast given us to inherit" [Ch2
20:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md).

Judah held Edom by aid of garrisons, as a wild beast is held in a cage,
that they might not injure them, but had taken no land from them, nor
expelled them. Edom sought to cast Israel out of God's land. Revolts
cannot be without bloodshed; and so it is perhaps the more probable,
that the words of Joel, "for the violence against the children of Judah,
because they have shed innocent blood in their land" [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019.md), relate to a massacre of the
Jews, when Esau revolted from Jehoram [Kg2
8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md). We have seen, in the Indian
Massacres, how every living being of the ruling power may, on such
occasions, be sought out for destruction. Edom gained its independence,
and Jehoram, who sought to recover his authority, escaped with his life
by cutting through the Edomite army by night [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md). Yet in Amaziha's time they were
still on the offensive, since the battle wherein he defeated them, was
again "in the valley of salt" [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); [Ch2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011.md), [Ch2
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md).

Azariah, in whose reign Amos prophesied, regained Elath from them, the
port for the Indian trade [Ch2 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002.md).
Of the origin of that war, we know nothing; only the brief words as to
the Edomite invasion against Ahaz, "and yet again had the Edomites come,
and smitten in Judah, and carried captive a captivity" [Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md), attest previous and, it may be,
habitual invasions. For no one such invasion had been named. It may
probably mean, "they did yet again, what they had been in the habit of
doing." But in matter of history, the prophets, in declaring the grounds
of God's judgments, supply much which it was not the object of the
historical books to relate. "They" are histories of God's dealings with
His people, His chastisements of them or of His sinful instruments in
chastising them. Rarely, except when His supremacy was directly
challenged, do they record the ground of the chastisements of pagan
nations. Hence, to those who look on the surface only, the wars of the
neighboring nations against Israel look but like the alternations of
peace and war, victory and defeat, in modern times. The prophets draw up
the veil, and show us the secret grounds of man's misdeeds and God's
judgments.

Because he did pursue his brother - The characteristic sin of Edom, and
its punishment are one main subject of the prophecy of Obadiah,
inveterate malice contrary to the law of kindred. Eleven hundred years
had passed since the birth of their forefathers, Jacob and Esan. But,
with God, eleven hundred years had not worn out kindred. He who willed
to knit together all creation, human beings and angels, in one in Christ
[Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md), and, as a means of union,
"made of one blood all nations of people for to dwell on all the face of
the earth" [Act 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md), used all sorts
of ways to impress this idea of brotherhood. "We" forget relationship
mostly in the third generation, often sooner; and we think it strange
when a nation long retains the memories of those relationships . God, in
His law, stamped on His people's minds those wider meanings. To slay a
man was to slay a "brother" [Gen 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005.md).

Even the outcast Canaan was a brother [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md) to Shem and Ham. Lot speaks to
the men of Sodom amidst their iniquities, "my brethren" [Gen
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#007.md); Jacob so salutes those unknown
to him [Gen 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004.md). The descendants of
Ishmael and Isaac were to be brethren; so were those of Esau and Jacob
[Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md); [Gen
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018.md). The brotherhood of blood was
not to wear out, and there was to be a brotherhood of love also [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md), [Gen
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037.md). Every Israelite was a brother ;
each tribe was a brother to every other [Deu
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009.md); [Deu
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#002.md); [Jdg
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#023.md), [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md); the force of the appeal was
remembered, even when passion ran high [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md). It enters habitually into the
divine legislation. "Thou shall open thy hand wide unto thy brother [Deu
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md); if thy brother, a" Hebrew, sell
himself to thee [Deu 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md); thou shalt
not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from
them [Deu 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md); if thy brother be
waxen poor, then shalt thou relieve him, though a stranger and a
sojourner, that he may live with thee" ([Lev
25:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035.md); add [Lev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md); [Deu
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007.md), [Deu
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md), [Deu
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#014).md).

In that same law, Edom's relationship as a brother was acknowledged. It
was an abiding law that Israel was not to take land, nor to refuse to
admit him into the congregation of the Lord. Edom too remembered the
relation, but to hate him. The nations around Israel seem to have been
little at war with one another, bound together by common hatred against
God's people. Of their wars indeed we should not hear, for they had no
religious interest. They would be but the natural results of the
passions of unregenerate nature. Feuds there doubtless were and forays,
but no attempts at permanent conquest or subdual. Their towns remain in
their own possession . Tyre does not invade Philistia; nor Philistia,
Tyre or Edom. But all combine against Israel. The words, "did pursue his
brother with the sword," express more than is mentioned in the
historical books.

To "pursue" is more than to fight. They followed after, in order to
destroy a remnant, "and cast off all pity:" literally, and more
strongly, "corrupted his compassions, tendernesses." Edom did violence
to his natural feelings, as Ezekiel, using the same word, says of Tyre,
"corrupting [Eze 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017.md) his wisdom,"
that is, perverting it from the end for which God gave it, and so
destroying it. Edom "steeled himself," as we say, against his better
feelings," his better nature," "deadened" them. But so they do not live
again. Man is not master of the life and death of his feelings, anymore
than of his natural existence. He can destroy; he cannot re-create. And
he does, so far, "corrupt," decay, do to death, his own feelings,
whenever, in any signal instance, he acts against them. Edom was not
simply unfeeling. He destroyed all "his tender yearnings" over
suffering, such as God has put into every human heart, until it destroys
them. Ordinary anger is satisfied and slaked by its indulgence; malice
is fomented and fed and invigorated by it. Edom ever, as occasion
gratified his anger; "his anger did tear continually;" yet, though
raging as some wild ravening animal, without control, "he kept his wrath
for ever," not within bounds, but to let it loose anew. He retained it
when he ought to have parted with it, and let it loose when he ought to
have restrained it.

"What is best, when spoiled, becomes the worst," is proverbial truth. :
"As no love wellnigh is more faithful than that of brothers, so no
hatred, when it hath once begun, is more unjust, no odium fiercer.
Equality stirs up and inflames the mind; the shame of giving way and the
love of preeminence is the more inflamed, in that the memory of infancy
and whatever else would seem to gender good will, when once they are
turned aside from the right path, produce hatred and contempt." They
were proverbial sayings of paganism, "fierce are the wars of brethren" ,
and "they who have loved exceedingly, they too hate exceedingly." : "The
Antiochi, the Seleuci, the Gryphi, the Cyziceni, when they learned not
to be all but brothers, but craved the purple and diadems, overwhelmed
themselves and Asia too with many calamities."

[Amos 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 1:12</span></span>

But - (And I, in My turn and as a consequence of these sins) will send a
fire upon Teman "Teman," say Eusebius and Jerome , "was a country of the
princes of Edom, which had its name from Teman son of Eliphaz, son of
Esau [Gen 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011.md), [Gen
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md). But even to this day there is a
village, called Teman, about 5 (Eusebius says 15) miles from Petra,
where there is also a Roman garrison, from which place was Eliphaz, king
of the Themanites." It is, however, probably the district which is
meant, of which Bozra was then the capital. For Amos when speaking of
cities, uses some word to express this, as "the palaces of Benhadad, the
wall of Gaza, of Tyrus, of Rabbah;" here he simply uses the name Teman,
as he does those of Moab and Judah. Amos does not mention Petra, or
Selah, for Amaziah had taken it, and called it Joktheel, "which God
subdued," which name it for some time retained [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md).

Bozrah - (Literally, which cuts off approach) is mentioned, as early as
Genesis [Gen 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033.md), as the seat of one
of the elective kings who, in times before Moses, reigned over Edom. It
lay then doubtless in Idumea itself, and is quite distinct from the
Bozrah of Hauran or Auranitis, from which Jerome also distinguishes it.
: "There is another Bosor also, a city of Esau, in the mountains of
Idumea, of which Isaiah speaks." There is yet a small village of the
like name (Busaira "the little Bozrah") which "appears," it is said ,
"to have been in ancient times a considerable city, if we may judge from
the ruins which surround the village." It has now "some 50 houses, and
stands on an elevation, on the summit of which a small castle has been
built." The name however, "little Bozrah," indicates the existence of a
"great Bozrah," with which its name is contrasted, and is not likely to
have been the place itself . Probably the name was a common one, "the
strong place" of its neighborhood . The Bozrah of Edom is either that
little vilage, or is wholly blotted out.

[Amos 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 1:13</span></span>

Ammon - These who receive their existence under circumstances, in any
way like those of the first forefathers of Moab and Ammon, are known to
be under physical as well as intellectual and moral disadvantages. Apart
from the worst horrors, on the one side reason was stupefied, on the
other it was active in sin. He who imprinted His laws on nature, has
annexed the penalty to the infraction of those laws. It is known also
how, even under the Gospel, the main character of a nation remains
unchanged. The basis of natural character, upon which grace has to act,
remains, under certain limits, the same. Still more in the unchanging
east. Slave-dealers know of certain hereditary good or evil qualities in
non-Christian nations in whom they traffic. What marvel then that Ammon
and Moab retained the stamp of their origin, in a sensual or passionate
nature? Their choice of their idols grew out of this original character
and aggravated it.

They chose them gods like themselves, and worsened themselves by copying
these idols of their sinful nature. The chief god of the fierce Ammon
was Milehem or Molech, the principle of destruction, who was appeased
with sacrifices of living children, given to the fire to devour. Moab,
beside its idol Chemosh, had the degrading worship of Baal Peor [Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md), reproductiveness the
counterpart of destruction. And, so. in fierce or degrading rites, they
worshiped the power which belongs to God, to create, or to destroy. Moab
was the seducer of Israel at Shittim [Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md). Ammon, it has been noticed,
showed at different times a special wanton ferocity . Such was the
proposal of Nahash to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, when offering to
surrender, "that I may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a
reproach unto all Israel" [Sa1 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md).

Such was the insult to David's messengers of peace, and the hiring of
the Syrians in an aggressive war against David [Sa2
10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md). Such, again, was this war of
extermination against the Gileadites. On Israel's side, the relation to
Moab and Ammon had been altogether friendly. God recalled to Israel the
memory of their common descent, and forbade them to war against either.
He speaks of them by the name of kindness, "the children of Lot," the
companion and friend of Abraham. "I will not give thee of their land for
a possession, because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
possession" [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md). Akin by descent, their history
had been alike. Each had driven out a giant tribe; Moab, the Emim;
Ammon, the Zamzummim [Deu 2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md),
[Deu 2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md). They had thus possessed
themselves of the tract from the Arnon, not quite half way down the Dead
Sea on its east side, to the Jabbok, about half-way between the Dead Sea
and the Sea of Galilee . Both had been expelled by the Amorites, and had
been driven, Moab, behind the Arnon, Ammon, behind the "strong border"
[Num 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md) of the upper part of the
Jabbok, what is now the Nahr Amman, "the river of Ammon," eastward.

The whole of what became the inheritance of the 2 12 tribes, was in the
hands of the Amorites, and threatened very nearly their remaining
possessions; since, at "Aroer that is before Rabbah" [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md), the Amorites were already over
against the capital of Ammon; at the Arnon they were but 2 12 hours from
Ar-Moab, the remaining capital of Moab. Israel then, in destroying the
Amorites, had been at once avenging and rescuing Moab and Ammon; and it
is so far a token of friendliness at this time, that, after the victory
at Edrei, the great "iron bedstead" of Og was placed in "Rabbah of the
children of Ammon" [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md). Envy,
jealousy, and fear, united them to "hire Balaam to curse Israel" [Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md), although the king of Moab was
the chief actor in this Num. 22-24, as he was in the seduction of Israel
to idoltary [Num 25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md). Probably Moab
was then, and continued to be, the more influential or the more
powerful, since in their first invasion of Israel, the Ammonites came as
the allies of Eglon king of Moab. "He gathered unto him the children of
Ammon and Amalek [Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md). And" they
"served Eglon." Yet Ammon's subsequent oppression must have been yet
more grievous, since God reminds Israel of His delivering them from the
Ammonites [Jdg 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md), not from Moab.
There we find Ammon under a king, and in league with the Philistines
[Jdg 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md), "crashing and crushing for
18 years all the children of Israel in Gilead." The Ammonites carried a
wide invasion across the Jordan against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim [Jdg
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#009.md), until they were subdued by
Jephthah. Moab is not named; but the king of Ammon claims as my land
[Jdg 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md), the whole which Moab and
Ammon had lost to the Amorites and they to Israel, "from Arnon unto
Jabbok and unto Jordan" [Jdg 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md).

The range also of Jephthah's victories included probably all that same
country from the Arnon to the neighborhood of Rabbah of Ammon . The
Ammonites, subdued then, were again on the offensive in the fierce siege
of Jabesh-Gilead and against Saul (see above the note at [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md). Yet it seems that they had
already taken from Israel what they had lost to the Amorites, for
Jabesh-Gilead was beyond the Jabbok ; and "Mizpeh of Moab," where David
went to seek the king of Moab [Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md), was probably no other than the
Ramoth-Mizpeh [Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md) of Gad, the
Mizpeh [Jdg 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md) from where Jephthah
went over to fight the Ammonites. With Hanan, king of Ammon, David
sought to remain at peace, on account of some kindness, interested as it
probably was, which his father Nahash had shown him, when persecuted by
Saul [Sa2 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md).

It was only after repeated attempts to bring an overwhelming force of
the Syriains against David, that Rabbah was besieged and taken, and that
awful punishment inflicted. The severity of the punishment inflicted on
Moab and Ammon, in that two-thirds of the fighting men of Moab were put
to death [Sa2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md), and fighting men of
"the cities of Ammon" [Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md) were
destroyed by a ghastly death, so different from David's treatment of the
Philistines or the various Syrians, implies some extreme hostility on
their part, from which there was no safety except in their destruction.
Moab and Ammon were still united against Jehoshaphat 2 Chr. 20, and with
Nebuchadnezzar against Jehoiakim [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md), whom they had before sought to
stir up against the king of Babylon [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md). Both profited for a time by the
distresses of Israel, "magnifying" themselves "against her border" [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md), and taking possession of her
cities after the 2 12 tribes has been carried away by Tiglath-pileser.
Both united in insulting Judah, and (as it appears from Ezekiel [Eze
25:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#002).md), out of jealousy against its
religious distinction.

When some of the scattered Jews were reunited under Gedaliah, after the
destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, it was a king of Ammon,
Baalis, who instigated Johanan to murder him [Jer
40:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011.md); [Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010.md). When Jerusalem was to be
rebuilt after the return from the captivity, Ammonites and Moabites [Neh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md), [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md); [Neh
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md), "Sanballat the Horonite" (that
is, out of Horonaim, which Moab had taken to itself [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md); [Jer
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003.md), [Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md), [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034)..md) "and Tobiah the servant, the
Ammonite," were chief in the opposition to it. They helped on the
persecution by Antiochus (1 Macc. 5:6). Their anti-religious character,
which showed itself in the hatred of Israel and the hire of Balaam, was
the ground of the exclusion of both from admission "into the
congregation of the Lord forever" [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md). The seduction of Solomon by his
Ammonite and Moabite wives illustrates the infectiousness of their
idolatry. While he made private chapels "for all his strange wives, to
burn incense and sacrifice to their gods" [Kg1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#008.md), the most stately idolatry was
that of Chemosh and Molech, the abomination of Moab and Ammon . For
Ashtoreth alone, besides these, did Solomon build high places in sight
of the temple of God, on a lower part of the Mount of Olives [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013.md).

They have ripped up the women with child in Gilead - Since Elisha
prophesied that Hazael would be guilty of this same atrocity, and since
Gilead was the scene of his chief atrocities , probably Syria and Ammon
were, as of old, united against Israel in a war of extermination. It was
a conspiracy to displace God's people from the land which He had given
them, and themselves to replace them. The plan was effective; it was,
Amos says, executed. They expelled and "inherited Gad" [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md). Gilead was desolated for the
sins for which Hosea rebuked it; "blood had blood." It had been "tracked
with blood" (see the note at [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008).md); now life was sought out for
destruction, even in the mother's womb. But, in the end, Israel, whose
extermination Ammon devised and in part effected, survived. Ammon
perished and left no memorial.

That they might enlarge their border - It was a horror, then, exercised,
not incidentally here and there, or upon a few, or in sudden stress of
passion, but upon system and in cold blood. We have seen lately, in the
massacres near Lebanon, where male children were murdered on system, how
methodically such savageness goes to work. A massacre, here and there,
would not have "enlarged their border." They must haw carried on these
horrors then, throughout all the lands which they wished to possess,
making place for themselves by annihilating Israel, that there might be
none to rise up and thrust them from their conquests, and claim their
old inheritance. Such was the fruit of habitually indulged covetousness.
Yet who beforehand would have thought it possible?

[Amos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 1:14</span></span>

I will kindle afire in the wall of Rabbah - Rabbah, literally, "the
great," called by Moses "Rabbah of the children of Ammon" [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md), and by later Greeks,
"Rabathammana" , was a strong city with a yet stronger citadel. Ruins
still exist, some of which probably date back to these times. The lower
city "lay in a valley bordered on both sides by barren hills of flint,"
at 12 an hour from its entrance. It lay on a stream, still called by its
name Moyet or Nahr Amman, "waters" or "river of Ammon," which ultimately
falls into the Zurka (the Jabbok) . "On the top of the highest of the
northern hills," where at the divergence of two valleys it abuts upon
the ruins of the town, "stands the castle of Ammon, a very extensive
rectangular building," following the shape of the hill and wholly
occupying its crest. "Its walls are thick, and denote a remote
antiquity; large blocks of stone are piled up without cement, and still
hold together as well as if they had been recently placed; the greater
part of the wall is entire. Within the castle are several deep
cisterns."

There are remains of foundations of a wall of the lower city at its
eastern extremity . This lower city, as lying on a river in a waterless
district, was called the "city of waters" [Sa2
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027.md), which Joab had taken when he
sent to David to come and besiege the Upper City. In later times, that
Upper City was resolutely defended against Antiochus the Great, and
taken, not by force but by thirst . On a conspicuous place on this
castle-hill, stood a large temple, some of its broken columns 3 12 feet
in diameter , probably the Grecian successor of the temple of its idol
Milchom. Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, cannot have escaped, when
Nebuchadnezzar , "in the 5th year of his reign, led an army against
Coele-Syria, and, having possessed himself of it, warred against the
Ammonites and Moabites, and having made all these nations subject to
him, invaded Egypt, to subdue it."

Afterward, it was tossed to and fro in the desolating wars between Syria
and Egypt. Ptolemy II called it from his own surname Philadelphia , and
so probably had had to restore it. It brought upon itself the attack of
Antiochus III and its own capture, by its old habit of marauding against
the Arabs in alliance with him. At the time of our Lord, it, with
"Samaria, Galilee and Jericho," is said by a pagan to be "inhabited by a
mingled race of Egyptians, Arabians and Phoenicians." It had probably
already been given over to "the children of the East," the Arabs, as
Ezekiel had foretold [Eze 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md). In
early Christian times Milchom was still worshiped there under its Greek
name of Hercules . Trajan recovered it to the Roman empire , and in the
4th century it, with Bostra , was still accounted a "vast town most
secured by strong walls," as a frontier fortress "to repel the
incursions of neighboring nations." It was counted to belong to Arabia .
An Arabic writer says that it perished before the times of Muhammed, and
covered a large tract with its ruins . It became a station of pilgrims
to Mecca, and then, until now, as Ezekiel foretold , a stable for camels
and a couching place.

I will kindle a fire in the wall - It may be that the prophet means to
speak of some conflagration from within, in that he says not, as
elsewhere, "I will send afire upon," but, "I will kindle a fire in" [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md), [Amo
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007.md), [Amo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md), [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md); [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md), [Amo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md). But "the shouting" is the
battle-cry ([Job 39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025.md); [Jer
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016.md); [Zep
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016), etc..md) of the victorious enemy,
the cheer of exultation, anticipating its capture. That onslaught was to
be resistless, sweeping, like a whirlwind, all before it. The fortress
and walls of Rabbah were to yield before the onset of the enemy, as the
tents of their caravans were whirled flat on the ground before the
eddying of the whirlwinds from the desert, burying all beneath them.

[Amos 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 1:15</span></span>

And their king - The king was commonly, in those nations, the center of
their energy. When "he and his princes" were "gone into captivity,"
there was no one to make head against the conqueror, and renew revolts.
Hence, as a first step in the subdual, the reigning head and those who
shared his counsels were removed. Ammon then, savage as it was in act,
was no ill-organized horde. On the contrary, barren and waste as all
that country now is, it must once have been highly cultivated by a
settled and laborious people. The abundance of its ruins attests the
industry and habits of the population. "The whole of the country," says
Burckhardt , "must have been extremely well cultivated, to have afforded
subsistence to the inhabitants of so many towns." "The low hills are,
for the most part, crowned with ruins." Of the "thirty ruined or
deserted places, which including Amman," have been even lately "counted
east of Assalt" (the village which probably represents Ramoth-Gilead,
"about 16 miles west of Philadelphia that is, Amman) several are in
Ammonitis. Little as the country has been explored, ruins of large and
important towns have been found south-southeast. and south of Amman .

Two hours southeast of Amman, Buckingham relates , "an elevation opened
a new view before us, in the same direction. On a little lower level,
was a still more extensive track of cultivated plain than that even
which we had already passed - Throughout its whole extent were seen
ruined towns in every direction, both before, behind, and on each side
of us; generally seated on small eminences; all at a short distance from
each other; and all, as far as we had yet seen, bearing evident marks of
former opulency and consideration. There was not a tree in sight as far
as the eye could reach; but my guide, who had been over every part of
it, assured me that the whole of the plain was covered with the finest
soil, and capable of being made the most productive grain-land in the
world - For a space of more than thirty miles there did not appear to me
a single interruption of hill, rock or wood, to impede immediate
tillage.

The great plain of Esdraelon, so justly celebrated for its extent and
fertility, is inferior in both to this plain of Belkah. Like Esdraelon,
it appears to have been once the seat of an active and numerous
population; but in the former the monuments of the dead only remain,
while here the habitations of the living are equally mingled with the
tombs of the departed, all thickly strewn over every part of the soil
from which they drew their sustenance." Nor does the crown, of a "talent
of gold weight, with precious stones" [Sa2
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md), belong to an uncivilized
people. Such hordes too depend on the will and guidance of their single
Skeikh or head. This was a hereditary kingdom [Sa2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md). The kings of Ammon had their
constitutional advisers. These were they who gave the evil and
destructive counsel to insult the ambassadors of David. Evil kings have
evermore evil counselors. It is ever the curse of such kings to have
their own evil, reflected, anticipated, fomented, enacted by bad
advisers around them. "Hand in hand the wicked shall not be unpunished"
[Pro 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021.md). They link together, but to
drag one another into a common destruction. Together they had counseled
against God; "king and princes together," they should go into captivity.

There is also doubtless, in the word Malcham, a subordinate allusion to
the god whom they worshiped under the title Molech or Malchom. Certainly
Jeremiah "seems" so to have understood it. For, having said of Moab,
"Chemosh shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together"
[Jer 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md), he says as to Ammon, in the
self-same formula and almost in the words of Amos ; "Malcham shall go
into captivity, his priests and his princes together." Zephaniah [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md) also speaks of the idol under the
same name Malcham, "their king." Yet since Ammon had kings before this
time, and just before their subdual by Nebuchadnezzar, and king Baalis
[Jer 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014.md) was a murderer, it is
hardly likely that Jeremiah too should not have included him in the
sentence of his people, of whose sins he was a mainspring. Probably,
then, Amos and Jeremiah foretell, in a comprehensive way, the
powerlessness of all their stays, human and idolatrous. All in which
they trusted should not only fail them, but should be carried captive
from them.
