Heritage

### [Proverbs Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 2:1</span></span>

Now in the divine order comes the promise [Pro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md). The conditions of its fulfillment
are stated in [Pro 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md) in four sets
of parallel clauses, each with some shade of distinct meaning. Thus, not
"receiving" only, but "hiding" or treasuring up - not the "ear" only,
but the "heart" - not the mere "cry," but the eager "lifting up the
voice."

[Proverbs 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 2:4</span></span>

Note the illustrations.

\(1\) Contact with Phoenician commerce, and joint expeditions in ships
of Tarshish (see [Psa 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010) note.md), had
made the Israelites familiar with the risks and the enterprise of the
miller's life. Compare Job 28:

\(2\) The treasure hidden in a field, is the second point of comparison.
Such treasure-seeking has always been characteristic of the East.
Compare [Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md).

[Proverbs 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 2:5</span></span>

The promise. The highest blessedness is to know God [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md). If any distinction between "the
Lord" יהוה yehovâh and "God" אלהים 'elohı̂ym can be pressed here, it is
that in the former the personality, in the latter the glory, of the
divine nature is prominent.

[Proverbs 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 2:6</span></span>

People do not gain wisdom by any efforts of their own, but God gives it
according to the laws of His own goodness.

[Proverbs 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 2:7</span></span>

Sound wisdom - "Soundness," an idea which passes on into that of health
and safety. Compare "sound doctrine" in [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md).

[Proverbs 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 2:8</span></span>

saints - The devout and God-fearing. Compare [Psa
85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md) etc. The occurrence of the word
here, in a book that became more and more prominent as prophetic
utterances ceased, probably helped to determine its application in the
period of the Maccabean struggles to those who especially claimed for
themselves the title of "devout" (Chasidim, the ̓Ασιδαῖοι Asidaioi of 1
Macc. 7:13).

[Proverbs 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 2:10</span></span>

Another picture of the results of living in the fear of the Lord. Not
that to which it leads a man, but that from which it saves him, is
brought into view. Notice also that it is one thing for wisdom to find
entrance into the soul, another to be welcomed as a "pleasant" guest.

[Proverbs 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 2:12</span></span>

The evil-doers here include not robbers and murderers only [Pro
1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#010.md), but all who leave the
straight path and the open day for crooked ways, perverse counsels,
deeds of darkness. "To delight etc." [Pro
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014.md) is the lowest depth of all.

[Proverbs 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 2:16</span></span>

The second great evil, the warnings against which are frequent (see the
marginal reference). Two words are used to describe the class.

\(1\) "The strange woman" is one who does not belong to the family, one
who by birth is outside the covenant of Israel.

\(2\) "The stranger" is none other than a foreigner.

It is the word used of the "strange" wives of Solomon [Kg1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md), [Kg1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#008.md), and of those of the Jews who
returned from Babylon (Ezra 10; passim). The two words together, in
connection with those which follow, and which imply at once marriage and
a profession of religious faith, point to some interesting facts in the
social history of Israel. Whatever form the sin here referred to had
assumed before the monarchy (and the Book of Judges testifies to its
frequency), the contact with Phoenicians and other nations under Solomon
had a strong tendency to increase it. The king's example would naturally
be followed, and it probably became a fashion to have foreign wives and
concubines. At first, it would seem, this was accompanied by some show
of proselytism [Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md); but the old
pagan leaven (influence) presently broke out; the sensual worship of
other gods led the way to a life of harlotry. The stringent laws of the
Mosaic code [Lev 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029.md); [Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md); [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md) probably deterred the women of
Israel from that sin, and led to a higher standard of purity among them
than prevailed among other nations.

Most interpreters have, however, generalized the words as speaking of
any adulteress. The Septuagint as if reluctant to speak of facts so
shameful, has allegorized them, and seen in the temptress the
personification of "evil counsel."

[Proverbs 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 2:17</span></span>

The guide of her youth - Better, the familiar friend (compare [Pro
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028.md); [Pro
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009).md). The "friend" is, of course, the
husband, or the man to whom the strange woman first belonged as a
recognized concubine. Compare [Jer 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004.md)

The covenant of her God - The sin of the adulteress is not against man
only but against the Law of God, against His covenant. The words point
to some religious formula of espousals. Compare [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md).

[Proverbs 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 2:18</span></span>

The house of the adulteress is as Hades, the realm of death, haunted by
the spectral shadows of the dead (Rephaim, see the [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010) note.md), who have perished there.

[Proverbs 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 2:19</span></span>

The words describe more than the fatal persistency of the sinful habit
when once formed. A resurrection from that world of the dead to "the
paths of life" is all but impossible.

[Proverbs 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 2:20</span></span>

The previous picture of shame and sin is brought before the disciple as
an incentive to a better course.

[Proverbs 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 2:21</span></span>

Noticeable here is the Hebrew love of home and love of country. To
"dwell in the land" is (compare [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md); [Lev
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#018), etc..md) the highest blessing for
the whole people and for individual men. contrast with it is the life of
the sinner cut off from the land (not "earth") of his fathers.
