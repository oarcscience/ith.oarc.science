### [Job Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#001.md)

[Job 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 8:1</span></span>

Then answered Bildad the Shuhite - ; see the notes at [Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md).

[Job 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 8:2</span></span>

How long wilt thou speak these things? - The flyings of murmuring and
complaint, such as he had uttered in the previous chapters.

The words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? - The Syriac and Arabic
(according to Walton) render this, "the spirit of pride fill thy mouth."
The Septuagint renders it, "The spirit of thy mouth is profuse of words"
- πολυῤῥῆμον polurrēmon. But the common rendering is undoubtedly
correct, and the expression is a very strong and beautiful one. His
language of complaint and murmuring was like a tempest. It swept over
all barriers, and disregarded all restraint. The same figure is found in
Aristophanes, Ran. 872, as quoted by Schultens, Τυφὼς ἐχβαίειν
παρασκενάξεται Tuphōs ekbainein paraskeuacetai - a tempest of words is
preparing to burst forth. And in Silius Italicus, xxi. 581:

\- qui tanta superbo

Facta sonas ore, et spumanti turbine perflas

Ignorantum aures.

The Chaldee renders it correctly רבא זעפא - a great tempest.

[Job 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 8:3</span></span>

Doth God pervert judgment? - That is, Does God afflict people unjustly?
Does he show favor to the evil, and punish the good? Bildad here
undoubtedly refers to Job, and supposes that he had brought this charge
against God. But he had not done it in so many words. He had complained
of the severity of his sufferings, and had indulged in irreverent
language toward God. But he had not advanced the charge openly that God
had perverted right. Bildad strenuously maintains that God would do
right. His argument is based on the supposition that God would deal with
people in this life according to their character; and thus he infers
that Job must have been guilty of some great wickedness, that punishment
should come upon him in this manner.

[Job 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 8:4</span></span>

If thy children have sinned against him - Bildad here assumes that the
children of Job had been wicked, and had been cut off in their sins.
This must have cut him to the quick, for there was nothing which a
bereaved father would feel more acutely than this. The meaning here is
somewhat weakened by the word "if." The Hebrew אם 'ı̂m is rather to be
taken in the sense of "since" - assuming it as an indisputable point, or
taking it for granted. It was not a supposition that if they should now
do it, certain other consequences would follow; but the idea is, that
since they had been cut off in their sins, if Job would even now seek
God with a proper spirit, he might be restored to prosperity, though his
beginning should be small; [Job 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007.md).

And he have cast them away - Bildad supposes that they had been disowned
by God, and had been put to death.

For their transgression - Margin, in the hand of their. The Hebrew is,
by the hand of their transgression; i. e, their sin has been the cause
of it, or it has been by the instrumentality of their sin. What
foundation Bildad had for this opinion, derived from the life and
character of the sons of Job, we have no means of ascertaining. The
probability is, however, that he had learned in general that they had
been cut off; and that, on the general principle which he maintained,
that God deals with men in this life according to their character, he
inferred that they must have been distinguished for wickedness. Men not
unfrequently argue in this way when sudden calamity comes upon others.

[Job 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 8:5</span></span>

If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes - If thou wouldest do it now. If
even on the supposition that your sons have thus perished, and that God
has come out in judgment against your family, you would look to God, you
might be restored to favor. The word rendered "seek betimes" (שׁחר
shâchar) means literally to seek in the morning, to seek early; and
then, to make it the first business. It is derived from the word meaning
aurora (שׁחר shachar) and has reference to the early light of the
morning, and hence, to an early seeking. It may be applied to seeking
him in early life, or as the first thing - looking to him immediately
when help is needed, or before we apply to anyone else; compare [Pro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#015.md); [Pro
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md); [Pro
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024.md); [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005.md); [Psa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md); [Psa
78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034.md); [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md); [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md); compare the advice of Eliphaz,
[Job 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#008.md).

[Job 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 8:6</span></span>

If thou wert pure and upright - There is something especially severe and
caustic in this whole speech of Bildad. He first assumes that the
children of Job were cut off for impiety, and then takes it for granted
that Job himself was not a pure and upright man. This inference he seems
to have derived partly from the fact that he had been visited with so
heavy calamities, and partly from the sentiments which Job had himself
expressed. Nothing could be more unjust and severe, however, than to
take it for granted that he was a hypocrite, and then proceed to argue
as if that were a settled point. He does not make it a supposition that
possibly Job might have erred - which would not have been improper; but
he proceeds to argue as if it were a point about which there could be no
hesitation.

He would awake for thee - He would arouse or excite himself יעיר yā‛ı̂r
on thy account. The image is that of arousing oneself from sleep or
inactivity to aid another; and the idea is, that God had, as it were,
slumbered over the calamities of Job, or had suffered them to come
without interposing to prevent them, but that he would arouse himself if
Job were pure, and would call upon him for aid.

And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous - That is, if
thy habitation should become righteous now, he would make it prosperous.
Hitherto, is the idea of Bildad, it has been a habitation of wickedness.
Thy children have been wicked, and are now cut off. Thou thyself hast
been a wicked man, and in consequence art afflicted. If now thou
wouldest become pure and seek unto God, then God would make thy
habitation prosperous. What could more try the patience of a sufferer
than such cold and unfeeling insinuations? And what could more
beautifully illustrate the nature of true courtesy, than to sit unmoved
and hear such remarks? It was by forbearance in such circumstances
eminently that Job showed his extraordinary patience.

[Job 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 8:7</span></span>

Though thy beginning was small - On the supposition that the children of
Job had been cut off, his family now was small. Yet Bildad says, that if
he were to begin life again, even with so small a family, and in such
depressed and trying circumstances, if he were a righteous man he might
hope for returning prosperity.

Yet thy latter end - From this, it is evident that Job was not now
regarded as an old man. He would still have the prospect of living many
years. Some have supposed, however that the meaning here is, that his
former prosperity should appear small compared with that which he would
hereafter enjoy if he were pure and righteous. So Noyes and Rosenmuller
interpret it. But it seems to me that the former interpretation is the
correct one. Bildad utters a general sentiment, that though when a man
begins life he has a small family and little property, yet if he is an
upright man, he will be prospered and his possessions will greatly
increase; compare [Job 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012.md) : "Yahweh
blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning."

[Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 8:8</span></span>

For inquire thee of the former age - That is, attend to the results of
observation. Ask the generations which have passed, and who in their
poems and proverbs have left the records of their experience. The
sentiment which Bildad proposes to confirm by this appeal is, that
though the wicked should for a time flourish, yet they would be cut off,
and that the righteous, though they may be for a time afflicted, yet if
they seek God, they will ultimately prosper. It was common to make these
appeals to the ancients. The results of observation were embodied in
proverbs, parables, fables, and fragments of poems; and he was regarded
as among the wisest of men who had the fruits of these observations most
at command. To that Bildad appeals, and especially, as would appear, to
the fragment of an ancient poem which he proceeds to repeat, and which,
perhaps, is the oldest poem extant in any language.

And prepare thyself - Make an effort, or give diligent attention to it.

To the search of their fathers - Of the bygone generations, not only to
the age immediately past, but to their ancestors. He would bring the
results of the observation of far distant ages to confirm the sentiment
which he had advanced.

[Job 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 8:9</span></span>

For we are but of yesterday - That is, we are of short life. We have had
but few opportunities of observation compared with those who have gone
before us. There can be no doubt that Bildad here refers to the
longevity of the antecedent ages compared with the age of man at the
time when he lived; and the passage, therefore, is of importance in
order to fix the date of the poem. It shows that human life had been
reduced in the time of Job within comparatively moderate limits, and
that an important change had taken place in its duration. This reduction
began not long after the flood, and was probably continued gradually
until it reached the present limit of seventy years. This passage proves
that Job could not have lived in the time of the greatest longevity of
man; compare the Introduction, Section 3.

And know nothing - Margin, not. So the Hebrew literally, "we do not
know." The sense is, "we have had comparatively few opportunities for
observation. From the comparative brevity of our lives, we see but
little of the course of events. Our fathers lived through longer
periods, and could mark more accurately the result of human conduct."
One suggestion may be made here, perhaps of considerable importance in
explaining the course of argument in this book. The friends of Job
maintained that the righteous would be rewarded in this life, and that
the wicked would be overtaken by calamity. It may seem remarkable that
they should have urged this so strenuously, when in the actual course of
events as we now see them, there appears to be so slender a foundation
for it in fact. But may this not be accounted for by the remark of
Bildad in the verse under consideration? They appealed to their fathers.

They relied on the results of experience in those ancient times. When
people lived 900 or 1,000 years; when one generation was longer than
twelve generations are now, this fact would be much more likely to occur
than as human life is now ordered. Things would have time to work
themselves right. The wicked in that long tract of time would be likely
to be overtaken by disgrace and calamity, and the righteous would
outlive the detractions and calumnies of their enemies, and meet in
their old age with the ample rewards of virtue. Should people now live
through the same long period, the same thing substantially would occur.
A man's character, who is remembered at all, is fully established long
before a thousand years have elapsed, and posterity does justice to the
righteous and the wicked. If people lived during that time instead of
being merely remembered, the same thing would be likely to occur.
Justice would be done to character, and the world would, in general,
render to a man the honor which he deserved. This fact may have been
observed in the long lives of the people before the flood, and the
result of the observation may have been embodied in proverbs, fragments
of poems, and in traditionary sayings, and have been recorded by the
sages of Arabia as indubitable maxims. With these maxims they came to
the controversy with Job, and forgetful of the change necessarily made
by the abbreviation of human life, they proceed to apply their maxims
without mercy to him; and because he was overwhelmed with calamity, they
assumed that therefore he must have been a wicked man.

Our days upon earth are a shadow - Comparisons of this kind are quite
common in the Scriptures; see the notes at [Job
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006.md). A similar figure occurs in [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015.md) :

For we are strangers before thee,

And sojourners, as were all our fathers:

Our days upon earth are as a shadow,

Yea, there is no abiding.

An expression similar occurs in Aeschylus, Agam. v. 488, as quoted by
Drusius and Dr. Good:

\- εἴδωλον σκιᾶς eidōlon skias -

\- The image or semblance of a shade -

So in Pindar, man is called σκιᾶς ὄναρ skias onar - the dream of a
shade; and so by Sophocles, καπνοῦ σκιὰ kapnou skia - the shadow of
smoke. All these mean the same thing, that the life of man is brief and
transitory. Bildad designs to apply it not to man in general, but to the
age in which he lived, as being disqualified by the shortness of life to
make extended observations.

[Job 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 8:10</span></span>

Shall not they teach thee - The results of human conduct, and the great
principles on which God governs the world.

And utter words out of their heart - Dr. Good renders this,

"And well forth the sayings of their wisdom,"

And supposes it means that the words of wisdom would proceed from them
as water bubbles from a fountain. But this, I think, is a mere conceit.
The true sense is, that they would not speak that merely which comes
from the mouth, or that which comes upper most, and without reflection -
as the Greeks say, λέγειν πᾶν ὅ τι ἐπὶ στόμα ἔλθῃ legein pan ho ti epi
stoma elthē; or, as the Latins, Quicquid in buccam venerit loqui - to
speak whatever comes in the mouth; but they would utter that which came
from the heart - which was sincere, and the result of deep and prolonged
reflection. Perhaps, also, Bildad means to insinuate that Job had
uttered what was uppermost in his mind, without taking time for
reflection.

[Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 8:11</span></span>

Can the rush - This passage has all the appearance of being a fragment
of a poem handed down from ancient times. It is adduced by Bildad as an
example of the views of the ancients, and, as the connection would seem
to imply, as a specimen of the sentiments of those who lived before the
life of man had been abridged. It was customary in the early ages of the
world to communicate knowledge of all kinds by maxims, moral sayings,
and proverbs; by apothegms and by poetry handed down from generation to
generation. Wisdom consisted much in the amount of maxims and proverbs
which were thus treasured up; as it now consists much in the knowledge
which we have of the lessons taught by the past, and in the ability to
apply that knowledge to the various transactions of life. The records of
past ages constitute a vast storehouse of wisdom, and the present
generation is more wise than those which have gone before, only because
the results of their observations have been treasured up, and we can act
on their experience, and because we can begin where they left off, and,
taught by their experience, can avoid the mistakes which they made. The
word "rush" here גמא gôme' denotes properly a bulrush, and especially
the Egyptian papyrus - papyrus Nilotica; see the notes at [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md). It is derived from the verb גמא
gâmâ', to absorb, to drink up, and is given to this plant because it
absorbs or drinks up moisture. The Egyptians used it to make garments,
shoes, baskets, and especially boats or skiffs; Pithy, Nat. His. 13.
21-26; see the notes at [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md).
They also derived from it materials for writing - and hence, our word
paper. The Septuagint renders it here, πάπυρος papuros.

Without mire - Without moisture. It grew in the marshy places along the
Nile.

Can the flag - Another plant of a similar character. The word אחוּ
'âchû, flag, says Gesenius, is an Egyptian word, signifying marsh-grass,
reeds, bulrushes, sedge, everything which grows in wet grounds. The word
was adopted not only into the Hebrew, but also into the Greek idiom of
Alexandria, where it is written, ἄχι achi, ἄχει achei. Jerome says of
it, "When I inquired of the learned what this word meant, I heard from
the Egyptians, that by this name everything was intended in their
language which grew up in a pool." The word is synonymous with rush, or
bulrush, and denotes a plant which absorbs a great quantity of water.
What is the exact idea which this figure is designed to convey, is not
very clear. I think it probable that the whole description is intended
to represent a hypocrite, and that the meaning is, that he had in his
growth a strong resemblance to such a rush or reed. There was nothing
solid or substantial in his piety. It was like the soft, spongy texture
of the water-reed, and would wilt under trial, as the papyrus would when
deprived of water.

[Job 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 8:12</span></span>

Whilst it is yet in his greenness - That is, while it seems to be in its
vigor.

And is not cut down - Even when it is not cut down. If suffered to stand
by itself, and if undisturbed, it will wither away. The application of
this is obvious and beautiful. Such plants have no self sustaining
power. They are dependent on moisture for their support. If that is
withheld, they droop and die. So with the prosperous sinner and the
hypocrite. His piety, compared with that which is genuine, is like the
spongy texture of the paper-reed compared with the solid oak. He is
sustained in his professed religion by outward prosperity, as the rush
is nourished by moisture; and the moment his prosperity is withdrawn,
his religion droops and dies like the flag without water.

[Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 8:13</span></span>

So are the paths of all that forget God - This is clearly a part of the
quotation from the sayings of the ancients. The word "paths" here means
ways, acts, doings. They who forget God are like the paper-reed. They
seem to flourish, but they have nothing that is firm and substantial. As
the paper-reed soon dies, as the flag withers away before any other
herb, so it will be with the wicked, though apparently prosperous.

And the hypocrite's hope shall perish - This important sentiment, it
seems, was known in the earliest periods of the world; and if the
supposition above be correct, that this is a fragment of a poem which
had come down from far distant times, it was probably known before the
flood. The passage requires no particular philological explanation, but
it is exceedingly important. We may remark on it,

\(1\) That there were hypocrites even in that early age of the world.
They are confined to no period, or country, or religious denomination,
or profession. There are hypocrites in religion - and so there are in
politics, and in business, and in friendship, and in morals. There arc
pretended friends, and pretended patriots, and pretended lovers of
virtue, whose hearts are false and hol ow, just as there are pretended
friends of religion. Wherever there is genuine coin, it will be likely
to be counterfeited; and the fact of a counterfeit is always a tribute
to the intrinsic worth of the coin - for who would be at the pains to
counterfeit that which is worthless? The fact that there are hypocrites
in the church, is an involuntary tribute to the excellency of religion.

\(2\) The hypocrite has a hope of eternal life. This hope is founded on
various things. It may be on his own morality; it may be on the
expectation that he will be able to practice a deception; it may be on
some wholly false and unfounded view of the character and plans of God.
Or taking the word "hypocrite" in a larger sense to denote anyone who
pretends to religion and who has none, this hope may be founded on some
change of feeling which he has had, and which he mistook for religion;
on some supposed vision which he had of the cross or of the Redeemer, or
on the mere subsiding of the alarm which an awakened sinner experiences,
and the comparative peace consequent on that. The mere cessation of fear
produces a kind of peace - as the ocean is calm and beautiful after a
storm - no matter what may be the cause, whether it be true religion or
any other cause. Many a sinner, who has lost his convictions for sin in
any way, mistakes the temporary calm which succeeds for true religion,
and embraces the hope of the hypocrite.

\(3\) That hope will perish. This may occur in various ways.

\(a\) It may die away insensibly, and leave the man to be a mere
professor of religion - a formalist, without comfort, usefulness, or
peace.

\(b\) It may be taken away in some calamity by which God tries the soul,
and where the man will see that he has no religion to sustain him.

\(c\) It may occur under the preaching of the gospel, when the hypocrite
may be convinced that he is destitute of vital piety, and has no true
love to God.

\(d\) It may be on a bed of death - when God comes to take away the
soul, and when the judgment-seat appears in view.

\(e\) Or it will be at the bar of God. Then the hope of the hypocrite
will certainly be destroyed. Then it will be seen that he had no true
religion, and then he will be consigned to the awful doom of him who in
the most solemn circumstances lived to deceive, and who assumed the
appearance of that which he had the strongest reason to believe he never
possessed. Oh! how important it is for every professor of religion to
examine himself, that he may know what is the foundation of his hope of
heaven!

[Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 8:14</span></span>

Whose hope shall be cut off - Schultens supposes that the quotation from
the ancients closes with [Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md),
and that these are the comments of Bildad on the passage to which he had
referred. Rosenmuller and Noyes continue the quotation to the close of
[Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019.md); Dr. Good closes it at [Job
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md). It seems to me that it is
extended further than [Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md), and
probably it is to be regarded as continued to the close of [Job
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018.md). The beginning of this verse has
been very variously rendered. Dr. Good says that it has never been
understood, and proposes to translate it, "thus shall his support rot
away." Noyes renders it, "whose expectation shall come to naught;"
Gesenius, "shall be cut off." Jerome, Non ei placebit vecordia sua. "his
madness (do age, rage, or frenzy) shall not please him?" The Septuagint,
"his house shall be uninhabitable, and his tent shall pass away as the
spider."

The Hebrew word translated "cut off" (יקט yāqôṭ) is from קוט kūṭ,
usually meaning to loathe, to nauseate, to be offensive. Gesenius
supposes that the word here is synonymous with the Arabic "to be cut
off." But this sense does not occur elsewhere in the Hebrew, and it is
doubtful whether this is the true sense of the phrase. In the Hebrew
word there is probably always the idea of loathing, of being offensive,
irksome, or disgusting; see [Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md), I was grieved; [Job
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001.md), is weary; [Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md), shall loathe; so [Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031.md); [Eze
16:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047.md), a tiresome, or disgusting
object. Taylor (Concord) renders it here, "Whom his hope shall loathe or
abominate, that is, who shall loathe or hate the thing that he hopes
for." I have no doubt that the meaning here is, to be loathsome,
offensive, or nauseous, and the correct sense is, "whose hope shall
rot." The figure is continued from the image of the paper-reed and the
flag, which soon decay; and the idea is, that as such weeds grow
offensive and putrid in the stagnant water, so shall it be with the hope
of the hypocrite.

And whose trust - Whose confidence, or expectation.

A spider's web - Margin, "house." So the Hebrew בית bayı̂th. The spider's
house is the web which it forms, a frail, light, tenuous substance which
will sustain almost nothing. The wind shakes it, and it is easily
brushed away. So it will be with the hope of the hypocrite.

[Job 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 8:15</span></span>

He shall lean upon his house - This is an allusion to the web or house
of the spider. The hope of the hypocrite is called the house which he
has built for himself; his home, his refuge, his support. But it shall
fail him. In times of trial he will trust to it for support, and it will
be found to be as frail as the web of the spider. How little the light
and slender thread which a spider spins would avail a man for support in
time of danger! So frail and unsubstantial will be the hope of the
hypocrite! It is impossible to conceive any figure which would more
strongly describe the utter vanity of the hopes of the wicked. A similar
comparison occurs in the Koran, Sur. 28, 40: "They who assume any other
patrons to themselves besides God, are like the spider building his
house; for the house of the spider is most feeble."

He shall hold it fast - Or, he shall lay hold on it to sustain him,
denoting the avidity with which the hypocrite seizes upon his hope. The
figure is still taken from the spider, and is an instance of a careful
observation of the habits of that insect. The idea is, that the spider,
when a high wind or a tempest blows, seizes upon its slender web to
sustain itself. But it is insufficient. The wind sweeps all away. So the
tempest of calamity sweeps away the hypocrite, though he grasps at his
hope, and would seek security in that, as a spider does in the light and
tenuous thread which it has spun.

[Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 8:16</span></span>

He is green before the sun - Vulgate, "antequam veniat sol - before the
sun comes." So the Chaldee, "before the rising of the sun." So Eichhorn
renders it. According to this, which is probably the true
interpretation, the passage means that he is green and flourishing
before the sun rises, but that he cannot hear its heat and withers away.
A new illustration is here introduced, and the object is to compare the
hypocrite with a vigorous plant that grows up quick and sends its
branches afar, but which has no depth of root, and which, when the
intense heat of the sun comes upon it, withers away. The comparison is
not with a tree, which would bear the heat of the sun, but rather with
those succulent plants which have a large growth of leaves and branches,
like a gourd or vine, but which will not bear a drought or endure the
intense heat of the sun. "This comparison of the transitory nature of
human hope and prosperity to the sudden blight which over throws the
glory of the forest and of the garden," says the Editor of the Pictorial
Bible (on [Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035).md), "is at once so
beautiful and so natural, as to have been employed by poets of every
age." One such comparison of exquisite finish occurs in Shakespeare:

This is the state of man! Today he puts forth

The tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms,

And hears his blushing honours thick upon him:

The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,

And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely

His greatness is a ripening, nips his shoot,

And then he falls, as I do.

And his branch shooteth forth ... - A comparison of a prosperous person
or nation with a vine which spreads in this manner, is common in the
Scriptures. See [Psa 80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md) :

She sent out her boughs unto the sea,

And her branches unto the river.

Compare the note at [Isa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008.md). A
similar figure occurs in [Psa 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md) :

I have seen the wicked in great power,

And spreading himself like a green bay tree.

[Job 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#017.md)

His roots are wrapped about the heap - There has been great diversity of
opinion in the interpretation of this passage. Jerome renders it, "over
the heap of stones his roots are condensed." Walton, "super fontem -
over a fountain." The Septuagint, "he lies down (or sleeps, κοιμᾶται
koimatai) on a heap of stones; and he lives in the midst of
flint-stones." According to some, the word rendered heap גל gal means a
fountain; according to others, it means a heap or pile of stones;
according to Dr. Good, it means a rock. According to the view of the
former, it refers to the flourishing condition of a hypocrite or sinner,
and means that he is like a tree that sends its roots by a fountain, and
is nourished by it. According to others, the reference is to the fact
that the hypocrite is like a plant that has no depth of earth for its
roots, that wraps its rooks around anything, even a heap of stones, to
support itself; and that consequently will soon wither under the intense
heat of the sun. The word גל gal, rendered "heap," means either

(1.) A heap, as a heap of stones, from גלל gâlal - to roll, as e. g.
stones. It may denote a heap of stones, [Jos
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md), but it commonly refers to the
ruins of walls and cities, [Jer 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011.md);
[Jer 51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md); [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md). It means

(2.) A fountain or spring, so called from the rolling or welling up of
the waters, [Sol 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#012.md), and hence,
rolling waves or billows, [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md);
[Psa 89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009.md); [Psa
107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md), [Psa
107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md). The parallelism, if nothing
else, demands that the usual signification should be given to it here;
and the true sense is, that the prosperous wicked man or the hypocrite
is like a plant which stands in the midst of rocks, rubbish, or old
ruins, and not like one that stands in a fertile soil where it may
strike its roots deep. The reference is to the fact that a tree or plant
which springs up on a rock, or in the midst of rocks, will send its
roots afar for nutriment, or will wrap them around the projecting points
of rocks in order to obtain support. All have observed this in trees
standing on rocks; but the following extract from Sillinian's Journal
for January, 1840, wil illustrate the fact referred to here more fully.

"About fifteen years ago, upon the top of an immense boulder of
limestone, some ten or twelve feet in diameter, a sapling was found
growing. The stone was but slightly imbedded in the earth; several of
its sides were raised from four to six feet above its surface; but the
top of the rock was rough with crevices, and its surface, which was
sloping off, on one side, to the earth, was covered with a thin mould.
From this mould the tree had sprung up, and having thrust its roots into
the crevices of the rock, it had succeeded in reaching the height of
some twelve or fifteen feet. But about this period the roots on one side
became loosened from their attachment, and the tree gradually declined
to the opposite side, until its body was in a parallel line with the
earth. The roots on the opposite side, having obtained a firmer hold,
afforded sufficient nourishment to sustain the plant; although they
could not, alone, retain it in its vertical position. In this condition
of things, the tree as if 'conscious of its needs, ' adopted (if the
term may be used) an ingenious process, in order to regain its former
upright position. One of the most vigorous of the detached roots sent
out a branch from its side, which, passing round a projection of the
rock, again united with the parent stalk, and thus formed a perfect loop
around this projection, which gave to the root an immovable attachment.

"The tree now began to recover from its bent position. Obeying the
natural tendency of all plants to grow erect, and sustained by this
root, which increased with unwonted vigor, in a few years it had
entirely regained its vertical position, elevated, as no one could doubt
who saw it, by the aid of the root which had formed this singular
attachment. But this was not the only power exhibited by this remarkable
tree.

"After its elevation it flourished vigorously for several years. Some of
its roots had traced the sloping side of the rock to the earth, and were
buried in the soil below. Others, having embedded themselves in its
furrows, had completely filled these crevices with vegetable matter. The
tree still continuing to grow, concentric layers of vegetable matter
were annually deposited between the alburnum and liber, until by the
force of vegetable growth alone, the rock was split from the top to the
bottom, into three nearly equal divisions, and branches of the roots
were soon found, extending down, through the divisions into the earth
below. On visiting the tree a few months since, to take a drawing of it,
we found that it had attained an altitude of fifty feet, and was four
and a half feet in circumference at its base."

The image here shows that the author of this beautiful fragment was a
careful observer of nature, and the comparison is exceedingly pertinent
and striking. What more beautiful illustration of a hypocrite can there
be? His roots do not strike into the earth. His piety is not planted in
a rich soil. It is on the hard rock of the unconverted human heart. Yet
it sends out its roots afar; seems to flourish for a time; draws
nutriment from remote objects; clings to a crag or a projecting rock, or
to anything for support - until a tempest sweeps it down to rise no
more! No doubt the idea of Bildad was, that Job was just such a man.

Seeth the place of stones - Septuagint, "and lives in the midst of
flints," not an unapt rendering - and a very striking description of a
hypocrite. So Castellio, "existit inter lapides." Its only nutriment is
derived from the scanty earth in the stony soil on which it stands, or
in the crevices of the rocks.

[Job 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 8:18</span></span>

If he destroy him from his place - The particle here which is rendered
"if (אם 'ı̂m) is often used to denote emphasis, and means here
"certainly" - "he shall be certainly destroyed." The word rendered
destroy, from בלע bela‛, means literally to swallow [Job
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md), to swallow up, to absorb; and
hence, to consume, lay waste, destroy. The sense is, that the wicked or
the hypocrite shall be wholly destroyed from his place, but the image or
figure of the tree is still retained. Some suppose that it means that
God would destroy him from his place; others, as Rosenmuller and Dr.
Good, suppose that the reference is to the soil in which the tree was
planted, that it would completely absorb all nutriment, and leave the
tree to die; that is, that the dry and thirsty soil in which the tree is
planted, instead of affording nutriment, acts as a "sucker," and absorbs
itself all the juices which would otherwise give support to the tree.
This seems to me to be probably the true interpretation. It is one drawn
from nature, and one that preserves the concinnity of the passage.

Then it shall deny him - That is, the soil, the earth, or the place
where it stood. This represents a wicked man under the image of a tree.
The figure is beautiful. The earth will be ashamed of it; ashamed that
it sustained the tree; ashamed that it ever ministered any nutriment,
and will refuse to own it. So with the hypocrite. He shall pass away as
if the earth refused to own him, or to retain any recollection of him.

I have not seen thee - I never knew thee. It shall utterly deny any
acquaintance with it. There is a striking resemblance here to the
language which the Savior says he will use respecting the hypocrite in
the day of judgment: "and then will I profess to them, I never knew
you;" [Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md). The hypocrite has
never been known as a pious man. The earth will refuse to own him as
such, and so will the heavens.

[Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 8:19</span></span>

Behold, this is the joy of his way - This is evidently sarcastic. "Lo!
such is the joy of his course! He boasts of joy, as all hypocrites do,
but his joy endures only for a little time. This is the end of it. He is
cut down and removed, and the earth and the heavens disown him!"

And out of the earth shall others grow - This image is still derived
from the tree or plant. The meaning is, that such a plant would be taken
away, and that others would spring up in its place which the earth would
not be ashamed of. So the hypocrite is removed to make way for others
who will be sincere, and who will be useful. Hypocrites and useless
people in the church are removed to make way for others who will be
active and devoted to the cause of the Redeemer. A similar sentiment
occurs in [Job 27:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md). This closes,
as I suppose, the quotation which Bildad makes from the poets of the
former age, and in the remainder of the chapter he states another truth
pertaining to the righteous. This fragment is one of the most
interesting that can be found any where. As a relic of the earliest
times it is exceedingly valuable; as an illustration of the argument in
hand; and of the course of events in this world, it is eminently
beautiful. It is as true now as it was when uttered before the flood,
and may be used now as describing the doom of the hypocrite, with as
much propriety as then, and it may be regarded as one of the way-marks
in human affairs, showing that the government of God, and the manner of
his dispensations, are always substantially the same.

[Job 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 8:20</span></span>

Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man - On the meaning of the
word perfect, see the note at [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md). The sentiment of Bildad, or the
inference which he draws from the whole argument is, that God will be
the friend of the pious, but that he will not aid the wicked. This
accords with the general sentiment maintained in the argument of the
friends of Job.

Neither will he help the evil doers - Margin, "Take the ungodly by the
hand." This is in accordance with the Hebrew. The figure is that of
taking one by the hand in order to assist him; see [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md).

[Job 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 8:21</span></span>

Till he fill thy mouth with laughing - Until he make thee completely
happy. The word rendered "till" (עד ‛ad), is rendered by Dr. Good, "even
yet." Noyes, following Houbigant, DeWette, and Michaelis, proposes to
change the pointing, and to read עד ‛ôd, instead of עד ‛ad - meaning,
"while." The verse is connected with that which follows, and the
particle used here evidently means "while," or "even yet" - and the
whole passage means, "if you return to God, he will even yet fill you
with joy, while those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. God will
show you favor, but the dwelling of the wicked shall come to naught."
The object of the passage is to induce Job to return to God, with the
assurance that if he did, he would show mercy to him, while the wicked
should be destroyed.

With rejoicing - Margin, "Shouting for joy." The word used (תרוּעה
terû‛âh) is properly that which denotes the clangor of a trumpet, or the
shout of victory and triumph.

[Job 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 8:22</span></span>

They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame - When they see your
returning prosperity, and the evidences of the divine favor. They will
then be ashamed that they regarded you as a hypocrite, and that they
reproached you in your trials.

And the dwelling-place of the wicked ... - The wicked shall be
destroyed, and his family shall pass away. That is, God will favor the
righteous, but punish the wicked. This opinion the friends of Job
maintain all along, and by this they urge him to forsake his sins,
repent, and return to God.
