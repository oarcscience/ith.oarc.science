### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 107:0</span></span>

This psalm is without a title, and its author is unknown. The occasion
on which it was composed is not particularly designated, though from
[Psa 107:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002.md), it is probable that it
was on a return from exile or captivity. There is nothing in the psalm
to forbid the supposition that this was the return from the captivity at
Babylon, and that the psalm was designed to be used at the re-dedication
of the temple after the restoration. Every part of it would be
appropriate to such an occasion, and it is every way probable that so
important an event would be celebrated with appropriate songs of praise.

The "design" of the psalm, so far as it has a practical bearing, is
indicated in [Psa 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md), [Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md), [Psa
107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md), [Psa
107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md), in the language repeated in
those verses: "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of men!" The purpose of the
psalm is so to set forth these "works," or these "doings" of God, as to
lead men to praise and adoration.

The psalm is very regular in its structure. The first three verses are
introductory, intended to designate the people who were specially called
on to praise God - as those who had been redeemed from the hand of the
enemy, and gathered out of the lands - east, west, north, and south.

The remainder of the psalm is divided into portions marked by the above
words, "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness," etc., [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md), [Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md), [Psa
107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md), [Psa
107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md). These portions are of unequal
length, and this language (with a few appropriate words added) is placed
"at the close of each part," as being that which was suggested by the
previous thoughts. In the closing portion, however, [Psa
107:32-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md), this language is not
employed, but the expression of "desire" in the other cases is changed
into an "affirmation" that all who were wise would "observe these
things," and would "understand the loving-kindness of the Lord."

The particular parts of the psalm are the following:

I. A reference to the redeemed of the Lord as having wandered in the
wilderness; as having been hungry and thirsty; as having no city to
dwell in; and then, as calling upon the Lord in such a manner that he
heard them, and led them in a right and safe way. For "this" the
psalmist expresses the wish that "men would praise the Lord for his
goodness," [Psa 107:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md).

II\. A reference to God as displaying goodness toward those who sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death, and who are bound in affliction and
iron: illustrated by a reference to the people of God in the times of
bondage, as being cast down and punished for their sins, and as then
calling upon the Lord in their trouble, so that he brought them out of
that darkness and shadow of death, and brake their bands asunder. For
"this" the psalmist expresses the wish that "men would praise the Lord
for his goodness," [Psa 107:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md).

III\. A reference to the deliverance performed for the people of God.
They had sinned; they had shown their folly; they had drawn near to the
gates of death, and then they cried unto the Lord, and he sent his word
and healed them. For "this" the psalmist expresses the desire that "men
would praise the Lord for his goodness," [Psa
107:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md).

IV\. A reference to the goodness of the Lord as manifested toward those
who go down to the sea in ships, and do business in the great waters.
They see the wonders of the Lord in the deep. They encounter storms and
tempests. They are raised up to the heavens on the waves, and then sink
to a corresponding depth. They reel to and fro and stagger like a
drunkard; and then they cry to the Lord, and he hears them, and makes
the sea calm, and brings them to the desired haven. For "this" the
psalmist expresses the wish that "men would praise the Lord for his
goodness," [Psa 107:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md).

V. A reference to the goodness of the Lord in preparing a place for men
to dwell in: turning rivers into a wilderness, the water-springs into
dry ground, the wilderness into standing water, and the dry ground into
water-springs: making arrangements for people to dwell upon the earth,
so that they may sow the fields and plant vineyards - setting the poor
on high from affliction, and making them families like a flock. In
reference to "this," and to "all" that God does, the psalmist says, in
the conclusion of the psalm, that all who are "wise, and will observe
these things, shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord," [Psa
107:33-43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md).

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good - See the notes at [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md).

For his mercy endureth for ever - He is unchanging in his mercy. It is
an attribute of his very nature. He is constantly manifesting it. The
word rendered "mercy" here, however - חסד chesed - is more general in
its signification than our word "mercy." Our word means "favor shown to
the guilty;" the Hebrew word means kindness, goodness, benignity in
general. It is this which is celebrated in the psalm before us.

[Psalms 107:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 107:2</span></span>

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so - They are especially qualified to
say so; they have special occasion to say so; they can and will
appreciate this trait in his character. The word rendered "redeemed"
here - from גאל gā'al - means "delivered, rescued," without reference to
any price paid for the deliverance. It refers here not to a ransom from
"sin," but to deliverance from "danger." The probable allusion is to the
deliverance from the captivity in Babylon. Compare the notes at [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md).

Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy - the power of the
enemy. That is, He has saved them from their enemies, and has not
suffered them to be destroyed by them. What is here said is true in the
most eminent sense of those who are redeemed by the blood of the Son of
God, and who are made heirs of salvation. Every consideration makes it
proper that they should praise the Lord. Of all on earth, they have most
occasion for such praise; of all among people, it may be presumed that
they will be best qualified to appreciate the goodness of the Lord.

[Psalms 107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 107:3</span></span>

And gathered them out of the lands - The countries where they were
scattered. In the times of the captivity the people were not all taken
to one place, or did not all abide in one place. In the long exile - of
seventy years - in Babylon, they would naturally be much scattered in
the different provinces; and the attempt to collect them together, to
restore them again to their native land, might be attended with much
difficulty.

From the east ... - From all quarters; from the places where they were
scattered abroad. That is, one taking his position in Babylon would see
them dispersed from that place as a center into all the surrounding
country.

And from the south - Margin, as in Hebrew, "from the sea." In general,
in the Old Testament, the word "sea" is used for the west, because the
western boundary of the land of Palestine was the Mediterranean Sea.
Compare [Psa 139:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009.md). But the supposed
position of the speaker here is "Babylon," and on that account the south
might be fitly designated by the word "sea;" as, on the south of
Babylon, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean would be soon reached.

[Psalms 107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 107:4</span></span>

They wandered in the wilderness - On their return from Babylon; or, when
God was conducting them again to their own land. The word "wilderness"
in the Scriptures means a desolate, barren, uninhabited region, usually
destitute of trees, of springs, and of water-courses. It does not
denote, as it does with us, a region of extensive "forests." Compare the
notes at [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md).

In a solitary way - Rather, in a "waste" way; a land that was desolate
and uncultivated.

They found no city to dwell in - In their journeyings. This was true of
the region between Babylon and Palestine; a wide, barren, desolate
waste.

[Psalms 107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 107:5</span></span>

Hungry and thirsty - As they would be, when wandering in such a desert.
A more literal and expressive rendering would be, "Hungry - also
thirsty."

Their soul fainted in them - The word used here - עטף ‛âṭaph - means
properly to cover, to clothe, as with a garment, [Psa
73:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#006.md); or a field with grain, [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md); then, to hide oneself, [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md); then, to cover with darkness,
[Psa 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003.md); 102, title; thus it denotes
the state of mind when darkness seems to be in the way - a way of
calamity, trouble, sorrow; of weakness, faintness, feebleness. Here it
would seem from the connection to refer to the exhaustion produced by
the want of food and drink.

[Psalms 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 107:6</span></span>

Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble - The language in this
verse is repeated in this psalm in [Psa
107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md), [Psa
107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md), [Psa
107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md) - as if this were the main
subject of the psalm, that when the people of God in different
circumstances, or under various forms of trouble, call upon God, he
hears them and delivers them.

And he delivered them out of their distresses - The verb from which the
noun used here is derived has the idea of being "narrow, straitened,
compressed." Hence, the word comes to be used in the sense of distress
of any kind - as if one were pressed down, or compressed painfully in a
narrow space.

[Psalms 107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 107:7</span></span>

And he led them forth by the right way - A literal version, if the term
necessary to express it might be allowable, would be," He wayed them in
a straight way;" he made a way for them, and that was a straight way. He
conducted them in the most direct path to the land to which they were
going.

That they might go to a city of habitation - A city where they might
permanently dwell. The word "city" here seems to be used in the sense of
"abode;" and the idea is, that he led them to a land where they might
cease to be wanderers, and might find a settled home.

[Psalms 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 107:8</span></span>

Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness - More literally,
"Let such - or, let these - praise the Lord for his goodness," the word
"men" having been supplied by our translators. Yet it is not improper to
suppose that a wider range is intended than would be denoted if it were
confined to those who had then been delivered. It was evidently designed
to impress the minds of those who might use this psalm in their
devotions; and the idea is, that the deliverance then vouchsafed to the
people of God in their troubles should lead all to praise and adore him.
Such a surprising interposition suggested an important lesson in regard
to God, applicable to all people; and should lead all to praise him in
view of the trait of character thus manifested, as that of a God who
hears prayer when his people are in trouble, and who can make a straight
path before them when they are in danger of being lost, and who can
conduct them through the wilderness - the waste places - of this world,
as he did his people across the pathless sands of the desert. The true
use of all history is to teach us lessons about God.

And for his wonderful works to the children of men - His doings as
suited to excite wonder and admiration. His dealings with his people in
the desert furnished one illustration of this; the world is full of such
illustrations. The desire expressed in this verse suggests the great
lesson of the psalm.

[Psalms 107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 107:9</span></span>

For he satisfieth the longing soul - This does not mean - what is indeed
true in itself - that God has made provision for the "soul" of man, and
satisfies it when it longs or pants for its needed supply, but the
reference is to the creatures of God - the living things that he has
made; and the idea is, that he has made provision for their needs. He
gives them food and drink, so that their needs are met. The "particular"
reference here, however, in the word rendered "longing" is to "thirst,"
as contradistinguished from the other member of the verse, where the
reference is to "hunger." So the word is used in [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md).

And filleth the hungry soul with goodness - Supplies the needs of the
hungry with "good;" that is, with that which is "good" for it; which
meets its needs, and imparts strength and happiness.

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

Such as sit in darkness - The reference in these verses [Psa
107:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md) is evidently to the children
of Israel, when in Babylon; and the design is, to show the goodness of
God to them in their trouble, and the occasion which they had for
praising him on that account. To "sit in darkness" is significant of
great ignorance (compare the notes at [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079.md); notes at [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002).md); or of affliction and trouble, as
darkness is an emblem of calamity.

And in the shadow of death - A dark, gloomy, chilly shade such as
"Death" would cast if he stood between us and the light. See the notes
at [Job 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md); compare [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md); [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md); [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md). The reference is to the sad and
gloomy residence of the Hebrews in the land of captivity.

Being bound in affliction and iron - Captives and slaves. Compare [Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018.md).

[Psalms 107:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 107:11</span></span>

Because they rebelled against the words of God - The commands of God.
They did not keep his commandments. Their captivity was produced by
national disobedience. See the notes at [Dan
9:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005.md).

And contemned the counsel - They despised the instructions of God. The
law of God, at the same time that it "is" law, is of the nature of
"counsel," since it is indicative of what God regards as wise and good,
and since it is the best "advice" that God can give to people. A just
and righteous law, while it involves "obligation" to obey it, is also
the best counsel that can be given, and implies that the highest
"wisdom" would be shown in being obedient to it. God will "command"
nothing which he would not "advise," and which it would not be "wisdom"
to obey.

Of the Most High - Of God, who, being supreme, has a right to rule over
all, and to require that his laws shall be obeyed.

[Psalms 107:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 107:12</span></span>

Therefore he brought down their heart - Their pride; their
self-sufficiency; their self-complacency. They thought that they could
do without God; they relied on their own resources, and were
self-satisfied; but God showed them that all this was vain, and humbled
them, as he often does the proud, in the dust.

With labour - With trouble; with affliction; with disappointment; with
reverses; with sorrow. The Hebrew word - עמל ‛âmâl - would include all
this. Compare [Gen 41:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md); [Deu
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#007.md); [Job
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#010.md); [Job
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002.md).

They fell down - They, as it were, "stumbled" - for so the Hebrew word
means. They were walking along with a haughty air, and a high look, and
suddenly they stumbled and fell.

And there was none to help - No God to interpose; no nation to befriend
them; no human arm to be stretched out for their deliverance. God gave
them up, helpless, to the just consequences of their folly and
wickedness.

[Psalms 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 107:13</span></span>

Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble - Compare Dan. 9. This is
repeated in the psalm in [Psa 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md),
[Psa 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md), [Psa
107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md), [Psa
107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md) - in all the divisions of the
psalm except the last. See the notes at [Psa
107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 107:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 107:14</span></span>

He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death - From their
captivity; from calamity which seemed to be as gloomy as the shadow of
death.

And brake their bands in sunder - Delivered them from their bondage, as
if the bands of a prisoner or captive were suddenly broken.

[Psalms 107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 107:15</span></span>

Oh that men would praise ... - See the notes at [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md). The idea here is that the
things just referred to "should" call forth expressions of gratitude to
God. The immediate reference is to those who had partaken of these
proofs of the divine goodness, but still the language is so general as
to be applicable to all classes of people.

[Psalms 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 107:16</span></span>

For he hath broken the gates of brass - The immediate "reason" here
given for praising the Lord is that he had "broken the gates of brass,"
continuing the thought from [Psa
107:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md). In the previous part of the
psalm, in giving a reason for praising the Lord, the fact that he feeds
the hungry was selected [Psa 107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md)
because in the preceding part the allusion was to the sufferings of
hunger and thirst [Psa 107:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md); here
the fact that he had broken the gates of brass is selected, because the
allusion in the immediately preceding verses [Psa
107:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#012.md) was to their imprisonment.
In the construction of the psalm there is great regularity. The "gates
of brass" refer probably to Babylon; and the idea is, that their
deliverance had been as if the brass gates of that great city had been
broken down to give them free egress from their captivity. Thus the
conquest of Babylon by Cyrus is announced in similar language: "I will
break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron,"
[Isa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md). See the notes at that
passage.

[Psalms 107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 107:17</span></span>

Fools, because of their transgression - Wicked people, considered as
fools, because they "are" transgressors. Compare [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), note; [Psa
73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md), note; [Psa
75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), note. The immediate allusion
here, probably, is to the Jews, who had been so wicked and so supremely
foolish in violating the commands of God, and making it necessary to
bring upon them as a punishment the captivity at Babylon; but the
language is made general because it will with equal propriety describe
the conduct of all wicked people. There is nothing more foolish than an
act of wickedness; there is no wisdom equal to that of obeying God.

And because of their iniquities, are afflicted - A more literal
rendering of this verse would be, "Fools from the way of their
transgressions (that is, by their course of transgression), and by their
iniquities, afflict themselves." The idea is, that it is "in the very
line" of their trangressions; or, that they "bring it upon themselves."
All punishment is in fact in the line of the offence; that is, sin leads
directly to it; or, in other words, if a man treads along in the path of
sin, he will come to this result - to punishment. Punishment is not
arbitrary on the part of God, and it is not of the nature of a mere
direct infliction from his "hand." It is what people mete out to
themselves, and what they might have avoided if they had chosen to do
so.

[Psalms 107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 107:18</span></span>

Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat - All food; all that is to be
eaten. The word rendered "abhorreth" is a word which is used with
reference to anything that is abominable or loathsome; that from which
we turn away with disgust. The language is expressive of sickness, when
we loathe all food.

And they draw near unto the gates of death - They are sick, and are
ready to die. The reference is to the under world - the world where the
dead are supposed to dwell. This is represented here as a city which is
entered through gates. See the notes at [Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 107:19</span></span>

Then they cry unto the Lord... - See [Psa
107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md), note; [Psa
107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md), note. The meaning here is,
that if the "sick" cry to the Lord, he hears them, and delivers them.
This cannot mean that it "always" occurs, but it occurs "so often" as to
show that God can and does interpose to save; "so often" as to encourage
us thus to call upon him when we are sick; "so often" as to lay a proper
foundation for praise. Many persons - very many - can recall such
instances in their own lives, when they seemed to all human appearance
to be drawing near to the gates of death, and when, in connection with
prayer, their disease took a favorable turn, and they were restored
again to health. Compare the notes at [Jam
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 107:20</span></span>

He sent his word, and healed them - He did it by a word; it was
necessary for him merely to give a command, and the disease left them.
So it was in the life of the Saviour, who often healed the sick by a
"word" [Mat 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008.md); [Luk
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#007.md); and so now restoration from
disease often seems to be accomplished as if some word had been spoken
by one who had power, commanding the disease to depart. In all cases,
also, whatever means may be used, healing power comes from God, and is
under his control. Compare [Psa 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002.md).

And delivered them from their destructions - From what would have
destroyed them, if it had not been checked and removed.

[Psalms 107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 107:21</span></span>

Oh that men... - See the notes at [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md). Who can help joining in this
wish, that those who have been restored from sickness, who have been
raised up from the borders of the grave, "would" praise God for it! Who
can help wishing that they had the feelings of Hezekiah when he was
saved from the sickness which threatened his life - saved by the direct
and manifest interposition of God - when he said [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md), "The Lord was ready to save me:
therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments, all the
days of our life in the house of the Lord!" Who can help wishing that
people everywhere would see in such interpositions the proof of the
benevolence of God, and would thank him that he has not forgotten guilty
and suffering people!

[Psalms 107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 107:22</span></span>

And let them sacrifice - As in the cases before [Psa
107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md), [Psa
107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md), this is connected with the
preceding part of the psalm, or is a "continuation" of the thought which
had been interrupted by the prayer, "Oh that men would praise the Lord."
The particular idea here is, that they who have been sick, and who have
been restored to health, should offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving; or,
that they are the proper persons to praise the Lord. The word
"sacrifice" here is used in a large sense to denote worship or
adoration. Let them worship God with thanks or praises.

The sacrifices of thanksgiving - Hebrew, "praise." Let them offer
praise.

And declare his works with rejoicing - Margin, as in Hebrew, "singing."
Let them set forth his "doings" in songs. Compare [Psa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

They that go down to the sea in ships - The scene here changes again.
From those that wander in the desert - from those who are in prison -
from those who are sick - the eye of the psalmist turns to those who
encounter the perils of the ocean, and he finds there occasion for
praise to God. The phrase "go down" or "descend" is employed here
because the sea is lower than the land, and because we "descend" when we
embark on board of a vessel.

That do business ... - Whose business or employment is on the ocean.

[Psalms 107:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 107:24</span></span>

These see the works of the Lord - They - sailors - have a special
opportunity to see the works of God. They see manifestations of his
power which are not seen on the land. They see things which seem to come
"directly" from God; which are "immediately" produced by him - not as
the things which occur on the land, which are the result of "growth,"
and which are slowly developed. They seem in the solitariness and
grandeur of the ocean to stand more directly in the presence of the
great God.

And his wonders in the deep - In the abyss; in that which is
distinguished for its "depth," as the mountains are for their height.
Compare [Psa 148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 107:25</span></span>

For he commandeth - Hebrew, "he says;" that is, He speaks the word, and
it is done. The mere expression of his will raises up the storm, and
throws the sea into commotion.

And raiseth the stormy wind - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Maketh to stand."
The "stormy wind" is literally, the wind of the tempest.

Which lifteth up the waves thereof - The waves of the ocean. The wind
seems to take them up, and lift them on high.

[Psalms 107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 107:26</span></span>

They mount up to the heaven - The mariners. That it refers to the
seamen, and not to the waves, is apparent from the close of the verse:
"their soul is melted."

They go down again to the depths - The word here is different from that
used in [Psa 107:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#024.md), and rendered
"deep," but the idea is essentially the same. It is the sea or ocean
considered as "deep;" as bottomless. The idea here is, that they seem to
descend into the very depths of the ocean.

Their soul is melted because of trouble - It seems to dissolve; it loses
all its vigor; it faints. The word used - מוג mûg - means to melt; to
flow down; to soften; and is then applied to the heart or mind that
loses its courage or vigor by fear or terror. [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015.md); [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md), [Jos
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#024.md); [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005.md). The "trouble" here referred to is
that which arises from fear and danger.

[Psalms 107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 107:27</span></span>

They reel to and fro - The word used here - חגג châgag - means to dance
as in a circle; then, to reel, or be giddy as drunkards are.

And stagger ... - This word means to move to and fro; to waver; to
vacillate; and it is then applied to a man who cannot walk steadily - a
drunkard. So the vessel, with the mariners on board, seems to stagger
and reel in the storm.

And are at their wit's end - Margin, as in Hebrew, "All their wisdom is
swallowed up." That is, They have no skill to guide the vessel. All that
has been done by the wisdom of naval architecture in constructing it,
and all that has been derived from experience in navigating the ocean,
seems now to be useless. They are at the mercy of the winds and waves;
they are dependent wholly on God; they can now only cry to him to save
them. Often this occurs in a storm at sea, when the most skillful and
experienced seaman feels that he can do no more.

[Psalms 107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 107:28</span></span>

Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble ... - See [Psa
107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md), [Psa
107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md), [Psa
107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md). Sailors pray. If they do not
pray elsewhere, they often do in a storm, when in danger of being
wrecked and lost. A storm at sea brings hundreds on their knees who
never prayed before - for they feel that their only help is in God, and
that it is a fearful thing to die. Then they do "right." They do what
"ought" to be done. But they do then only what people ought always to
do, for it is as plain a duty to pray when we are in safety as when we
are in danger; when sailing on a smooth sea as in a storm; when on the
land as on the ocean. People anywhere, and at any time may die; and
people everywhere and at all times "should," therefore, call upon God.
Storms, tempests, fire, disease, and danger, only impel people to do
what they should do always from higher motives, and when their motives
will be likely to be more disinterested and pure.

[Psalms 107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 107:29</span></span>

He maketh the storm a calm - God does this, and God only can do it. The
fact, therefore, that Jesus did it [Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md), proves that he was divine. There
can be no more striking proof of divine power than the ability to calm
the raging waves of the ocean by a word. This is literally, "He places
the tempest to silence."

So that the waves thereof are still - Are lulled. The ocean ceases to be
agitated, and the surface becomes smooth. Nothing is more still than the
ocean in a calm. Not a breath of air seems to stir; not a ripple
agitates the surface of the sea; the sails of the vessel hang loose, and
even the vessel seems to be perfectly at rest: "As idle as a painted
ship upon a painted ocean." So God can calm down the tempest of the
soul. He can make the mind which was heaving and tossed, like the ocean,
with anguish on account of guilt, and which trembled in view of the
coming judgment, as calm as the ocean is when in its state of perfect
repose. God can do "this," and none "but" God can do it; and as Jesus
thus stills the agitation of the guilty soul, as he did the waves of the
sea, "this" proves also that he is divine.

[Psalms 107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 107:30</span></span>

Then are they glad because they be quiet - Because the storm subsides,
and they have the feeling of safety from danger.

So he bringeth them - Rather, "And he guides them."

Unto their desired haven - The word translated "haven" occurs nowhere
else. By some it is rendered "shore," but the word "haven" or "port"
seems best to express the sense of the passage: "the haven of their
desire." No one can appreciate this fully who has not been long at sea,
and who has not experienced the intense desire once more to see "land."
Even then no one experiences it fully who has not some object there
which he desires to see, or to accomplish. If his business is there, if
it is his native land, if his father, mother, wife, or children are
there, if it is the place of his father's sepulchre, and the place where
he was born and reared, how intense becomes the desire to see that land
once more. So God brings his people to rest in heaven - their haven,
their home. After being tossed by the tempests of life, after
encountering its storms and dangers, after the fear and agitation
experienced, he stills the storms; the way becomes smooth and calm; the
end of the voyage is serene; and death is like the ship smoothly gliding
into port with its sails all set. The soul enters heaven - the desired
haven - the port that was longed for; a safe haven, beyond all storms or
tempests; an eternal home!

[Psalms 107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 107:31</span></span>

Oh that men... - See [Psa 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md), note;
[Psa 107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md), note; [Psa
107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md), note. Assuredly they who are
thus delivered from the dangers of the sea should praise the Lord; they
who have seen the wonders of God on the great ocean should "never"
forget God.

[Psalms 107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 107:32</span></span>

Let them exalt him also - Let them lift up his name on high; let them
make it conspicuous. The word means "to lift up," and is applied to
praise because we thus, as it were, "lift up" God, or make him
conspicuous.

In the congregation of the people - Not merely in private, but in
public. As his doings are public and conspicuous - as they pertain to
all - people should acknowledge him in their public capacity, or when
assembled together.

And praise him in the assembly of the elders - The old men; the men
eminent for experience and wisdom. Perhaps this refers to those who
occupied some official position in public worship, as appointed to
preside over that worship, and to conduct it. We know that the
arrangement was early made to appoint a body of aged men to preside over
the assemblies for worship, and to direct the devotions of the people.
In the presence of such venerable and venerated men, they are here
exhorted to give due praise to God. The "reason" for this seems to be
partly drawn from what had been referred to in the previous verses - the
power of God as seen in stilling the tempests of the ocean; and partly
from what is immediately referred to - the blessing of God on the labors
of man in cultivating the earth.

[Psalms 107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 107:33</span></span>

He turneth rivers into a wilderness - He makes great changes in the
earth; he shows that he has absolute dominion over it. See the notes at
[Isa 44:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026.md). On the word
"wilderness," see the notes at [Psa
107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md). The point here is, that God had
such control over nature that he could make the bed of a river dry and
barren as the rocky or sandy desert. He could effectually dry up the
stream, and make it so dry and parched that nothing would grow but the
most stunted shrubs, such as were found in the waste and sandy desert.

And the water-springs into dry ground - The very fountains of the
rivers: not only drying up the river itself by leading it off into
burning wastes where it would be evaporated by the heat, or lost in the
sand - but so directly affecting the "sources" of the streams as to make
them dry.

[Psalms 107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 107:34</span></span>

A fruitful land - Hebrew, A land of fruit. That is, a land that would
produce abundance. The word "fruit" here is not used in the limited
sense in which we now employ it, but means any productions of the earth.

Into barrenness - Margin, as in Hebrew, "saltness." The word is used to
denote a barren soil, because where salt "abounds" the soil "is" barren.
Thus it is around the Dead Sea. Compare [Job
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#006.md); [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md). See also Virg. Geor. II. 238,
"Salsa ... tellus - frugibus infelix;" Pliny, Hist. Nat. 31. 7; Bochart,
Hieroz. t. i., p. 872.

For the wickedness of them that dwell therein - As he overthrew Sodom
and Gomorrah; probably alluding to that.

[Psalms 107:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 107:35</span></span>

He turneth the wilderness into a standing water - A pool; a lake. See
the notes at [Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md).

And dry ground into water-springs - Not merely watering it with rain
from heaven, but causing gushing fountains to break forth, and to flow
continually, diffusing fertility and beauty everywhere.

[Psalms 107:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 107:36</span></span>

And there he maketh the hungry to dwell - Those who were in want; those
who would have perished. It is not necessary to refer this to any
particular case. It is a general statement, pertaining to changes which
God makes upon the earth, as great as if he "should" thus convert a
desert into a fruitful field - a barren waste into a land abounding in
springs of water; as if he should conduct there a company of famished
men, and provide for them food in abundance.

That they may prepare a city for habitation - A permanent dwelling-place
for man.

[Psalms 107:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 107:37</span></span>

And sow the fields, and plant vineyards - Cultivate the earth. The
culture of the vine was an important feature in agriculture in
Palestine, and hence, it is made so prominent here.

Which may yield fruits of increase - The fruits which the earth
produces.

[Psalms 107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 107:38</span></span>

He blesseth them also - In the manner immediately specified.

So that they are multiplied greatly - This was regarded as one of the
highest blessings which God could confer, and hence, it was so often
promised by him to the patriarchs, as a proof of his favor, that their
seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the sand upon the
sea-shore. [Gen 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md); [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Gen
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md); [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md).

And suffereth not their cattle to decrease - The keeping of herds of
cattle was also an important point in husbandry, and hence, it was a
blessing that they were made to increase, and that they were kept from
the diseases to which cattle are subject.

[Psalms 107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 107:39</span></span>

Again, they are minished ... - literally, "And they are made to
decrease." That is - all is in the hand of God. He rules and directs all
things. If there is prosperity, it comes from him; if there are
reverses, they occur under his hand. People are not always prosperous.
There are changes, misfortunes, disappointments, sorrows. God so deals
with the race as in the bests manner to secure the recognition of
himself: not always sending prosperity, lest people should regard it as
a thing of course, and forget that it comes from him; and not making the
course of life uniformly that of disappointment and sorrow, lest they
should feel that there is no God presiding over human affairs. He visits
now with prosperity, and now with adversity; now with success, and now
with reverses, showing that his agency is constant, and that people are
wholly dependent on him. In existing circumstances - since man is what
he is - it is better that there should be alternations, reverses, and
changes, than that there should be a uniform course.

Through oppression - Anything that "presses" or "straitens."

Affliction - Evil; here, in the sense of calamity.

And sorrow - Anguish, pain: of body or mind.

[Psalms 107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 107:40</span></span>

He poureth contempt upon princes - He treats them as if they were common
people; he pays no regard in his providence to their station and rank.
They are subjected to the same needs as others; they meet with reverses
like others; they become captives like others; they sicken and die like
others; they are laid in the grave like others; and, with the same
offensiveness, they turn back to dust. Between monarchs and their
subjects, masters and their slaves, mistresses and their handmaidens,
rich men and poor men, beauty and deformity, there is no distinction in
the pains of sickness, in the pangs of dying, in the loathsomeness of
the grave. The process of corruption goes on in the most splendid
coffin, and beneath the most costly monument which art and wealth can
rear, as well as in the plainest coffin, and in the grave marked by no
stone or memorial. What can more strikingly show "contempt" for the
trappings of royalty, for the adornings of wealth, for the stars and
garters of nobility, for coronets and crowns, for the diamonds, the
pearls, and the gold that decorate beauty, than that which occurs "in a
grave!" The very language used here, alike in the Hebrew and in our
translation, is found in [Job 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021.md).
The word rendered "princes" properly means "willing, voluntary, prompt;"
and is then applied to the generous, to the noble-minded, to those who
give liberally. It then denotes one of noble rank, as the idea of rank
in the mind of the Orientals was closely connected with the notion of
liberality in giving. Thus it comes to demote one of noble birth, and
might be applied to any of exalted rank.

And causeth them to wander in the wilderness - Margin, "void place." The
Hebrew word - תהו tôhû - means properly wasteness, desolateness;
emptiness, vanity. See [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md); [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md); [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md); [Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009.md); [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md). Here it means an empty,
uninhabited place; a place where there is no path to guide; a land of
desolation. The reference seems to be to the world beyond the grave; the
land of shadows and night. Compare the notes at [Job
10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md).

Where there is no way - literally, "no way." That is, no well-trodden
path. All must soon go to that pathless world.

[Psalms 107:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 107:41</span></span>

Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction - Margin, "after." The
sense is not materially different. The idea is, that while he thus
humbles princes, bringing them down from their lofty position, he has
respect to the poor in their condition of suffering and trial, and
raises them from that depressed state, and gives them prosperity. Thus
he orders the circumstances of people, and shows his sovereignty.

And maketh him families like flock - Numerous as a flock. Large families
were accounted a blessing among the Hebrews. See the notes at [Psa
107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md).

[Psalms 107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 107:42</span></span>

The righteous shall see it, and rejoice - Shall see all these changes;
shall see in their own case the proofs of the divine favor. They shall
thus have occasion for praise.

And all iniquity shall stop her mouth - The wicked shall be silenced;
they shall be dumb. The righteous shall find, in these varied scenes,
occasion for praise and joy; the wicked shall be able to find no
occasion for complaining or murmuring. The divine dealings shall be
manifestly so just, and so worthy of universal approval, that, even
though the wicked are disposed to complain against God, they will be
able to find nothing which will justify them in such complaints.

[Psalms 107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 107:43</span></span>

Whoso is wise - All who are truly wise. That is, all who have a proper
understanding of things, or who are disposed to look at them aright.

And will observe these things - Will attentively consider them; will
reason upon them correctly; will draw just conclusions from them; will
allow them to produce their "proper" impression on the mind. The meaning
is, that these things would not be understood at a glance, or by a hasty
and cursory observation, but that all who would take time to study them
would see in them such proofs of wisdom and goodness that they could not
fail to come to the conclusion that God is worthy of confidence and
love.

Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord - They will
perceive that God is a merciful Being; that he seeks the welfare of the
universe; that he desires the good of all; that the whole system is so
arranged as to be adapted to secure the greatest good in the universe.
No one can study the works of God, or mark the events of his providence,
without perceiving that there are "innumerable" arrangements which have
no other end than to produce happiness; which can be explained only on
the supposition that God is a benevolent Being; which would not exist
under the government of a malevolent being. And, although there are
things which seem to be arrangements to cause suffering, and although
sin and misery have been allowed to come into the world, yet we are not
in circumstances to enable us to show that, in some way, these may not
be consistent with a desire to promote the happiness of the universe, or
that there may not be some explanation, at prosent too high for us,
which will show that the principle of benevolence is applicable to all
the works of God. Meantime, where we can - as we can in numberless cases
- see the proofs of benevolence, let us praise God; where we cannot, let
us silently trust him, and believe that there will yet be some way in
which we may see this as the angels now see it, and, like them, praise
him for what now seems to us to be dark and incomprehensible. There is
an "eternity" before us in which to study the works of God, and it would
not be strange if in that eternity we may learn things about God which
we cannot understand now, or if in that eternity things now to us as
dark as midnight may be made clear as noonday. How many things
incomprehensible to us in childhood, become clear in riper years!
