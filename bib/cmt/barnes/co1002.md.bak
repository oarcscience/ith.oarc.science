### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 2:0</span></span>

The design of this chapter is the same as the concluding part of [Co1
1:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md), to show that the gospel does
not depend for its success on human wisdom, or the philosophy of men.
This position the apostle further confirms:

\(1\) [Co1 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), By a reference to
his own example, as having been successful among them, and yet not
endowed with the graces of elocution, or by a commanding address; yet.

\(2\) Lest it should be thought that the gospel was real folly, and
should be contemned, he shows in the remainder of the chapter [Co1
2:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), that it contained true wisdom;
that it was a profound scheme - rejected, indeed, by the people of the
world, but seen to be wise by those who were made acquainted with its
real nature and value, [Co1 2:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md).

The first division of the chapter [Co1
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), is a continuation of the
argument to show that the success of the gospel does not depend on human
wisdom or philosophy. This he proves:

\(1\) By the fact that when he was among them, though his preaching was
attended with success, yet he did not come with the attractions of human
eloquence, [Co1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md).

\(2\) this was in accordance with his purpose, not designing to attempt
anything like that, but having another object, [Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md).

\(3\) in fact he had not evinced that, but the contrary, [Co1
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md).

\(4\) his design was that their conversion should not appear to have
been made by human wisdom or eloquence, but to have been manifestly the
work of God, [Co1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md).

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

And I, brethren - Keeping up the tender and affectionate style of
address.

When I came unto you - When I came at first to preach the gospel at
Corinth. [Act 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md) ff.

Came not with excellency of speech - Came not with graceful and
attractive eloquence. The apostle here evidently alludes to that nice
ant studied choice of language; to those gracefully formed sentences,
and to that skill of arrangement in discourse and argument which was so
much an object of regard with the Greek rhetoricians. It is probable
that Paul was never much distinguished for these (compare [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010).md), and it is certain he never
made them an object of intense study and solicitude. Compare [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md), [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md).

Or of wisdom - Of the wisdom of this world; of that kind of wisdom which
was sought and cultivated in Greece.

The testimony of God - The testimony or the witnessing which God has
borne to the gospel of Christ by miracles, and by attending it
everywhere with his presence and blessing. In [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), the gospel is called "the
testimony of Christ;" and here it may either mean the witness which the
gospel bears to the true character and plans of God; or the witnessing
which God had borne to the gospel by miracles, etc. The gospel contains
the testimony of God in regard to his own character and plans;
especially in regard to the great plan of redemption through Jesus
Christ. Several mss. instead of "testimony of God," here read "the
mystery of God." This would accord well with the scope of the argument;
but the present reading is probably the correct one. See Mill. The
Syriac version has also "mystery."

[1 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 2:2</span></span>

For I determined - I made a resolution. This was my fixed, deliberate
purpose when I came there. It was not a matter of accident, or chance,
that I made Christ my great and constant theme, but it was my deliberate
purpose. It is to be recollected that Paul made this resolution, knowing
the special fondness of the Greeks for subtle disquisitions, and for
graceful and finished elocution; that he formed it when his own mind, as
we may judge from his writings, was strongly inclined by nature to an
abstruse and metaphysical kind of discussion, which could not have
failed to attract the attention of the acute and subtle reasoners of
Greece; and that he made it when he must have been fully aware that the
theme which he had chosen to dwell upon would be certain to excite
derision and contempt. Yet he formed, and adhered to this resolution,
though it might expose him to contempt; and though they might reject and
despise his message.

Not to know - The word "know" here εἰδέναι eidenai is used probably in
the sense of "attend to, be engaged in, or regard." I resolved not to
give my time and attention while among you to the laws and traditions of
the Jews; to your orators, philosophers, and poets; to the beauty of
your architecture or statuary; to a contemplation of your customs and
laws, but to attend to this only - making known the cross of Christ. The
word εἰδω eidō to know, is sometimes thus used. Paul says that he
designed that this should be the only thing on which his mind should be
fixed; the only object of his attention; the only object there upon
which he sought that knowledge should be diffused. Doddridge renders it
"appear to know."

Anything among you - Anything while I was with you. Or, anything that
may exist; among you, and that may be objects of interest to you. I
resolved to know nothing of it, whatever it might be. The former is
probably the correct interpretation.

Save Jesus Christ - Except Jesus Christ. This is the only thing of which
I purposed to have any knowledge among you.

And him crucified - Or, "even καί kai him that was crucified." He
resolved not only to make the "Messiah" the grand object of his
knowledge and attention there, but even a "crucified" Messiah; to
maintain the doctrine that the Messiah was to be crucified for the sins
of the world; and that he who had been crucified was in fact the
Messiah. See the note at [Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md). We
may remark here:

\(1\) That this should be the resolution of every minister of the
gospel. This is his business. It is not to be a politician; not to
engage in the strifes and controversies of people; it is not to be a
good farmer, or scholar merely; not to mingle with his people in festive
circles and enjoyments; not to be a man of taste and philosophy, and
distinguished mainly for refinement of manners; not to be a profound
philosopher or metaphysician, but to make Christ crucified the grand
object of his attention, and seek always and everywhere to make him
known.

\(2\) he is not to be ashamed anywhere of the humbling doctrine that
Christ was crucified. In this he is to glory. Though the world may
ridicule; though philosophers may sneer; though the rich and the
frivilous may deride it, yet this is to be the grand object of interest
to him, and at no time, and "in no society" is he to be ashamed of it!

\(3\) it matters not what are the amusements of society around him; that
fields of science, of gain, or ambition, are open before him, the
minister of Christ is to know Christ and him crucified alone. If he
cultivates science, it is to be that he may the more successfully
explain and vindicate the gospel. If he becomes in any manner familiar
with the works of art, and of taste, it is that he may more successfully
show to those who cultivate them, the superior beauty and excellency of
the cross. If he studies the plans and the employments of people, it is
that he may more successfully meet them in those plans, and more
successfully speak to them of the great plan of redemption.

\(4\) the preaching of the cross is the only kind of preaching that will
be attended with success. That which has in it much respecting the
divine mission, the dignity, the works, the doctrines, the person, and
the atonement of Christ, will be successful. So it was in the time of
the apostles; so it was in the Reformation; so it was in the Moravian
missions; so it has been in all revivals of religion. There is a power
about that kind of preaching which philosophy and human reason have not.
"Christ is God's great ordinance" for the salvation of the world; and we
meet the crimes and alleviate the woes of the world, just in proportion
as we hold the cross up as appointed to overcome the one, and to pour
the balm of consolation into the other.

[1 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 2:3</span></span>

And I was with you - Paul continued there at least a year and six
months. [Act 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011.md).

In weakness - In conscious feebleness; diffident of my own powers, and
not trusting to my own strength.

And in fear, and in much trembling - Paul was sensible that he had many
enemies to encounter [Act 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md).; and
he was sensible of his own natural disadvantages as a public speaker,
[Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md). He knew too, how much the
Greeks valued a manly and elegant species of oratory; and he, therefore,
delivered his message with deep and anxious solicitude as to the
success. It was at this time, and in view of these circumstances, that
the Lord spoke to him by night in a vision, and said, "be not afraid,
but speak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no man shall
set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city," [Act
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009.md). If Paul was conscious of
weakness, well may other ministers be; and if Paul sometimes trembled in
deep solicitude about the result of his message, well may other
ministers tremble also. It was in such circumstances, and with such
feelings, that the Lord met him to encourage him - And it is when other
ministers feel thus, that the promises of the gospel are inestimably
precious. We may add, that it is then, and then only, that they are
successful. Notwithstanding all Paul's fears, he was successful there.
And it is commonly, perhaps always, when ministers go to their work
conscious of their own weakness; burdened with the weight of their
message; diffident of their own powers; and deeply solicitous about the
result of their labors, that God sends down His Spirit, and converts
sinners to God. The most successful ministers have been men who have
evinced most of this feeling; and most of the revivals of religion have
commenced, and continued, just as ministers have preached, conscious of
their own feebleness, distrusting their own powers, and looking to God
for aid and strength.

[1 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 2:4</span></span>

And my speech - The word "speech" here - if it is to be distinguished
from "preaching" - refers, perhaps, to his more private reasonings; his
preaching to his public discourses.

Not with enticing words - Not with the persuasive reasonings (πειθοῖς
λόγοις peithois logois) of the wisdom of men. Not with that kind of
oratory that was adapted to captivate and charm; and which the Greeks so
much esteemed.

But in demonstration - In the showing ἀποδείξει apodeixei; or in the
testimony or evidence which the Spirit produced. The meaning is, that
the Spirit furnished the evidence of the divine origin of the religion
which he preached, and that it did not depend for its proof on his own
reasonings or eloquence. The proof, the demonstration which the Spirit
furnished was, undoubtedly, the miracles which were performed; the gift
of tongues; and the remarkable conversions which attended the gospel -
The word "Spirit" here refers, doubtless, to the Holy Spirit; and Paul
says that this Spirit had furnished demonstration of the divine origin
and nature of the gospel. This had been by the gift of tongues ([Co1
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005). Compare 1 Cor. 14.md), and by the
effects of his agency in renewing and sanctifying the heart.

And of power - That is, of the power of God [Co1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md); the divine power and efficacy
which attended the preaching of the gospel there. Compare [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md) - The effect of the gospel is the
evidence to which the apostle appeals for its truth. That effect was
seen:

\(1\) In the conversion of sinners to God of all classes, ages, and
conditions, when all human means of reforming them was vain.

\(2\) in its giving them peace, joy, and happiness; and in its
transforming their lives.

\(3\) in making them different people - in making the drunkard sober;
the thief honest; the licentious pure; the profane reverent; the
indolent industrious; the harsh and unkind, gentle and kind; and the
wretched happy.

\(4\) in its diffusing a mild and pure influence over the laws and
customs of society; and in promoting human happiness everywhere - And in
regard to this evidence to which the apostle appeals, we may observe:

\(1\) That is a kind of evidence which anyone may examine, and which no
one can deny. It does not need labored, abstruse argumentation, but it
is everywhere in society. Every man has witnessed the effects of the
gospel in reforming the vicious, and no one can deny that it has this
power.

\(2\) it is a mighty display of the power of God. There is no more
striking exhibition of his power over mind than in a revival of
religion. There is no where more manifest demonstration of his presence
than when, in such a revival, the proud are humbled, the profane are
awed, the blasphemer is silenced, and the profligate, the abandoned, and
the moral are converted unto God, and are led as lost sinners to the
same cross, and find the same peace.

\(3\) the gospel has thus evidenced from age to age that it is from God.
Every converted sinner furnishes such a demonstration; and every
instance where it produces peace, hope, joy, shows that it is from
heaven.

[1 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 2:5</span></span>

That your faith - That is, that your belief of the divine origin of the
Christian religion.

Should not stand - Greek, "should not be;" that is, should not rest upon
this; or be sustained by this. God intended to furnish you a firm and
solid demonstration that the religion which you embraced was from Him;
and this could not be if its preaching had been attended with the graces
of eloquence, or the abstractions of refined metaphysical reasoning. It
would then appear to rest upon human wisdom.

In the power of God - In the evidence of divine power accompanying the
preaching of the gospel. The power of God would attend the exhibition of
truth everywhere; and would be a demonstration that would be
irresistible that the religion was not originated by man, but was from
heaven. That power was seen in changing the heart; in overcoming the
strong propensities of our nature to sin; in subduing the soul; and
making the sinner a new creature in Christ Jesus. Every Christian has
thus, in his own experience, furnished demonstration that the religion
which he loves is from God, and not from man. man could not subdue these
sins; and man could not so entirely transform the soul. And although the
unlearned Christian may not be able to investigate all the evidences of
religion; although he cannot meet all the objections of cunning and
subtle infidels, although he may be greatly perplexed and embarrassed by
them, yet he may have the fullest proof that he loves God, that he is
different from what he once was; and that all this has been accomplished
by the religion of the cross.

The blind man that was made to see by the Saviour John 10, might have
been wholly unable to tell how his eyes were opened, and unable to meet
all the cavils of those who might doubt it, or all the subtle and
cunning objections of physiologists, but of one thing he certainly could
not doubt, that "whereas he was blind, he then saw;" [Joh
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025.md). A man may have no doubt that
the sun shines, that the wind blows, that the tides rise, that the blood
flows in his veins, that the flowers bloom, and that this could not be
except it was from God, while he may have no power to explain these
facts; and no power to meet the objections and cavils of those who might
choose to embarrass him. So people may know that their hearts are
changed; and it is on this ground that no small part of the Christian
world, as in everything else, depend for the most satisfactory evidence
of their religion. On this ground humble and unlearned Christians have
been often willing to go to the stake as martyrs - just as a humble and
unlearned patriot is willing to die for his country. He loves it; and he
is willing to die for it. A Christian loves his God and Saviour; and is
willing to die for his sake.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

How be it - But δε de. This commences the "second" head or argument in
this chapter, in which Paul shows that if human wisdom is missing in his
preaching, it is not devoid of true, and solid, and even divine wisdom -
Bloomfield.

We speak wisdom - We do not admit that we utter foolishness. We have
spoken of the foolishness of preaching [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md); and of the estimate in which it
was held by the world [Co1 1:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md);
and of our own manner among you as not laying claim to human learning or
eloquence; but we do not design to admit that we have been really
speaking folly. We have been uttering that which is truly wise, but
which is seen and understood to be such only by those who are qualified
to judge - by those who may be denominated "perfect," that is, those who
are suited by God to understand it. By "wisdom" here, the apostle means
that system of truth which he had explained and defended - the plan of
salvation by the cross of Christ.

Among them that are perfect - (ἐν τοῖς τελείοις en tois teleios). This
word "perfect" is here evidently applied to Christians, as it is in [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md), "Let us therefore as many as be
perfect, be thus minded." And it is clearly used to denote those who
were advanced in Christian knowledge; who were qualified to understand
the subject; who had made progress in the knowledge of the mysteries of
the gospel; and who thus saw its excellence. It does not mean here that
they were sinless, for the argument of the apostle does not bear on that
inquiry, but that they were qualified to understand the gospel in
contradistinction from the gross, the sensual, and the carnally minded,
who rejected it as foolishness. There is, perhaps, here an allusion to
the pagan mysteries, where those who had been fully initiated were said
to be perfect - fully instructed in those rites and doctrines. And if
so, then this passage means, that those only who have been fully
instructed in the knowledge of the Christian religion, will be qualified
to see its beauty and its wisdom. The gross and sensual do not see it,
and those only who are enlightened by the Holy Spirit are qualified to
appreciate its beauty and its excellency.

Not the wisdom of the world - Not that which this world has originated
or loved.

Nor of the princes of this world - Perhaps intending chiefly here the
rulers of the Jews; see [Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). They
neither devised it, nor loved it, nor saw its wisdom; [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md).

That come to naught - That is, whose plans fail; whose wisdom vanishes;
and who themselves, with all their pomp and splendor, come to nothing in
the grave; compare Isa. 14. All the plans of human wisdom shall fail;
and this which is originated by God only shall stand,

[1 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 2:7</span></span>

But we speak - We who have preached the gospel.

The wisdom of God - We teach or proclaim the wise plan of God for the
salvation of people; we make known the divine wisdom in regard to the
scheme of human redemption. This plan was of God, in opposition to other
plans which were of human beings.

In a mystery, even the hidden wisdom - ἐν μυστηρίῳ τὴν ἀποκεκρυμμένην en
mustēriō tēn apokekrummenēn. The words "even" and "wisdom" in this
translation have been supplied by our translators; and the sense would
be more perspicuous if they were omitted, and the translation should be
literally made, "We proclaim the divine wisdom hidden in a mystery." The
apostle does not say that their preaching was mysterious, nor that their
doctrine was unintelligible, but he refers to the fact that this wisdom
had been "hidden in a mystery" from people until that time, but was then
revealed by the gospel. In other words, he does not say that what they
then declared was hidden in a mystery, but that they made known the
divine wisdom which had been concealed from the minds of people. The
word "mystery" with us is commonly used in the sense of that which is
beyond comprehension; and it is often applied to such doctrines as
exhibit difficulties which we are not able to explain.

But this is not the sense in which it is commonly used in the
Scriptures; see the note at [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md); compare Campbell on the
Gospels, Dissertation 9; part 1. The word properly denotes that which is
"concealed" or "hidden;" that which has not yet been made known; and is
applied to those truths which until the revelation of Jesus Christ were
concealed from people, which were either hidden under obscure types and
shadows or prophecies, or which had been altogether unrevealed, and
unknown to the world. The word stands opposed to that which is revealed,
not to that which is in itself plain. The doctrines to which the word
relates may be in themselves clear and simple, but they are hidden in
mystery until they are revealed. From this radical idea in the word
"mystery," however, it came also to be applied not only to those
doctrines which had not been made known, but to those also which were in
themselves deep and difficult to that which is enigmatical and obscure;
[Co1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002.md); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md).

It is applied also to the secret designs and purposes of God; [Rev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007.md). The word is most commonly
applied by Paul to the secret and long concealed design of God to make
known his gospel to the Gentiles; to break down the wall between them
and the Jews; and to spread the blessings of the true religion
everywhere; [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md). Here, it evidently means the
beauty and excellency of the person and plans of Jesus Christ, but which
were in fact unknown to the princes of this world. It does not imply, of
necessity, that they could not have understood them, nor that they were
unintelligible, but that, in fact, whatever was the cause, they were
concealed from them. Paul says [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md), that had they known his wisdom,
they would not have crucified him - which implies at least that it was
not in itself unintelligible; and he further says, that this mystery had
been revealed to Christians by the Spirit of God, which proves that he
does not here refer to that which is in itself unintelligible; [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md). "The apostle has here especially
in view the all-wise counsel of God for the salvation of people by Jesus
Christ, in the writings of the Old Testament only obscurely signified,
and to the generality of people utterly unknown" - Bloomfield.

Which God ordained - Which plan, so full of wisdom, God appointed in his
own purpose before the foundation of the world; that is, it was a plan
which from eternity he determined to execute. It was not a new device;
it had not been got up to serve an occasion; but it was a plan laid deep
in the eternal counsel of God, and on which he had his eye forever
fixed. This passage proves, that God had a plan, and that this plan was
eternal. This is all that is involved in the doctrine of eternal decrees
or purposes. And if God had a plan about this, there is the same reason
to think that he had a plan in regard to all things.

Unto our glory - In order that we might be honored or glorified. This
may refer either to the honor which was put upon Christians in this
life, in being admitted to the privileges of the sons of God; or more
probably to that "eternal weight of glory" which remains for them in
heaven; [Co2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md). One design of that
plan was to raise the redeemed to "glory, and honor, and immortality."
It should greatly increase our gratitude to God, that it was a subject
of eternal design; that he always has cherished this purpose; and that
he has loved us with such love, and sought our happiness and salvation
with such intensity, that in order to accomplish it, he was willing to
give his own Son to die on a cross.

[1 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 2:8</span></span>

Which none of the princes - None of those rulers who were engaged in the
crucifixion of the Messiah, referring both to the Jewish rulers, and the
Roman governor.

Knew - They did not perceive or appreciate the excellency of his
character, the wisdom of his plan, the glory of his scheme of salvation.
Their ignorance arose from not understanding the prophecies, and from an
unwillingness to be convinced that Jesus of Nazareth had been truly sent
by God. In [Act 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md), Peter says that
it was through ignorance that the Jews had put him to death; see the
note on this place.

For had they known it - Had they fully understood his character, and
seen the wisdom of his plan, and his work, they would not have put him
to death; see the note on [Act 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md).
Had they seen the hidden wisdom in that plan - had they understood the
glory of his real character, the truth respecting his incarnation, and
the fact that he was the long expected Messiah of their nation, they
would not have put him to death. It is incredible that they would have
crucified their Messiah, knowing and believing him to be such. They
might have known it but they were unwilling to examine the evidence.
They expected a different Messiah, and were unwilling to admit the
claims of Jesus of Nazareth. For This ignorance, however, there was no
excuse. If they did not have a full knowledge, it was their own fault.
Jesus had performed miracles which were a complete attestation to his
divine mission [Joh 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md); [Joh
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025.md); but they closed their eyes on
those works, and were unwilling to be convinced - God always gives to
people sufficient demonstration of the truth, but they close their eyes,
and are unwilling to believe. This is the sole reason why they are not
converted to God and saved.

They would not have crucified - It is perfectly manifest that the Jews
would not have crucified their own Messiah, "knowing him to be such." He
was the hope and expectation of their nation. All their desires were
centered in him. And to him they looked for deliverance from all their
foes.

The Lord of glory - This expression is a Hebraism, and means "the
glorious Lord;" or the "Messiah." Expressions like this, where a noun
performs the office of an adjective, are common in the Hebrew language -
Grotius supposes that the expression is taken from that of "the King of
glory," in [Psa 24:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md) -

Lift up your heads, O ye gates,

Be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors,

And the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory?

Jehovah, strong and mighty.

Jehovah, mighty in battle.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates;

Lift them up, ye everlasting doors;

And the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory?

Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory.

God is called "the God of glory" in [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md) - The fact that this appellation
is given to Yahweh in the Old Testament, and to the Lord Jesus in the
verse before us, is one of those incidental circumstances which show how
the Lord Jesus was estimated by the apostles and how familiarly they
applied to him names and titles which belong only to God. The foundation
of this appellation is laid in his exalted perfections; and in the honor
and majesty which he had with the Father before the world was; [Joh
17:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md).

[1 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 2:9</span></span>

But as it is written - This passage is quoted from [Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md). It is not quoted literally; but
the sense only is given. The words are found in the apocryphal books of
Elijah; and Origen and Jerome supposed that Paul quoted from those
books. But it is evident that Paul had in his eye the passage in Isaiah;
and intended to apply it to his present purpose. These words are often
applied by commentators and others to the future life, and are supposed
by them to be descriptive of the state of the blessed there. But against
the supposition that they refer directly to the future state, there are
insuperable objections:

\(1\) The first is, that the passage in Isaiah has no such reference. In
that place it is designed clearly to describe the blessedness of those
who were admitted to the divine favor; who had communion with God; and
to whom God manifested himself as their friend. That blessedness is said
to be superior to all that people elsewhere enjoy; to be such as could
be found no where else but in God. See [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md), [Isa
64:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md), [Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md). It is used there, as Paul uses
it, to denote the happiness which results from the communication of the
divine favor to the soul.

\(2\) the object of the apostle is not to describe the future state of
the redeemed. It is to prove that those who are Christians have true
wisdom [Co1 2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); or that they have
views of truth, and of the excellence of the plan of salvation which the
world has not, and which those who crucified the Lord Jesus did not
possess. The thing which he is describing here, is not merely the
happiness of Christians, but their views of the wisdom of the plan of
salvation. They have views of that which the eyes of other people have
not seen; a view of wisdom, and fitness, and beauty which can be found
in no other plan. It is true that this view is attended with a high
degree of comfort; but the comfort is not the immediate thing in the eye
of the apostle.

\(3\) the declaration in [Co1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md), is
conclusive proof that Paul does not refer to the happiness of heaven. He
there says that God has revealed these things to Christians by his
Spirit. But if already revealed, assuredly it does not refer to that
which is yet to come. But although this does not refer directly to
heaven, there may be an application of the passage to a future state in
an indirect manner, which is not improper. If there are such
manifestations of wisdom in the plan here; if Christians see so much of
its beauty here on earth; and if their views so far surpass all that the
world sees and enjoys, how much greater and purer will be the
manifestations of wisdom and goodness in the world of glory.

Eye hath not seen - This is the same as saying, that no one had ever
fully perceived and understood the value and beauty of those things
which God has prepared for his people. All the world had been strangers
to this until God made a revelation to his people by his Spirit. The
blessedness which the apostle referred to had been unknown alike to the
Jews and the Gentiles.

Nor ear heard - We learn the existence and quality of objects by the
external senses; and those senses are used to denote any acquisition of
knowledge. To say that the eye had not seen, nor the ear heard, was,
therefore, the same as saying that it was not known at all. All people
had been ignorant of it.

Neither have entered into the heart of man - No man has conceived it; or
understood it. It is new; and is above all that man has seen, and felt,
and known.

The things which God hath prepared - The things which God "has held in
reserve" (Bloomfield); that is, what God has appointed in the gospel for
his people. The thing to which the apostle here refers particularly, is
the wisdom which was revealed in the gospel; but he also intends,
doubtless, to include all the provisions of mercy and happiness which
the gospel makes known to the people of God. Those things relate to the
pardon of sin; to the atonement, and to justification by faith; to the
peace and joy which religion imparts; to the complete and final
redemption from sin and death which the gospel is suited to produce, and
which it will ultimately effect. In all these respects, the blessings
which the gospel confers, surpass the full comprehension of people; and
are infinitely beyond all that man could know or experience without the
religion of Christ. And if on earth the gospel confers such blessings on
its friends, how much higher and purer shall be the joys which it shalt
bestow in heaven!

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

But God hath revealed them - That is, those elevated views and
enjoyments to which people everywhere else had been strangers, and which
have been under all other forms of religion unknown, have been
communicated to us by the revelation of God - This verse commences the
"third" part of this chapter, in which the apostle shows how these
truths, so full of wisdom had been communicated to Christians. It had
not been by any native endowments of theirs; not by any strength of
faculties, or powers. but solely by revelation from God.Unto us - That
is, first to the apostles; secondly, to all Christians - to the church
and the world through their inspired instructors; and third, to all
Christians by the illuminating agency of the Spirit on their hearts. The
connection shows that he did not mean to confine this declaration to the
apostles merely, for his design was to show that all Christians had this
knowledge of the true wisdom. It was true that this was revealed in an
eminent manner to the apostles, and through their inspired preaching and
writings; but it is also true, that the same truths are communicated by
the agency of the same Spirit to all Christians; [Joh
16:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md). No truth is now communicated
to Christians which was not revealed to and by the inspired writers; but
the same truths are imparted by means of their writings, and by the
illumination of the Spirit to all the true friends of God.

By his Spirit - By the Holy Spirit, that was promised by the Saviour.
[Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md). This proves:

\(1\) That people by nature are not able to discover the deep things of
God - the truths which are needful to salvation.

\(2\) that the apostles were inspired by the Holy Spirit; and if so,
then the Scriptures are inspired.

\(3\) that all Christians are the subjects of the teaching of the Holy
Spirit; that these truths are made known to them by his illumination;
and that but for this, they would remain in the same darkness as other
men.

For the Spirit - The Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of God; see [Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md).

Searcheth - This word does not fully express the force of the original
ἐρευνᾷ ereuna. It means to search accurately, diligently, so as fully to
understand; such profound research as to have thorough knowledge. So
David uses the Hebrew word חקר chaaqar in [Psa
139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001.md). So the word is used to denote a
careful and accurate investigation of secret and obscure things, in [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). Compare [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md); [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md); [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md), where it is used to denote that
profound and accurate search by which the desires and feelings of the
heart are known - implying the most profound knowledge of which we can
have any conception; see [Pro 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md).
Here it means, that the Holy Spirit has an intimate knowledge of all
things. It is not to be supposed that he searches, or inquires as people
do who are ignorant; but that he has an intimate and profound knowledge,
such as is usually the result of a close and accurate search. The result
is what the apostle means to state - the accurate, profound, and
thorough knowledge, such as usually attends research. He does not state
the mode in which it is obtained; but the fact. And he uses a word more
emphatic than simple knowledge, because he designs to indicate that his
knowledge is profound, entire, and thorough.

All things - All subjects; all laws; all events; all beings.

The deep things of God - He has a thorough knowledge of the hidden
counsels or purposes of God; of all his plans and purposes. He sees all
his designs. He sees all his councils; all his purposes in regard to the
government of the universe, and the scheme of salvation. He knows all
whom God designs to save; he sees all that they need; and he sees how
the plan of God is suited to their salvation - This passage proves:

\(1\) That the Spirit is, in some respects, distinct from the Father, or
from him who is here called God. Else how could he be said to search all
things, even the deep purposes of God? To "search" implies "action,
thought, personality." An attribute of God cannot be said to search. How
could it be said of the justice, the goodness, the power, or the wisdom
of God that it "searches," or "acts?" To search, is the action of an
intelligent agent, and cannot be performed by an attribute.

\(2\) the Spirit is omniscient. He searches or clearly understands "all
things" - the very definition of omniscience. He understands all the
profound plans and counsels of God. And how can there be a higher
demonstration of omniscience than to "know God?" - But if omniscient,
the Holy Spirit is divine - for this is one of the incommunicable
attributes of God; [Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md); [Psa
139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001.md); [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md).

\(3\) he is not a distinct being from God. There is a union between him
and God, such as may be compared to the union between a man and his
soul, [Co1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md). God is one; and
though he subsists as Father, Son, and Spirit, yet he is one God, [Deu
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md) - This passage is, therefore, a
very important, and a decisive one in regard to the personality and
divinity of the Holy Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 2:11</span></span>

For what man ... - The design of this is, to illustrate what he had just
said by a reference to the way in which man acquires the knowledge of
himself. The purpose is to show that the Spirit has an exact and
thorough knowledge of the things of God; and this is done by the very
striking thought that no man can know his own mind, his own plans and
intentions, but himself - his own spirit. The essential idea is, that no
man can know another; that his thoughts and designs can only be known by
himself, or by his own spirit; and that unless he chooses to reveal them
to others, they cannot ascertain them. So of God. No man can penetrate
his designs; and unless he chooses to make them known by his Spirit,
they must forever remain inscrutable to human view.

The things of a man - The "deep things" - the hidden counsels, thoughts,
plans, intentions.

Save the spirit of man ... - Except his own mind; that is, himself. No
other man can fully know them. By the spirit of man here, Paul designs
to denote the human soul - or the intellect of man. It is not to be
supposed that he here intends to convey the idea that there is a perfect
resemblance between the relation which the soul of man bears to the man,
and the relation which the Holy Spirit bears to God. The illustration is
to be taken in regard to the point immediately before him - which is,
that no one could know and communicate the deep thoughts and plans of
God except his Spirit - just as no one could penetrate into the
intentions of a man, and fully know them, but himself. The passage
proves, therefore, that there is a knowledge which the Spirit has of
God, which no man, no angel can obtain, just as every man's spirit has a
knowledge of his own plans which no other man can obtain; that the
Spirit of God can communicate his plans and deep designs, just as a man
can communicate his own intentions; and consequently, that while there
is a distinction of some kind between the Spirit of God and God, as
there is a distinction which makes it proper to say that a man has an
intelligent soul, yet there is such a profound and intimate knowledge of
God by the Spirit, that he must be equal with him; and such an intimate
union, that he can be called "the Spirit of God," and be one with God,
as the human soul can be called "the spirit of the man," and be one with
him.

In all respects we are not to suppose that there is a similarity. In
these points there is - It may be added that the union, the oneness of
the Spirit of God with God, is no more absurd or inexplicable than the
union of the spirit of man with the man; or the oneness of the complex
person made up of body and soul, which we call man. When people have
explained all the difficulties about themselves - in regard to their own
bodies and spirits, it will be time to advance objections against the
doctrines here stated in regard to God.

Even so - To the same extent; in like manner.

The things of God - His deep purposes and plans.

Knoweth no man - Man cannot search into them - any more than one man can
search the intentions of another.

[1 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 2:12</span></span>

Now we have received - We who are Christians; and especially we, the
apostles. The following verse shows that he had himself and the other
apostles chiefly in view; though it is true of all Christians that they
have received, not the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is of
God.

Not the spirit of this world - Not the wisdom and knowledge which this
world can give - not the learning and philosophy which were so much
valued in Greece. The views of truth which we have, are not such as this
world gives, but are such as are communicated by the Spirit of God.

But the Spirit which is of God - We are under the teaching's and
influence of the Holy Spirit.

That we might know - That we might fully understand and appreciate. The
Spirit is given to us in order that we might fully understand the favors
which God has conferred on us in the gospel. It was not only necessary
that God should grant the blessings of redemption by the gift of His
Son, but, such was the hardness and blindness of the human heart, it was
needful that he should grant His Holy Spirit also, so that people might
be brought fully to see and appreciate the value of those favors. For
people do not see them by nature; neither does anyone see them who is
not enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God.

The things that are freely given us - That are conferred on us as a
matter of grace or favor. He here refers to the blessings of redemption
- the pardon of sin, justification, sanctification, the divine favor and
protection, and the hope of eternal life - These things we Know; they
are not matters of conjecture; but are surely and certainly confirmed to
us by the Holy Spirit. It is possible for all Christians to know and be
fully assured of the truth of those things, and of their interest in
them.

[1 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 2:13</span></span>

Which things we speak - Which great, and glorious, and certain truths,
we, the apostles, preach and explain.

Not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth - Not such as human
philosophy or eloquence would dictate. They do not have their origin in
the devices of human wisdom, and they are not expressed in such words of
dazzling and attractive rhetoric as would be employed by those who pride
themselves on the wisdom of this world.

But which the Holy Ghost teacheth - That is, in the words which the Holy
Spirit imparts to us. Locke understands this as referring to the fact
that the apostles used "the language and expressions" which the Holy
Spirit had taught in the revelations of the Scriptures. But this is
evidently giving a narrow view of the subject. The apostle is speaking
of the whole course of instruction by which the deep things of God were
made known to the Christian church; and all this was not made known in
the very words which were already contained in the Old Testament. He
evidently refers to the fact that the apostles were themselves under the
direction of the Holy Spirit, in the words and doctrines which they
imparted; and this passage is a full proof that they laid claim to
divine inspiration. It is further observable that he says, that this was
done in such "words" as the Holy Spirit taught, referring not to the
doctrines or subjects merely, but to the manner of expressing them. It
is evident here that he lays claim to an inspiration in regard to the
words which he used, or to the manner of his stating the doctrines of
revelation. Words are the signs of thoughts; and if God designed that
his truth should be accurately expressed in human language, there must
have been a supervision over the words used, that such should be
employed, and such only, as should accurately express the sense which he
intended to convey.

Comparing spiritual things with spiritual - πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ
συγκρίνοντες pneumatikois pneumatika sugkrinontes. This expression has
been very variously interpreted; and is very difficult of explanation.
LeClerc renders it "speaking spiritual things to spiritual men." Most of
the fathers rendered it: "comparing the things which were written by the
Spirit of the Old Testament with what is now revealed to us by the same
Spirit, and confirming our doctrine by them." Calvin renders the word
"comparing" by "fitting," or adapting ("aptare"), and says that it means
"that he adapted spiritual things to spiritual people, while he
accommodated words to the thing; that is he tempered that celestial
wisdom of the Spirit with simple language, and which conveyed by itself
the native energy of the Spirit." Thus, says he, he reproved the vanity
of those who attempted to secure human applause by a turgid and subtle
mode of argument.

Grotius accords with the fathers, and renders it, "explaining those
things which the prophets spake by the Spirit of God, by those things
which Christ has made known to us by his Spirit." Macknight renders it:
"explaining spiritual things in words taught by the Spirit." So
Doddridge - The word rendered "comparing" συγκρίνοντες sugkrinontes,
means properly "to collect, join, mingle, unite together"; then "to
separate or distinguish parts of things and unite them into one"; then
"to judge of the qualities of objects by carefully separating or
distinguishing"; then "to compare for the purpose of judging," etc.
Since it means to compare one thing with another for the purpose of
explaining its nature, it comes to signify to "interpret," to "explain;"
and in this sense it is often used by the Septuagint as a translation of
the Hebrew word פתר phathar, "to open, unfold, explain." (See [Gen
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008.md), [Gen
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#016.md), [Gen
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#022.md); [Gen
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#012.md), [Gen
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#015).md); also of פרשׁ paarash, "to
explain"; and of the Chaldee peshar, [Dan
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#013.md), [Dan
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#017.md). See also [Dan
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004.md), [Dan
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#009.md),[Dan
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016.md), [Dan
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024.md), [Dan
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#026.md), [Dan
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030.md), [Dan
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#036.md), [Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045.md); [Dan
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#003.md), [Dan
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#006.md),[Dan
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016.md); [Dan
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md), [Dan
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#013.md), [Dan
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#016.md), [Dan
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018.md), [Dan
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#020.md); [Dan
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#016.md), in all which places the noun
σύγκρισις sugkrisis, is used in the same sense. In this sense the word
is, doubtless, used here, and is to be interpreted in the sense of
"explaining, unfolding." There is no reason, either in the word used
here, or in the argument of the apostle, why the sense of comparing
should be retained.

Spiritual things - πνευματικὰ pneumatika. Things, doctrines, subjects
that pertain to the teaching of the Spirit. It does not mean things
"spiritual" in opposition to "fleshly;" or "intellectual" in opposition
to things pertaining to "matter;" but spiritual as the things referred
to were such as were performed, and revealed by the Holy Spirit - his
doctrines on the subject of religion under the new dispensation, and his
influence on the heart.

With spiritual - πνευματικοῖς pneumatikois. This is an adjective; and
may be either masculine or neuter. It is evident, that some noun is
understood. That may be either:

\(1\) ανθρωποις anthrōpois, "men" - and then it will mean "to spiritual
men" - that is, to people who are enlightened or taught by the Spirit
and thus many commentators understand it; or,

\(2\) It may be λόγοις logois, "words" - and then it may mean, either
that the "spiritual things" were explained by "words" and illustrations
drawn from the writings of the Old Testament, inspired by the Spirit -
as most of the fathers, and many moderns understand it; or that the
"things spiritual" were explained by-words which the Holy Spirit then
communicated, and which were adapted to the subject - simple, pure,
elevated; not gross, not turgid, not distinguished for rhetoric, and not
such as the Greeks sought, but such as became the Spirit of God
communicating great, sublime, yet simple truths to people.

It will then mean "explaining doctrines that pertain to the Spirit's
teaching and influence in words that are taught; by the same Spirit, and
that are suited to convey in the most intelligible manner those
doctrines to men." Here the idea of the Holy Spirit's present agency is
kept up throughout; the idea that he communicates the doctrine, and the
mode of stating it to man - The supposition that λόγοις logois, words,
is the word understood here, is favored by the fact that it occurs in
the previous part of this verse. And if this be the sense, it means that
the words which were used by the apostles were pure, simple,
unostentatious, and undistinguished by display - such as became
doctrines taught by the Holy Spirit, when communicated in words
suggested by the same Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

But the natural man - ψυχικὸς, δὲ ἄνθρωπος psuchikos de anthrōpos. The
word "natural" here stands opposed evidently to "spiritual." It denotes
those who are governed and influenced by the natural instincts; the
animal passions and desires, in opposition to those who are influenced
by the Spirit of God. It refers to unregenerate people; but it has also
not merely the idea of their being unregenerate, but that of their being
influenced by the animal passions or desires. See the note on [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md). The word "sensual" would
correctly express the idea. The word is used by the Greek writers to
denote that which man has in common with the brutes - to denote that
they are under the influence of the senses, or the mere animal nature,
in opposition to reason and conscience - Bretschneider. See [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md). Here it denotes that they are
under the influence of the senses, or the animal nature, in opposition
to being influenced by the Spirit of God. Macknight and Doddridge render
it: "the animal man."

Whitby understands by it the man who rejects revelation, the man who is
under the influence of carnal wisdom. The word occurs but six times in
the New Testament; [Co1 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046.md); [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md); [Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019.md). In [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046.md), it is rendered "natural," and
is applied to the body as it exists before death, in contradistinction
from what shall exist after the resurrection - called a spiritual body.
In [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md), it is applied to wisdom:
"This wisdom - is earthly, sensual, devilish." In [Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019.md), it is applied to sensual
persons, or those who are governed by the senses in opposition to those
who are influenced by the Spirit: "These be they who separate
themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit." The word here evidently
denotes those who are under the influence of the senses; who are
governed by the passions and the animal appetites, and natural desires;
and who are uninfluenced by the Spirit of God. And it may be observed
that this was the case with the great mass of the pagan world, even
including the philosophers.

Receiveth not - οὐ δέχεται ou dechetai, does not "embrace" or
"comprehend" them. That is, he rejects them as folly; he does not
perceive their beauty, or their wisdom; he despises them. He loves other
things better. A man of intemperance does not receive or love the
arguments for temperance; a man of licentiousness, the arguments for
chastity; a liar, the arguments for truth. So a sensual or worldly man
does not receive or love the arguments for religion.

The things of the Spirit of God - The doctrines which are inspired by
the Holy Spirit, and the things which pertain to his influence on the
heart and life. The things of the Spirit of God here denote all the
things which the Holy Spirit produces.

Neither can he know them - Neither can he understand or comprehend them.
Perhaps, also, the word "know" here implies also the idea of "loving,"
or "approving" of them, as it often does in the Scripture. Thus, to know
the Lord often means to love him, to have a full, practical acquaintance
with him. When the apostle says that the animal or sensual man cannot
know those things, he may have reference to one of two things. Either:

\(1\) That those doctrines were not discoverable by human wisdom, or by
any skill which the natural man may have, but were to be learned only by
revelation. This is the main drift of his argument, and this sense is
given by Locke and Whitby. Or,

\(2\) He may mean that the sensual the unrenewed man cannot perceive
their beauty and their force, even after they are revealed to man,
unless the mind is enlightened and inclined by the Spirit of God. This
is probably the sense of the passage.

This is the simple affirmation of a fact - that while the man remains
sensual and carnal, he cannot perceive the beauty of those doctrines.
And this is a simple and well known fact. It is a truth - universal and
lamentable - that the sensual man, the worldly man, the proud, haughty,
and self-confident man; the man under the influence of his animal
appetites - licentious, false, ambitious, and vain - does not perceive
any beauty in Christianity. So the intemperate man perceives no beauty
in the arguments for temperance; the adulterer, no beauty in the
arguments for chastity; the liar, no beauty in the arguments for truth.
It is a simple fact, that while he is intemperate, or licentious, or
false, he can perceive no beauty in these doctrines.

But this does not prove that he has no natural faculties for perceiving
the force and beauty of these arguments; or that he might not apply his
mind to their investigation, and be brought to embrace them; or that he
might not abandon the love of intoxicating drinks, and sensuality, and
falsehood, and be a man of temperance, purity, and truth. He has all the
natural faculties which are requisite in the case; and all the inability
is his "strong love" of intoxicating drinks, or impurity, or falsehood.
So of the sensual sinner. While he thus remains in love with sin, he
cannot perceive the beauty of the plan of salvation, or the excellency
of the doctrines of religion. He needs just the love of these things,
and the hatred of sin. He needs to cherish the influences of the Spirit;
to receive what He has taught, and not to reject it through the love of
sin; he needs to yield himself to their influences, and then their
beauty will be seen.

The passage here proves that while a man is thus sensual, the things of
the Spirit will appear to him to be folly; it proves nothing about his
ability, or his natural faculty, to see the excellency of these things,
and to turn from his sin. It is the affirmation of a simple fact
everywhere discernible, that the natural man does not perceive the
beauty of these things; that while he remains in that state he cannot;
and that if he is ever brought to perceive their beauty, it will be by
the influence of the Holy Spirit. Such is his love of sin, that he never
will be brought to see their beauty except by the agency of the Holy
Spirit. "For wickedness perverts the judgment, and makes people err with
respect to practical principles; so that no one can be wise and
judicious who is not good." Aristotle, as quoted by Bloomfield.

They are spiritually discerned - That is, they are perceived by the aid
of the Holy Spirit enlightening the mind and influencing the heart.

(The expression ψυχικὸς ἄνθρωπος psuchikos anthrōpos; has given rise to
much controversy. Frequent attempts have been made to explain it, merely
of the animal or sensual man. If this be the true sense, the doctrine of
human depravity, in as far at least as this text may be supposed to bear
upon it, is greatly invalidated. The apostle would seem to affirm only,
that individuals, addicted to the gross indulgences of sense, are
incapable of discerning and appreciating spiritual things. Thus, a large
exception would be made in favor of all those who might be styled
intellectual and moral persons, living above the inferior appetites, and
directing their faculties to the candid investigation of truth. That the
phrase, however, is to be explained of the natural or "unregenerate"
man, whether distinguished for intellectual refinement, and external
regard to morals, or degraded by animal indulgence, will appear evident
from an examination of the passage.

The word in dispute comes from ψυχή psuchē, which though it primarily
signify the breath or animal life, is by no means confined to that
sense, but sometimes embraces the mind or soul "as distinguished both
from man's body and from his πνεῦμα pneuma, or spirit, breathed into him
immediately by God" - See Parkhurst's Greek Lexicon. The etymology of
the word does not necessarily require us, then, to translate it
"sensual." The context therefore alone must determine the matter. Now
the "natural man" is there opposed to the spiritual man, the ψυχικὸς
psuchikos to the πνευματικὸς pneumatikos, and if the latter be explained
of "him who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit" - who is regenerate - the
former must be explained of him who is not enlightened by that Spirit,
who is still in a state of nature; and will thus embrace a class far
more numerous than the merely sensual part of mankind.

Farther; the general scope of the passage demands this view. The
Corinthians entertained an excessive fondness for human learning and
wisdom. They loved philosophical disquisition and oratorical display,
and may therefore have been impatient of the "enticing words" of Paul.
To correct their mistaken taste, the apostle asserts and proves the
utter insufficiency of human wisdom, either to discover spiritual
things, or to appreciate them when discovered. He exclaims "where is the
'wise'? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath
not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" [Co1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md), [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031.md). Now it would be strange indeed,
if in bringing his argument to a conclusion, he should simply assert,
that "sensual" people were incapable of spiritual discernment. So lame
and impotent a conclusion is not to be attributed to the apostle. The
disputed phrase, therefore, must be understood of all unregenerate
persons, however free from gross sin, or eminent in intellectual
attainment. Indeed it is the "proud wisdom" of the world, and not its
sensuality, that the apostle? throughout has chiefly in view. Add to all
this; that the simplicity of the gospel has "in reality" met with more
bitter opposition and pointed scorn, from people of worldly wisdom, than
from people of the sensual class. Of the former, is it especially true
that they have counted the gospel "foolishness" and contemptuously
rejected its message.

Of this natural man it is affirmed that he cannot know the things of the
Spirit of God. He can know them "speculatively," and may enlarge on them
with great accuracy and beauty, but he cannot know them so as to approve
and receive. Allowing the incapacity to be moral, not natural or
physical, that is to say, it arises from "disinclination or perversion
of will:" still the spiritual perception is affected by the fall, and
whether that be directly or indirectly through the will, matters not,
"as far as the fact is concerned." It remains the same. The mind of man,
when applied to spiritual subjects, does not now have the same
discernment that it originally had, and as our author remarks, if it is
ever brought to perceive their beauty, it must be by the agency of the
Spirit. (See the supplementary note on [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007)..md)

[1 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 2:15</span></span>

But he that is spiritual - The man who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit
in contradistinction from him who is under the influence of the senses
only.

Judgeth - Greek: "Discerns." (margin); the same word as in the previous
verse. It means that the spiritual man has a discernment of these truths
in regard to which the sensual man was blind and ignorant.

All things - Not absolutely all things; or not that he is omniscient;
but that he has a view of those things to which the apostle had
reference - that is, to the things which are revealed to man by the Holy
Spirit.

Yet he himself is judged - Greek, as in the margin, "is discerned;" that
is, his feelings, principles, views, hopes, fears, joys, cannot be fully
understood and appreciated by any natural or sensual man. He does not
comprehend the principles which actuate him; he does not enter into his
joys; he does not sympathize with him in his feelings. This is a matter
of simple truth and universal observation. The reason is added in the
following verse, that as the Christian is influenced by the Lord and as
the natural man does not know him, so he cannot know him who is
influenced by him; that is the Christian.

[1 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 2:16</span></span>

For who hath known ... - This passage is quoted from [Isa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md). The interrogative form is a
strong mode of denying that anyone has ever known the mind of the Lord.
The argument of Paul is this, "No one can understand God. No one can
fully comprehend his plans, his feelings, his views, his designs. No one
by nature, under the influence of sense and passion, is either disposed
to investigate his truths, or loves them when they are revealed. But the
Christian is influenced by God. He has his Spirit. He has the mind of
Christ; who had the mind of God. He sympathizes with Christ; he has his
feelings, desires, purposes, and plans. And as no one can fully
understand God by nature, so neither can he understand him who is
influenced by God, and is like him; and it is not to be wondered at that
he regards the Christian religion as folly, and the Christian as a fool.

The mind of Christ - The views, feelings, and temper of Christ. We are
influenced by his Spirit.

Remarks On 1 Corinthians 2

1\. Ministers of the gospel should not be too anxious to be
distinguished for excellency of speech or language, [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md). Their aim should be to speak the
simple truth, in language pure and intelligible to all. Let it be
remembered, that if there ever was any place where it would be proper to
seek such graces of eloquence, it was Corinth. If in any city now, or in
any refined and genteel society it would be proper, it would have been
proper in Corinth. Let this thought rebuke those, who, when they preach
to a frivilous and fashionable auditory, seek to fill their sermons with
ornament rather than with solid thought; with the tinsel of rhetoric,
rather than with pure language. Paul was right in his course; and was
wise. True taste abhors meretricious ornaments, as much as the gospel
does. And the man who is called to preach in a rich and fashionable
congregation, should remember, that he is stationed there not to please
the ear, but to save the soul; that his object is not to display his
talent or his eloquence, but to rescue his hearers from ruin. This
purpose will make the mere ornaments of rhetoric appear small. It will
give: seriousness to his discourse; gravity to his diction; unction to
his eloquence; heart to his arguments; and success to his ministry.

2\. The purpose of every minister should be like that of Paul, to preach
Christ and only him crucified. See the note on [Co1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md).

3\. If Paul trembled at Corinth in view of dangers and difficulties; if
he was conscious of his own weakness and feebleness, then we should
learn also to be humble. He is not much in danger of erring who imitates
the example of this great apostle. And if he who had received a direct
commission from the great Head of the church, and who was endowed with
such mighty powers, was modest, unassuming, and diffident, then it
becomes ministers of the gospel now, and all others to be humble also.
We should not, indeed, be afraid of people; but we should be modest,
humble, and lowly; much impressed, as if conscious of our mighty charge;
and anxious to deliver just such a message as God will approve and
bless.

Would I describe a preacher, such an Paul,

Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,

Paul should himself direct me. I would trace.

His master-strokes, and draw from his design.

I would express him simple, grave, sincere;

In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain;

And plain in manner, decent, solemn, chaste,

And natural in gesture: much impress'd.

Himself, an conscious of his awful charge;

And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds.

May feel it too. Affectionate in look,

And tender in address, as well becomes.

A messenger of grace to guilty men.

Task, B.

Our aim should be to commend our message to every man's conscience; and
to do it with humility toward God, and deep solicitude; with boldness
toward our fellow man - respectfully toward them - but still resolved to
tell the truth, [Co1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md).

4\. The faith of Christians does not stand in the wisdom of man. Every
Christian has evidence in his own heart, in his experience, and in the
transformation of his character, that none but God could have made the
change on his soul. His hopes, his joys, his peace, his sanctification,
his love of prayer, of the Bible, of Christians, of God, and of Christ,
are all such as nothing could have produced but the mighty power of God.
All these bear marks of their high origin. They are the work of God on
the soul. And as the Christian is fully conscious that these are not the
native feelings, of his heart - that if left to himself he would never
have had them; so he has the fullest demonstration that they are to be
traced to a divine source. And can he be mistaken about their existence?
Can a man doubt whether he has joy, and peace, and happiness? Is the
infidel to tell him coolly that he must be mistaken in regard to the
existence of these emotions, and that it is all delusion?

Can a child doubt whether it loves a parent? Can a husband doubt whether
he loves his wife? Can a friend question whether he loves a friend? Or a
man whether he loves his country? And can he doubt whether this emotion
produces joy? And can a person doubt whether he loves God? Whether he
has different views from what he once had? Whether he has peace and joy
in view of the character of God, and the hope of heaven? And by what
right shall the infidel tell him that he is mistaken, and that all this
is delusion? How can he enter into the soul, and pronounce the man who
professes to have these feelings mistaken? What should we think of the
man who would tell a wife that she did not love her husband; or a father
that he did not love his children? How can he know this? And, in like
manner, how can an infidel and a scoffer say to a Christian, that all
his hopes and joys, his love and peace are delusion and fanaticism? The
truth is, that the great mass of Christians are just as well satisfied
of the truth of religion, as they are of their own existence; and that a
Christian will die for his love to the Saviour, just as he will die for
his wife, and children, and country. Martyrdom in the one case is on the
same principle as martyrdom in the other. Martyrdom in either is noble
and honorable, and evinces the highest qualities and principles of the
human mind.

5\. Christians are influenced by true wisdom, [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md). They are not fools; though they
appear to be to their fellow man. They see a real beauty and wisdom in
the plan of redemption which the world does not discern. It is not the
wisdom of this world; but it is the wisdom which looks to eternity. Is a
man a fool who acts with reference to the future? Is he a fool who
believes that he shall live to all eternity, and who regards it as
proper to make preparation for that eternity? Is he a fool who acts as
if he were to die - to be judged - to enter on an unchanging destiny?
Folly is manifested in closing the eyes on the reality of the condition;
not in looking at it as it is. The man who is sick, and who strives to
convince himself that he is well; the man whose affairs are in a state
of bankruptcy, and who is unwilling to know it, is a fool. The man who
is willing to know all about his situation, and to act accordingly, is a
wise man. The one represents the conduct of a sinner, the other that of
a Christian. A man who should see his child drowning, or his house on
fire, or the pestilence breathing around him, and be unconcerned, or
dance amidst such scenes, would be a fool or a madman. And is not the
sinner who is frivilous and thoughtless over the grave and over hell
equally foolish and mad? And if there is a God, a heaven, a Saviour, and
a hell; if people are to die, and to be judged, is he not wise who acts
as if it were so, and who lives accordingly? While Christians,
therefore, may not be distinguished for the wisdom of this world - while
many are destitute of learning, science, and eloquence, they have a
wisdom which will survive when all other is vanished away.

6\. All the wisdom of this world shall come to nothing, [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md). What will be the value of
political sagacity, when all governments shall come to an end but the
divine government? What will be the value of eloquence, and graceful
diction, when we stand at the judgment seat of Christ? What will be the
value of science in this world, when all shall be revealed with the
clearness of noonday? How low will all human attainments appear in that
world, when the light of eternal day shall be shed over all the works of
God? How little can human science do to advance the eternal interests of
man? And how shall all fade away in the future world of glory - just as
the feeble glimmering of the stars fades away before the light of the
morning sun! How little, therefore, should we pride ourselves on the
highest attainments of science, and the most elevated distinctions of
learning and eloquence.

7\. God has a purpose in regard to the salvation of people, [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md). This scheme was ordained before
the world. It was not a new device. It was not the offspring of chance,
an accident, or an "after thought." It was because God purposed it from
eternity. God has a plan; and this plan contemplates the salvation of
his people. And it greatly enhances the value of this benevolent plan in
the eyes of his people, that it has been the object of "the eternal
earnest desire and purpose of God." How much a gift is enhanced in value
from the fact that it has been long the purpose of a parent to bestow
it; that he has toiled for it; that he has made arrangements for it; and
that this has been the chief object of his efforts and his plan for
years. So the favors of eternal redemption are bestowed on Christians as
the fruit of the eternal purpose and desire of God. And how should our
hearts rise in gratitude to him for his unspeakable gift!

8\. One great and prominent cause of sin is the fact that people are
blind to the reality and beauty of spiritual objects. So it was with
those who crucified the Lord, [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). Had they seen his glory as it
was, they would not have crucified him. And so it is now. When people
blaspheme God, they see not his excellency; when they revile religion,
they know not its real value; when they break the laws of God, they do
not fully discern their purity and their importance. It is true they are
willfully ignorant, and their crime is often enhanced by this fact; but
it is equally true that "they know not what they do." For such poor,
blinded, deluded mortals, the Saviour prayed; and for such we should all
pray. The man that curses God, has no just sense of what he is doing.
The man who is profane, and a scoffer, and a liar, and an adulterer, has
no just sense of the awful nature of his crime; and is an object of
commiseration while his Sin should be HAted - and is a proper subject of
prayer.

9\. People are often committing the most awful crimes when they are
unconscious of it [Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). What crime
could compare with that of crucifying the only Son of God? And what
crime could be attended with more dreadful consequences to its
perpetrators? So of sinners now. They little know what they do; and they
little know the consequences of their sins. A man may curse his Maker,
and say it is in sport! But how will it be regarded on the Day of
Judgment? A person may revile the Saviour! But how will it appear when
he dies? It is a solemn thing to trifle with God and with His laws. A
man is safer when he plays on top of a volcano, or when he makes a jest
of the pestilence or the forked lightnings of heaven, than when he makes
fun of religion and God! In a world like this, people should be serious
and revere God. A single deed, like that of the crucifixion of Christ,
may be remembered, when all the circumstances of sport and mockery shall
have passed away - remembered when the world shall be destroyed, and
stars and suns shall rush to ruin.

10\. Christians have views of the beauties of religion, and have
consolations arising from these views, which the world does not have,
[Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md). They have different views of
God, of Christ, of heaven, of eternity. They see a beauty in all these
things, and a wisdom in the plan of salvation, which the people of the
world do not see. The contemplations of this beauty and wisdom, and the
evidence which they have that they are interested in all this, gives
them a joy which the world does not possess. They see what the eye has
not elsewhere seen; they enjoy what people elsewhere have not enjoyed;
and they are elevated to privileges which people elsewhere do not
possess. On earth, they partake of happiness which the world never can
give, and in heaven they shall partake of the fulness of that joy - of
pleasures there which the eye had not before seen, nor the ear heard,
nor the heart of man conceived. Who would not want to be a Christian?

11\. The Holy Spirit is in some sense distinct from the Father. This is
implied in his action as an agent - in searching, knowing, etc. [Co1
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md). An attribute; a quality, does
not search and know.

12\. The Holy Spirit is divine. None can know God but one equal to
himself. If the Spirit intimately knows the wisdom, the goodness, the
omniscience, the eternity, the power of God, he must be divine. No
created being can have this intelligence, [Co1
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md).

13\. Christians are actuated by a different Spirit from the people of
this world, [Co1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md). They are
influenced by a regard to God and His glory. The people of the world are
under the influence of pride, avarice, sensuality, ambition, and vain
glory.

14\. The sinner does not perceive the beauty of the things of religion.
To all this beauty, he is blind. This is a sober and a most melancholy
fact. Whatever may be the cause of it, the fact is undeniable and sad.
It is so with the sensualist; with the people of avarice, pride,
ambition, and licentiousness. The gospel is regarded as folly, and is
despised and scorned by the people of this world. This is true in all
places, among all people, and at all times. To this there are no
exceptions in human nature; and over this we should sit down and weep.

15\. The reason of this is, that people love darkness. It is not that
they are destitute of the natural faculties for loving God, for they
have as strong native powers as those who become Christians. It is
because they love sin - and this simple fact, carried out into all its
bearings, will account for all the difficulties in the way of the
sinner's conversion. There is nothing else; and,

16\. We see here the value of the influences of the Spirit. It is by
this Spirit alone that the mind of the Christian is enlightened,
sanctified, and comforted. It is by Him alone that he sees the beauty of
the religion which he loves; it is by His influence alone that he
differs from his fellow man. And no less important is it for the sinner.
Without the influences of that Spirit his mind will always be in
darkness, and his heart will always hate the gospel. How anxiously,
therefore, should he cherish His influences! How careful should he be
not to grieve Him away!

17\. There is a difference between Christians and other people. One is
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, the other not; one sees a beauty in
religion, to the other it is folly; the one has the mind of Christ, the
other has the spirit of the world; the one discerns the excellency of
the plan of salvation, to the other all is darkness and folly. How could
beings differ more in their moral feelings and views than do Christians
and the people of this world?
