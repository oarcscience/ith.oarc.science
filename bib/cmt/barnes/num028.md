### [Numbers Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 28:1</span></span>

The daily offering had been already commanded [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md), and no doubt additional
offerings had become customary on festivals. But no such elaborate
system as is here prescribed was or could possibly have been observed in
the wilderness: compare [Deu 12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md).
The regulations of this and the next chapter therefore point to the
immediate prospect of that settlement in Canaan which alone could enable
the Israelites to obey them. Compare the ordinances in Num. 15.

[Numbers 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 28:2</span></span>

My offering, and my bread ... - Or, my offering, even my bread, etc.
Offering is here קרבן qorbân (compare [Lev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md); [Mar
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011).md), a term in itself of quite
general import, but often especially applied, as apparently in this
instance, to the meat-offering which accompanied the sacrifices. This
meat-offering connected itself, from its very nature, with the life of
the Israelites in Canaan, not with their life in the wilderness; and it
was annexed to the animal sacrifices as a token that the people must
dedicate to God their property and the fruits of their labor as well as
their own persons. See [Num 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#002.md) note
and [Lev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 28:7</span></span>

The original of the word "strong wine" שׁכר shêkār is a term usually
employed to describe strong drink other than wine ([Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009) note.md). The Israelites in the
wilderness had, in their lack of wine, substituted shechar made from
barley for it. They had thus observed the spirit, though not the letter
of the ordinance. The drink-offering was either poured round the foot of
the altar; or on the altar, and so upon the flesh of the sacrifice by
which the altar was covered (compare [Exo
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009).md).

[Numbers 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 28:9</span></span>

The Sabbath-offering, not previously enjoined, consisted of two lambs,
properly accompanied, in addition to the regular daily offering.

[Numbers 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 28:11</span></span>

The New-moon offering is here also commanded for the first time. The
goat as a sin-offering, though mentioned last, would seem in fact to
have been offered first (compare the precedents in Exo. 29; Lev. 5; 8;
9; 14; 16). The sin-offering, which [Num
15:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022.md) had been contemplated in
cases where a sin had been committed ignorantly without the knowledge of
the congregation, was henceforth not to be offered merely at discretion,
as circumstances might seem to require, but to be regularly repeated,
not less frequently than once a month.

[Numbers 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 28:16</span></span>

The Passover offering was the same as that of the New moon, and was
repeated on each of the seven days of the festival, thus marking the
importance and the solemnity of the occasion. The details of the
offering had not been previously prescribed.

[Numbers 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 28:26</span></span>

The festival offering at the season of first-fruits was to be offered on
one day only; and was the same with that of the new moon and Passover.
It nearly though not entirely accords with the sacrificial offering
prescribed in [Lev 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#018.md) ff.
