### [Isaiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 39:0</span></span>

This short chapter completes the historical part of Isaiah. The same
record occurs with some slight changes in [Kg2
20:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md). Compare the Introduction to
Isa. 36. The chapter is composed of the following parts: -

1\. The statement that the king of Babylon sent an embassage to Hezekiah
to congratulate him on his recovery [Isa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md). This embassage contemplated also
an inquiry into the truth of the report in regard to the miracle on the
sun-dial [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md).

2\. Hezekiah showed them all his treasures in an ostentatious and
improper manner [Isa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002.md). This was
permitted, in order that he might be tried, and might know all that was
in his own heart, and not be lifted up with pride, and with the
conviction of his own righteousness [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md).

3\. Isaiah is sent with a message to Hezekiah to inquire what he had
done, and who those ambassadors were [Isa
39:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md).

4\. He is directed to deliver the solemn message of God that Jerusalem
should be taken, and that all its inhabitants and all its treasures
should be carried to Babylon - the place from where those ambassadors
came [Isa 39:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#005.md).

5\. Hezekiah expresses submission to the just sentence and purpose of
God, and gratitude that it should not occur in his days [Isa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 39:1</span></span>

At that time - That is, soon after his recovery; or after he had amassed
great wealth, and was surrounded with the evidences of prosperity [Ch2
32:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md).

Merodach-baladan, the son of Balddan, king of Babylon - In the parallel
place in [Kg2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md), this name is
written Berodach-baladan, by a change of a single letter. Probably the
name was written and pronounced both ways. Merodach was an idol of the
Babylonians [Jer 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md) : 'Babylon is
taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is confounded.' This idol, according
to Gesenius, was probably the planet Mars, or Mars the god of war. To
this god, as well as to Saturn, the ancient Semitic nations offered
human sacrifices (see Gesenius' Lex. and Corem. in loc.) The word
'Balddan' is also a compound word, and means 'Bel is his lord.' The name
of this idol, Merodach, was often incorporated into the proper names of
kings, and of others. Thus we have the names Evil-Merodach,
Messi-Mordachus, Sisimor-dachus, Mardocentes, etc. In regard to the
statement of Isaiah in this verse, no small degree of difficulty has
been felt by commentators, and it is not until quite recently that the
difficulty has been removed, and it has been done in a manner to furnish
an additional and most striking demonstration of the entire and minute
accuracy of the sacred narrative. The difficulty arose from several
circnmstances:

1\. This king of Babylon is nowhere else mentioned in sacred history.

2\. The kingdom of Assyria was yet flourishing, and Babylon was one of
its dependencies.

For, only nine years before, Salmanassar the Assyrian monarch is said to
have transported the inhabitants of Babylon to other parts [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md), and Manasseh, not many years
after, was carried captive to Babylon by the king of Assyria [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md). These instances incontestably
prove that at the time of Hezekiah, Babylon was dependent on the
Assyrian kings. Who, then, it is asked, was this Merodach-baladan, king
of Babylon? If he was governor of that city, how could he send an
embassy of congratulation to the Jewish sovereign, then at war with his
liege lord? The canon of Ptolemy gives us no king of this name, nor does
his chronology appear reeoncilable with sacred history.

'In this darkness and doubt,' says Dr. Wiseman, 'we must have continued,
and the apparent contradiction of this text to ether passages would have
remaimed inexplicable, had not the progress of modern Oriental study
brought to light a document of the most venerable antiquity. This is
nothing less than a fragment of Berosus, preserved in the chronicle of
Eusebius. This interesting fragment informs us, that after Sennacherib's
brother had governed Babylon, as Assyrian viceroy, Acises unjustly
possessed himself of the supreme command. After thirty days he was
murdered by Merodach-baladan, who usurped the sovereignty for six
months, when he was in turn killed, and was succeeded by Elibus. But
after three years, Sennacherib collected an army, gave the usurper
battle, conquered, and took him prisoner. Having once more reduced
Babylon to his obedience, he left his son Assordan, the Esarhaddon of
Scripture, as governor of the city.'

The only objection to this satement, or to the entire consistency of
this fragment with the Scripture narrative is, that Isaiah relates the
murder of Sennacherib, and the succession of Esarhaddon before
Merodach-baladan's embassy to Jerusalem. But to this Gesenius has well
replied, that this arrangement is followed by the prophet in order to
conclude the history of the Assyrian monarch, which has no further
connection with the subject, so as not to return to it again.

By this order, also, the prophecy of his murder is more closely
connected with the history of its fulfillment ([Isa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007.md); compare [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).md). And this solution, which
supposes some interval to have elapsed between Sennacherib's return to
Nineveh, and his death, is rendered probable by the words of the text
itself. 'He went and returned, and dwelt in Nineveh; and it came to
pass,' etc. [Isa 37:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037).md)

Thus we have it certainly explained how there was a king, or rather a
usurper in Babylon at the time when it was really a provincial city of
the Assyrian empire. Nothing was more probable than that
Merodach-baladan, having seized the throne, should endeavor to unite
himself in league and amity with the enemies of his master, against whom
he had revolted. Hezekiah, who, no less than himself, had thrown off the
Assyrian yoke, and was in powerful alliance with the king of Egypt,
would be his first resource. No embassy, on the other hand, could be
more welcome to the Jewish monarch who had the common enemy in his
neighborhood, and who would be glad to see a division made in his favor
by a rebellion in the very heart of that enemy's kingdom. Hence arose
that excessive attention which he paid to the envoys of the usurper, and
which so offended Isaiah, or rather God, who, as a consequence,
threatened the Babylonian captivity (see Dr. Wiseman's Lectures on
Science and Revealed Religion, pp. 369-371 Ed. And. 1837).

Sent letters - The Septuagint adds, καὶ πρέβεις kai presbeis - 'and
ambassadors.'

And a present - It was customary among the Orientals, as it is now, to
send a valuable present when one prince sent an embassage for any
purpose to another. It is stated in [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md), that one object of their coming
was to make inquiry 'of the wonder that was done in the land;' that is,
of the miracle in regard to the retrocession of the shadow on the
sun-dial of Ahaz. It is well known that, from the earliest periods, the
Babylonians and Chaldeans were distinguished for their attention to
astronomy. Indeed, as a science, astronomy was first cultivated on the
plains of Chaldea; and there the knowledge of that science was scarcely
surpassed by any of the ancient nations. The report which they had heard
of this miracle would, therefore, be to them a matter of deep interest
as an astronomical fact, and they came to make inquiry into the exact
truth of the report.

[Isaiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 39:2</span></span>

And Hezekiah was glad of them - Possibly he regarded himself as
flattered by an embassage from so great a distance, and so celebrated a
place as Babylon. It is certain that he erred in some way in regard to
the manner in which he received them, and especially in the ostentatious
display which he made of his treasures [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md).

And showed them the house of his precious things - The Septuagint
renders this, Νεχωθᾶ Nechōtha - 'The house of Nechotha,' retaining the
Hebrew word. The Margin, 'Spicery.' The Hebrew word (נכתה nekotoh)
properly means, according to Gesenius, a contusion, a breaking to
pieces; hence, aromatic powder, or spices reduced to powder, and then
any kind of aromatics. Hence, the word here may mean 'the house of his
spices,' as Aquila, Symmachus, and the Vulgate translate it; or 'a
treasury,' 'a storehouse,' as the Chaldee and the Syriac here render it.
It was undoubtedly a treasure or store house; but it may have taken its
name from the fact, that it was mainly employed as a place in which to
keep spices, unguents, and the various kinds of aromatics which were
used either in public worship, or for the purposes of luxury.

The silver and the gold - Possibly Hezekiah may have obtained no small
quantity of silver and gold from what was left in the camp of the
Assyrians. It is certain that after he was delivered from danger he was
signally prospered, and became one of the most wealthy and magnificent
monarchs of the east; [Ch2 32:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md) :
'And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor; and he made himself
treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stones, and for
spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
storehouses also for the increase of grain, and wine, and oil; and
stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.' A considerable
part of this wealth arose from presents which were made to him, and from
gifts which were made for the service of the temple [Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md).

And the precious ointment - Used for anointing kings and priests. Or
more probably the ointment here referred to was that which was in more
common use, to anoint the body after bathing, or when they were to
appear in public.

And all the house of his armor - Margin, 'Vessels,' or 'instruments,' or
'jewels.' The word כלי kelı̂y denotes any article of furniture, utensil,
or vessel; any trapping, instrument, or tool; and any implement of war,
weapon, or arms. Probably it here refers to the latter, and denotes
shields, swords, spears, such as were used in war, and such as Hezekiah
had prepared for defense. The phrase is equivalent to our word arsenal
(compare [Ch2 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027).md). Solomon had an
extensive arsenal of this description [Kg1
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016.md), and it is probable that
these were regarded as a part of the necessary defense of the kingdom.

Nor in all his dominion - Everything that contributed to the defense,
the wealth, or the magnificence of his kingdom he showed to them. The
purpose for which Hezekiah thus showed them all that he had, was
evidently display. In [Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md), it
is stated that 'Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit
done unto him, for his heart was lifted up;' and in [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md), it is said, that in regard to
this transaction, 'God left him, to try him, that he might know all that
was in his heart.' The result showed how much God hates pride, and how
certainly he will punish all forms of ostentation.

[Isaiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 39:3</span></span>

Then came Isaiah - Isaiah was accustomed to declare the will of God most
freely to monarchs (see Isa. 7)

What said these men? - What proposition have they made? What is the
design of their coming? It is implied in the question that there had
been some improper communication from them. To this question Hezekiah
returned no answer.

And from whence came they? - It was doubtless known in Jerusalem that
ambassadors had come, but it would not be likely to be known from what
country they had come.

From a far country - Probably this was said in order to palliate and
excuse his conducts, by intimating to the prophet that it was proper to
show respectful attention to foreigners, and that he had done nothing
more than was demanded by the laws of hospitality and kindness.

[Isaiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 39:4</span></span>

What have they seen? - It is probable that the fact that Hezekiah had
showed them the treasures of his kingdom was known in Jerusalem. Such a
fact would be likely to attract attention, and to produce inquiry among
the people into the cause.

All that is in mine house - Here was the confessions of a frank, an
honest, and a pious man. There was no concealment; no disguise. Hezekiah
knew that he was dealing with a man of God - a man too to whom he had
been under great obligations. He knew that Isaiah had come commissioned
by God, and that it would be in vain to attempt to conceal anything. Nor
does he seem to have wished to make any concealment. If he was conscious
that what he had done had been improper, he was willing to confess it;
and at any rate he was willing that the exact truth should be known. Had
Hezekiah been like Ahaz, he might have spurned Isaiah from his presence
as presenting improper inquiries. But Hezekiah was accustomed to regard
with respect the messengers of God, and he was therefore willing to
submit his whole conduct to the divine adjudication and reproof. Piety
makes a man willing that all that he has done should be known. It saves
him from double-dealing and subterfuges, and a disposition to make vain
excuses; and it inclines him to fear God, to respect his ambassadors,
and to listen to the voice of eternal truth.

[Isaiah 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 39:5</span></span>

Hear the word of the Lord of hosts - Hear what the mighty God that rules
in heaven says of this. This is an instance of great fidelity on the
part of the prophet. He felt himself sent from God in a solemn manner to
rebuke sin in a monarch, and a pious monarch. It is an instance that
strikingly resembles the boldness and faithfulness of Nathan when he
went to David, and said, 'Thou art the man' [Sa2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007.md).

[Isaiah 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 39:6</span></span>

Behold, the days come - The captivity of the Jews in Babylon commenced
about one hundred and twenty years after this prediction (compare [Jer
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#005).md).

That all that is in thine house - That is, all the treasures that are in
the treasure-house [Isa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002.md).

And that which thy fathers have laid up in store - In [Kg2
18:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#015.md), we are told that Hezekiah,
in order to meet the demands of the king of Assyria, had cut off even
the ornaments of the temple, and taken all the treasures which were in
'the king's house.' It is possible, however, that there might have been
other treasures which had been accumulated by the kings before him which
he had not touched.

Nothing shall be left - This was literally fulfilled (see [Ch2
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018).md). It is remarkable, says
Vitringa, that this is the first intimation that the Jews would be
carried to Babylon - the first designation of the place where they would
be so long punished and oppressed. Micah [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md), a contemporary of Isaiah,
declares the same thing, but probably this was not before the
declaration here made by Isaiah. Moses had declared repeatedly, that, if
they were a rebellious people, they should be removed from their own to
a foreign land; but he had not designated the country [Lev
26:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md); [Deu
28:64-67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md); [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md). Ahijah, in the time of Jeroboam
[Kg1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md), had predicted that they
should be carried 'beyond the river,' that is, the Euphrates; and Amos
[Amo 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027.md) had said that God would
carry them 'into captivity beyond Damascus.' But all these predictions
were now concentrated on Babylon; and it was for the first time
distinctly announced by Isaiah that that was to be the land where they
were to suffer so long and so painful a captivity.

[Isaiah 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 39:7</span></span>

And of that sons - Thy posterity (see the note at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).md).

That shall issue from thee - Of the royal family. The captivity at
Babylon occurred more than a hundred years after this, and of course
those who were carried there were somewhat remote descendants of
Hezekiah.

And they shall be eunuchs - The word used here (סריסים sâriysiym)
denotes properly and strictly eunuchs, or such persons as were
accustomed to attend on the harems of Oriental monarchs [Est
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md), [Est
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014.md). These persons were also
employed often in various offices of the court [Est
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#010.md), [Est
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#012.md), [Est
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#015.md), and hence, the word often means
a minister of court, a court-officer, though not literally an eunuch
[Gen 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#006.md); [Gen
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md). It is not easy, however, to tell
when the word is to be understood literally, and when not. The Targum
understands it of those who should be nurtured, or become great in the
kingdom of Babylon. That the Jews were advanced to some offices of trust
and power in Babylon, is evident from the case of Daniel [Dan
1:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md). It is by no means improbable,
also, that the king of Babylon would have a pride in having among the
attendants at his court, or even over the harem, the descendants of the
once magnificent monarchs of the Jews.

[Isaiah 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 39:8</span></span>

Good is the word of the Lord - The sense of this is, 'I acquiesce in
this; I perceive that it is right; I see in it evidence of benevolence
and goodness.' The grounds of his acquiescence seem to have been:

1\. The fact that he saw that it was just. He felt that he had sinned,
and that he had made an improper display of his treasures, and deserved
to be punished.

2\. He felt that the sentence was mild and merciful. It was less than he
deserved, and less than he had reason to expect.

3\. It was merciful to him, and to his kingdom at that time. God was not
coming forth to cut him off, or to involve him in anymore calamity.

4\. His own reign and life were to be full of mercy still.

He had abundant cause of gratitude, therefore, that God was dealing with
him in so much kindness. It cannot be shown that Hezekiah was regardless
of his posterity, or unconcerned at the calamity which would come upon
them. All that the passage fairly implies is, that he saw that it was
right; and that it was proof of great mercy in God that the punishment
was deferred, and was not, as in the case of David (2 Sam. 13-14 ff), to
be inflicted in his own time. The nature of the crime of Hezekiah is
more fully stated in the parallel passage in [Ch2
32:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md), [Ch2
32:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md).

For there shall be peace - My kingdom shall not be disturbed during my
reign with a foreign invasion.

And truth - The truth of God shall be maintained; his worship shall be
kept up; his name shall be honored.

In my days - During my reign. He inferred this because Isaiah had said
[Isa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md) that his posterity would be
carried to Babylon. He was assured, therefore, that these calamities
would not come in his own time. We may learn from this:

1\. That we should submit to God when he punishes us. If we have right
feelings we shall always see that we deserve all that we are called to
suffer.

2\. In the midst of severest judgments we may find some evidence of
mercy. There are some considerations on which the mind may fix that will
console it with the evidence of the compassion of God, and that will not
only make it submissive, but fill it with gratitude.

3\. We should accustom ourselves to such views of the divine dealings,
and should desire to find in them the evidence of goodness and mercy,
and not the evidence of wrath and severity.

It is of infinite importance that we should cherish right views of God;
and should believe that he is holy, good. and merciful. To do this, we
should feel that we deserve all that we suffer; we should look at what
we might have endured; we should look at the mercies spared to us, as
well as at those which are taken away; and we should hold to the belief,
as an unwavering principle from which we are never to depart, that God
is good, supremely and wholly good. Then our minds will have peace. Then
with Hezekiah we may say, 'Good is the word of Yahweh.' Then with the
suffering Redeemer of the world we may always say, 'Not my will, but
thine be done' [Luk 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md).
