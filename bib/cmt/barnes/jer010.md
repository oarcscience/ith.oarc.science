Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 10:2</span></span>

Signs of heaven - Extraordinary appearances, such as eclipses, comets,
and the like, which seemed to the pagan to portend national calamities.
To attribute importance to them is to walk in pagan ways.

[Jeremiah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 10:3</span></span>

The customs - Better, as the marg, "the ordinances," established
institutions, "of the peoples, i. e." pagan nations.

[Jeremiah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 10:4</span></span>

They deck it - It was covered with plates of gold and silver, and then
fastened with nails in its place, that it might not "more, i. e." tumble
down.

The agreement in this and the following verses with the argument in Isa.
40-44 is so manifest, that no one can doubt that the one is modelled
upon the other. If, therefore, Jeremiah took the thoughts and phrases
from Isaiah, it is plain that the last 27 chapters of Isaiah were prior
in date to Jeremiah's time, and were not therefore written at the close
of the Babylonian exile. This passage then is a crucial one to the
pseudo-Isaiah theory. Two answers are attempted,

\(1\) that the pseudo-Isaiah borrowed from Jeremiah. But this is refuted
by the style, which is not that usual with Jeremiah.

\(2\) that it is an interpolation in Jeremiah.

But how then are we to account for its being found in the Septuagint
Version? The only argument of real importance is that these verses break
the continuity of thought; but the whole chapter is somewhat
fragmentary, and not so closely connected as the previous three. Still
there is a connection. The prophet had just included all Israel under
the ban of uncircumcision: he now shows them their last chance of safety
by enlarging upon the truth, that (compare [Jer
9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023)) their true glory is their
God, not an idol of wood, but the King of nations. Then comes the sad
feeling that they have rejected God and chosen idols [Jer
10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017); then the nation's deep grief
[Jer 10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019) and earnest prayer [Jer
10:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023). It is quite possible that
only portions of the concluding part of Jeremiah's templesermon were
embodied in Baruch's scroll, and that had the whole been preserved, we
should have found the thoughts as orderly in development as those in
Jer. 7-9.

[Jeremiah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 10:5</span></span>

They are upright ... - Rather, "They are like a palm tree of turned
work, i. e." like one of those stiff inelegant pillars, something like a
palm tree, which may be seen in oriental architecture. Some translate
thus: "They are like pillar's in a garden of cucumbers, i. e." like the
blocks set up to frighten away the birds; but none of the ancient
versions support this rendering.

[Jeremiah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 10:6</span></span>

For as much as - Or, "No one is like unto thee, O Jehovah." In [Jer
10:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006), the prophet contrasts God's
greatness with the impotence of idols.

[Jeremiah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 10:7</span></span>

O King of nations - i. e., pagan nations. Yahweh is not the national God
of the Jews only, but He reigns over all mankind [Psa
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028).

It - i. e., everything.

In all their kingdoms - More correctly, "in all their royalty or
kingship."

[Jeremiah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 10:8</span></span>

Brutish - [Jer 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021) and foolish
Theirs was the brutishness of men in a savage state, little better than
mere animals: their folly that of stupidity.

The stock ... - Rather, the instruction of idols is a piece of wood.
That is what they are themselves, and "ex nihilo nihil fit" (from
nothingness, nothing is made).

[Jeremiah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 10:9</span></span>

Or, "It is a piece of wood ([Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008)
note); yea, beaten silver it is, which is brought from Tarshish, and
gold from Uphaz: it is the work etc."

Tarshish ... Uphaz - See the marginal reference and [Gen
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004). Possibly Uphaz was a place in
the neighborhood of the River Hyphasis.

Blue and purple - Both colors were purple, from dyes obtained from
shellfish: but the former had a violet, the latter a red tinge.

[Jeremiah 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 10:11</span></span>

This verse is (in the original) in Chaldee. It was probably a proverbial
saying, which Jeremiah inserts in its popular form.

[Jeremiah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 10:12</span></span>

Discretion - Or, understanding. The three attributes ascribed to the
Creator are very remarkable. The creation of the earth, the material
world, is an act of "power;" the "establishing," i. e., the ordering and
arranging it as a place fit for man's abode, is the work of his
"wisdom;" while the spreading out the heavens over it like a tent is an
act of "understanding," or skill. Naturally, the consideration of these
attributes has led many to see here an allusion to the Holy Trinity.

[Jeremiah 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 10:13</span></span>

When ... - i. e., the rushing downpour of rain follows immediately upon
the thunder. The rest of the verse is identical with marginal reference;
but probably the words belong to Jeremiah, the Psalm being of
comparatively late date.

With rain - For the rain [Psa 135:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#007).

[Jeremiah 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 10:14</span></span>

In his knowledge - Rather, "without knowledge; i. e., on comparing his
powerless idols with the terrific grandeur of a tropical thunderstorm
the man who can still worship them instead of the Creator is destitute
of knowledge.

Every founder ... - Or, "every goldsmith is put to shame etc." He has
exhausted his skill on what remains an image.

[Jeremiah 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 10:15</span></span>

Rather, "They are vanity, a work of mockery," deserving only ridicule
and contempt.

[Jeremiah 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 10:16</span></span>

The portion, of Jacob - i. e., Yahweh. He is not like gods made by a
carpenter and goldsmith.

Of all things - literally, of the all, the universe.

The rod of his inheritance - See [Psa
74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002); compare [Isa
63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017). The rod is the scepter, and
Israel the people over whom Yahweh especially rules.

[Jeremiah 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 10:17</span></span>

The prophet now returns to the main subject of his sermon, the conquest
of Judaea.

Thy wares - Rather, thy bundle, which could contain a few articles for
necessary use, and be carried in the hand. They are going into exile.

O inhabitant of the fortress - i. e., thou that art besieged, that
inhabitest a besieged town.

[Jeremiah 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 10:18</span></span>

Sling out - A similar metaphor for violent ejection occurs in [Isa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018) (see the note).

At this once - Or, "at this time." Previous invasions had ended either
in deliverance, or at most in temporary misfortune. God's long-suffering
is exhausted, and this time Judaea must cease to be an independent
nation.

That they may find it so - Omit "so," and explain either

\(1\) "I will distress them" with the rigors of a siege "that they may
feel it, i. e., the distress; or,

\(2\) "that they may find" Me, God, that which alone is worth finding.

[Jeremiah 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 10:19</span></span>

The lamentation of the daughter of Zion, the Jewish Church, at the
devastation of the land, and her humble prayer to God for mercy.

[Jer 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019)

Grievous - Rather, "mortal," i. e., fatal, incurable.

A grief - Or, "my grief."

[Jer 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020)

tabernacle - i. e., "tent." Jerusalem laments that her tent is plundered
and her children carried into exile, and so "are not," are dead [Mat
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018), either absolutely, or dead to
her in the remote land of their captivity. They can aid the widowed
mother no longer in pitching her tent, or in hanging up the curtains
round about it.

[Jer 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#021)

Therefore they shall not prosper - Rather, "therefore they have not
governed wisely." "The pastors," i. e., the kings and rulers [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008), having sunk to the condition of
barbarous and untutored men, could not govern wisely.

[Jer 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022)

The "great commotion" is the confused noise of the army on its march
(see [Jer 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016)).

Dragons - i. e., jackals; see the marginal reference.

[Jer 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023)

At the rumour of the enemy's approach Jeremiah utters in the name of the
nation a supplication appropriate to men overtaken by the divine
justice.

[Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024)

With judgment - In [Jer 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011); [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028), the word "judgment" (with a
different preposition) is rendered "in measure." The contrast therefore
is between punishment inflicted in anger, and that inflicted as a duty
of justice, of which the object is the criminal's reformation. Jeremiah
prays that God would punish Jacob so far only as would bring him to true
repentance, but that he would pour forth his anger upon the pagan, as
upon that which opposes itself to God [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025).
