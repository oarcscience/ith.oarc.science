### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

For an account of the resurrection of Christ, see the notes at Matt. 28.

[Joh 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009.md)

The scripture - See [Luk 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md), [Luk
24:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046.md). The sense or meaning of the
various predictions that foretold his death, as, for example, [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), compare [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md); [Psa
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md), compare [Act
2:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md); [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), compare [Act
2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md).

For an account of the resurrection of Christ, see the notes at Matt. 28.

[John 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 20:13</span></span>

They have taken away - That is the disciples or friends of Jesus who had
laid him there. Perhaps it was understood that the body was deposited
there only to remain over the Sabbath, with an intention then of
removing it to some other place of burial. Hence, they hastened early in
the morning to make preparation, and Mary supposed they had arrived
before her and had taken him away.

[John 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 20:14</span></span>

Knew not that it was Jesus - She was not expecting to see him. It was
yet also twilight, and she could not see distinctly.

[John 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 20:16</span></span>

Jesus saith unto her, Mary - This was spoken, doubtless, in a tone of
voice that at once recalled him to her recollection.

Rabboni - This is a Hebrew word denoting, literally, my great master. If
was one of the titles given to Jewish teachers. This title was given
under three forms:

\(a\) Rab, or master - the lowest degree of honor.

\(b\) Rabbi, my master - a title of higher dignity.

\(c\) Rabboni, my great master the most honorable of all.

This title, among the Jews, was only given to seven persons, all persons
of great eminence. As given by Mary to the Saviour, it was at once an
expression of her joy, and an acknowledgment of him, as her Lord and
Master. It is not improbable that she, filled with joy, was about to
cast herself at his feet.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

Touch me not ... - This passage has given rise to a variety of
interpretations. Jesus required Thomas to touch him [Joh
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027.md), and it has been difficult to
ascertain why he forbade this now to Mary. The reason why he directed
Thomas to do this was, that he doubted whether he had been restored to
life. Mary did not doubt that. The reason why he forbade her to touch
him now is to be sought in the circumstances of the case. Mary, filled
with joy and gratitude, was about to prostrate herself at his feet,
disposed to remain with him, and offer him there her homage as her risen
Lord. This is probably included in the word touch in this place; and the
language of Jesus may mean this: "Do not approach me now for this
purpose. Do not delay here. Other opportunities will yet be afforded to
see me. I have not yet ascended - that is, I am not about to ascend
immediately, but shall remain yet on earth to afford opportunity to my
disciples to enjoy my presence." From [Mat
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md), it appears that the women, when
they met Jesus, held him by the feet and worshipped him. This species of
adoration it was probably the intention of Mary to offer, and this, at
that time, Jesus forbade, and directed her to go at once and give his
disciples notice that he had risen.

My brethren - See [Joh 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md).

My Father and your Father ... - Nothing was better fitted to afford them
consolation than this assurance that this God was theirs; and that,
though he had been slain, they were still indissolubly united in
attachment to the same Father and God.

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

The same day at evening - On the first day of the week, the day of the
resurrection of Christ.

When the doors were shut - This does not mean that the doors were
fastened, though that might have been the case, but only that they were
closed. Jesus had been taken from them, and it was natural that they
should apprehend that the Jews would next attempt to wreak their
vengeance on his followers. Hence, they met in the evening, and with
closed doors, lest the Jews should bring against them the same charge of
sedition that they had against the Lord Jesus. It is not certainly said
what was the object of their assembling, but it is not unreasonable to
suppose that it was to talk over the events which had just occurred, to
deliberate about their condition, and to engage in acts of worship.
Their minds were doubtless much agitated. They had seen their Master
taken away and put to death; but a part of their number also had
affirmed that they had seen him alive. In this state of things they
naturally came together in a time and place of safety. It was not
uncommon for the early Christians to hold their meetings for worship in
the night. In times of persecution they were forbidden to assemble
during the day, and hence, they were compelled to meet in the night.
Pliny the younger, writing to Trajan, the Roman emperor, and giving an
account of Christians, says that "they were accustomed to meet together
on a stated day before it was light, and sing among themselves
alternately a hymn to Christ as God." True Christians will love to meet
together for worship. Nothing will prevent this; and one of the
evidences of piety is a desire to assemble to hear the Word of God, and
to offer to him prayer and praise. It is worthy of remark that this is
the first assembly that was convened for worship on the Lord's Day, and
in that assembly Jesus was present. Since that time, the day has been
observed in the church as the Christian Sabbath, particularly to
commemorate the resurrection of Christ.

Came Jesus ... - There is no evidence that he came into their assembly
in any miraculous manner. For anything that appears to the contrary,
Jesus entered in the usual way and manner, though his sudden appearance
alarmed them.

Peace be unto you - The sudden manner of his appearance, and the fact
that most of them had not before seen him since his resurrection, tended
to alarm them. Hence, he addressed them in the usual form of salutation
to allay their fears, and to assure them that it was their own Saviour
and Friend.

[John 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 20:20</span></span>

He showed unto them his hands ... - In this manner he gave them
indubitable proofs of his identity. He showed them that he was the same
Being who had suffered; that he had truly risen from the dead, and had
come forth with the same body. That body had not yet put on its
glorified form. It was necessary first to establish the proof of his
resurrection, and that could be done only by his appearing as he was
when he died.

[John 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 20:21</span></span>

As my Father hath sent me - As God sent me to preach, to be persecuted,
and to suffer; to make known his will, and to offer pardon to men, so I
send you. This is the design and the extent of the commission of the
ministers of the Lord Jesus. He is their model; and they will be
successful only as they study his character and imitate his example.
This commission he proceeds to confirm by endowing them all with the
gift of the Holy Spirit.

[John 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 20:22</span></span>

He breathed on them - It was customary for the prophets to use some
significant act to represent the nature of their message. See Jer. 13;
Jer. 18, etc. In this case the act of breathing was used to represent
the nature of the influence that would come upon them, and the source of
that influence. When man was created, God breathed into him the breath
of life, [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md). The word rendered
"spirit" in the Scriptures denotes wind, air, breath, as well as Spirit.
Hence, the operations of the Holy Spirit are compared to the wind, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md); [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md).

Receive ye the Holy Ghost - His breathing on them was a certain sign or
pledge that they would be endowed with the influences of the Holy
Spirit. Compare [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md); John 2.

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

Whose soever sins ... - See the notes at [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md). It is worthy of remark here
that Jesus confers the same power on all the apostles. He gives to no
one of them any special authority. If Peter, as the Papists pretend, had
been appointed to any special authority, it is wonderful that the
Saviour did not here hint at any such pre-eminence. This passage
conclusively proves that they were invested with equal power in
organizing and governing the church. The authority which he had given
Peter to preach the gospel first to the Jews and the Gentiles, does not
militate against this. See the notes at [Mat
16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md). This authority given them
was full proof that they were inspired. The meaning of the passage is
not that man can forgive sins that belongs only to God [Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md) but that they should be
inspired; that in founding the church, and in declaring the will of God,
they should be taught by the Holy Spirit to declare on what terms, to
what characters, and to what temper of mind God would extend forgiveness
of sins. It was not authority to forgive individuals, but to establish
in all the churches the terms and conditions on which men might be
pardoned, with a promise that God would confirm all that they taught;
that all might have assurance of forgiveness who would comply with those
terms; and that those who did not comply should not be forgiven, but
that their sins should be retained. This commission is as far as
possible from the authority which the Roman Catholic claims of remitting
sin and of pronouncing pardon.

[John 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 20:25</span></span>

Except I shall see ... - It is not known what was the ground of the
incredulity of Thomas. It is probable, however, that it was, in part, at
least, the effect of deep grief, and of that despondency which fills the
mind when a long-cherished hope is taken away. In such a case it
requires proof of uncommon clearness and strength to overcome the
despondency, and to convince us that we may obtain the object of our
desires. Thomas has been much blamed by expositors, but he asked only
for proof that would be satisfactory in his circumstances. The testimony
of ten disciples should have been indeed sufficient, but an opportunity
was thus given to the Saviour to convince the last of them of the truth
of his resurrection. This incident shows, what all the conduct of the
apostles proves, that they had not conspired together to impose on the
world. Even they were slow to believe, and one of them refused to rely
even on the testimony of ten of his brethren. How unlike this to the
conduct of men who agree to impose a story on mankind! Many are like
Thomas. Many now are unwilling to believe because they do not see the
Lord Jesus, and with just as little reason as Thomas had. The testimony
of those eleven men - including Thomas who saw him alive after he was
crucified; who were willing to lay down their lives to attest that they
had seen him alive; who had nothing to gain by imposture, and whose
conduct was removed as far as possible from the appearance of imposture,
should be regarded as ample proof of the fact that he rose from the
dead.

[John 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 20:26</span></span>

And after eight days again - That is, on the return of the first day of
the week. From this it appears that they thus early set apart this day
for assembling together, and Jesus countenanced it by appearing twice
with them. It was natural that the apostles should observe this day, but
not probable that they would do it without the sanction of the Lord
Jesus. His repeated presence gave such a sanction, and the historical
fact is indisputable that from this time this day was observed as the
Christian Sabbath. See [Act 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md); [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md).

[John 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 20:28</span></span>

My Lord and my God - In this passage the name God is expressly given to
Christ, in his own presence and by one of his own apostles. This
declaration has been considered as a clear proof of the divinity of
Christ, for the following reasons:

1\. There is no evidence that this was a mere expression, as some have
supposed, of surprise or astonishment.

2\. The language was addressed to Jesus himself - "Thomas ...said unto
him."

3\. The Saviour did not reprove him or check him as using any improper
language. If he had not been divine, it is impossible to reconcile it
with his honesty that he did not rebuke the disciple. No pious man would
have allowed such language to be addressed to him. Compare [Act
14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013.md); [Rev
22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md).

4\. The Saviour proceeds immediately to commend Thomas for believing;
but what was the evidence of his believing? It was this declaration, and
this only. If this was a mere exclamation of surprise, what proof was it
that Thomas believed? Before this he doubted. Now he believed, and gave
utterance to his belief, that Jesus was his Lord and his God.

5\. If this was not the meaning of Thomas, then his exclamation was a
mere act of profaneness, and the Saviour would not have commended him
for taking the name of the Lord his God in vain. The passage proves,
therefore, that it is proper to apply to Christ the name Lord and God,
and thus accords with what John affirmed in [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), and which is established
throughout this gospel.

[John 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 20:29</span></span>

Because thou hast seen me - Because you have looked upon my body, and
seen the proofs that I am the same Saviour that was crucified. Jesus
here approves the faith of Thomas, but more highly commends the faith of
those who should believe without having seen.

Blessed - Happy, or worthy of the divine approbation. The word has here
the force of the comparative degree, signifying that they would be in
some respects more blessed than Thomas. They would evince higher faith.

That have not seen ... - Those who should be convinced by the testimony
of the apostles, and by the influences of the Spirit. They would evince
stronger faith. All faith is of things not seen; and God blesses those
most who most implicitly rely on his word.

[John 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 20:30</span></span>

Other signs - Other miracles. Many were recorded by the other
evangelists, and many which he performed were never recorded, [Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025.md).

[John 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 20:31</span></span>

These are written - Those recorded in this gospel.

That ye might believe ... - This is a clue to the design which John had
in view in writing this gospel. The whole scope or end of the book is to
accomplish two objects:

1\. To prove that Jesus was the Messiah; and,

2\. That they who looked at the proof might be convinced and have
eternal life.

This design is kept in view throughout the book. The miracles, facts,
arguments, instructions, and conversations of our Lord all tend to this.
This point had not been kept in view so directly by either of the other
evangelists, and it was reserved for the last of the apostles to collect
those arguments, and make out a connected demonstration that Jesus was
the Messiah. If this design of John is kept steadily in view, it will
throw much light on the book, and the argument is unanswerable, framed
after the strictest rules of reasoning, infinitely beyond the skill of
man, and having throughout the clearest evidence of demonstration.
