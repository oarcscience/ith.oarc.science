### [Genesis Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

\- Joseph Was Exalted

1\. יאר ye'or, "river, canal," mostly applied to the Nile. Some suppose
the word to be Coptic.

2\. אחוּ 'āchû, "sedge, reed-grass, marsh-grass." This word is probably
Coptic.

8\. חרטמים charṭumı̂ym, ἐξηγηταὶ exēgētai, ἱερογραμματεῖς
hierogrammateis, "sacred scribes, hieroglyphs." חרט chereṭ "stylus," a
graving tool.

43\. אברך 'abrēk "bend the knee." In this sense it is put for הברך
habrēk imperative hiphil of ברך bārak. Those who take the word to be
Coptic render it variously - "bow all, bow the head, cast thyself down."

45\. פענח &lt;צפנת tsāpenat-pa‛nēach, Tsaphenath-pa'neach, in the
Septuagint ψονθομ-φανήχ Psonthom-Fanēch. "Revelator occulti," Kimchi.
This is founded on an attempted Hebrew derivation. Σωτήρ κόσμου Sōtēr
kosmou in Oxford MS., "servator mundi," Jerome. These point to a Coptic
origin. Recent Egyptologists give P-sont-em-ph-anh,
"the-salvation-of-the-life or world." This is a high-flowing title, in
keeping with Eastern phraseology. אסנת 'âsnath, Asenath, perhaps
belonging to Neith, or worshipper of Neith, a goddess corresponding to
Athene of the Greeks. פוטי פרע pôṭı̂y-pera‛, Potiphera', seems to be a
variation of פוטיפר Pôṭı̂yphar, Potiphar [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md). אן 'ôn or און 'ôn, On =Oein,
"light, sun;" on the monuments TA-RA, "house of the sun." ביתשׁמשׁ bêyth
shemesh, [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013.md), Heliopolis, north
of Memphis, on the east bank of the Nile.

51\. מנשׁה menasheh, Menasheh, "causing to forget."

52\. אפרים 'eprâyı̂m Ephraim, "double fruit."

Here we have the double dream of Pharaoh interpreted by Joseph, in
consequence of which he is elevated over all the land of Egypt.

[Gen 41:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

The dreams are recited. "By the river." In the dream Pharaoh supposes
himself on the banks of the Nile. "On rite green." The original word
denotes the reed, or marsh grass, on the banks of the Nile. The cow is a
very significant emblem of fruitful nature among the Egyptians, the
hieroglyphic symbol of the earth and of agriculture; and the form in
which Isis the goddess of the earth was adored. "Dreamed a second time."
The repetition is designed to confirm the warning given, as Joseph
afterward explains [Gen 41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032.md). Corn
(grain) is the natural emblem of fertility and nurture. "Blasted with
the east wind The east wind". The east wind is any wind coming from the
east of the meridian, and may be a southeast or a northeast, as well as
a direct east. The Hebrews were accustomed to speak only of the four
winds, and, therefore, must have used the name of each with great
latitude. The blasting wind in Egypt is said to be usually from the
southeast. "And, behold, it was a dream." The impression was so distinct
as to be taken for the reality, until he awoke and perceived that it was
only a dream. "His spirit was troubled." Like the officers in the prison
[Gen 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#006.md), he could not get rid of the
feeling that the twofold dream portended some momentous event. "The
scribes" - the hieroglyphs, who belonged to the priestly caste, and
whose primary business was to make hieroglyphic and other inscriptions;
while they were accustomed to consult the stars, interpret dreams,
practise soothsaying, and pursue the other occult arts. The sages; whose
chief business was the cultivation of the various arts above mentioned,
while the engraving or inscribing department strictly belonged to the
hieroglyphs or scribes. "His dream;" the twofold dream. "Interpreted
them" - the two dreams.

[Gen 41:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009.md)

The chief butler now calls Joseph to mind, and mentions his gift to
Pharaoh. "My sins." His offence against Pharaoh. His ingratitude in
forgetting Joseph for two years does not perhaps occur to him as a sin.
"A Hebrew lad." The Egyptians were evidently well acquainted with the
Hebrew race, at a time when Israel had only a family. "Him he hanged."
The phrase is worthy of note, as a specimen of pithy brevioquence. Him
he declared that the dream foreboded that Pharaoh would hang.

[Gen 41:14-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014.md)

Pharaoh sends for Joseph, who is hastily brought from the prison. "He
shaved." The Egyptians were accustomed to shave the head and beard,
except in times of mourning (Herod. 2:32). "Canst hear a dream to
interpret it" - needest only to hear in order to interpret it. "Not I
God shall answer." According to his uniform habit Joseph ascribes the
gift that is in him to God. "To the peace of Pharaoh" - so that Pharaoh
may reap the advantage. In form. This takes the place of "in look," in
the former account. Other slight variations in the terms occur. "And
they went into them" - into their stomachs.

[Gen 41:25-36](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025.md)

Joseph now proceeds to interpret the dream, and offer counsel suitable
to the emergency. "What the God is about to do." The God, the one true,
living, eternal God, in opposition to all false gods. "And because the
dream was repeated." This is explained to denote the certainty and
immediateness of the event. The beautiful elucidation of the dream needs
no comment. Joseph now naturally passes from the interpreter to the
adviser. He is all himself on this critical occasion. His presence of
mind never forsakes him. The openness of heart and readiness of speech,
for which he was early distinguished, now stand him in good stead. His
thorough self-command arises from spontaneously throwing himself, with
all his heart, into the great national emergency which is before his
mind. And his native simplicity of heart, practical good sense, anti
force of character break forth into unasked, but not unaccepted counsel.
"A man discreet" - intelligent, capable of understanding the occasion;
wise, prudent, capable of acting accordingly. "Let Pharaoh proceed" -
take the following steps: "Take the fifth" of the produce of the land.
"Under the hand of Pharaoh." Under his supreme control.

The measures here suggested to Pharaoh were, we must suppose in
conformity with the civil institutions of the country. Thee exaction of
a fifth, or two tithes, during the period of plenty, may have been an
extraordinary measure, which the absolute power of the monarch enabled
him to enforce for the public safety. The sovereign was probably
dependent for his revenues on the produce of the crown lands, certain
taxes on exports or imports, and occasional gifts or forced
contributions from his subjects. This extraordinary fifth was, probably,
of the last description, and was fully warranted by the coming
emergency. The "gathering up of all the food" may imply that, in
addition to the fifth, large purchases of corn were made by the
government out of the surplus produce of the country.

[Gen 41:37-46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#037.md)

Pharaoh approves of his counsel, and selects him as "the discreet and
wise man" for carrying it into effect. "In whom is the Spirit of God."
He acknowledges the gift that is in Joseph to be from God. "All my
people behave" - dispose or order their conduct, a special meaning of
this word, which usually signifies to kiss. "His ring." His signet-ring
gave Joseph the delegated power of the sovereign, and constituted him
his prime minister or grand vizier. "Vestures of fine linen." Egypt was
celebrated for its flax, and for the fineness of its textures. The
priests were arrayed in official robes of linen, and no man was allowed
to enter a temple in a woolen garment (Herodotus ii. 37, 81). "A gold
chain about his neck." This was a badge of office worn in Egypt by the
judge and the prime minister. It had a similar use in Persia and
Babylonia [Dan 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md). "The second
chariot." Egypt was noted for chariots, both for peaceful and for
warlike purposes (Herodotus ii. 108). The second in the public
procession was assigned to Joseph. "Bow the knee." The various
explications of this proclamation agree in denoting a form of obeisance,
with which Joseph was to be honored. I am Pharaoh, the king [Gen
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md). "Without thee shall no man lift
up his hand or foot." Thou art next to me, and without thee no man shall
act or move. "Zaphenath-paneah." Pharaoh designates him the preserver of
life, as the interpreter of the dream and the proposer of the plan by
which the country was saved from famine. He thus naturalizes him so far
as to render his civil status compatible with his official rank.
"Asenath." The priests were the highest and most privileged class in
Egypt. Intermarriage with this caste at once determined the social
position of the wonderous foreigner. His father-in-law was priest of On,
a city dedicated to the worship of the sun.

With our Western and modern habit we may at the first glance be
surprised to find a stranger of a despised race suddenly elevated to the
second place in the kingdom. But in ancient and Eastern governments,
which were of a despotic character, such changes, depending on the will
of the sovereign, were by no means unusual. Secondly, the conviction
that "the Spirit of God was in" the mysterious stranger, was sufficient
to overbear all opposing feelings or customs. And, lastly, it was
assumed and acted on, as a self-evident fact, that the illustrious
stranger could have no possible objection to be incorporated into the
most ancient of nations, and allied with its noblest families. We may
imagine that Joseph would find an insuperable difficulty in becoming a
citizen of Egypt or a son-in-law of the priest of the sun. But we should
not forget that the world was yet too young to have arrived at the rigid
and sharplydefined systems of polytheism or allotheism to which we are
accustomed. Some gray streaks of a pure monotheism, of the knowledge of
the one true God, still gleamed across the sky of human memory. Some
faint traces of one common brotherhood among mankind still lingered in
the recollections of the past. The Pharaoh of Abraham's day feels the
power of him whose name is Yahweh [Gen
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md). Abimelek acknowledges the God
of Abraham and Isaac [Gen 20:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003.md); [Gen
21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md); [Gen
26:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#028.md). And while Joseph is frank
and faithful in acknowledging the true God before the king of Egypt,
Pharaoh himself is not slow to recognize the man in whom the Spirit of
God is. Having experienced the omniscience and omnipotence of Joseph's
God, he was prepared, no doubt, not only himself to offer him such
adoration as he was accustomed to pay to his national gods, but also to
allow Joseph full liberty to worship the God of his fathers, and to
bring up his family in that faith.

Joseph was now in his thirtieth year, and had consequently been thirteen
years in Egypt, most part of which interval he had probably spent in
prison. This was the age for manly service [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md). He immediately enters upon his
office.

[Gen 41:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#047.md)

The fulfillment of the dream here commences. "By handfuls." Not in
single stalks or grains, but in handfuls compared with the former yield.
It is probable that a fifth of the present unprecedented yield was
sufficient for the sustenance of the inhabitants. Another fifth was
rendered to the government, and the remaining three fifths were stored
up or sold to the state or the foreign broker at a low price. "He left
numbering because there was no number." This denotes that the store was
immense, and not perhaps that modes of expressing the number failed.

[Gen 41:50-52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050.md)

Two sons were born to Joseph during the seven years of plenty.
"Menasseh." God made him forget his toil and his father's house. Neither
absolutely. He remembered his toils in the very utterance of this
sentence. And he tenderly and intensely remembered his father's house.
But he is grateful to God, who builds him a home, with all its soothing
joys, even in the land of his exile. His heart again responds to long
untasted joys. "Fruitful in the land of my affliction." It is still, we
perceive, the land of his affliction. But why does no message go from
Joseph to his mourning father? For many reasons. First, he does not know
the state of things at home. Secondly, he may not wish to open up the
dark and bloody treachery of his brothers to his aged parent. But,
thirdly, he bears in mind those early dreams of his childhood. All his
subsequent experience has confirmed him in the belief that they will one
day be fulfilled. But that fulfillment implies the submission not only
of his brothers, but of his father. This is too delicate a matter for
him to interfere in. He will leave it entirely to the all-wise
providence of his God to bring about that strange issue. Joseph,
therefore, is true to his life-long character. He leaves all in the hand
of God, and awaits in anxious, but silent hope, the days when he will
see his father and his brethren.

[Gen 41:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#053.md)

The commencement and the extent of the famine are now noted. "As Joseph
had said." The fulfillment is as perfect in the one part as in the
other. "In all the lands" - all the lands adjacent to Egypt; such as
Arabia and Palestine. The word all in popular discourse is taken in a
relative sense, to be ascertained by the context. We are not aware that
this famine was felt beyond the distance of Hebron. "Go unto Joseph"
Pharaoh has had reason to trust Joseph more and more, and now he adheres
to his purpose of sending his people to him. "All the face of the land
of Egypt." "And Joseph opened all places in which there was food" - all
the stores in every city. "And sold unto Mizaim." The stores under
Pharaoh's hand were public property, obtained either by lawful taxation
or by purchase. It was a great public benefit to sell this grain, that
had been providently kept in store, at a moderate price, and thus
preserve the lives of a nation during a seven years' famine. "All the
land." This is to be understood of the countries in the neighborhood of
Egypt. Famines in these countries were not unusual. We have read already
of two famines in Palestine that did not extend to Egypt [Gen
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md); [Gen
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md).

The fertility of Egypt depends on the rise of the waters of the Nile to
a certain point, at which they will reach all the country. If it fall
short of that point, there will be a deficiency in the crops
proportioned to the deficiency in the rise. The rise of the Nile depends
on the tropical rains by which the lake is supplied from which it flows.
These rains depend on the clouds wafted by the winds from the basin of
the Mediterranean Sea. The amount of these piles of vapor will depend on
the access and strength of the solar heat producing evaporation from the
surface of that inland sea. The same cause, therefore, may withhold rain
from central Africa, and from all the lands that are watered from the
Mediterranean. The duration of the extraordinary plenty was indeed
wonderful. But such periods of excess are generally followed by
corresponding periods of deficiency over the same area. This prepares
the way for the arrival of Joseph's kindred in Egypt.
