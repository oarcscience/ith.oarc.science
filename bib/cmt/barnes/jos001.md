Heritage

### [Joshua Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

[Jos 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001) serves as an introduction
to the history of the war, and pointedly call attention to the leading
thought of the whole book - that the invasion and subjugation of Canaan
were undertaken by the Israelites at God's direct command and completed
in His never-failing strength.

[Joshua 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 1:1</span></span>

Now ... - Hebrew: "and, ..." The statement following is thus connected
with some previous one, which is assumed to be known to the reader. So
Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, etc., are by the same means linked on to the
books preceding them. The connection here is the closer, since the Book
of Deuteronomy concludes, and the book of Joshua opens, by referring to
the death of Moses.

Moses, the servant of the Lord - On the epithet, see the marginal
reference "b."

Moses' minister - It is impossible altogether to pass by the typical
application of this verse. Moses, representing the law, is dead; Joshua,
or, as that name is written in Greek, Jesus, is now bidden by God to do
what Moses could not - lead the people into the promised land. Joshua
was "Moses' minister," just as Christ was "made under the Law;" but it
was Joshua, not Moses, who worked out the accomplishment of the
blessings which the Law promised. On the name Joshua, see [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009) note, and [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016).

Saying - No doubt directly, by an immediate revelation, but not as God
spake to Moses, "mouth to mouth" [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008). Though upon Joshua's appointment
to be Moses' successor ([Num 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018)
ff), it had been directed that "counsel should be asked" for him through
the medium of Eleazar "after the judgment of Urim," yet this was
evidently a resource provided to meet cases of doubt and difficulty.
Here there was no such case; but the appointed leader, knowing well the
purpose of God, needed to be stirred up to instant execution of it; and
the people too might require the encouragement of a renewed divine
command to set out at once upon the great enterprise before them
(compare [Jos 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013)).

[Joshua 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 1:4</span></span>

Lebanon is spoken of as "this Lebanon," because visible from the
neighborhood in which Israel was encamped. (Compare [Deu
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008).) "The wilderness" of the text
is the Desert of Arabia, which forms the southern, as Lebanon does the
northern, limit of the promised land. The boundaries on the east and
west are likewise indicated; and the intervening territory is described
generally as "all the land of the Hittites." The Hittites are properly
the inhabitants of northern Canaan and Phoenicia (see [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008) note), but the name appears to be
used here for the Canaanites in general, as in [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029). On the boundaries of the
promised land compare [Deu 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024); [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).

[Joshua 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 1:7</span></span>

Prosper - See the margin. The literal rendering should be retained here
since the notion of prosperity is separately introduced by a different
word in [Jos 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008).

[Joshua 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 1:10</span></span>

Officers - The "scribes." (See the [Exo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006) note, and [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018).)

[Joshua 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 1:11</span></span>

Prepare you victuals - The order was probably given with the knowledge
that the manna would cease when the host crossed the Jordan [Exo
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035), and possibly because amidst
their preparations there might not be opportunity to gather it in
sufficient quantity. Nor does it appear that manna ever formed the whole
and sole sustenance of the people. (Compare [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001) note.)

It is the view of the majority of commentators - Jewish and Christian,
ancient and modern - that the "three days" here named are identical with
those of [Jos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002); and that the
command of Joshua in the text was not in fact given until after the
return of the spies. Here, as elsewhere in the Hebrew historical books
and frequently in the Gospels, the order of time is superseded by the
order of thought. For the purpose if the writer was not historical
merely; it was, on the contrary, mainly religious and theoretical.
Intending, then, to exhibit God as accomplishing His promises to the
covenant-people, he begins by informing us that God gave the word and
set Joshua and the host actually in motion to take possession of their
inheritance. Having placed this leading fact in the forefront, he
returns to mention in Josh. 2 certain transactions closely relevant to
the early stages of Joshua's conquests, but which had in fact happened
before the camp was removed from the plains of Moab and immediately
after the expiration of the thirty days' mourning for Moses. [Deu
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008). The order of events was probably
the following - 3rd Nisan, the spies are sent out [Jos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001); 6th, the spies return [Jos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#023); 7th, the camp is removed from
Shittim to the bank of Jordan [Jos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001), and the command [Jos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011) is issued; 10th, the river is
crossed [Jos 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019).

[Joshua 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 1:14</span></span>

Armed - Rather, "arrayed" (see [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018) note).

On this side Jordan - Compare [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001), note.
