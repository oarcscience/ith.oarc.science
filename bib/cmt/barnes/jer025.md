### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 25:0</span></span>

It was immediately after the battle of Carchemish (605 b.c.) between
Egypt and Babylon, and probably before Nebuchadnezzar and his victorious
army appeared in Palestine, that Jeremiah delivered this prophecy Jer.
25, orally perhaps at first to the people, but soon afterward committed
to writing; it formed part of Jehoiakim's scroll [Jer
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md). It belongs to the year of
Jeremiah's greatest activity, when he was using his utmost efforts to
detach Jehoiakim from Egypt, and prevail upon him to accept frankly the
position of a king subject to Nebuchadnezzar, not only as a matter of
policy but of religious duty. It was this latter aspect of the appeal
that made the king reject it. He burned the prophet's scroll, tried to
slay the prophet, and heard the voice of God no more during the rest of
his reign.

[Jeremiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 25:1</span></span>

The fourth year - See [Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md) note.
This invasion of Judaea, in which Daniel was carried captive to Babylon,
was according to the date of the years the fourth, but according to the
actual time the third, year of the Jewish king. Nebuchadnezzar was not
yet fully king, but associated with his father Nabopalassar.

[Jeremiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 25:3</span></span>

The three and twentieth year - i. e., nineteen under Josiah, and four
under Jehoiakim. This prophecy divides itself into three parts,

\(1\) the judgment of Judah [Jer
25:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md), and Babylon's doom [Jer
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md);

\(2\) the wine-cup of fury [Jer
25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md);

\(3\) the judgment of the world [Jer
25:30-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md).

[Jeremiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 25:5</span></span>

Turn ye - i. e., Repent ye; the great summons of God to mankind at all
times ([Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md); [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md); compare [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 25:9</span></span>

The term families is probably used here to signify the widespread empire
of Nebuchadnezzar.

My servant - This title, so remarkable in the Old Testament as the
especial epithet, first of Moses, and then of the Messiah, is thrice
given to Nebuchadnezzar, and marks the greatness of the commission
entrusted to him.

[Jeremiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 25:10</span></span>

Take from them ... the sound of the millstones, and the light of the
candle - (or, lamp). To denote the entire cessation of domestic life.
The one was the sign of the preparation of the daily meal, the other of
the assembling of the family after the labors of the day were over.

[Jeremiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 25:11</span></span>

Seventy years - The duration of the Babylonian empire was really a
little short of this period. But the 70 years are usually calculated
down to the time when the Jews were permitted to return to their country
(compare [Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 25:12</span></span>

Perpetual desolations - The ruins of Babylon form its only lasting
memorial.

[Jeremiah 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 25:13</span></span>

The Septuagint places a full stop after "book," and take the rest as a
title "what Jeremiah prophesied against the nations," which series there
immediately follows. In the Masoretic Text, this series is deferred to
the end Jer. 46-49, and with Jer. 50-51, forms one entire series. Other
reasons make it probable that the Septuagint has preserved for us an
earlier text, in which all direct mention of the king of Babylon is
omitted and the 70 years are given as the duration of Judah's captivity,
and not of the Babylonian empire. The fuller text of the Masorites is to
be explained by the dislocation which Jehoiakim's scroll evidently
suffered.

[Jeremiah 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 25:14</span></span>

Shall serve themselves of them also - i. e., shall impose forced labor
upon the Chaldaeans, and reduce them also to servitude.

[Jeremiah 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 25:15</span></span>

Saith - Or, hath said. This prophecy - placed by the Septuagint after
those against the nations - forms an impressive statement of the manner
in which the new kingdom of Babylon was to execute Yahweh's wrath upon
the nations far and near.

[Jeremiah 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 25:16</span></span>

Be moved - Rather, stagger.

[Jeremiah 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 25:17</span></span>

Then took I the cup - Not actually offering the wine-cup - Holy
Scripture has suffered much from this materialistic way of explaining
it: but publicly proclaiming this prophecy in Jerusalem, as the central
spot of God's dealings with men, and leaving it to find its way to the
neighboring states.

[Jeremiah 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 25:18</span></span>

As it is this day - Words omitted by the Septuagint, and probably added
by Jeremiah after the murder of Gedaliah had completed the ruin of the
land.

[Jeremiah 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 25:19</span></span>

The arrangement is remarkable. Jeremiah begins with the south, Egypt;
next Uz on the southeast, and Philistia on the southwest; next, Edom,
Moab, and Ammon on the east, and Tyre, and Sidon, and the isles of the
Mediterranean on the west; next, in the Far East, various Arabian
nations, then northward to Media and Elam, and finally the kings of the
north far and near.

[Jeremiah 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 25:20</span></span>

The mingled people - Either auxiliaries; or, rather, a constituent
portion of the people of Egypt, who were not of pure blood.

Azzah - i. e., Gaza.

The remnant of Ashdod - A sentence which none but a contemporary writer
could have used. Psammetichus, after a siege of 29 years, had captured
and destroyed Ashdod, except for a feeble remnant.

[Jeremiah 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 25:22</span></span>

The isles - Rightly explained in the margin; it probably refers here to
Cyprus.

[Jeremiah 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 25:23</span></span>

Dedan - See the [Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md) note.

Buz - See [Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002.md) note.

All that are ... - See the marginal reference note.

[Jeremiah 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 25:24</span></span>

Arabia - That part which bordered on Palestine, and was inhabited mainly
by Ishmaelites.

The mingled people - Compare the [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md) note. In Arabia there seem to
have been many tribes of Cushite origin, who by intermarriage with other
tribes had become of mixed blood.

[Jeremiah 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 25:25</span></span>

Zimri - Probably a district between Arabia and Persia. "Elam" is put in
Scripture for the whole of Persia.

[Jeremiah 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 25:26</span></span>

All the kingdoms of the world ... - In accordance with the usage of Holy
Scripture this universality is limited. It is moral and not
geographical.

Sheshach - Jerome says that this is the name Babel written in cypher,
the letters being transposed. Another example occurs in [Jer
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md), where the words "the heart of my
risers up" become the Chaldaeans. The Septuagint omits the clause
containing the name.

[Jeremiah 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 25:27</span></span>

The metaphors denote the helplessness to which the nations are reduced
by drinking the wine-cup of fury [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md).

[Jeremiah 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 25:30</span></span>

Yahweh has risen like a lion from His covert, and at His roaring the
whole world is filled with terror and confusion.

Upon his habitation - Against His pasture; i. e., Judaea. Yahweh comes
forth as the lion to destroy the sheep which lie terrified within the
circle of the tents.

A shout - The vintage-shout, here used for the war-cry. Compare [Isa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md); [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md).

[Jeremiah 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 25:31</span></span>

A noise - The trampling of an army in motion. Compare [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md).

A controversy - i. e., a suit at law.

Will plead - Or, will hold judgment. As judge He delivers the wicked to
the sword.

[Jeremiah 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 25:32</span></span>

A great whirlwind - Or, storm.

The coasts of the earth - See [Jer
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md) note. The thunderstorm seen first
on the edge of the horizon overspreads the heaven, and travels from
nation to nation in its destructive course.

[Jeremiah 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 25:33</span></span>

Lamented - See the marginal reference and [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md).

[Jeremiah 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 25:34</span></span>

Principal of the flock - i. e., noble ones.

Wallow yourselves in the ashes - Rather, roll yourselves on the ground.

For ... - Read; "for your days for being slaughtered are accomplished,
and I will scatter you" (or, (dash you in pieces).

Fall like a pleasant vessel - The comparison suggests the idea of change
from a thing of value into worthless fragments.

[Jer 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#036.md)

Hath spoiled - Or, spoileth.

[Jeremiah 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 25:37</span></span>

The peaceable habitations - The pastures of peace, the peaceable fields
where the flocks lately dwelt in security. See [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md) note.

[Jeremiah 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 25:38</span></span>

Yahweh has risen up, like a lion that leaves its covert, eager for prey,
that He may execute judgment upon the wicked.
