### [Deuteronomy Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 10:1</span></span>

These verses are closely connected with the preceding chapter, and state
very briefly the results of the intercession of Moses recorded in [Deu
9:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025.md). The people are reminded that
all their blessings and privileges, forfeited by apostasy as soon as
bestowed, were only now their own by a new and most unmerited act of
grace on the part of God, won from Him by the self-sacrificing mediation
of Moses himself [Deu 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010.md).

[Deu 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md). The order for making the
ark and tabernacle was evidently given before the apostasy of the people
(Exo. 25ff); but the tables were not put in the ark until the completion
and dedication of the tabernacle Exo. 40. But here as elsewhere (compare
the [Deu 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001) note.md) Moses connects
transactions closely related to each other and to his purpose without
regard to the order of occurrence.

[Deu 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md)

There Aaron died - i. e., while the people were encamped in Mosera or
Moseroth. In [Deu 32:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#050.md); as well as in
[Num 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#025.md) ff Mount Hor is assigned as
the place of Aaron's death. It is plain then that Moserah was in the
neighborhood of Mount Hor. The appointment of Eleazar to minister in
place of Aaron, is referred to as a proof of the completeness and
fulness of the reconciliation effected between God and the people by
Moses. Though Aaron was sentenced to die in the wilderness for his sin
at Meribah, yet God provided for the perpetuation of the high
priesthood, so that the people would not suffer. Compare [Deu
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020.md) and note.

[Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md)

At that time - i. e., that of the encampment at Sinai, as the words also
import in [Deu 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md). Throughout the
passage the time of the important events at Sinai is kept in view; it is
reverted to as each incident is brought forward by Moses, alluded to
sufficiently for his purpose, and dismissed.

Moses is evidently here speaking of the election by God of the tribe of
Levi at large, priests and others also, for His own service.

[Deuteronomy 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 10:12</span></span>

After these emphatic warnings against self-righteousness the principal
topic is resumed from Deut. 6, and this division of the discourse is
drawn to a conclusion in the next two chapters by a series of direct and
positive exhortations to a careful fulfillment of the duties prescribed
in the first two of the Ten "Words."

[Deu 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md)

What doth the Lord thy God require ... - A noteworthy demand. God has in
the Mosaic law positively commanded many things. However, these relate
to external observances, which if need be can be enforced. But love and
veneration cannot be enforced, even by God himself. They must be
spontaneous. Hence, even under the law of ordinances where so much was
peremptorily laid down, and omnipotence was ready to compel obedience,
those sentiments, which are the spirit and life of the whole, have to
be, as they here are, invited and solicited.

[Deuteronomy 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 10:16</span></span>

On "circumcision" see [Gen 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md). This
verse points to the spiritual import of circumcision. Man is by nature
"very far gone from original righteousness," and in a state of enmity to
God; by circumcision, as the sacrament of admission to the privileges of
the chosen people, this opposition must be taken away ere man could
enter into covenant with God. It was through the flesh that man first
sinned; as it is also in the flesh, its functions, lusts, etc., that
man's rebellion against God chiefly manifests itself still. It was
fitting therefore that the symbol which should denote the removal of
this estrangement from God should be worked in the body. Moses then
fitly follows up the command "to circumcise the heart," with the warning
"to be no more stiff-necked." His meaning is that they should lay aside
that obduracy and perverseness toward God for which he had been
reproving them, which had led them into so many transgressions of the
covenant and revolts from God, and which was especially the very
contrary of that love and fear of God required by the first two of the
Ten Commandments. The language associated with circumcision in the Bible
distinguishes the use made of this rite in the Jewish religion from that
found among certain pagan nations. Circumcision was practiced by some of
them as a religious rite, designed (e. g.) to appease the deity of death
who was supposed to delight in human suffering; but not by any, the
Egyptians probably excepted, at all in the Jewish sense and meaning.

The grounds on which circumcision was imposed as essential by the Law
are the same as those on which Baptism is required in the Gospel. The
latter in the New Testament is strictly analogous to the former under
the Old; compare [Col 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md).
