### [Joshua Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 2:1</span></span>

An harlot's house - In the face of the parallel passages (e. g. [Lev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#007.md) : [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007).md) the rendering advocated for
obvious reasons, namely, "the house of a woman, an innkeeper," cannot be
maintained. Rahab must remain an example under the Law similar to that
[Luk 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037.md) under the Gospel, of "a
woman that was a sinner," yet, because of her faith, not only pardoned,
but exalted to the highest honor. Rahab was admitted among the people of
God; she intermarried into a chief family of a chief tribe, and found a
place among the best remembered ancestors of King David and of Christ;
thus receiving the temporal blessings of the covenant in largest
measure. The spies would of course betake themselves to such a house in
Jericho as they could visit without exciting suspicion; and the
situation of Rahab's, upon the wall [Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015.md), rendered it especially suitable.
It appears from [Jos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004.md) that Rahab
hid them before the King's messengers reached her house, and probably as
soon as the spies had come to her house. It is therefore most likely
that they met with Rahab outside of Jericho (compare [Gen
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014).md), and ascertained where in the
city she dwelt, and that they might entrust themselves to her care.
Rahab (i. e. "spacious," "wide." Compare the name "Japheth" and [Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027), note.md) is regarded by the fathers
as a type of the Christian Church, which was gathered out of converts
from the whole vast circle of pagan nations.

[Joshua 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 2:4</span></span>

I wist not whence they were - Rahab acted as she did from the belief in
God's declared word, and conviction that resistance to His will would be
both vain and wicked [Jos 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md).
Thus, she manifested a faith both sound and practical, and is praised
accordingly [Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md); [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md). The falsehood to which she had
recourse may be excused by the pressure of circumstances and by her own
antecedents, but cannot be defended.

[Joshua 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 2:6</span></span>

Stalks of flax - literally, "the carded fibres of the tree." The flax in
Palestine grew to more than three feet in height, with a stalk as thick
as a cane. It was probably with the flax stalks, recently cut (compare
[Exo 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031), note.md) and laid out on the
house roof to dry, that Rahab hid the spies.

[Joshua 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 2:7</span></span>

The sense is, that "they pursued along the way which leads to Jordan and
across the fords;" probably those described in [Jdg
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028.md).

[Joshua 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 2:11</span></span>

The Lord your God, he is God - From the rumour of God's miraculous
interpositions Rahab believed, and makes the self-same confession to
which Moses endeavors to bring Israel by rehearsing similar arguments
[Deu 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#039.md). Rahab had only heard of
what Israel had experienced. Her faith then was ready. It is noteworthy,
too, that the same reports which work faith and conversion in the
harlot, cause only terror and astonishment among her countrymen.
(Compare [Luk 8:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#037)..md)

[Joshua 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 2:12</span></span>

A true token - literally, "a sign" or "pledge of truth; "something to
bind them to keep their promise faithfully. The "token" was the oath
which the spies take [Jos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#014.md).

[Joshua 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 2:14</span></span>

Our life for yours - See the margin. This is (see [Jos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#017).md) a form of oath, in which God is
in effect invoked to punish them with death if they did not perform
their promise to save Rahab's life. Compare the more common form of
oath, [Sa1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#026.md), etc.

[Joshua 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 2:15</span></span>

Upon the town wall - The town wall probably formed the back wall of the
house, and the window opened therefore into the country. (Compare Paul's
escape, [Co2 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033).md).

[Joshua 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 2:18</span></span>

The "line" or cord was spun of threads dyed with cochineal: i. e., of a
deep and bright scarlet color. The color would catch the eye at once,
and supplied an obvious token by which the house of Rahab might be
distinguished. The use of scarlet in the Levitical rites, especially in
those more closely connected with the idea of putting away of sin and
its consequences (compare e. g., [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), [Lev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#006.md),[Lev
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#051.md); [Num
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006).md), naturally led the fathers, from
Clement of Rome onward, to see in this scarlet thread, no less than in
the blood of the Passover ([Exo 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007.md),
[Exo 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#013), etc..md), an emblem of
salvation by the Blood of Christ; a salvation common alike to Christ's
messengers and to those whom they visit.

[Joshua 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 2:22</span></span>

Unto the mountain - Probably the mountains to the west and north of
Jericho, called afterward, from the belief that the 40 days of our
Lord's temptation were passed among them, the Quarantania. The spies
avoided at the first the neighhourhood of the Jordan, where the pursuers
sought them: and amidst the grottoes of the limestone rocks, which in
later ages were the abode of numerous hermits, they could readily
shelter themselves for three days.
