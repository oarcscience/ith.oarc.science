### [Genesis Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

\- The Sealing of the Covenant

1\. שׁדי shaday, Shaddai, "Irresistible, able to destroy, and by
inference to make, Almighty." שׁדד shādad "be strong, destroy." This
name is found six times in Genesis, and thirty-one times in Job.

5\. אברהם 'abrâhām, Abraham, from אברם 'abrām "high-father," and הם hām
the radical part of המין hāmôn a "multitude," is obtained by a euphonic
abbreviation אברהם 'abrâhām, "father of a multitude." The root רהם rhm
is a variation of רום rvm; affording, however, a link of connection in
sound and sense with the root המה hāmâh "hum, be tumultuous," from which
comes המון hāmôn a "multitude." The confluence of the biliterals רם rm
and הם hm yields the triliteral רהם rhm occurring in Arabic, though not
elsewhere in our written Hebrew. The law of formation here noticed is
interesting and real, though רהם rhm may not have been an actual result
of it.

11\. נמלתם nemaltem formed from נמל nāmal, "circumcised." מוּל mûl "cut,
circumcise."

15\. שׂרה śārâh Sarah, "princess."

19\. יצהק yı̂tschāq Jitschaq, "laughing."

The present form of the covenant is not identical with the former. That
referred chiefly to the land; this chiefly to the seed. That dwelt much
on temporal things; this rises to spiritual things. That specifies only
Abram; this mentions both Abram and Sarai. At the former period God
formally entered into covenant with Abram ברית כרת kārat berı̂yt, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).md); at present he takes the first
step in the fufillment of the covenant ברית נתן nātan berı̂yt, seals it
with a token and a perpetual ordinance, and gives Abram and Sarai new
names in token of a new nature. There was an interval of fourteen years
at least between the ratification of the covenant and the preparation
for the fulfillment of its conditions, during which Abraham's faith had
time to unfold.

[Gen 17:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

The covenant in its spiritual aspect. "The Lord," the Author of
existence and performance. "God Almighty," El Shaddai. "El," the
Lasting, Eternal, Absolute. "Shaddai," the Irresistible, Unchangeable,
Destructive [Isa 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md); [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md). This term indicates on the one
hand his judicial, punitive power, and points to his holiness; and on
the other hand, his alterative, reconstructive power, and points to his
providence. The complex name, therefore, describes God as the Holy
Spirit, who works in the development of things, especially in the
punishment and eradication of sin and its works, and in the regeneration
and defense of holiness. It refers to potence, and potence combined with
promise affords ground for faith.

Walk before me and be perfect. - In the institution of the covenant we
had "fear not" - an encouragement to the daunted or the doubting. In its
confirmation we have a command, a rule of life, prescribed. This is in
keeping with the circumstances of Abraham. For, first, he has now faith
in the Lord, which is the fruit of the new man in him prevailing over
the old, and is therefore competent to obey; and, next, the Lord in whom
he believes is God Almighty, the all-efficient Spirit, who worketh both
to will and to do in the destroying of sin and building up of holiness.
"Walk" - act in the most comprehensive sense of the term; "before me,"
and not behind, as one conscious of doing what is, not displeasing, but
pleasing to me; "and be perfect," not sincere merely, unless in the
primitive sense of duty, but complete, upright, holy, not only in walk,
which is provided for in the previous clause, but in heart, the spring
of action.

[Gen 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#002.md)

My covenant - which I have already purposed and formally closed. "I will
grant," carry into effect, the provisions of it. "Multiply thee." The
seed is here identified with the head or parent seat of life. The seed
now comes forward as the prominent benefit of the covenant.

[Gen 17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#003.md)

Abram fell on his face. - This is the lowliest form of reverence, in
which the worshipper leans on his knees and elbows, and his forehead
approaches the ground. Prostration is still customary in the East. Abram
has attained to loftier notions of God. "God talked with him." Yahweh,
El Shaddai, is here called God. The Supreme appears as the Author of
existence, the Irresistible and Everlasting, in this stage of the
covenant relation.

[Gen 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004.md)

As for me. - The one party to the covenant is here made prominent, as in
[Gen 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#009.md) the other party is brought
out with like emphasis. The exalted Being who has entered into it
imparts a grandeur, solemnity, and excellence to the covenant. "Father
of many nations." The promise of seed is here expanded and
particularized. A multitude of nations and kings are to trace their
descent from Abram. This is true in a literal sense. The twelve tribes
of Israel and many Arab tribes, the twelve princes of Ishmael, Keturah's
descendants, and the dukes of Edom sprang from him. But it is to be more
magnificently realized in a spiritual sense. "Nations" is a term usually
applied, not to the chosen people, but to the other great branches of
the human race. This points to the original promise, that in him should
all the families of the earth be blessed. "Abraham." The father of many
nations is to be called by a new name, as he has come to have a new
nature, and been elevated to a new dignity. The high father has become
the father of the multitude of the faithful.

[Gen 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md)

Next, the spiritual part of the covenant comes into view. "To be a God
unto thee, and to thy seed after thee." Here we find God, in the
progress of human development, for the third time laying the foundations
of a covenant of grace with man. He dealt with Adam and with Noah, and
now be deals with Abraham. "A perpetual covenant." This covenant will
not fail, since God has originated it, notwithstanding the moral
instability of man. Though we cannot as yet see the possibility of
fulfilling the condition on man's side, yet we may be assured that what
God purposes will somehow be accomplished. The seed of Abraham will
eventually embrace the whole human family in fellowship with God.

[Gen 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md)

Thirdly, the temporal and the spiritual are brought together. The land
of promise is made sure to the heir of promise, "for a perpetual
possession," and God engages to "be their God." The phrase "perpetual
possession" has here two elements of meaning - first, that the
possession, in its coming form of a certain land, shall last as long as
the co-existing relations of things are continued; and, secondly, that
the said possession in all the variety of its ever grander phases will
last absolutely forever. Each form will be perfectly adequate to each
stage of a progressive humanity. But in all its forms and at every stage
it will be their chief glory that God is their God.

[Gen 17:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#009.md)

The sign of the covenant. "And thou." The other party to the covenant
now learns his obligation. "Every male of you shall be circumcised."
Circumcision, as the rainbow, might have been in existence before it was
adopted as the token of a covenant. The sign of the covenant with Noah
was a purely natural phenomenon, and therefore entirely independent of
man. That of the Abrahamic covenant was an artificial process, and
therefore, though prescribed by God, was dependent on the voluntary
agency of man. The former marked the sovereignty of God in ratifying the
covenant and insuring its fulfillment, notwithstanding the mutability of
man; the latter indicates the responsibility of man, the trust he places
in the word of promise, and the assent he gives to the terms of the
divine mercy. As the former covenant conveys a common natural blessing
to all mankind and contemplates a common spiritual blessing, so the
latter conveys a special spiritual blessing and contemplates its
universal acceptance. The rainbow was the appropriate natural emblem of
preservation from a flood; and the removal of the foreskin was the fit
symbol of that removal of the old man and renewal of nature, which
qualified Abraham to be the parent of a holy seed. And as the former
sign foreshadows an incorruptible inheritance, so the latter prepares
the way for a holy seed, by which the holiness and the heritage will at
length be universally extended.

It is worthy of remark that in circumcision, after Abraham himself, the
parent is the voluntary imponent, and the child merely the passive
recipient of the sign of the covenant. Hereby is taught the lesson of
parental responsibility and parental hope. This is the first formal step
in a godly education, in which the parent acknowledges his obligation to
perform all the rest. It is also, on the command of God, the formal
admission of the believing parents' offspring into the privileges of the
covenant, and therefore cheers the heart of the parent in entering upon
the parental task. This admission cannot be reversed but by the
deliberate rebellion of the child.

Still further, the sign of the covenant is to be applied to every male
in the household of Abraham. This indicates that the servant or serf
stands in the relation of a child to his master or owner, who is
therefore accountable for the soul of his serf, as for that of his son.
It points out the applicability of the covenant to others, as well as
the children of Abraham, and therefore its capability of universal
extension when the fulness of time should come. It also intimates the
very plain but very often forgotten truth, that our obligation to obey
God is not cancelled by our unwillingness. The serf is bound to have his
child circumcised as long as God requires it, though he may be unwilling
to comply with the divine commandments.

[Gen 17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md)

The time of circumcision is the eighth day. Seven is the number of
perfection. Seven days are therefore regarded as a type of perfectage
and individuality. At this stage, accordingly, the sign of
sanctification is made on the child, betokening the consecration of the
heart to God, when its rational powers have come into noticeable
activity. To be "cut off from his people" is to be excluded from any
part in the covenant, and treated simply as a Gentile or alien, some of
whom seem to have dwelt among the Israelites. It was sometimes
accompanied with the sentence of death [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md); and this shows that it did not
of itself imply such a doom. Excommunication, however, for the omission
of circumcision, would be extremely rare, as no parent would
intentionally neglect the sacred interest of his child. Yet the omission
of this rite has not been unprecedented, as the children of Israel did
not generally circumcise their children in the wilderness [Jos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005.md).

[Gen 17:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md)

Sarai is now formally taken into the covenant, as she is to be the
mother of the promised seed. Her name is therefore changed to Sarah,
"princess." Aptly is she so named, for she is to bear the child of
promise, to become nations, and be the mother of kings. "Abraham fell
upon his face and laughed." From the reverential attitude assumed by
Abraham we infer that his laughter sprang from joyful and grateful
surprise. "Said in his heart." The following questions of wonder are not
addressed to God; they merely agitate the breast of the astonished
patriarch. Hence, his irrepressible smile arises not from any doubt of
the fulfillment of the promise, but from surprise at the unexpected mode
in which it is to be fulfilled. Laughing in Scripture expresses joy in
the countenance, as dancing does in the whole body.

[Gen 17:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md)

Abraham seems up to this time to have regarded Ishmael as the promised
seed. Hence, a feeling of anxiety instantly penetrates his breast. It
finds utterance in the prayer, "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee."
He asks "life" for his beloved son - that is, a share in the divine
favor; and that "before God" - that is, a life of holiness and communion
with God. But God asseverates his purpose of giving him a son by Sarah.
This son is to be called Isaac - he that laughs or he shall laugh, in
reference to the various emotions of surprise and delight with which his
parents regarded his birth. Abram's prayer for Ishmael, however, is not
unanswered. He is to be fruitful, beget twelve princes, and become a
great nation. But Isaac is to be the heir of promise. At the present
season next year he is to be born. The communication being completed,
"God went" up from Abram.

[Gen 17:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023.md)

In the self-same day. - In this passage we have the prompt and punctual
fulfillment of the command concerning circumcision detailed with all the
minuteness due to its importance. Ishmael was thirteen years of age when
he was circumcised. Josephus relates that the Arabs accordingly delay
circumcision until the thirteenth year (Ant. I. 12. 2).
