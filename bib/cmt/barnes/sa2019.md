### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 19:5</span></span>

Had Absalom gained the victory, it is likely that, according to the
manner of Oriental despots, he would have sought to secure his throne by
killing all possible competitors [Jdg
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005); [Kg1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 19:8</span></span>

David saw the justice of what Joab said, and the new danger which
threatened him if he did not rouse himself from his grief.

For Israel ... - Not David's followers, but as before [Sa2
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#026); [Sa2
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006), [Sa2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017), Absalom's army.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 19:13</span></span>

Of my bone ... - Render as in preceding verse, "art thou not my bone and
my flesh?" It is curious to note how the phrase is used in [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001) of common descent from Israel, in
[Sa2 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#012) of the closer kindred of
the tribe of Judah, and in this verse of the yet nearer kindred between
David and Amasa his sister's son.

Captain ... in the room of Joab - It is very plain that David felt the
weight of Joab's overbearing influence to be very oppressive (compare
[Sa2 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#022); [Sa2
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039); [Sa2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010)). He was, at this time, very
angry with Joab for killing Absalom; and so, thinking it of vital
importance to win over Amasa and the army of Judah, he did not scruple
to offer him Joab's high post.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 19:16</span></span>

Shimei being aware that Judah was unanimous in recalling the king, lost
no time in trying to make his peace with David, by bringing a large
Benjamite force with him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 19:17</span></span>

Before the king - i. e., "to meet the king." Compare [Sa2
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008). The king was on the east bank,
and they crossed over (by the ford) from the west bank to go to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 19:18</span></span>

As he was come over Jordan - Render, "when he was crossing," i. e., just
embarking for the purpose of crossing. The scene still lies on the east
bank. Shimei left nothing undone to soften, if possible, David's
resentment.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 19:20</span></span>

This is the first time that the "house of Joseph," or "Joseph," stands
for all the ten tribes of which Ephraim was the head and leader. While
Saul of Benjamin was king, or while Mahanaim was the capital of his
son's kingdom, it was not natural so to name them, nor does it seem so
at first sight in the mouth of Shimei the Benjamite. But it is very
possible that he used the phrase for the purpose of exculpating himself
and his own tribe from having taken the initiative in the rebellion,
anti of insinuating that they were drawn away by the preponderating
influence of the great house of Joseph. On the other hand, the phrase
may be an indication that the passage was written after the separation
of the kingdom of Israel, when the phrase was a common one.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 19:24</span></span>

Beard - The "moustache," the beard of the upper lip. The fact related in
this verse tends to clear Mephibosheth from the suspicion of
unfaithfulness to David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 19:26</span></span>

What appears to have happened is, that when Mephibosheth ordered Ziba to
saddle the donkeys and ride with him to join David, Ziba left him under
pretence of obeying, but instead laded the donkeys with provisions, and
went off alone with them, thus making it impossible for Mephibosheth to
follow.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 19:29</span></span>

Unable to get to the bottom of the story, and perhaps unwilling to make
an enemy of Ziba, David compromised the matter by dividing the land,
thus partially revoking his hasty sentence [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004). We still see the impatient
temper of David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 19:37</span></span>

Chimham - From marginal references it appears that Chimham, having
accepted David's offer, came and settled near Bethlehem. His house was
still called after him at the time of the captivity.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 19:39</span></span>

The "people" is the term especially applied in this narrative to David's
followers [Sa2 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017); [Sa2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014); [Sa2
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#002); [Sa2
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001); [Sa2
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#002). They crossed by the ford,
while David and his household, accompanied by Barzillai and Chimham,
came over in the ferry.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa2 19:41</span></span>

It seems that David and his whole party made a halt at Gilgal [Sa2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#015); [Sa1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014), and possibly made some solemn
agreement there about the kingdom. But while they were there, "all the
men of Israel," representatives from the tribes not included in "half
the people of Israel" [Sa2 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#040), came
up in great wrath at finding that the restoration had been accomplished
without consulting them, and accused the men of Judah of unfair dealing.
