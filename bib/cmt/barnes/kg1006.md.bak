### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 6:1</span></span>

In the four hundred and eightieth year - It is upon this statement that
all the earlier portion of what is called the "received chronology"
depends. Amid Minor differences there is a general agreement, which
justifies us in placing the accession of Solomon about 1000 B.C. (1018
B.C. Oppert.) But great difficulties meet us in determining the sacred
chronology anterior to this. Apart from the present statement, the
chronological data of the Old Testament are insufficient to fix the
interval between Solomon's accession and the Exodus, since several of
the periods which make it up are unestimated. Hence, chronologists have
based entirely the "received chronology" upon this verse. But the text
itself is not free from suspicion.

\(1\) it is the sole passage in the Old Testament which contains the
idea of dating events from an era.

\(2\) it is quoted by Origen without the date, and seems to have been
known only in this shape to Josephus, to Theophilus of Antioch, and to
Clement of Alexandria.

\(3\) it is hard to reconcile with other chronological statements in the
Old and New Testament.

Though the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel furnish us with no exact
chronology, they still supply important chronological data - data which
seem to indicate for the interval between the Exodus and Solomon, a
period considerably exceeding 480 years. For the years actually set down
amount to at least 580, or, according to another computation, to 600;
and though a certain deduction might be made from this sum on account of
the round numbers, this deduction would scarcely do more than balance
the addition required on account of the four unestimated periods. Again,
in the New Testament, Paul (according to the received text) reckons the
period from the division of Canaan among the tribes in the sixth year of
Joshua [Jos 14:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md), to Samuel the
prophet, at 450 years, which would make the interval between the Exodus
and the commencement of the temple to be 579 years. On the whole, it
seems, therefore, probable that the words "in the four hundred and
eightieth year, etc.," are an interpolation into the sacred text, which
did not prevail generally before the third century of our era.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 6:2</span></span>

The size of Solomon's temple depends upon the true length of the ancient
cubit, which is doubtful. It has been estimated as somewhat less than a
foot, and again as between 19 and 20 inches, a difference of nearly 8
inches, which would produce a variation of nearly 40 feet in the length
of the temple-chamber, and of 46 in that of the entire building. It is
worthy of remark that, even according to the highest estimate, Solomon's
temple was really a small building, less than 120 feet long, and less
than 35 broad. Remark that the measures of the temple, both "house" and
porch [Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md), were exactly double
those of the older tabernacle ([Exo
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#018) note.md). This identity of
proportion amounts to an undesigned coincidence, indicating the
thoroughly historical character of both Kings and Exodus.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 6:4</span></span>

Windows of narrow lights - Either (as in the margin) windows, externally
mere slits in the wall, but opening wide within, like the windows of old
castles: or, more probably, "windows with fixed lattices." The windows
seem to have been placed high in the walls, above the chambers spoken of
in [Kg1 6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 6:5</span></span>

Chambers - (Margin, floors). Rather, a lean-to, which completely
surrounded three sides of the building, the north, the west, and the
south.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 6:6</span></span>

In order to preserve the sanctity of the temple, and at the same time
allow the attachment to it of secular buildings - sleeping apartments,
probably, for the priests and other attendants - Solomon made
"rebatements" in the wall of the temple, or in other words built it
externally in steps, thus: The beams, which formed the roof of the
chambers and the floors of the upper stories, were then laid on these
steps or "rests" in the wall, not piercing the wall, or causing any real
union of the secular with the sacred building. It resulted from this
arrangement that the lowest; chambers were the narrowest, and the
uppermost considerably the widest of all, the wall receding each time by
the space of a cubit.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 6:7</span></span>

The spirit of the command (marginal references), was followed. Thus the
fabric rose without noise.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 6:8</span></span>

The door for the middle chamber - i. e., the door which gave access to
the mid-most "set of chambers." The chambers on the ground-floor were
possibly reached each by their own door in the outer wall of the
lean-to. The middle and upper floors were reached by a single door in
the right or south wall, from which a winding staircase ascended to the
second tier, while another ascended from the second to the third. The
door to the stairs was in the outer wall of the building, not in the
wall between the chambers and the temple. That would have desecrated the
temple far more than the insertion of beams.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 6:9</span></span>

He built the house, and finished it - i. e., the external shell of the
house. The internal fittings were added afterward. See [Kg1
6:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015.md).

Covered the house - Roofed it with a wooden roof, sloped like our roofs.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 6:12</span></span>

The meaning is, "So far as this house goes, thou art obedient ([Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md); [Ch1
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012), etc..md); if thou wilt be obedient
in other things also, then will I perform My word," etc., God's promises
being always conditional. The promises made to David were:

\(1\) that he should be succeeded by one of his sons [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md); [Psa
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md);

\(2\) that the kingdom should be established in the line of his
descendants forever, if they were faithful [Psa
132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012.md); and

\(3\) that the Israelites should be no more afficted as beforetime [Sa2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md).

These promises are now confirmed to Solomon, but on the express
condition of obedience, and two further promises are added.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 6:13</span></span>

The first promise to "dwell among" the Israelites had been made to Moses
[Exo 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md); [Exo
29:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045.md), but had not been repeated to
David. The next promise, "I will not forsake, etc.," if not absolutely
new, seems to have been more positive and general than previous similar
promises [Deu 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md), [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008.md); [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md). God will not at any time or under
any circumstances wholly forsake Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 6:15</span></span>

The description of this verse applies to the main chamber of the temple,
the holy place, only. The writer in [Kg1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md) describes the holy of holies.

The marginal rendering of this verse is right, and not the rendering in
the text.

Fir - Rather, "juniper." See [Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md)
note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 6:16</span></span>

The meaning is, that at the distance of 20 cubits, measured along the
side walls of the house from the end wall, Solomon constructed a
partition, which reached from the floor to the ceiling and had a doorway
in it. He thus made within the house, a sanctuary for a holy of holies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 6:18</span></span>

Knops and open flowers - Rather, "gourds and opening flower-buds."
Imitations of the vegetable world are among the earliest of
architectural ornaments. They abound in the architecture of Egypt and
Persia. In that of Assyria they occur more sparingly.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 6:20</span></span>

The fore part - Perhaps "the interior."

And so covered ... - Rather, "and he covered the altar (of incense) with
cedar." The altar was doubtless of stone, and was covered with cedar in
preparation for the overlaying with gold. This overlaying was not
gilding, but the attachment of thin plates of gold, which had to be
fastened on with small nails. Such a mode of ornamentation was common in
Babylonia, in Assyria, and in Media.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 6:21</span></span>

The house - i. e., the main chamber.

The chains of gold - Omit "the." Their object was to form a barrier
between the holy place and the holy of holies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 6:22</span></span>

The lavish use of the precious metals in ornamentation was a special
feature if early Oriental architecture. Recent researches have given
reason to believe that two stages of the great temple at Borsippa - now
known as the Bits Nimrud - had respectively a gold and a silver coating.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 6:23</span></span>

Two cherubims - The pattern of the tabernacle was followed (marginal
reference), but without servile imitation. The original cherubs were
entirely of gold. These, being so much larger, were of wood, merely
overlaid with a golden plating. The arrangement of the wings, and the
direction of the faces, seem also to have been different. Moses'
cherubim "covered with their wings over the mercy seat;" Solomon's
stretched out theirs to the full [Kg1
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#027.md), so that the four wings, each
five cubits long [Kg1 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#024.md), extended
across the whole sanctuary, the width of which was twenty cubits [Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md). The former looked toward one
another, and were bent downward toward the mercy-seat; the latter looked
outward, toward the great chamber. (See [Ch2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#013), and note..md)

Of olive-tree - The oleaster or wild olive, not the cultivated species.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 6:29</span></span>

Palms, cherubs, and flowers - the main decorations of Solomon's temple -
bear considerable resemblance to the ornamentation of the Assyrians, a
circumstance which can scarcely be accidental.

Within and without - i. e., both in the inner chamber, or holy of
holies, and in the outer one.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 6:31</span></span>

A fifth part - Better than the margin. The meaning seems to be that the
lintel was one-fifth of the width of the wall, and each door-post
one-fifth of its height. Thus the opening was a square of four cubits,
or of six feet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 6:32</span></span>

The two doors - i. e., two leaves which met in the middle, as in the
Assyrian gate-ways generally.

Spread gold - The doors were not simply sheeted with gold, like the
floors [Kg1 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#030.md), but had the gold
hammered to fit the forms of the palms, cherubs, and flowers carved upon
them. [Kg1 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#035.md). Such hammered
metal-work, generally in bronze, has been found in tolerable abundance
among the Assyrian remains.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 6:33</span></span>

The door of the temple - The door, that is, which led from the porch
into the great chamber of the temple. Its posts were "a fourth part of
the wall," or, "five cubits high," which was, therefore, the height of
the doorway.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 6:34</span></span>

Fir-tree - Rather, juniper ([Kg1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md)
note). Each door was made in two parts, which folded back one on the
other like shutters, by means of hinges. The weight of the doors no
doubt made it inconvenient to open the whole door on every occasion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 6:36</span></span>

The inner court - An outer court is mentioned in [Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009.md). The inner court is probably
identical with the "higher court" of Jeremiah [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md), being raised above the outer,
as were sometimes the inner courts of Assyrian palaces. The court seems
to have surrounded the temple. Its dimensions may be reasonably presumed
to have been double those of the court of the tabernacle, i. e., 100
cubits on each side of the temple, and 200 cubits at the ends; or, about
720 feet long by 360 broad.

With three rows of hewed stone - Either a fence enclosing the court, or
the area of the court, which was possibly formed by three layers of hewn
stone placed one above the other, and was then boarded on the top with
cedar planks. Such a construction would no doubt be elaborate; but if it
was desired to elevate the inner court above the outer, this is the way
in which it would be likely to have been done. The temple would be
placed, like the Assyrian palaces, on an artificial platform; and the
platform, being regarded as a part of the sacred building, would be
constructed of the best material.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 6:38</span></span>

Seven years - More exactly, "seven years and six months," since Zif was
the second, and Bul the eighth month. [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md).
