### [Joshua Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 4:2</span></span>

Take you twelve men - The order is given in the plural, because no doubt
the tribes themselves were to choose their own representatives, the
choice being approved by Joshua [Jos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004.md). These twelve would be left with
Joshua on the hither bank of the river, waiting to receive his orders
after the rest of the people had made their way across [Jos
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017.md); [Jos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 4:8</span></span>

Laid them down there - i. e. in Gilgal [Jos
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020.md). Spoken of as the doers of this,
because it was done by the twelve who acted for them.

[Joshua 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 4:9</span></span>

Another set of stones is intended than that before mentioned. The one
set was erected by the command of God at the spot where they passed the
night [Jos 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003.md); the other by Joshua on
the spot where the priests' feet rested while they bore up the ark
during the passage of the people. This spot was near, or perhaps on, the
eastern brink (compare [Jos 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#008).md).
These stones would therefore mark the spot at which the people crossed,
as the others marked the place in which they lodged the night after the
crossing; nor, as the stones would only be reached by the water in flood
time, and then by the utmost edge of it, is there any reason why they
could not both be seen, and continue in their place as the writer
asserts they did up to the time when he wrote.

[Joshua 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 4:13</span></span>

The plains of Jericho, consisting of the higher terrace of the Jordan
valley, are almost seven miles broad. The mountains of Judaea here
recede somewhat from the river, and leave a level and fertile space,
which, at the time of Joshua's invasion, was principally occupied by a
forest of palms. Hence, the name "city of palms," [Deu
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 4:15</span></span>

The passage of the priests to the further bank had been already referred
to, [Jos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011.md); but the writer, in
observance of his general plan (compare introductory remarks to Josh.
3), re-introduces it here as the leading feature in the concluding
section of his account, and (as before) with mention of God's special
direction about it. The statement that on the removal of the ark the
waters of Jordan at once returned to their former level [Jos
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#018.md), heightens the impression which
is especially inculcated throughout - that the whole transaction was
extraordinary and miraculous. The details and incidents of the passage
are no doubt open to manifold discussion: but all such discussion will
be futile unless it proceed throughout on the admission that we have
here before us the record of a distinctly supernatural interposition:
compare the introduction to the Book of Joshua.

[Joshua 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 4:19</span></span>

Gilgal, mentioned here by anticipation (compare [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009)), the modern Jiljulieh (Conder.md),
was on rising ground (compare [Jos
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#003).md), and, according to Josephus,
nearly five miles from the river, and consequently about two from the
city itself. The site of the camp was no doubt fortified by Joshua, as
it constituted for some time the abiding foothold in Canaan, from where
he sallied forth to subdue the country. It was also the place of safety
where the ark, and no doubt also the women, children, cattle, and other
property of the people were left. Hence, the demolition of Jericho and
Ai, strong fortresses in the neighborhood of Gilgal, was no doubt
dictated by sound policy as well as by religious obligations.
