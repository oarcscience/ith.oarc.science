### [2 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 11:5</span></span>

Rehoboam was between two dangers: on the north he might be attacked by
Jeroboam, on the south by Jeroboam's ally, Egypt. From this side was the
greater peril, and therefore out of the 15 cities fortified, all but
three were on the southern or western frontier, where Egypt would be
most likely to attack.

[2 Chronicles 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 11:6</span></span>

See Josh. 15 and notes at [Jos
15:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md), notes; [Jos
15:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048.md), notes; [Jos
15:58-59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md), notes.

For Adullam see [Sa1 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md) note. It was
in the near neighborhood of Socoh [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035.md); but its site cannot be actually
fixed. It was a place of great antiquity [Gen
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 11:8</span></span>

For Gath, see [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md) note. Its
native king, Achish [Kg1 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039.md), is to
he regarded, not as an independent monarch, but as one of the many
vassal-kings over whom Solomon reigned [Ch2
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023.md). For Mareshah, see [Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044.md), for Ziph, [Jos
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 11:9</span></span>

The site of Adoraim is uncertain. For Lachish, see [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md); Azekah, [Jos
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md); Zorah, [Jos
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033.md); Aijalon, [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md); Hebron, [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md). No one of the cities was really
within the limits of the tribe of Benjamin. The writer uses the phrase
"Judah and Benjamin" merely as the common designation of the southern
kingdom (compare [Ch2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012.md) and [Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023).md).

[2 Chronicles 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 11:14</span></span>

Jeroboam probably confiscated the Levitical lands for the benefit of
this new priesthood. Under these circumstances the priests and Levites
emigrated in large numbers to the southern kingdom; an act which was
followed by a general emigration of the more pious Israelites [Ch2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 11:15</span></span>

The high places - i. e., the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel.

For the devils - literally, "for the goats:" probably the word is used
(as in [Lev 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007).md) for objects of
idolatrous worship generally.

[2 Chronicles 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 11:17</span></span>

Three years - i. e., during the first three years of Rehoboam's reign.
In the fourth year an apostasy took place, which neutralized all the
advantages of the immigration (marginal reference). In the fifth the
apostasy was punished by the invasion and success of Shishak [Ch2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 11:18</span></span>

This is probably an extract from the "genealogies" of Iddo [Ch2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015.md).

As Jerimoth is not mentioned among the legitimate sons of David [Ch1
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md); [Ch1
14:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#004.md), he must have been the child of
a concubine.

Abihail was probably the "grand-daughter," not "daughter," of Eliab [Sa1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006.md); [Sa1
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#013.md); [Ch1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 11:20</span></span>

Maachah the daughter of Absalom - Rather, "grand-daughter" (see the [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 11:22</span></span>

Jeush was probably the oldest of Rehoboam's sons, and should naturally
and according to the provisions of the Law [Deu
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md) have been his heir. But
Rehoboam's affection for Maachah led him to transgress the Law.

[2 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 11:23</span></span>

Rehoboam's wisdom was shown:

\(1\) In dispersing his other sons instead of allowing them to remain
together in Jerusalem, where they might have joined in a plot against
Abijah, as Adonijah and his brothers had done against Solomon [Kg1
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md);

\(2\) In giving his sons positions which might well content them and
prevent them from being jealous of Abijah.

He desired many wives - (Compare [Ch2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021).md). Some prefer to connect the
words with the preceding words. If so, they denote another point in
which Rehoboam was careful to please his sons.
