### [Judges Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

[Judges 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 1:1</span></span>

After the death of Joshua - But from [Jdg
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md) to [Jdg
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009.md) is a consecutive narrative, ending
with the death of Joshua. Hence, the events in this chapter and in [Jdg
2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md) are to be taken as belonging to
the lifetime of Joshua. See [Jdg 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011.md)
note.

Asked the Lord - The phrase is only found in Judges and Samuel. It was
the privilege of the civil ruler, to apply to the high priest to consult
for him the Urim and Thummim (marginal reference). (Compare [Jos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md); [Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md), [Jos
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md); [Jos
19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051).md). Here it was not Phinehas, as
Josephus concludes from placing these events after the death of Joshua,
but Eleazar, through whom the children of Israel inquired "who" (or,
rather), "which tribe of us shall go up!"

[Judges 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 1:2</span></span>

And the Lord said - i. e. answered by Urim and Thummim. The land was the
portion which fell to Judah by lot, not the whole land of Canaan (see
[Jdg 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011).md). The priority given to
Judah is a plain indication of divine direction. It points to the birth
of our Lord of the tribe of Judah. Judah associated Simeon with him [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md) because their lots were
intermingled [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md).

[Judges 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 1:4</span></span>

The Canaanites and the Perizzites - See [Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md), note; [Gen
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007.md), note. Bezek may be the name of a
district. It has not yet been identified.

[Judges 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 1:7</span></span>

Threescore and ten kings - We may infer from this number of conquered
kings, that the intestine wars of the Canaanites were among the causes
which, under God's Providence, weakened their resistance to the
Israelites. Adoni-Bezek's cruelty to the subject kings was the cause of
his receiving (compare the marginal references) this chastisement. The
loss of the thumb would make a man unfit to handle a sword or a bow; the
loss of his big toe would impede his speed.

[Judges 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 1:8</span></span>

Render "and the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it,
and smote it," etc. With regard to the capture of Jerusalem there is
some obscurity. It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the
edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In [Jos
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008.md), [Jos
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#010.md) the Jebusite and the king of
Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any
distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal
reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem,
but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare [Jdg
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021).md). Further, we learn from [Jdg
19:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#010.md) that Jerusalem was wholly a
Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md), and so it continued until the
reign of David [Sa2 5:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md). The
conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time
here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that
the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent
the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete
possession.

Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at [Jdg
20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048.md); [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md), and [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007.md).

[Judges 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 1:16</span></span>

The children of the Kenite - See [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md) note.

The city of palm trees - Jericho (see the marginal reference). The
rabbinical story is that Jericho, with 500 cubits square of land, was
given to Hobab. The use of the phrase "city of palm trees" for
"Jericho," is perhaps an indication of the influence of Joshua's curse
[Jos 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md). Tbe very name of Jericho
was blotted out. There are no palm trees at Jericho now, but Josephus
mentions them repeatedly, as well as the balsam trees.

[Judges 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 1:17</span></span>

Hormah - See [Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md) note. The
destruction then vowed was now accomplished. This is another decisive
indication that the events here related belong to Joshua's lifetime.
This would be about six years after the vow.

[Judges 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 1:18</span></span>

It is remarkable that Ashdod is not here mentioned, as it is in [Jos
15:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#046.md), in conjunction with Gaza and
Ekron; but that Askelon, which is not in the list of the cities of Judah
at all, is named in its stead. (See [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003) note..md) It is a curious fact that
when Rameses III took Askelon it was occupied, not by Philistines, but
apparently by Hebrews. Rameses began to reign in 1269 B.C., and reigned
25 years. At any time between 1269 and 1244 B.C. such occupation of
Askelon by Hebrews agrees with the Book of Judges.

[Judges 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 1:21</span></span>

This verse is nearly identical with [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063.md), except in the substitution of
Benjamin for Judah. Probably the original reading Judah was altered in
later times to Benjamin, because Jebus was within the border of
Benjamin, and neither had the Benjamites expelled the Jebusites.

[Judges 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 1:22</span></span>

Bethel was within the borders of Benjamin, but was captured, as we here
learn, by the house of Joseph, who probably retained it.

[Judges 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 1:26</span></span>

The site of this new Luz is not known, but "the land of the Hittites"
was apparently in the north of Palestine, on the borders of Syria ([Gen
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015) note.md).

[Judges 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 1:31</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Accho, afterward called Ptolemais, now
Akka or St. Jean d'Acre, is named here for the first time.

[Judges 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jdg 1:32</span></span>

It is an evidence of the power of the Canaanite in this portion of the
land that it is not said (compare [Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030).md) that the Canaanites dwelt among
the Asherites, but that the Asherites (and [Jdg
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#033), Naphtali.md) "dwelt among the
Canaanites;" nor are the Canaanites in Accho, Zidon, and the other
Asherite cities, said to have become tributaries.

[Judges 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 1:34</span></span>

The Amorites are usually found in the mountain [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md); [Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md). Here they dwell in the valley,
of which the monuments of Rameses III show them to have been in
possession when that monarch invaded Syria. It was their great strength
in this district, and their forcible detention of the territory of Dan,
which led to the expedition of the Danites Judg. 18. The house of Joseph
lent their powerful aid in subduing them, probably in the times of the
Judges.

[Judges 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 1:36</span></span>

The going up to Akrabbim - See the margin and references; properly "the
ascent of scorpions," with which the whole region abounds.

The rock - Petra, the capital of Idumea, so called from the mass of
precipitous rock which encloses the town, and out of which many of its
buildings are excavated. The original word "Selah" is always used of the
rock at Kadesh-Barnea [Num 20:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md),
near Petra (compare [Oba 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003).md). This
leads us to look for "the ascent of scorpions," here coupled with סלע הס
has-sela‛, in the same neighborhood.
