Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Exodus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001)

[Exodus 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 19:1</span></span>

The wilderness ... the desert of Sinai - If the mount from which the law
was delivered be the rock of Ras Safsafeh, then the spacious plain of Er
Rahah would be the "desert" of Sinai (see [Exo
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#017)).

[Exodus 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 19:3</span></span>

Moses went up unto God - This seems to imply that the voice was heard by
Moses as he was ascending the mount.

House of Jacob - This expression does not occur elsewhere in the
Pentateuch. It has a special fitness here, referring doubtless to the
special promises made to the Patriarch.

[Exodus 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 19:4</span></span>

On eagles' wings - Both in the law [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011) and in the Gospel [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037), the Church is compared to
fledgelings which the mother cherishes and protects under her wings: but
in the law that mother is an eagle, in the Gospels "a hen"; thus
shadowing forth the diversity of administration under each covenant: the
one of power, which God manifested when He brought His people out of
Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and led them into the
promised land; the other of grace, when Christ came in humility and took
the form of a servant and became obedient unto death, even the death of
the Cross. Compare also [Rev 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014).

[Exodus 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 19:5</span></span>

A peculiar treasure - A costly possession acquired with exertion, and
carefully guarded. The special relation in which Israel stands, taken
out of the pagan world and consecrated to God, as His slaves, subjects,
and children, determines their privileges, and is the foundation of
their duties. The same principle applies even in a stronger sense to the
Church. See [Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028); [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

All the earth is mine - It was a point of great practical importance, to
impress upon the Jews that their God was no mere national Deity. Compare
[Deu 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014); [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).

[Exodus 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 19:6</span></span>

A kingdom of priests - Israel collectively is a royal and priestly race:
a dynasty of priests, each true member uniting in himself the attributes
of a king and priest. Compare [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

An holy nation - The holiness of Israel consisted in its special
consecration to God: it was a sacred nation, sacred by adoption, by
covenant, and by participation in all means of grace. Compare [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006); [Deu
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019); [Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009); [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017); [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027).

[Exodus 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 19:8</span></span>

All that the Lord ... - By this answer the people accepted the covenant.
It was the preliminary condition of their complete admission into the
state of a royal priesthood.

[Exodus 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 19:10</span></span>

Sanctify them - The injunction involves bodily purification and
undoubtedly also spiritual preparation. Compare [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022). The washing of the clothes was
an outward symbol well understood in all nations.

[Exodus 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 19:12</span></span>

Set bounds unto the people - The low line of alluvial mounds at the foot
of the cliff of Ras Safsafeh exactly answers to the bounds which were to
keep the people off from touching the mount: but the bounds here spoken
of were to be set up by Moses.

[Exodus 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 19:13</span></span>

Touch it - Rather "touch him." The person who had touched the mount was
not to be touched, since the contact would be pollution.

[Exodus 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 19:17</span></span>

Out of the camp - The encampment must have extended far and wide over
the plain in front of the mountain. From one entrance of the plain to
the other there is space for the whole host of the Israelites.

[Exodus 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 19:18</span></span>

A furnace - The word in the original is Egyptian, and occurs only in the
Pentateuch.

[Exodus 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 19:22</span></span>

The priests also - Sacrifices had hitherto been offered by firstborn, or
the heads of families. See [Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)
note.
