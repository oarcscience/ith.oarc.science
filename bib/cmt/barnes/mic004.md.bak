### [Micah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

[Micah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 4:1</span></span>

But (And) in the last days it shall come to pass - God's promises,
goodness, truth, fail not. He withdraws His Presence from those who
receive Him not, only to give Himself to those who will receive Him.
Mercy is the sequel and end of chastisement. Micah then joins on this
great prophecy of future mercy to the preceding woe, as its issue in the
order of God's Will. "And it shall be." He fixes the mind to some great
thing which shall come to pass; "it shall be." Then follows, in marked
reference to the preceding privations, a superabundance of mercy. For
"the mountain of the house," which should be as a forest and which was
left unto them desolate, there is "the mountain of the Lord's house
established;" for the heap of dust and the plowed field, there is the
flowing-in of the Gentiles; for the night and darkness, that there shall
be no vision, there is the fullness of revelation; for corrupt judgment,
teaching, divining, a law from God Himself going forth through the
world; for the building of Jerusalem with blood, one universal peace.

In the last days - Literally, the end of the days, that is, of those
days which are in the thoughts of the speaker. Politically, there are
many beginnings and many endings; as many endings as there are
beginnings, since all human polity begins, only to end, and to be
displaced in its turn by some new beginning, which too runs its course,
only to end. Religiously, there are but two consummations. All time,
since man fell, is divided into two halves, the looking forward to
Christ to come in humility; the looking forward to His coming in glory.
These are the two events on which man's history turns. To that former
people the whole period of Christ's kingdom was one future, the fullness
of all their own shadows, types, sacrifices, services, prophecies,
longing, being. The "end of their days" was the beginning of the new Day
of Christ: the coming of His Day was necessarily the close of the former
days, the period of the dispensation which prepared for it.

The prophets then by the words, "the end of the days," always mean the
times of the Gospel . "The end of the days" is the close of all which
went before, the last dispensation, after which there shall be no other.
Yet this too hast "last days" of its own, which shall close God's
kingdom of grace and shall issue in the Second Coming of Christ; as the
end of those former days, which closed the times of "the law," issued in
His First Coming. We are then at once living in the last times, and
looking on to a last time still to come. In the one way Peter speaks
[Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md) of the last times, or the
end of the times , in which Christ was manifested for us, in contrast
with the foundations of the world, before which He was foreordained.

And Paul contrasts God's [Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)
speaking to the fathers in the prophets, and at the end of these days
speaking to us in the Son; and of our Lord coming [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md) at the end, consummation, of the
times , to put away sins by the sacrifice of Himself; and says that the
things which befell the Jews [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md) were written for our admonition,
unto whom the ends of the times (that is, of those of the former people
of whom he had been speaking) are come; and John speaks of this as [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md) the last time. In the other way,
they contrast the last days, not with the times before them but with
their own, and then plainly they are a last and distant part of this
their own last time .

The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith ; In the last days perilous times shall come :
There shall come at the end of the days scoffers : They told you that
there should be mockers in the last time. The Jews distributed all time
between "this world" and "the coming world" , including under "the
coming world" the time of grace under the Messiah's reign, and the
future glory. To us the names have shifted, since this present world
[Mat 13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040.md); [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md) is to us the kingdom of Christ,
and there remains nothing further on this earth to look to, beyond what
God has already given us. Our future then, placed as we are between the
two Comings of our Lord, is, of necessity, beyond this world .

The mountain of the house of the Lord shall be - abidingly

Established - He does not say merely, "it shall be established."
Kingdoms may be established at one time, and then come to an end. He
says, "it shall be a thing established" . His saying is expanded by
Daniel; "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
kingdom which shall not be destroyed forever, and it shall abide
forever" [Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md). The house of the
Lord was the center of His worship, the token of His Presence, the
pledge of His revelations and of His abiding acceptance, protection,
favor. All these were to be increased and continuous. The image is one
familiar to us in the Hebrew Scriptures. People were said to go up to
it, as to a place of dignity.

In the Psalm on the carrying of the Ark thither, the hill of God is
compared to the many-topped mountains of Basan [Psa
68:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016.md), (the Hermon-peaks which
bound Basan,) and so declared to be greater than they, as being the
object of God's choice. The mountain where God was worshiped rose above
the mountains of idolatry. Ezekiel, varying the image, speaks of the
Gospel as an overshadowing cedar [Eze
17:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md), planted by God upon an high
mountain and an eminent, in the mountain of the height of Israel, under
which should dwell all fowl of every wing; and, in his vision of the
Temple, he sees this, the image of the Christian Church [Eze
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md), upon a very high mountain. Our
Lord speaks of His Apostles and the Church in them, as [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md) a city set upon a hill which
cannot be hid. The seat of God's worship was to be seen far and wide;
nothing was to obscure it. It, now lower than the surrounding hills, was
then to be as on the summit of them. Human elevation, the more exalted
it is, the more unstable is it. Divine greatness alone is at once solid
and exalted. The new kingdom of God was at once to be "exalted above the
hills," and "established on the top of the mountains;" "exalted," at
once, above everything human, and yet "established," strong as the
mountains on which it rested, and unassailable, unconquerable, seated
secure aloft, between heaven, whence it came and to which it tends, and
earth, on which it just tests in the sublime serenity of its majesty.

The image sets forth the supereminence of the Lord's House above all
things earthly. It does not define wherein that greatness consists. The
flowing in of the nations is a fruit of it [Mic
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md). The immediate object of their
coming is explained to be, to learn to know and to do the will of God
[Mic 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md). But the new revelation does
not form all its greatness. That greatness is from the Presence of God,
revealing and evermore teaching His Will, ruling, judging, rebuking,
peacemaking [Mic 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md). Dionysius:
"The 'mountain of the Lord's House' was then 'exalted above the hills'
by the bodily Presence of Christ, when He, in the Temple built on that
mountain, spake, preached, worked so many miracles; as, on the same
ground, Haggai says, 'the glory of this latter house shall be greater
than the glory of the former' [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md)." Lap.: "This 'mountain,' the
church of Christ, transcends all laws, schools, doctrines, religions,
Synagogues of Jews and Philosophers, which seemed to rise aloft among
men, like mountain-tops, yea, whatever under the sun is sublime and
lofty, it will overpass, trample on, subdue to itself."

Even Jews have seen the meaning of this figure. Their oldest mystical
book explains it. Zohar, f. 93: "'And it shall be in the last days,'
when namely the Lord shall visit the daughter of Jacob, then shall 'the
mountain of the house of the Lord be firmly established, that is, the
Jerusalem which is above, which shall stand firmly in its place, that it
may shine by the light which is above. (For no light can retain its
existence, except through the light from above.) For in that time shall
the light from above shine sevenfold more than before; according to
that, Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun;
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days,
in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of His people and healeth
the stroke of their wound" [Isa 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md).
Another, of the dry literal school, says (Aben Ezra), "It is well known
that the house of the Temple is not high. The meaning then is, that its
fame shall go forth far, and there shall return to it from all quarters
persons with offerings, so that it shall be, as if it were on the top of
all hills, so that all the inhabitants of the earth should see it."

Some interpret "the mountain" to be Christ, who is called the Rock [Co1
10:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md), on the confession of whom,
God-Man, "the house of the Lord," that is, the Church is built , the
precious Cornerstone [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md), which is laid, beside which no
foundation can be laid [Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md); "the
great mountain," of which Daniel [Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035.md) prophesied. It is "firmly
established," so that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against the
Church, being built thereon; "exalted above hills and mountains", that
is above all beside, greater or smaller, which has any eminence; for He
in truth is [Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md) highly exalted
and hath a Name above every name, being [Eph
1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md) at the Right Hand of God in
the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also
in that which is to come; and all things are under His Feet. And this
for us, in that He, the Same, is the Head over all things to the Church
which is His Body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all. Rup.:
"He is God and Man, King and Priest, King of kings, and a Priest abiding
forever. Since then His Majesty reacheth to the Right Hand of God,
neither mountains nor hills, Angels nor holy men, reach thereto; for "to
which of the Angels said God at any time, Sit thou on My Right Hand?"
[Heb 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md).

Cyril: "Aloft then is the Church of God raised, both in that its Head is
in heaven and the Lord of all, and that, on earth, it is not like the
Temple, in one small people, but "set on a hill that it cannot be hid"
[Mat 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md), or remain unseen even to
those tar from it. Its doctrine too and life are far above the wisdom of
this world, showing in them nothing of earth, but are above; its wisdom
is the knowledge and love of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, and its
life is bid with Christ in God, in those who are justified in Him and
hallowed by His Spirit." In Him, it is lifted above all things, and with
the eyes of the mind beholdeth (as far as may be) the glory of God,
soaring on high toward Him who is the Author of all being, and, filled
with divine light, it owneth Him the Maker of all.

And people (peoples, nations) shall flow unto (literally upon) it - A
mighty tide should set in to the Gospel. The word is used only
figuratively) is appropriated to the streaming in of multitudes, such as
of old poured into Babylon, the merchant-empress of the world [Jer
51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md). It is used of the distant
nations who should throng in one continuous stream into the Gospel, or
of Israel streaming together from the four corners of the world . So,
Isaiah foretells, "Thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
be shut day nor night; that they may bring unto thee the forces of the
Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought" ([Isa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011.md), add [Rev
21:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025).md). These were to flow upon it,
perhaps so as to cover it, expressing both the multitude and density of
the throng of nations, how full the Church should be, as the swollen
river spreads itself over the whole champaign country, and the surging
flood-tide climbs up the face of the rock which hounds it. The flood
once covered the highest mountains to destroy life; this flood should
pour in for the saving of life. Lap.: "It is a miracle, if waters ascend
from a valley and flow to a mountain. So is it a miracle that earthly
nations should ascend to the church, whose doctrine and life are lofty,
arduous, sublime. This the grace of Christ effecteth, mighty and lofty,
as being sent from heaven. As then waters, conducted from the fountains
by pipes into a valley, in that valley bound up and rise nearly to their
original height, so these waters of heavenly grace, brought down into
valleys, that is, the hearts of men, make them to bound up with them
into heaven and enter upon and embrace a heavenly life."

[Micah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 4:2</span></span>

And many nations shall come - Isaiah [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md) added the world all to Micah's
prophecy. So our Lord said, "This Gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations" [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md); and the elect are to be
gathered out "of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues" [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md). All nations shall flow into it.
The all might be many or few. Both prophets say that those all should be
many. Judah probably knew already of many. The history of Genesis gave
them a wide-expanding knowledge of the enlargement of mankind alter the
flood, in Europe, Asia, Africa, as they then existed in their nations.
The sons of Japhet had already spread over the whole coast of our
Western sea, and far North; the Cimmerians , or Cwmry, Scandinavians ,
Carpathians , (probably Celts,) Armenians ; (including the kindred
Phrygians,) Scythians , Medes, Ionians , Aeolians , Iberians , Cypriotes
, Dardani , Tybarenes , Moschi , and the Turseni , or perhaps the
Thracians. On the East, the sons of Shem had spread in Elam, Asshur,
Arrapachitis ; they occupied the intervening tract of Aram; in the
northwest they reached to Lydia. Southward the sons of Joktan were in
Arabia. Micah's hearers knew how, of the sons of Ham, Cush had spread
far to the southeast and south from Babylonia to Aethiopia; Egypt they
remembered too well, and, beyond it, they knew of the far-scattered
tribes of the Libyans, who extended along the coast of Africa.
Phoenician trade filled up this great outline.

They themselves had, in Solomon's time, traded with India ; about this
time, we know that they were acquainted with the furthest East, China .
Such was the sight before the human mind of the prophet; such the extent
of the nations whom his people knew of.

Some were the deadly enemies of his people; some were to be its
conquerors. He knew that the the ten tribes were to be abidingly
wanderers among the nations , despised by them ; "a people, the
strangers and sojourners of the whole world" . He knew many of those
nations to be sunk in idolatry, viciousness; proud, contemptuous,
lawless; he saw them fixed in their idolatries. "All people will walk
every one in the name of his god." But he saw what eye of man could not
see, what the will of man could not accomplish, that He, whom now Judah
alone partially worshiped, would turn the hearts of His creatures to
Himself, to seek Him, not in their own ways, but as He should reveal
Himself at Jerusalem. Micah tells them distinctly, that those who should
believe would be a great multitude from many nations. In like way Isaiah
expresses the great multitude of those for whom Christ should atone [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md). He bare the sin of many [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md). By knowledge of Him shall My
righteous Servant make many righteous. And our Lord Himself says [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); The Son of man came to give His
life a ransom for many ([Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md),
add [Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015).md). This is my Blood -
which is shed for many for the remission of sins. In Micah's time not
one people, scarcely some poor fragments of the Jewish people, went up
to worship God at Zion, to call to remembrance His benefits, to learn of
Him. Those who should thereafter worship Him, should be many nations.

And say - Exhorting one another, in fervor and mutual love, as Andrew
exhorted his brother Simon, and Philip Nathanael, and the woman of
Samaria those of her city, to come to Christ: and so all since, who have
been won by Him, by word or example, by preaching or by deed, in public
or in private, bear along with them others to seek Him whom they
themselves have found.

Let us go up - leaving the lowness and earthliness of their former
conversation, and mounting upward on high where Christ is, desiring
righteousness, and athirst to know His ways.

To the house of the God of Jacob - They shall seek Him as Jacob sought
Him, , "who left his father's house and removed into another land, was a
man of heavy toils and served for hire, but obtained special help from
God, and, undistinguished as he was, became most glorious. So too the
Church, leaving all pagan wisdom, and having its conversation in Heaven,
and therefore persecuted and enduring many hardships, enjoys now glory
with God."

And He - , that is, the God of Jacob of whom he had just spoken, shall
teach us of His ways They do not go to God, because they know Him, but
that they may know Him. They are drawn by a mighty impulse toward Him.
Howsoever attracted, they come, not making bargains with God, (as some
now would,) what they should be taught, that He should reveal to them
nothing transcending reason, nothing exceeding or contradicting their
notions of God; they do not come with reserves, that God should not take
away this or that error, or should not disclose anything of His
incomprehensibleness. They come in holy simplicity, to learn whatever He
will condescend to tell them; in holy confidence, that He, the
Infallible Truth, will teach them infallibly. They say, "of His ways."
For all learning is by degrees, and all which all creatures could learn
in all eternity falls infinitely short of His truth and Holiness. Nay,
in all eternity the highest creature which He has made and which He has
admitted most deeply into the secrets of His Wisdom will be as
infinitely removed as ever from the full knowledge of His Wisdom and His
Love. For what is finite, enlarged, expanded, accumulated to the utmost
degree possible, remains finite still.

It has no proportion to the Infinite. But even here, all growth in grace
implies growth in knowledge. The more we love God, the more we know of
Him; and with increased knowledge of Him come higher perceptions of
worship, praise, thanksgiving, of the character of faith, hope, charity,
of our outward and inward acts and relations to God, the unboundedness
of God's love to us and the manifoldness of the ways of pleasing Him,
which, in His love, He has given us. Since then the whole Christian life
is a growth in grace, and even Paul [Phi
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md), forgetting those things which
are behind and reaching forth to those which are before, pressed toward
the mark for the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, then Paul too was
ever learning, in intensity, what he knew certainly by revelation, of
His ways. Again, as each blade of grass is said to differ from another,
so, and much more, each soul of man which God has created for Himself.
No one ever saw or could imagine two human beings, in whom the grace of
God had unfolded itself in exactly the same way.

Each saint will have his distinct beauty around the throne. But then
each will have learnt "of His ways," in a different proportion or
degree. His greatest saints, yea His Apostles, have been pre-eminent,
the one in one grace, another in another. John the Immerser came as a
pattern of repentance and contempt of self; John the Evangelist stood
out pre-eminent in deep tender burning personal love; Paul was known for
his zeal to spread the knowledge of Christ Crucified; Mary Magdelene was
famous for her loving penitence. Even the Blessed Virgin herself, under
inspiration, seems, in part, to speak of her lowly lowness , as that
which God specially regarded in her, when He made her the Mother of God.
Eternity only will set forth the fullness of the two words "He will
teach us of His ways." For eternity will shew, how in all [Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md) worketh that one and the
self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will; and how
the countless multitude of the redeemed have corresponded to His gifts
and drawings. : "The way of the life to God-ward is one, in that it
looketh to one end, to please God; but there are many tracks along it,
as there are many modes of life;" and each several grace is a part of
the way to God.

And we will walk in His paths - o: "By believing, hoping, loving,
well-doing, and bearing patiently all trouble." Rup.: "For it sufficeth
not to believe, unless we act as He commandeth, and strive to enter on
His ways, the strait and narrow path which leadeth unto life. He Himself
then, when He had said, "Go, teach all nations," baptizing them in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, added,
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you"
[Mat 28:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md). They say too, "we will
walk," that is, go on from strength to strength, not stand still after
having labored for a while to do His Will, but hold on to all His ways
and to Himself who is the Way, until they appear before the Lord in
Zion.

For the law - (literally, law,) shall go forth from Zion These are the
prophet's words, declaring why the nations should so flock to Zion. For
he says, "shall go forth," but the nations were not gathered to Zion,
until the Gospel was already gone forth. He speaks of it as law simply,
not the Jewish law as such, but a rule of life Man's better nature is
ill at ease, being out of harmony with God. It cannot be otherwise.
Having been made in His likeness, it must be distressed by its
unlikeness; having been made by Him for Himself, it must be restless
without Him. What they indistinctly longed for, what drew them, was the
hope to be conformed by Him to Him. The sight of superhuman holiness,
life, love, endurance, ever won and wins those without to the Gospel or
the church. Our Lord Himself gives it, as the substance of prophecy [Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md), that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His Name among all nations beginning at
Jerusalem. The image may be that of a stream, issuing forth from
Jerusalem and watering the whole world. Theodoret: "The law of the
Gospel and the word of the Apostles, beginning from Jerusalem, as from a
fountain, ran through the whole world, watering those who approached
with faith." But in that it "went forth," it may be meant, that it left
those from among whom it "went forth," and Cyril, "Zion was indeed
desolate of the law and Jerusalem bared of the divine word." Jerome:
"The word of God passed from Jerusalem to the Gentiles." Rup.: "For the
shadow was done away, and the types ceased, and sacrifices were
abolished, and everything of Moses was, in the letter, brought to a
close."

He does not say here, through whom God would so teach, but he does speak
of a direct teaching of God. He does not say only, "God will give us a
law," or "will make a revelation of Himself." He speaks of a Personal,
direct, continuous act of teaching by God, carried on upon earth,
whether the teacher be our Lord's word spoken once on earth, which does
"not pass away" [Mat 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md), or God the
Holy Spirit, as teaching in the Church and in the hearts which receive
Him. The words which follow speak of a personal reign, as these speak of
personal teaching.

[Micah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 4:3</span></span>

And He shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off
- Hitherto, they had walked each in their own ways [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md); now, they sought to be taught in
the ways of God. Before, they had been lords of the world; now they
should own a Judge higher than themselves. They were no common, but
mighty nations, such as had heretofore been the oppressors of Israel.
They were to be many, and those mighty, nations. He should , "not only
command, but "rebuke," not weak or petty nations only, but mighty, and
those not only near but afar." Mohammed had moral strength through what
he stole from the law and the Gospel, and by his owning Christ as the
Word of God. He was a heretic, rather than a pagan. Fearful scourge as
he was, and as his successors have been, all is now decayed, and no
mighty nation is left upon earth, which does not profess the Name of
Christ.

He shall rebuke them - For it was an office of the Holy Ghost "to
reprove the world as to its sin, the righteousness of Christ, the
judgment of the prince of this world" [Joh
16:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md). The Gospel conquered the
world, not by compromises or concordants, but by convicting it. It alone
could "rebuke" with power; for it was, like its Author, all-holy. It
could rebuke with efficacy; for it was the word of Him who knew what is
in man. It could rebuke with awe; for it knew the secrets of eternal
Judgment. It could rebuke winningly; for it knew "the love of Christ
which passeth knowledge" [Eph 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md).
Its martyrs suffered and rebuked their judges; and the world was amazed
at the impotence of power and the might of suffering. It rebuked the
enthroned idolatry of centuries; it set in rebellion by its rebukes
every sinful passion of man, and it subdued them. Tyrants, whom no human
power could reach, trembled before its censures. Then only is it
powerless, if its corrupted or timid or paralyzed ministers forfeit in
themselves the power of rebuke.

And they shall beat their spears into plowshares - "All things are made
new in Christ." As the inward disquiet of evil men makes them restless,
and vents itself toward others in envy, hatred, maliciousness, wrong, so
the inward peace whereof He saith, My peace I give unto you, shall,
wherever it reacheth, spread out abroad and, by the power of grace,
bring to "all nations unity, peace, and concord." All, being brought
under the one empire of Christ, shall be in harmony, one with the other.
As far as in it lies, the Gospel is a Gospel of peace, and makes peace.
Christians, as far as they obey Christ, are at peace, both in themselves
and with one another. And this is what is here prophesied. The peace
follows from His rule. Where He judges and rebukes, there even the
mighty "beat their swords into plowshares." The universal peace, amid
which our Lord was born in the flesh, the first which there had been
since the foundation of the Roman empire, was, in God's Providence, a
fruit of His kingdom.

It was no chance coincidence, since nothing is by chance. God willed
that they should be contemporaneous. It was fitting that the world
should be still, when its Lord, the Prince of peace, was born in it.
That outward cessation of public strife, though but for a brief time,
was an image how His peace spread backward as well as forward, and of
the peace which through Him, our Peace, was dawning on the world. :
"First, according to the letter, before That Child was born to us, "on
whose shoulder the government is" Isa. 1, the whole world was full of
blood; people fought against people, kings against kings, nations
against nations. Lastly, the Roman state itself was torn by civil wars,
in whose battles all kingdoms shed blood. But after that, at the time of
the Empire of Christ, Rome gained an undivided empire, the world was
laid open to the journeys of Apostles, and the gates of cities were open
to them, and, for the preaching of the One God, one single empire was
formed.

It may too be understood as an image, that, on receiving the faith of
Christ, anger and unrestrained revilings were laid aside, so that each
putteth his hand to the plow and looketh not back, and, breaking in
pieces the shafts of contumelies, seeketh to reap spiritual fruit, so
that, others laboriing, we enter into their labors; and of us it is
said, "They shall come with joy, bringing their sheaves" [Psa
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md). Now no one fighteth; for we
read "Blessed are the peacemakers" [Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md); no one learneth to "strive, to
the subverting of the hearers" [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md). And every one shall rest under
his vine, so as to press out that "Wine which gladdeneth the heart of
man" [Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md), under that "Vine,"
whereof the "Father is the Husbandman" [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md); and under his fig tree,
gathering the sweet "fruits of the Holy Spirit love, joy, peace, and the
rest" [Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md).

The fathers had indeed a joy, which we have not, that wars were not
between Christians; for although "just wars are lawful," war cannot be
on both sides just; very few wars have not, on both sides, what is
against the spirit of the Gospel. For, except where there is exceeding
wickedness on one side, or peril of further evil, the words of our Lord
would hold good, in public as in private, "I say unto you, that ye
resist not evil" [Mat 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md).

This prophecy then is fulfilled:

\(1\) in the character of the Gospel. Ribera: "The law of the Gospel
worketh and preserveth peace. For it plucketh up altogether the roots of
all war, avarice, ambition, injustice, wrath. Then, it teacheth to bear
injuries, and, so far from requiting them, willeth that we be prepared
to receive fresh wrongs. He saith, "If anyone smite thee on the right
cheek, turn to him the other also ..." [Mat
5:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md). "I say unto you, Love your
enemies ..." [Mat 5:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md). For neither
did the old law give these counsels, nor did it explain so clearly the
precept implied in them, nor had it that wonderful and most efficacious
example of the and love of Christ, nor did it supply whereby peace could
be preserved; whereas now the first fruits of the Spirit are love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness."

\(2\) The prophecy has been fulfilled within and without, among
individuals or bodies of men, in body or mind, in temper or in deed, as
far as the Gospel has prevailed. "The multitude of them that believed
were of one heart and of one mind" [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md); one, through One indwelling
Spirit; one, though a great multitude, through one bond of love. : "See
how these Christians love one another;" "see how ready they are to die
for one another," was, in the third century, a pagan proverb as to
Christian love. : "They love one another, almost before they know one
another." : "Their first lawgiver has persuaded them that they are all
brethren." "We (which grieves you,)" the Christian answered , "so love
one another, because we know not how to hate. We call ourselves
'brethren' which you take ill, as men who have one Father, God, and are
sharers in one faith, in one hope, coheirs."

For centuries too, there was, for the most part, public peace of
Christians among themselves. Christian soldiers fought only, as
constrained by the civil law, or against Barbarian invaders, to defend
life, wife, children, not for ambition, anger, or pride. Christians
could then appeal, in fulfillment of the prophecy, to this outward, the
fruit of the inward, peace. "We," says an early martyr, , "who formerly
stained ourselves with mutual slaughter, not only do not wage war with
foes, but even, in order not to lie and deceive those who consume us,
willingly professing Christ, meet death." "From the coming of the Lord,"
says another martyr, . "the New Testament, reconciling unto peace, and a
life-giving law, went forth into all lands. If then another law and
word, going forth from Jerusalem, produced such peace among the nations
which received it, and thereby reproved much people of want of wisdom,
then it would follow that the prophets spake of some other. But if the
law of liberty, that is, the law of God preached by the Apostles, which
went forth out of Jerusalem to all the world, worked such a
transformation, that swords and spears of war He wrought into
plow-shares and pruning-hooks, instruments of peace, and now men know
not how to fight, but, when smitten, yield the other cheek, then the
prophets spake of no other, but of Him who brought it to pass." "Even
from this," says Tertullian , "you may know that Christ was promised,
not as one mighty in war, but as a peace-bringer. Either deny that these
things were prophesied, since they are plain to see; or, since they are
written, deny that they are fulfilled. But if thou mayest deny neither,
thou must own that they are fulfilled in Him, of whom they are
prophesied." "Of old" , says Athanasius, "Greeks and Barbarians, being
idolaters, warred with one another, and were fierce toward those akin.
For through their implacable warfare no one might pass land or sea,
unarmed. Their whole life was passed in arms; the sword was to them for
staff and stay. They worshiped idols, sacrificed to demons, and yet from
their reverence for idols they could gain no help to correct their
minds. But when they passed into the school of Christ, then, of a truth,
pricked in mind, they wondrously laid aside their savage slaughters, and
now think no more of things of war; for now all peace and friendship are
alone their mind's delight. who then did this, who blended in peace
those who hated one another, save the Beloved Son of the Father, the
common Saviour of all, Christ Jesus, who, through His love, endured all
things for our salvation?

For of old too, the peace which should hold sway from Him was
prophesied, "they shall beat their swords into plowshares." Nor is this
incredible, since now too, the Barbarians with innate savageness, while
they yet sacrifice to their idols, are mad with one another, and cannot
for one hour part with their swords. But when they have received the
teaching of Christ, immediately forever they turn to husbandry; and, in
lieu of arming their hands with swords, stretch them out to prayer. And
altogether, instead of warring with one another, they arm themselves
against the devil and demons, warring against them with modesty and
virtue of soul. This is a token of the Godhead of the Saviour. For what
men could not learn among idols, this they have learned from Him.
Christ's disciples, having no war with one another, array themselves
against demons by their life and deeds of virtue, chase them and mock
their captain the devil, chaste in youth, enduring in temptation, strong
in toils, tranquil when insulted, unconcerned when despoiled."

And yet later, Chrysostom says , "Before the Coming of Christ, all men
armed themselves and no one was exempt from this service, and cities
fought with cities, and everywhere were men trained to war. But now most
of the world is in peace; all engage in mechanical art or agriculture or
commerce, and few are employed in military service for all. And of this
too the occasion would cease, if we acted as we ought and did not need
to be reminded by afflictions." : "After the Sun of righteousness
dawned, so far are all cities and nations from living in such perils,
that they know not even how to take in hand any affairs of war. - Or if
there be still any war, it is far off at the extremity of the Roman
Empire, not in each city and country, as heretofore. For then, in any
one nation, there were countless seditions and multiform wars. But now
the whole earth which the sun surveys from the Tigris to the British
isles, and therewith Lybia too and Egypt and Palestine, yea, all beneath
the Roman rule, - ye know how all enjoy complete security, and learn of
war only by hearsay."

Cyril (on Isa. 2 and here) and Theodoret (on Isa. 2 and here) carry on
this account into the fifth century after our Lord's Coming. Christians
then during those four centuries could point to a present fulfillment of
prophecy, when we, for our sins, can only speak of the past [Isa
59:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md). The Lord's hand is not
shortened, that it cannot save: neither His ear heavy, that it cannot
hear; but our iniquities have separated between us, and our God, and our
sins have hid His Face from us, that He will not hear. Those first
Christians could urge against the Jews the fulfillment of their
prophecies herein, where the Jews can now urge upon us their seeming
non-fulfillment; : "In the time of King Messiah, after the wars of Gog
and Magog, there shall be peace and tranquillity in all the world, and
the sons of men shall have no need of weapons, but these promises were
not fulfilled."

The prophecy is fulfilled, in that the Gospel is a Gospel of peace and
makes peace. Christians, as far as they obey Christ, are at peace both
in themselves and with one another. The promises of God are perfect on
His part: He is faithful to them. But He so wills to be freely loved by
His intelligent creatures whom He formed for His love, that He does not
force our free-agency. We can fall short of His promises, if we will. To
those only who will it, the Gospel brings peace, stilling the passions,
quelling disputes, banishing contentions, removing errors, calming
concupiscence, soothing and repressing anger, in individuals, nations,
the Church; giving oneness of belief, harmony of soul, contentment with
our own, love of others as ourselves; so that whatever is contrary to
this has its origin in something which is not of Christ nor of His
Gospel.

[Micah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 4:4</span></span>

But - And

They shall sit every man, under his vine and under his fig-tree -
Palestine was a home of the vine and the fig-tree. Vineyards were a
common property, possessed by all but the very poor , or even by them
[Neh 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#004.md); [Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md). The land was "a land of bread
and vineyards" [Kg2 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#032.md). The vine
was the emblem of the people, in Psalmists and prophets ([Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md) ff; [Isa
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md); [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md) ff; [Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md); [Jer
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md); [Eze
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md); [Eze
17:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005.md); [Eze
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001).md). The bunch of grapes or the
vine-leaf appear as characteristic emblems on Jewish coins , chiefly in
the times of their revolts under Vespasian and Hadrian . The fig is also
mentioned as part of the characteristic fruitfulness of Palestine [Deu
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008.md).

It too was an universal property [Kg2
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#032.md). Both formed natural arbors; the
fig had its name probably from its length, the vine from the arch made
by its drooping boughs. Both formed, in those hot countries, a grateful
shade. The vine, rising with its single stem, was spread over
trellis-work or by props, so as to enclose a considerable space . Even
in Italy, a single vine shaded a portico . In Palestine it grew by the
walls of the house [Psa 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003.md).

Rabbis relate how their forefathers sat and studied under the fig-tree ,
as Nathanael was doubtless meditating or praying under one, when Jesus,
being God, saw him [Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md). It
exhibits a picture of domestic peace, each family gathered in harmony
and rest under the protection of God, each content with what they have,
neither coveting another's, nor disturbed in their own. Wine is
explained in Holy Scripture to be an emblem of gladness, and the fig of
sweetness . Cyril: "For exceeding sweet is the word of the Saviour, and
it knoweth how to gladden man's heart; sweet also and full of joy is the
hope of the future, wherewith we are enriched in Christ.

Such had been Israel's lot in the peaceful days of Solomon [Kg1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md), the peace of whose times had
already been made the image of the Gospel Ps. 72; the coming of the
Queen of the South from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the
wisdom of Solomon [Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md), had made
her kingdom to be selected as an emblem of those who should fall down
before Christ and serve Him [Psa 60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012.md)
:10-11. Lap.: "Such is that most quiet fearlessness which the law of
Christ bringeth, as being the law of charity, peace, and concord."

And none shall make them afraid - o: "Neither man, nor devil; for the
Lord hath given us power to "tread on serpents and scorpions, and over
all the power of the enemy, and said, nothing shall by any means hurt
you" [Luk 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md), and bade us, "fear
not them which kill the body" [Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md). Witness the might which He gave
to His Apostles and Martyrs.

For the mouth of the Lord of Host hath spoken it - The prophets often
add this, when what they say, seems, for its greatness, past belief Yet
it will be, because He hath spoken it, "the Lord" who changeth not, "the
Lord of Hosts," to whose commands all creatures are subject, whose word
is truth with whom to speak is to do.

[Micah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 4:5</span></span>

For all people well walk, every one in the name of his god, and we will
walk in the name of the Lord our God - Hitherto unsteadfastness had been
the very characteristic sin of Israel. It was , "constant only in its
inconstancy," ever "falling away like their forefathers, starting aside
like a broken bow" [Psa 78:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057.md). The
pagan persevered in their worship, because it was evil or had evil in
it, not checking but feeding their passions. Israel did not persevere in
his, because it required him to deny himself things unlawful. "Hath a
nation changed their gods which are yet no gods? But My people have
changed their glow for that which doth not profit" [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md). Henceforth, the prophet
professeth for his people, the true Israel, that he will be as steadfast
in good, as the pagan in evil; so our Lord sets forth "the children of
this world in their generation" [Luk
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md), as an example of wisdom to the
children of light.

Cyril: "They who are eager to go up into the mountain of the Lord, and
wish to learn thoroughly His ways, promise a ready obedience, and
receive in themselves the glories of the life in Christ, and undertake
with their whole strength to be earnest in all holiness. 'For let every
one,' he saith, 'in every country and city go the way himself chooseth,
and pass his life, as to him seemeth good; but our care is Christ, and
His laws we will make our straight path; we will walk along with Him;
and that not for this life only, present or past, but yet more for what
is beyond' [Ti2 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md). It is a faithful saying. For they
who now suffer with Him, shall walk with Him forever, and with Him be
glorified, and with Him reign. But they make Christ their care, who
prefer nothing to His love, who cease from the vain distractions of the
world, and seek rather righteousness and what is pleasing unto Him, and
to excell in virtue. Such an one was the divine Paul; for he writeth, "I
am crucified with Christ; and now no longer I live, but Christ liveth in
me" [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); and again, "I
determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him
crucified" [Co1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md).

To "walk" is so uniformly in Holy Scripture used of a person's moral or
religious "ways" . p. 378, and above on [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md), p. 35. So again to walk with
God, [Gen 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md) or before God, [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md) or contrary to God, [Lev
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021).) (as we say.md), that the prophet
here too is doubtless speaking of the opposite religious ways of the
pagan and of the future people of God. The "name" was often, in Hebrew,
expressive of the character; and, in regard to God Himself, that Name
which He vouchsafed to give to Himself , expressed His Self-existence,
and, as a result, His Unchangeableness and His Faithfulness. The names,
by which it was foretold that Christ should be called, express both His
Deity and attributes ; the human Name, which He bare and vouchsafes to
bear yet, was significant of His office for us, Saviour [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

To praise "the Name of the Lord" then, is to praise Him in that
character or relation which He has revealed to us. : "He 'walketh in the
Name of the Lord,' who ordereth every act and motion worthily of the
vocation wherewith he is called, and, "whether he eateth or drinketh,
doth all to the glory of God. [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)" this promise hath its own
reward; for it is "forever and ever." They who "walk in the Name of the
Lord," shall "walk before Him in, the land of the living, forever and
ever" [Psa 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009.md). Such walk on, with
quickened steps, lingering not, "in the Name of the Lord our God," that
is, doing all things in His Name, as His great Name requires, conformed
to the holiness and all other qualities which His Name expresseth. "For
ever and ever, literally forever and yet, or, more strictly still, for
that which is hidden and yet," which is the utmost thought of eternity
we can come to. Time indeed has no relation to eternity; for time, being
God's creature, is infinite. Still, practically to us, our nearest
conception of eternity, is existence, on and on and on, an endless,
unchanging, ever-prolonged future, lost in distance and hidden from us,
and then, and yet, an ever-to-come yet, which shalt never come to an
end. Well then may we not faint, as tho' it were long to toil or to do
without this or that, since the part of our way which lies amid toils
and weariness is so short, and will soon be at an end; what lies beyond,
in joy, is infinite in infinite joy, ever full and still ever a yet to
come.

The prophet says, "we will walk;" , "uniting himself in longing, hope,
faith, to the sons of the New Testament, that is, Christians, as his
brethren, re-born by the grace of the same Christ;" , "ministers of the
Old, heirs of the New Testament, because they loved through that same
faith whereby we love; believing in the Incarnation, Passion,
Resurrection of Christ yet to be, as we believe in it, having been."

[Micah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 4:6</span></span>

In that day - that is, in that day of Christ and of His Gospel, of grace
and salvation, the last days of which he had been speaking. Hitherto he
had prophesied the glory of Zion, chiefly through the coming-in of the
Gentiles. Now he adds, how the Jews should, with them, be gathered by
grace into the one fold, in that long last day of the Gospel, at the
beginning, in the course of it, and completely at the end [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md).

Her that halteth - The prophet resumes the image of the scattered flock,
under which he had before [Mic 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)
foretold their restoration. This was no hope of his own, but His word
who cannot fail. The course of events, upon which he is entering, would
be, at times, for their greatness and their difficulty, past human
belief. So he adds straightway, at the outset, "saith the Lord." To
"halt" is used of bodily lameness [Gen
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#032.md), and that, of a flock, worn out
by its wanderings [Zep 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md). It is
used also of moral halting [Psa 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md);
[Psa 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018.md), such as had been a chief
sin of Israel, serving partly God, partly Baal ; God, with a service of
fear, Baal with a service of that counterfeit of love, sensuality. So it
was sick, both in body and soul, and driven out also, and afflicted.

[Micah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 4:7</span></span>

And her that was cast off a strong nation - The prophecy, that there
should be a remnant, was depressing. Yet what a remnant should it be! A
remnant, which should multiply like the stars of heaven or the sand on
the sea-shore. Israel had never been "a strong nation," as a kingdom of
this world. At its best estate, under David, it had subdued the petty
nations around it, who were confederated to destroy it. It had never
competed with the powers of this world, East or West, Egypt or Nineveh,
although God had at times marvelously saved it from being swallowed up
by them. Now, the remnant of Judah, which itself was but a remnant of
the undivided people, was to become "a strong nation." So Isaiah
prophesied, "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a
strong nation" [Isa 60:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#022.md). Plainly not
in temporal greatness, both because human strength was not, and could
not be, its characteristic, and because the prophet had been speaking of
spiritual restoration.

: "'Strong' are they, whom neither torture nor allurements can separate
from the love of Christ." "Strong are they, who are strong against
themselves." Strong were they who said,

"We ought to obey God rather than men [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md), and, "who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we
are more than conquerors through Him that loved us" [Rom
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md), [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md). God does not only restore in the
Gospel; He multiplies exceedingly. Rup.: "I will so clothe her with the
spirit of might, that, as she shall be fruitful in number, so shall she
be glorious in victories, so that of her it shall be said, "who is she
that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
terrible as an army with banners?" [Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md). For, not to name those, whose
whole life is one warfare against invisible enemies and the evil desires
of the flesh, who shall count the martyrs of Christ? We know that that
"remnant" and "strong nation" owe wholly to grace all which they are, as
they themselves in the Revelations give thanks; "Thou wast slain and
hast redeemed us to God by Thy Blood, out of every kindred and tongue
and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings and priests,
and we shall reign on the earth" [Rev
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); that same Lord, of whom it is
here said,

The Lord shall reign over them in Zion from henceforth even forever -
The visible kingdom of God in Judah was often obscured, kings, princes,
priests, and false prophets combining to encourage one another in
rebellion against God. In the captivity it even underwent an almost
total eclipse by the over-shadowing of earthly power, save when the
divine light flashed forth for an instant in the deeds or words of power
and wisdom, related by Daniel. "Henceforth," that is, from the time,
when the law should go forth out of Zion, God should indeed reign, and
that kingdom should have no end.

[Micah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 4:8</span></span>

And thou, O tower of the flock - "'Tower of Ader,' which is interpreted
'tower of the flock,' about 1000 paces (a mile) from Bethlehem," says
Jerome who lived there, "and foresignifying (in its very name) by a sort
of prophecy the shepherds at the Birth of the Lord." There Jacob fed his
sheep [Gen 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md), and there (since it
was hard by Bethlehem) the shepherds, keeping watch over their flocks by
night, saw and heard the Angels singing, "Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will toward men." The Jews inferred from this
place that the Messiah should be revealed there .

Stronghold - (Ophel ) of the daughter of Zion Ophel was a strong place
in the South of Jerusalem, the last which the wall, enclosing Zion,
reached, before, or as, it touched on the Eastern porch of the temple ,
with whose service it was connected.

We know that, after the captivity, the Nethinim, who did the laborious
service of the temple, dwelt there [Neh
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026.md); [Neh
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021.md). It lay very near to the
priests' district [Neh 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028.md). It was
probably, a lower acclivity, "swelling out," (as its name seems to mean
,) from the mountain of the temple. In the last war, it was held
together with "the temple, and the adjoining parts to no slight extent,
and the valley of Kedron." It was burnt before the upper city was taken.
It had been encircled by a wall of old; for Jotham "built greatly upon
its wall" [Ch2 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md), Manasseh
"encircled it" [Ch2 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md), (probably
with an outer wall) "and raised it exceedingly," that is, apparently
raised artificially the whole level.

Yet, as a symbol of all Jerusalem, Ophel is as remarkable, as the "tower
of the flock" is as to Bethlehem. For Ophel, although fortified, is no
where spoken of, as of any account . It is not even mentioned in the
circuit of the walls, at their dedication, under Nehemiah [Neh
12:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#031.md), probably as an outlying,
spot. It was probably of moment chiefly, as giving, an advantage to an
enemy who might occupy it.

Both then are images of lowliness. The lonely Shepherd tower, for
Bethlehem, the birthplace of David; Ophel for Jerusalem, of which it was
yet but an outlying part, and deriving its value probably as an outwork
of the temple. Both symbols anticipate the fuller prophecy of the
littleness, which shall become great in God. Before the mention of the
greatness of the "dominion to come," is set forth the future poverty to
which it should come. In lowliness Christ came, yet is indeed a Tower
protecting and defending the sheep of His pasture, founded on earth in
His Human Nature, reaching to Heaven in His divine; "a strong Tower; the
righteous runneth into it, and is safe" [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md).

Unto thee shall it come - (Literally, "unto thee shall it come , and
there shall arrive etc.") He saith not at first what shall come, and so
raises the soul to think of the greatness of that which should come. The
soul is left to fill up what is more than thought can utter. "Unto
thee," (literally, quite up to thee) No hindrances should withhold it
from coming. Seemingly it was a great way off, and they in a very
hopeless state. He suggests the difficulty even by his strength of
assurance. One could not say, "it shall come quite up to thee," of that
which in the way of nature would readily come to any one. But amid all
hindrances God's Might makes its way, and brings His gifts and promises
to their end. "And there shall arrive." He twice repeats the assurance,
in equivalent words, for their fuller assurance , "to make the good
tidings the gladder by repeating and enforcing them."

The "first or former, dominion." The word often stands, as our "former"
, in contrast with the "later." It is not necessarily "the first,"
strictly; and so here, not the "dominion" of David and Solomon
exclusively. Rather the prophet is placed in spirit in the later times
when the kingdom should be suspended, and foretells that "the former
dominion," that is, that of the line of David, should come to her, not
in its temporal greatness, but the line itself. So the Angel said, "He
shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord
God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He shall
reign over the house of Jacob forever" [Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md).

The (A) kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem - that is, a kingdom, which
should not be of her, but which should come to her; not her's by right,
but by His right, who should merit it for her, and, being King of kings,
makes His own, "kings and priests unto God and His Father" [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).

The Jews themselves seem to have taken these words into their own
mouths, just before they rejected Him, when they hoped that He would be
a king, such as they wished for. "Blessed be the kingdom of our father
David that cometh in the Name of the Lord" [Mar
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#010.md). And in a distorted form, they
held it even afterward .

[Micah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 4:9</span></span>

Now - The prophet places himself in the midst of their deepest sorrows,
and out of them he promises comfort. "Why dost thou cry out aloud? is
there no King in thee? is thy Counsellor perished?" . Is then all lost,
because thou hast no visible king, none to counsel thee or consult for
thee? . Very remarkably he speaks of their "King and Counsellor" as one,
as if to say, "When all beside is gone, there is One who abides. Though
thou be a captive, God will not forsake thee. When thou hadst no earthly
king, "the Lord thy God was thy King" [Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md). He is the First, and He is the
Last. When thou shalt have no other, He, thy King, ceaseth not to be."
Montanus: "Thou shouldest not fear, so long as He, who counselleth for
thee, liveth; but He liveth forever." Thy "Counsellor," He, who is
called "Counsellor" [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), who
counselleth for thee, who counselleth thee, will, if thou obey His
counsel, make birth-pangs to end in joy.

For pangs have taken thee, as a woman in travail - Resistless,
remediless, doubling the whole frame, redoubled until the end, for which
God sends them, is accomplished, and then ceasing in joy. The truest
comfort, amid all sorrow, is in owning that the travail-pains must be,
but that the reward shall be afterward. Montanus: "It is meet to look
for deliverance from God's mercy, as certainly as for punishment from
our guilt; and that the more, since He who foretold both, willingly
saves, punishes unwillingly." So the prophets adds.

[Micah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 4:10</span></span>

Be in pain, and labor to bring forth - (Literally, Writhe and burst
forth,) as if to say, "thou must suffer, but thy suffering and thy joy
shall be one. Thou canst not have the joy without the suffering. As
surely as thou sufferest, thou shalt have joy. In all sorrow, lose not
faith and hope, and "thou shalt be sorrowful, but thy sorrow shall be
turned into joy" [Joh 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md). Cyril:
"Good daughter, be very patient in the pangs, bear up against your
sorrows," so shall the birth be nigh. Yet for the time she must "go
forth out of the city" into captivity. "And thou shalt dwell in the
field," houseless, under tents, as captives were accustomed to be kept,
until all were gathered together to be led away; a sore exchange for her
former luxury, and in requital of their oppression [Amo
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md); [Mic
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md).

And thou shalt go even to Babylon - Not Babylon, but Assyria was the
scourge of God in Micah's time. Babylon was scarcely known, a far
country [Kg2 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#014.md). Yet Micah is
taught of God to declare that thither shall the two tribes be carried
captive, although the ten were carried captive by Assyria. "There (see
the note at [Hos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015).md) shalt thou be
delivered, there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine
enemies." God's judgments, or purifying trials, or visitation of His
saints, hold their way, until their end be reached. They who suffer them
cannot turn them aside; they who inflict them cannot add to them or
detain them. The prison house is the place of deliverance to Joseph and
Peter; the Red Sea to Israel; the judges were raised up, when Israel was
mightily oppressed; Jabesh-Gilead was delivered when the seventh day was
come [Sa1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#003.md), [Sa1
11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#010.md); the walls of Jerusalem were
the end of Sennacherib; Judah should have long been in the very hand and
grasp of Babylon, yet must its clenched hand be opened.

[Micah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 4:11</span></span>

Now also - (And now.) The prophet had already spoken of the future
before them, with this word Now. Then, he distinctly prophesied the
captivity to Babylon. Twice more he begins anew; as Holy Scripture, so
often, in a mystery, whether speaking of evil or of good, of deliverance
or of punishment, uses a threefold form. In these two, no mention is
made of the enemy, and so there is some uncertainty. But the course must
apparently be either backward or forward. They must either be two nearer
futures before the Captivity, or two more distant after it. This second
gathering might, in itself, either be that of the Assyrian hosts under
Sennacherib out of all the nations subject to him; or that of the many
petty nations in the time of the Maccabees, who took advantage of the
Syrians' oppression, to combine to eradicate the Jews (1 Macc. 5:1, 2).
If understood of Sennacherib, the prophet, having foretold the entire
captivity of the whole people to Babylon, would have prophesied the
sudden destruction of a nearer enemy, whose miraculous and instantaneous
overthrow should be the earnest of the destruction of Babylon and of
their deliverance from it. This would suit well with the description,
"He shall gather them as sheaves to the floor," and would correspond
well with the descriptions in Isaiah. On the other hand, whereas this
description would suit any other event, in which man gathered his
strength against God and was overthrown, the following words, "Arise and
thresh, O daughter of Zion," etc., fit better with the victories of the
Maccabees, in which Israel was active, than with the overthrow of
Sennacherib, in which they were wholly passive, and God did all for
them, as Isaiah and Nahum foretell the same overthrow [Isa
10:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md); [Isa
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024.md), [Isa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md); [Isa
17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012.md); [Isa
29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md); [Nah
1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md). Then also, if the course of
the description was backward:

1\) the captivity in Babylon

2\) the destruction of Sennacherib

There is no earlier event to correspond with "the smiting of the judge
of Israel on the cheek" ([Mic 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md) in
Hebrew). The malice also of the nations gathered against Zion suits
better with the abiding character of the petty nations, and of their
hereditary envy against Israel and its high claims. To Nineveh and
Babylon, Israel was but one little corner of ground, which rounded their
territory and connected them with Egypt. They disdained them, even while
they sought to subdue them. Micah describes the exultation of petty
gratified rivalry.

That say, let her be defiled - The bad have a keen eye for the haltings
and inconsistencies and falls of God's people, for which they are ever
on the watch. Like Satan, they are first tempters, then the accusers;
first desecrators, then sanctimonious justiciaries. God, in His
judgment, leaves what has been inwardly defiled to be outwardly
profaned. "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple are ye" [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md). "The faithful city had become a
harlot" [Isa 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md). "The land had
become polluted by its inhabitants" [Jer
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md); [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md); [Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md). Now it was to be polluted by the
enemy. Its seducers ask for the judgment of God. "It has become like us
in its deeds; let it no more be distinguished from us by the name of the
people of God."

And let our eye look upon Zion - With pleasure upon its desolation, and
feed itself with its misery. : "Where the eye, there love; where the
hand, there pain." "They opened their mouth wide against me: they said,
Aha, Aha, our eye hath seen" [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md). The world hates the Church;
Edom, Israel; it cannot be satisfied with beholding its chastisements
[Mic 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md); [Oba
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md). The sufferings of the Martyrs
were the choice spectacle of the pagan.

[Micah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 4:12</span></span>

But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they His
counsel - The pagan did, for their own ends, what God willed for His.
The first step was the same; God willed that His people should be
punished; they willed to punish them. But all which lay beyond, they saw
not; that God willed (on their repentance) to pardon His own people, but
to punish themselves for their pride [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md), [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md) and cruelty [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md), [Zac
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019.md). : "Almighty God corrects the
elect through the reprobate, as with a rod; after which He condemns the
reprobate eternally, as when the son has been disciplined, the rod is
cast into the fire."

For He shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor - The multitude
of the sheaves hinders not the threshing; the multitude of God's enemies
hinders not their destruction. They think that they strengthen
themselves, as they gather together; God sees them but as ripened and
fitted for destruction, gathered into one bundle together, to perish
together. God gathers them, not by constraint or force, but by giving
free scope to their own wayward wills, and overruling these to His ends.

[Micah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 4:13</span></span>

Arise - (It may be,) from the dust in which they were lying, "I will
make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass." Threshing in the
East is partly with oxen, partly with wheels of iron, or with planks set
with sharp flints on an open place made hard to this end. The prophet
joins another image, with this and represents Judah as being by God
endued with strength, first as with a "horn of iron" [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011.md) to cast the enemy to the ground,
and then with "hoofs of brass," wherewith to trample them to dust, as
the stubble and chaff. "And I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord,"
that is, to Myself; the Lord gathered them into the floor by His
Providence; the Lord gave His people strength to subdue them; and now,
in His own Person, He says, I will complete My own work.

The very image of the "threshing" implies that this is no mere
destruction. While the stubble is "beaten" or bruised to small pieces,
and the chaff is far more than the wheat, and is carried out of the
floor, there yet remains the seed-corn. So in the great judgments of
God, while most is refuse, there yet remains over, what is severed from
the lost heap and wholly "consecrated" to Him. Whatever things were the
object of the חרם chêrem [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md) or
"thing devoted to the Lord," could not be redeemed, but must remain
wholly the Lord's. If it had life, it was to be put to death Lev. 29.
And so the use of the word here may the rather shew, how those converted
to God, and who became gain, hallowed to Him, were to pass through death
to life, to die to themselves that they might live to Him: what was evil
was to be slain in them, that they themselves might live.

The Israelites and God's dealings with them are "ensamples of us upon
whom the ends of the world are come" [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md). And so the whole section fits
wonderfully with the condition of the single soul. "She who halteth"
(Rib.) "the soul, who would serve God, yet not so as wholly to give up
the service of the world, which it had in Baptism renounced, who, after
it had gone astray like a lost sheep, and been scattered amid the
manifoldness of earthly things, was gathered again into the fold, to
love One only, long for One only, give itself to One," its Good
Shepherd, and over it the Lord reigneth forever, if, taught by
experience the deceitfulness of Satan's promises, and stung by the sense
of its own thanklessness and vileness, and conscious of the peril of
self confidence, it abideth more closely than others with God. He shall
gather her that is driven out, that is, , "He shall restore her, from
whom He had, for the time, withdrawn His grace," and her that was
afflicted, trouble being God's most effectual instrument, in recalling
the soul to Himself. "For the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down"
[Psa 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md).

And will make her that halteth, a remnant, placing her among the elect
and holy, and her that was cast off strong; for Christ giveth oft to
such souls great richness of divine graces, so that "where sin abounded,
grace" should "much more abound" [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md). Rib.: "To it, when enlightened
and purified by affliction and by repentance, it is promised, that its
Lord, the Great King, shall come to it, and again reign in it, which is
the great bliss of souls in grace. For then doth the soul really reign,
when it submits wholly to Christ, whom to serve is to reign, and so,
under Him, receives power to command its wrong desires, and rule
itself;" that great and wonderful power which the Evangelist expresses
in words so brief, "To them gave He power to become the sons of God"
[Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md). Thus He maketh it strong,
so that "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, can separate it from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord" [Rom 8:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md).

Then, "he describes the condition of the soul fluctuating between good
and evil, called one way by God through inward inspirations, and another
way by the enticements and habits of sin. And, wishing to follow God,
yet not to be without its sinful pleasures, and knowing this to be
impossible, it is in anguish and hesitates. Her the prophet justly
rebukes, 'why thus cry aloud, as though thou must be led captive by the
Devil, not knowing or unable to extricate thyself? Hast thou no King,
aided by whose power, thou mayest fight against all enticements, habit,
the flesh?' Paul felt this and cried aloud, "I see another law in my
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that
I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" [Rom
7:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md). You see his grief. But he
despairs not. He knows that he has a King. I thank God through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Or why grievest thou, as if thou hadst no "counsellor,"
by whose counsels to free thee from these snares? "Thy Counsellor"
indeed "perished" on the Cross, but for thy sake, that thou mayest live.

He died, to destroy him who hath the power of death. But He rose the
third day and is still with thee; at the Right Hand of the Father He
still reigns Immortal forever. See how many counsels He has left thee in
the Gospel, how many admonitions, whereby thou mayest lead a happy and
tranquil life. Now "pain seizes thee like a woman in travail." For such
a soul travails, having conceived inspirations from God, which it wishes
to obey, but that the flesh, overcome by concupiscence, resists, and so
it never brings forth, nor experiences that joy, whereof the Lord
speaketh, "When she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more
the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world" [Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021.md). Wherefore he adds; be in pain,
for thou art indeed in travail; thou wilt not cease to be in pain, until
thou bring forth. Thou wilt go forth, etc. "God, by a provision of His
great mercy, allows lukewarm souls, who will be at no pains to gain
grace, to fall into foulest sins, in order that, owning at last their
misery, they may cease to be lukewarm, and with great ardor of soul may
embrace virtue. For, warned by the result, they understand that they
themselves emboldened the tempter, (for he chiefly attacks the lukewarm
and remiss,) and they become ardent in the conflict and in well-doing."

Wherefore he says, thou shalt go forth out of the city, that City of
God, whereof He is the Builder and Maker [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md), which is gladdened by the river
of His spirit; "and it dwells in the open field, unprotected, ready to
be a prey, in the broad way of its own concupiscences, out of the narrow
road which leadeth to life, and goeth even to Babylon, the city of
'confusion,' in tumult and din and unrest, and the distractions of this
life." Yet even there shall it be delivered, like the poor Prodigal, who
came to himself in a far country, when worn out by its hard service.
Even there it must not despair, but remember, with him, its Father's
house, its former home, the Heavenly Jerusalem. Its pains within or
without, whereby it is brought back, are travail-pains. Though all is
dark, it must not say, I have no Counsellor. For its Redeemer's Name is
"Counsellor" [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), "one Counsellor
of a thousand" (Ecclesiasticus 6:6). : "Thine Intercessor never dies."

Out of the very depth of misery will the Divine Mercy draw thee. Though
thou seem held by the strong hand of the enemy, and he seems to triumph
over thee and to jeer thee, "There, there so would we have it, we have
devoured him" [Psa 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md), and hosts of
devils seek thy utter destruction, and thou seem to be "delivered over"
[Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md) to them to the destruction of
the flesh; yet is it only that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the
Lord. Even Satan, when he is tormenting souls, knows not the thoughts of
the Lord, nor understands His counsels, how, by the very pain which he
inflicts, God is bidding: them, Rise and (Rib.) "look up to heaven and
long for heavenly things and trample on all which they had hitherto
foully served, honor or vain glory or covetousness or lust;" how He will
exalt their horn in the Lord, make it strong as iron that they should do
all things through Christ in strengthening them, and conquer all through
the might of Christ; how He should bruise Satan under their feet
shortly, and they consecrate wholly to God their whole strength, every
power of soul and body which hitherto had been the adversary's.
