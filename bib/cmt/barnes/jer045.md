### [Jeremiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

The long catalogue of calamities so consistently denounced by Jeremiah
against his country [Jer 45:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001), made
a most painful impression upon Baruch's mind. He was of ambitious
temperament [Jer 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005), and being of
noble birth as the grandson of Maaseiah, the governor of Jerusalem in
Josiah's time [Ch2 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008), and a scribe,
he appears to have looked forward either to high office in the state, or
far more probably to being invested with prophetic powers. This address
tells Baruch to give up his ambitious hopes, and be content with
escaping with life only. Like the prophecy of the 70 years of exile, it
would become a prediction of good only after really troubles had been
undergone and pride was quelled. As regards the place of this prophecy
it would come in order of time next to Jer. 36, but as that was a
public, and this a private prophecy, they would not be written upon the
same scroll. When the last memorials of Jeremiah's life were added to
the history of the fall of Jerusalem, Baruch attached to them this
prediction, which - humbled by years, and the weight of public and
private calamity - he now read with very different feelings from those
which filled his mind in his youth.

[Jeremiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

These words - i. e., the words of Jehoiakim's scroll.

[Jeremiah 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 45:3</span></span>

Grief to my sorrow - Baruch's sorrow is caused by the sinfulness of the
Jewish nation, to which God adds grief by showing how severely it will
be punished.

I fainted in - Or, "am weary with" [Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006).

[Jeremiah 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 45:4</span></span>

land - Or, earth. Baruch's lot was cast in one of those troublous times
when God enters into judgment with all flesh [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005). It was not Judaea only but the
whole known world that was thrown into turmoil by Nebuchadnezzars energy
[Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).
