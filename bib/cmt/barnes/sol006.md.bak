### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 6:1</span></span>

The question put by the chorus, and the answer it receives from the
bride, show that the loss and seeking are not to be taken too seriously.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 6:4</span></span>

The section might be entitled, "Renewed declaration of love after brief
estrangement."

[Sol 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md)

Tirzah ... Jerusalem - Named together as the then two fairest cities of
the land. For Jerusalem compare [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md). "Tirzah" (i. e., "Grace" or
"Beauty ")was an old Canaanite royal city [Jos
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024.md). It became again a royal
residence during the reigns of Baasha and his three successors in the
kingdom of the ten tribes, and may well therefore have been famed for
its beauty in the time of Solomon.

Terrible as ... - Awe-inspiring as the bannered (hosts). The warlike
image, like others in the Song, serves to enhance the charm of its
assured peace.

[Sol 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md)

Even for the king the gentle eyes of the bride have an awe-striking
majesty. Such is the condescension of love. Now follows [Sol
6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005.md) the longest of the repetitions
which abound in the Song, marking the continuance of the king's
affection as when first solemnly proclaimed [Sol
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md). The two descriptions belong,
according to some (Christian) expositors, to the Church of different
periods, e. g. to the primitive Church in the splendor of her first
vocation, and to the Church under Constantine; other (Jewish) expositors
apply them to "the congregation of Israel" under the first and second
temples respectively.

[Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md)

The king contrasts the bride with the other claimants for her royal
estate or favor [Sol 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md). She not only
outshines them all for him, but herself has received from them
disinterested blessing and praise.

This passage is invaluable as a divine witness to the principle of
monogamy under the Old Testament and in the luxurious age of Solomon.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 6:10</span></span>

The chorus address the bride here only as the Shulamite, and beg her to
perform for their entertainment a sacred dance (see [Sol
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013).md) of her own country. The bride,
after complying with their request, while they sing some stanzas in her
praise [Sol 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md), and after receiving
fresh commendations from the king [Sol
7:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006.md), invites him to return with her
to her mother's house Cant. 7:11-8:4. Many Jewish allegorists interpret
the whole as referring to the times of the second temple, and to the
present dispersion of Israel, during which, God continuing to vouchsafe
His mercy, Israel prays for final restoration, the coming of Messiah,
and the glory of the latter day. Christian interpreters have made
similar applications to the now militant Church looking for the Second
Advent, or to the ancient synagogue praying for the Incarnation.

As the morning - The glorious beauty of the bride bursts upon them like
a second dawn, as she comes forth to meet them at the commencement of
another day. Special poetical words are used for "sun" (burning heat)
and "moon" (white one). The same terms are applied to sun and moon in
[Isa 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md); [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 6:11</span></span>

The bride's words may be paraphrased: "You speak of me as a glorious
beauty; I was lately but a simple maiden engaged in rustic toils. I went
down one day into the walnut-garden" (the walnut abounded on the shores
of Lake Gennesaret, and is still common in Northern Palestine) "to
inspect the young plants of the vale" (i. e., the wady, or watercourse,
with now verdant banks in the early spring after the rainy season), "and
to watch the budding and blossoming of vine and pomegranate." Compare
[Sol 2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md) notes. "Then, suddenly,
ere I was myself aware, my soul" (the love-bound heart) "had made me the
chariot of a lordly people" (i. e., an exalted personage, one who
resides on the high places of the earth; compare [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md); [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md), where Elijah and Elisha, as the
spiritual leaders of the nation, are "the chariot and horsemen of
Israel," compare also [Isa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018).md).
This last clause is another instance of the love for military
similitudes in the writer of the Song.

Ammi-nadib - literally, my people a noble one. The reference is either
to Israel at large as a wealthy and dominant nation, under Solomon, or
to the bride's people (the Shulamites) in particular, to the chief place
among whom, by her union with the king, she is now exalted.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 6:13</span></span>

Return, return - About to withdraw, the bride is recalled by the chorus,
desiring yet a little longer to contemplate a grace and beauty which has
won all hearts.

Shulamite - Probably the same as "Shunamite," i. e., a native of the
town or district of Shunem, situated in the territory of Issachar [Jos
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md), on the slopes of the Little
Hermon, overlooking the plain of Jezreel. It is now called Salem.

See - Look or gaze at. The bride's modest reply, taking up their words,
and wondering at their request. The chorus answer with a further
petition.

As it were the company of two armies - Or, rather, the dance of Mahanaim
(see the margin), a well-known sacred dance, taking its name from the
locality in which it originated [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md); [Jos
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#038.md). Some, taking "Mahanaim" to be
an ordinary designation for "the Angels" or "Angelic Hosts," render here
"a dance as it were of angel-choirs," i. e., one of special grace and
beauty. The former of these interpretations is to be preferred.
