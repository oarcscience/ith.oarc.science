### [Jeremiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 31:1</span></span>

At the same time - literally, At that time, i. e., "the latter day."
mentioned in [Jer 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024.md).

[Jeremiah 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 31:2</span></span>

The people which were left of the sword - A promise of the restoration
of the ten tribes to their land.

The wilderness - Either the desert which lay between Assyria and
Palestine; or more probably an allusion to the wilderness of Mount
Sinai.

Found grace ... rest - Rather, "shall certainly find grace; I will go to
give Israel rest.

[Jeremiah 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 31:3</span></span>

Of old - From afar (margin). See [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md). To the Jew God was enthroned in
Zion, and thus when His mercy was shown unto the exiles in Assyria it
came from a distant region [Ch2 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#020.md),
[Ch2 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#038.md).

With lovingkindness ... - Rather, I have continued lovingkindness unto
thee.

[Jeremiah 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 31:4</span></span>

O virgin of Israel - i. e., the whole people (compare [Jer
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017) note.md).

[Jeremiah 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 31:5</span></span>

Shall eat them as common things - Rather, shall eat the fruit.
Literally, as in the margin. For three years the fruit of a
newly-planted tree was not to be touched, that of the fourth year was
consecrated to God, but on the fifth year it was profane, i. e.,
unconsecrated, and so might be applied to the owner's use [Lev
19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md).

[Jeremiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 31:6</span></span>

This verse anticipates a time when the schism caused by Jeroboam is
over. Ephraimite watchmen equally with the tribe of Judah watch for the
new moon that they may go up to Jerusalem to keep the appointed Feasts.

[Jeremiah 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 31:7</span></span>

Among - Or, because of. Israel is the chief or, first of the nations
[Deu 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019.md), and Yahweh summons mankind
to rejoice, because the remnant of Israel is about to be restored to its
old position.

[Jeremiah 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 31:8</span></span>

The coasts of the earth - See [Jer
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md) note.

Thither - Really, here. Not to the north country, but to Palestine,
where Jeremiah wrote. A company is the word constantly used of Israel at
the Exodus [Exo 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#003.md) as an organized
community.

[Jeremiah 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 31:9</span></span>

Weeping - For joy, not for sorrow.

Supplications - The conviction that God is guiding them, encourages them
to pray.

Ephraim is My firstborn - The house of Joseph is thus to be restored to
its old preeminence.

[Jeremiah 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 31:10</span></span>

The isles - The coast land of the Mediterranean, used here to show that
the most distant countries are to hear and marvel at Israel's wonderful
restoration.

[Jeremiah 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 31:12</span></span>

Omit together. The ten tribes are to flow like a river down from Zion's
height to their own land, there to reap the rich produce of their
tillage. In Jerusalem they would be occupied with religious duties, but
after these are rendered to God, they are to disperse each to his own
fields.

Sorrow - Rather, languish, pine.

[Jeremiah 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 31:13</span></span>

Both gives the idea of the men dancing, which is incorrect. Except at a
religious solemnity [Sa2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md), dancing
was confined to women. Render and young men and old rejoice together.

[Jeremiah 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 31:15</span></span>

The religious character of the restoration of the ten tribes.
Chastisement brought repentance, and with it forgiveness; therefore God
decrees their restoration.

[Jer 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md)

Ramah, mentioned because of its nearness to Jerusalem, from which it was
distant about five miles. As the mother of three tribes, Benjamin,
Ephraim, and Manasseh, Rachel is regarded as the mother of the whole
ten. This passage is quoted by Matthew (marginal reference) as a type.
In Jeremiah it is a poetical figure representing in a dramatic form the
miserable condition of the kingdom of Ephraim devastated by the sword of
the Assyrians.

[Jer 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#016.md)

Rachel's work had been that of bearing and bringing up children, and by
their death she was deprived of the joy for which she had labored: but
by their being restored to her she will receive her wages.

[Jer 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#017.md)

In thine end - i. e., for thy time to come (see the [Jer
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011) note.md).

[Jer 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md)

As a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke - literally, like an untaught
calf. Compare the [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md) note.
Ephraim, like an untrained steer, had resisted Yahweh's will.

[Jer 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md)

After that I was turned - i. e., after I had turned away from Thee. In
[Jer 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md) it has the sense of turning
to God.

Instructed - Brought to my senses by suffering. The smiting upon the
thigh is a sign of sorrow. Compare [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017.md).

The reproach of my youth - i. e., the shame brought upon me by sins of
my youth.

[Jer 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md)

Moved to compassion by Ephraim's lamentation, Yahweh shows Himself as
tender and ready to forgive as parents are their spoiled (rather,
darling) child.

For ... him - Or, "that so often as I speak concerning him," i. e., his
punishment.

My bowels are troubled - The metaphor expresses the most tender internal
emotion.

[Jer 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021.md)

Waymarks - See [Kg2 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#017.md) note.

High heaps - Or, signposts, pillars to point out the way.

Set thine heart - Not set thy affection, but turn thy thoughts and
attention (in Hebrew the heart is the seat of the intellect) to the
highway, even the way by which thou wentest.

[Jer 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022.md)

Israel instead of setting itself to return hesitates, and goes here and
there in a restless mood. To encourage it God gives the sign following.

A woman shall compass a man - i. e., the female shall protect the strong
man; the weaker nature that needs help will surround the stronger with
loving and fostering care. This expresses a new relation of Israel to
the Lord, a new covenant, which the Lord will make with His people ([Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031) following.md). The fathers saw in
these words a prophecy of the miraculous conception of our Lord by the
Virgin.

[Jeremiah 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 31:23</span></span>

As yet - Or, Again, once move. The prophet now turns to Judah. By the
mountain of holiness is meant not the temple only, but all Jerusalem, of
which the temple was the most sacred spot, and that by which all the
rest was made holy.

[Jeremiah 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 31:24</span></span>

Go forth - "Go about." Judah shall have its settled population and fixed
abodes; and shepherds shall move about with their flocks, wherever
pasture is to be found.

[Jeremiah 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 31:25</span></span>

Sorrowful - Or, languishing [Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012.md).

[Jeremiah 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 31:26</span></span>

The prophet, seeming to himself to awake and look up in the midst of his
sleep (whether ecstatic or not we cannot tell), rejoiced in a revelation
so entirely consolatory, and unlike his usual message of woe.

[Jeremiah 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 31:27</span></span>

The prophet shows that the happiness of Israel and Judah, united in one
prosperous nation, will rest upon the consciousness that their
chastisement has been the result of sins which they have themselves
committed, and that God's covenant depends not upon external sanctions,
but upon a renewed heart.

[Jer 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027.md)

So rapid shall be the increase that it shall seem as if children and
young cattle sprang up out of the ground.

[Jer 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md), [Jer
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#030.md)

A sour grape - Better, sour grapes. The idea that Jeremiah and Ezekiel
(marginal reference) modified the terms of the second Commandment arises
from a mistaken exegesis of their words. Compare [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018.md); [Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md). The obdurate Jews made it a
reproach to the divine justice that the nation was to be sorely visited
for Manasseh's sin. But this was only because generation after
generation had, instead of repenting, repeated the sins of that evil
time, and even in a worse form. justice must at length have its course.
The acknowledgment that each man died for his own iniquity was a sign of
their return to a more just and right state of feeling.

[Jer 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md)

A time is foretold which shall be to the nation as marked an epoch as
was the Exodus. God at Sinai made a covenant with His people, of which
the sanctions were material, or (where spiritual) materially understood.
Necessarily therefore the Mosaic Church was temporary, but the sanctions
of Jeremiah's Church are spiritual - written in the heart - and
therefore it must take the place of the former covenant [Heb
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md), and must last forever. The
prophecy was fulfilled when those Jews who accepted Jesus of Nazareth as
the Messiah, expanded the Jewish into the Christian Church.

[Jer 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md)

Although ... - i. e., although as their husband (or, "lord" (Baal,
compare [Hos 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016)).md) I had lawful
authority over them. The translation in [Heb
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009.md) agrees with the Septuagint here,
but the balance of authority is in favor of the King James Version.

[Jer 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md)

The old law could be broken [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md); to remedy this God gives, not a
new law, but a new power to the old law. It used to be a mere code of
morals, external to man, and obeyed as a duty. In Christianity, it
becomes an inner force, shaping man's character from within.

[Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md)

I will forgive their iniquity - The foundation of the new covenant is
the free forgiveness of sins (compare [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md). It is the sense of this full
unmerited love which so affects the heart as to make obedience
henceforward an inner necessity.

[Jeremiah 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 31:35</span></span>

Divideth ... - Rather, stirreth up the sea so that its waves roar.

[Jeremiah 31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 31:36</span></span>

If those - If these. From the uniformity of God's operations in the
material world, the prophet deduces the certainty of a similar
uniformity in God's dealings with man in things spiritual.

A nation - A people. Israel has long ceased to be a nation, but it still
exists as a numerous, influential, and distinct people. In [Mat
28:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md) Jeremiah's prophecy receives
its Christian application, and Israel becomes the Church, with the
promise of perpetual existence. It has no national existence, but its
members ought to be a strongly marked people, refusing to be merged in
the world, while everywhere they pervade and influence it.

[Jeremiah 31:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 31:37</span></span>

All the seed - Unworthy members of Israel may be cast away, but the race
shall never entirely cease to exist.

[Jeremiah 31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 31:38</span></span>

To the Lord - Or, for Yahweh: for His dwelling in the hearts of a people
prepared to be His temple.

[Jeremiah 31:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 31:39</span></span>

Over ... Gareb - Or, straight along the hill Gareb. Probably the hill of
lepers, outside the old walls, toward the southwest.

Goath - Goah. Unknown.

[Jeremiah 31:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 31:40</span></span>

The whole valley of the dead bodies - Probably some part of the Valley
of Ben-Hinnom. Comparing [Zac 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md), the
conclusion seems evident that Jeremiah's words are to be spiritually
understood. His city is one that renders holy unto Yahweh what was
before unclean. Compare John's new Jerusalem [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md).
