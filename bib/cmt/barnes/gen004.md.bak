\- Section IV - The Family of Adam

\- Cain and Abel

1\. קין qayı̂n, Qain (Cain), "spear-shaft," and קנה qānah, "set up,
establish, gain, buy," contain the biliteral root קן qan, "set up,
erect, gain." The relations of root words are not confined to the narrow
rules of our common etymology, but really extend to such instinctive
usages as the unlettered speaker will invent or employ. A full
examination of the Hebrew tongue leads to the conclusion that a
biliteral root lies at the base of many of those triliterals that
consist of two firm consonants and a third weaker one varying in itself
and its position. Thus, יטב yāṭab and טיב ṭôb. So קין qayı̂n and קנה
qānah grow from one root.

2\. הבל hebel, Habel (Abel), "breath, vapor."

3\. מנחה mı̂nchâh, "gift, offering, tribute." In contrast with זבח
zebach, it means a "bloodless offering".

7\. חטאת chaṭā't, "sin, sin-penalty, sin-offering." רבץ rābats, "lie,
couch as an animal."

16\. נוד nôd, Nod, "flight, exile; related: flee."

This chapter is a continuation of the second document. Yet it is
distinguished from the previous part of it by the use of the name Yahweh
alone, and, in one instance, אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym alone, to designate the
Supreme Being. This is sufficient to show that distinct pieces of
composition are included within these documents. In the creation week
and in the judgment, God has proved himself an originator of being and a
keeper of his word, and, therefore, the significant personal name Yahweh
is ready on the lips of Eve and from the pen of the writer. The history
of fallen man now proceeds. The first family comes under our notice.

[Gen 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md)

In this verse the first husband and wife become father and mother. This
new relation must be deeply interesting to both, but at first especially
so to the mother. Now was begun the fulfillment of all the intimations
she had received concerning her seed. She was to have conception and
sorrow multiplied. But she was to be the mother of all living. And her
seed was to bruise the serpent's head. All these recollections added
much to the intrinsic interest of becoming a mother. Her feelings are
manifested in the name given to her son and the reason assigned for it.
She "bare Cain and said, I have gained a man from Yahweh." Cain occurs
only once as a common noun, and is rendered by the Septuagint δόρυ doru,
"spear-shaft." The primitive meaning of the root is to set up, or to
erect, as a cane, a word which comes from the root; then it means to
create, make one's own, and is applied to the Creator [Gen
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019.md) or the parent [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md). Hence, the word here seems to
denote a thing gained or achieved, a figurative expression for a child
born. The gaining or bearing of the child is therefore evidently the
prominent thought in Eve's mind, as she takes the child's name from
this. This serves to explain the sentence assigning the reason for the
name. If the meaning had been, "I have gained a man, namely, Yahweh,"
then the child would have been called Yahweh. If Jehovah had even been
the emphatic word, the name would have been a compound of Yahweh, and
either אישׁ 'ı̂ysh, "man," or קנה qı̂nâh, "qain," such as Ishiah or
Coniah. But the name Cain proves קניתי qānı̂ytı̂y, "I have gained" to be
the emphatic word, and therefore the sentence is to be rendered "I have
gained (borne) a man (with the assistance) of Yahweh."

The word "man" probably intimates that Eve fully expected her son to
grow to the stature and maturity of her husband. If she had daughters
before, and saw them growing up to maturity, this would explain her
expectation, and at the same time give a new significance and emphasis
to her exclamation, "I have gained a man (heretofore only women) from
Yahweh." It would heighten her ecstasy still more if she expected this
to be the very seed that should bruise the serpent's head.

Eve is under the influence of pious feelings. She has faith in God, and
acknowledges him to be the author of the precious gift she has received.
Prompted by her grateful emotion, she confesses her faith, She also
employs a new and near name to designate her maker. In the dialogue with
the tempter she had used the word God אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym. But now she adopts
Yahweh. In this one word she hides a treasure of comfort. "He is true to
his promise. He has not forgotten me. He is with me now again. He will
never leave me nor forsake me. He will give me the victory." And who can
blame her if she verily expected that this would be the promised
deliverer who should bruise the serpent's head?

[Gen 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002.md)

His brother Habel. - Habel means "breath, vanity." Does a sense of the
vanity of earthly things grow in the minds of our first parents? Has the
mother found her sorrow multiplied? Has she had many daughters between
these sons? Is there something delicate and fragile in the appearance of
Habel? Has Cain disappointed a mother's hopes? Some of all these
thoughts may have prompted the name. There is something remarkable in
the phrase "his brother Habel." It evidently points with touching
simplicity to the coming outrage that was to destroy the peace and
purity of the first home.

The two primitive employments of men were the agricultural and the
pastoral. Here is the second allusion to some use which was made of
animals soon after the fall. Coats of skin were provided for the first
pair; and now we have Habel keeping sheep. In the garden of Eden, where
the tree of life was accessible, an exclusively vegetable diet was
designed for man. Whether this continued after the fall, we are not
informed. It is certain that man had dominion over the whole animal
kingdom. It can scarcely be doubted that the outer coverings of animals
were used for clothing. Animals are presently to be employed for
sacrifice. It is not beyond the bounds of probability that animal food
may have been used before the flood, as a partial compensation for the
desire of the tree of life, which may have been suited to supply all the
defects of vegetable and even animal fare in sustaining the human frame
in its primeval vigor.

Man in his primitive state, then, was not a mere gatherer of acorns, a
hunter, or a nomad. He began with horticulture, the highest form of
rural life. After the fall he descended to the culture of the field and
the tending of cattle; but still he had a home, and a settled mode of
living. It is only by a third step that he degenerates to the wandering
and barbarous state of existence. And only by the predominance of might
over right, the selfish lust of power, and the clever combinations of
rampant ambition, comes that form of society in which the highest state
of barbaric civilization and the lowest depth of bondage and misery
meet.

[Gen 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003.md)

At the end of days. - This may denote the end of the week, of the year,
or of some longer period. The season of the year was probably the
ingathering, when the fruits of the earth and the firstlings of the
flock would come in, and when it was not unnatural for the first family
to celebrate with a subdued thankfulness the anniversary of their
creation. And the present occasion seems to have been the time when Cain
and Habel, have arrived at the years of discretion and self-dependence,
solemnly come forward with their first voluntary offerings to the Lord.
Hitherto they may have come under their parents, who were then the
actual offerers. Now they come on their own account.

Here, accordingly, we ascend from the secular to the eternal. We find a
church in the primeval family. If Cain and Habel offer to God, we may
imagine it was the habit of their parents, and has descended to them
with all the sanction of parental example. But we may not venture to
affirm this in all its extent. Parental example they no doubt had, in
some respects; but whether Adam and Eve had yet ascended so far from the
valley of repentance and humiliation as to make bold to offer anything
to the Lord, admits of question. Right feeling in the first offenders
would make the confidence of faith very slow of growth. It is even more
natural for their children, being one remove from the actual
transgressors, to make the first essay to approach God with an offering.

Cain brings of the fruits of the soil. We cannot say this was the mere
utterance of nature giving thanks to the Creator for his benefits, and
acknowledging that all comes from him, and all is due to him. History,
parental instruction, and possibly example, were also here to give
significance to the act. The offering is also made to Yahweh, the author
of nature, of revelation, and now, in man's fallen state, of grace.
There is no intimation in this verse of the state of Cain's feelings
toward God. And there is only a possible hint, in the "coats of skin,"
in regard to the outward form of offering that would be acceptable. We
must not anticipate the result.

[Gen 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)

And Habel brought. - Habel's offering differs from that of his brother
in outward form. It consists of the firstlings of his flock. These were
slain; for their fat is offered. Blood was therefore shed, and life
taken away. To us who are accustomed to partake of animal food, there
may appear nothing strange here. We may suppose that each brother
offered what came to hand out of the produce of his own industry. But
let us ascend to that primeval time when the fruit tree and the herb
bearing seed were alone assigned to man for food, and we must feel that
there is something new here. Still let us wait for the result.

And the Lord had respect unto Habel and his offering, - but not unto
Cain. We have now the simple facts before us. Let us hear the inspired
comment: "Πίστελ pistei, 'by faith' Abel offered unto God πλείονα Θυσίαν
pleiona thusian, 'a more excellent sacrifice' than Cain" [Heb
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md). There was, then, clearly an
internal moral distinction in the intention or disposition of the
offerers. Habel had faith - that confiding in God which is not bare and
cold, but is accompanied with confession of sin, and a sense of
gratitude for his mercy, and followed by obedience to his will. Cain had
not this faith. He may have had a faith in the existence, power, and
bounty of God; but it wanted that penitent returning to God, that humble
acceptance of his mercy, and submission to his will, which constitute
true faith. It must be admitted the faith of the offerer is essential to
the acceptableness of the offering, even though other things were equal.

However, in this case, there is a difference in the things offered. The
one is a vegetable offering, the other an animal; the one a presentation
of things without life, the other a sacrifice of life. Hence, the latter
is called πλείων θυσία pleiōn thusia; there is "more in it" than in the
former. The two offerings are therefore expressive of the different
kinds of faith in the offerers. They are the excogitation and exhibition
in outward symbol of the faith of each. The fruit of the soil offered to
God is an acknowledgment that the means of this earthly life are due to
him. This expresses the barren faith of Cain, but not the living faith
of Habel. The latter has entered deeply into the thought that life
itself is forfeited to God by transgression, and that only by an act of
mercy can the Author of life restore it to the penitent, trusting,
submissive, loving heart. He has pondered on the intimations of
relenting mercy and love that have come from the Lord to the fallen
race, and cast himself upon them without reserve. He slays the animal of
which he is the lawful owner, as a victim, thereby acknowledging that
his life is due for sin; he offers the life of the animal, not as though
it were of equal value with his own, but in token that another life,
equivalent to his own, is due to justice if he is to go free by the as
yet inscrutable mercy of God.

Such a thought as this is fairly deducible from the facts on the surface
of our record. It seems necessary in order to account for the first
slaying of an animal under an economy where vegetable diet was alone
permitted. We may go further. It is hard to suppose the slaying of an
animal acceptable, if not previously allowed. The coats of skin seem to
involve a practical allowance of the killing of animals for certain
purposes. Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that there was more in the
animal than in the vegetable offering, and that more essential to the
full expression of a right faith in the mercy of God, without borrowing
the light of future revelation. Hence, the nature of Habel's sacrifice
was the index of the genuineness of his faith. And the Lord had respect
unto him and his offering; thereby intimating that his heart was right,
and his offering suitable to the expression of his feelings. This
finding is also in keeping with the manner of Scripture, which takes the
outward act as the simple and spontaneous exponent of the inward
feeling. The mode of testifying his respect to Habel was by consuming
his offering with fire, or some other way equally open to observation.

And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. - A feeling of
resentment, and a sense of disgrace and condemnation take possession of
Cain's breast. There is no spirit of inquiry, self-examination, prayer
to God for light, or pardon. This shows that Cain was far from being in
a right frame of mind.

[Gen 4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#006.md)

Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? - The Lord does
not yet give up Cain. In great mercy he expostulates with him. He puts a
question which implies that there is no just cause for his present
feelings. Neither anger at his brother, because his offering has been
accepted, nor vexation in himself, because his own has not, is a right
feeling in the presence of the just and merciful God, who searches the
heart. Submission, self-examination, and amendment of what has been
wrong in his approach to God, alone benefit the occaslon. To this,
accordingly, the Lord directs his attention in the next sentence.

If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted? - To do well is to retrace
his steps, to consider his ways, and find out wherein he has been wrong,
and to amend his offering and his intention accordingly. He has not duly
considered the relation in which he stands to God as a guilty sinner,
whose life is forfeited, and to whom the hand of mercy is held out; and
accordingly he has not felt this in offering, or given expression to it
in the nature of his offering. Yet, the Lord does not immediately reject
him, but with longsuffering patience directs his attention to this, that
it may be amended. And on making such amendment, he holds out to him the
clear and certain hope of acceptance still. But he does more than this.
As Cain seems to have been of a particularly hard and unheedful
disposition, he completes his expostulation, and deepens its awful
solemnity, by stating the other alternative, both in its condition and
consequence.

And if thou do not well, at the door is sin lying. - Sin past, in its
unrequited and unacknowledged guilt; sin present, in its dark and
stubborn passion and despair; but, above all, sin future, as the growing
habit of a soul that persists in an evil temper, and therefore must add
iniquity unto iniquity, is awaiting thee at the door, as a crouching
slave the bidding of his master. As one lie borrows an endless train of
others to keep up a vain appearance of consistency, so one sin if not
repented of and forsaken involves the dire necessity of plunging deeper
and deeper into the gulf of depravity and retribution. This dread
warning to Cain, expressed in the mildest and plainest terms, is a
standing lesson written for the learning of all mankind. Let him who is
in the wrong retract at once, and return to God with humble
acknowledgment of his own guilt, and unreserved submission to the mercy
of his Maker; for to him who perseveres in sin there can be no hope or
help. Another sentence is added to give intensity to the warning.

And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. - This
sentence has all the pithiness and familiarity of a proverb. It has been
employed before, to describe part of the tribulation the woman brought
upon herself by disobedience, namely, the forced subjection of her will
to that of her husband in the fallen state of humanity [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md). It is accordingly expressive of
the condition of a slave under the hard bondage and arbitrary caprice of
a master and a tyrant. Cain is evidently the master. The question is,
Who is the slave? To whom do the pronouns "his" and "him" refer?
Manifestly, either to sin or to Habel. If to sin, then the meaning of
the sentence is, the desire, the entire submission and service of sin
will be yielded to thee, and thou wilt in fact make thyself master of
it. Thy case will be no longer a heedless ignorance, and consequent
dereliction of duty, but a willful overmastering of all that comes by
sin, and an unavoidable going on from sin to sin, from inward to outward
sin, or, in specific terms, from wrath to murder, and from
disappointment to defiance, and so from unrighteousness to ungodliness.
This is an awful picture of his fatal end, if he do not instantly
retreat. But it is necessary to deal plainly with this dogged,
vindictive spirit, if by any means he may be brought to a right mind.

If the pronouns are referred to Habel, the meaning will come to much the
same thing. The desire, the forced compliance, of thy brother will be
yielded unto thee, and thou wilt rule over him with a rigor and a
violence that will terminate in his murder. In violating the image of
God by shedding the blood of thy brother, thou wilt be defying thy
Maker, and fiercely rushing on to thy own perdition. Thus, in either
case, the dark doom of sin unforsaken and unremitted looms fearfully in
the distance.

The general reference to sin, however, seems to be the milder and more
soothing form of expostulation. The special reference to Habel might
only exasperate. It appears, moreover, to be far-fetched, as there is no
allusion to his brother in the previous part of the address. The
boldness of the figure by which Cain is represented as making himself
master of sin, when he with reckless hand grasps at all that comes by
sin, is not unfamiliar to Scripture. Thus, the doer of wickedness is
described as the master of it [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md). On these grounds we prefer the
reference to sin, and the interpretation founded on it.

There are two other expositions of this difficult sentence which deserve
to be noticed. First. "And as to thy brother, unto thee shall be his
desire, and thou shalt rule over him with all the right of the first
born." But (1) the reference to his brother is remote; (2) the rights of
primogeniture are perhaps not yet established; (3) the words do not
express a right, but an exercise of might against right arising in a
fallen state [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016); (4.md) the Judge
of all the earth is not accustomed to guarantee the prerogatives of
birth to one who is in positive rebellion against him, but, on the other
hand, he withdraws them from the unworthy to confer them on whom he
will. For these reasons we conceive this exposition is to be rejected.
Second. "And unto thee shall be sin's desire; but thou shalt overcome
it." But (1) the parallelism between the two members of the sentence is
here neglected; (2) a different meaning is assigned to the words here
and in [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016),, (3.md) the connection
between the sentence thus explained and what goes before is not clear;
(4) the lesson taught is not obvious; and (5) the assurance given is not
fulfilled. On these grounds we cannot adopt this explanation.

The above address of the Lord to Cain, expressed here perhaps only in
its substance, is fraught with the most powerful motives that can bear
on the mind of man. It holds out acceptance to the wrong-doer, if he
will come with a broken heart and a corresponding expression of
repentance before God, in the full faith that he can and will secure the
ends of justice so that he can have mercy on the penitent. At the same
time it points out, with all clearness and faithfulness to a soul yet
unpractised in the depths of iniquity, the insidious nature of sin, the
proneness of a selfish heart to sin with a high hand, the tendency of
one sinful temper, if persisted in, to engender a growing habit of
aggravated crime which ends in the everlasting destruction of the soul.
Nothing more than this can be done by argument or reason for the warning
of a wrong-doer. From the mouth of the Almighty these words must have
come with all the evidence and force they were capable of receiving.

[Gen 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008.md)

And Cain talked with Abel his brother. - Cain did not act on the divine
counsel. He did not amend his offering to God, either in point of
internal feeling or external form. Though one speak to him from heaven
he will not hear. He conversed with Habel his brother. The topic is not
stated. The Septuagint supplies the words, "Let us go into the field."
If in walking side by side with his brother he touched upon the divine
communication, the conference did not lead to any better results. If the
divine expostulation failed, much more the human. Perhaps it only
increased his irritation. When they were in the field, and therefore out
of view, he rose up against his brother and killed him. The deed is done
that cannot be recalled. The motives to it were various. Selfishness,
wounded pride, jealousy, and a guilty conscience were all at work [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md). Here, then, is sin following
upon sin, proving the truth of the warning given in the merciful
forbearance of God.

[Gen 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009.md)

Where is Habel thy brother? - The interrogatory here reminds us of the
question put to the hiding Adam, "Where art thou?" It is calculated to
strike the conscience. The reply is different from that of Adam. The sin
has now advanced from hasty, incautious yielding to the tempter, to
reiterated and deliberate disobedience. Such a sinner must take
different ground. Cain, therefore, attempts to parry the question,
apparently on the vain supposition that no eye, not even that of the
All-seeing, was present to witness the deed. "I know not." In the
madness of his confusion he goes further. He disputes the right of the
Almighty to make the demand. "Am I my brother's keeper?" There is, as
usual, an atom of truth mingled with the amazing falsehood of this surly
response. No man is the absolute keeper of his brother, so as to be
responsible for his safety when he is not present. This is what Cain
means to insinuate. But every man is his brother's keeper so far that he
is not himself to lay the hand of violence on him, nor suffer another to
do so if he can hinder it. This sort of keeping the Almighty has a right
to demand of every one - the first part of it on the ground of mere
justice, the second on that of love. But Cain's reply betrays a
desperate resort to falsehood, a total estrangement of feeling, a
quenching of brotherly love, a predominence of that selfishness which
freezes affection and kindles hatred. This is the way of Cain [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md).

[Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md)

What hast thou done? - The Lord now charges him with his guilt: "The
voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the soil." In the
providence of God blood has a voice crying to him to which he cannot but
give heed. It is vain, then, to attempt concealment.

[Gen 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011.md)

The curse ([Gen 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025), note.md) which now
fell on Cain was in some sense retributive, as it sprang from the soil
which had received his brother's blood. The particulars of it are the
withdrawal of the full strength or fruitfulness of the soil from him,
and the degradation from the state of a settled dweller in the presence
of God to that of a vagabond in the earth. He was to be banished to a
less productive part of the earth, removed from the presence of God and
the society of his father and mother, and abandoned to a life of
wandering and uncertainty. The sentence of death had been already
pronounced upon man.

[Gen 4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013.md)

My iniquity is more than I can bear. - To bear iniquity is in Hebrew
phrase to undergo the punishment of it. And the prospect of this, as it
presents itself to the eyes of Cain, is so appalling that he shrinks
from it as intolerable. To be driven from the face of the soil,
inhabited by the other surviving members of the human family, to an
unknown and therefore terrible region; to be hidden from the face of
God, who manifested himself still to the race of Adam in their present
abode; to be a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth, far away from the
land of his birth; and to be liable to be slain in just revenge by
anyone who should find him - such is the hard fate he sees before him.
It is dark enough in itself, and no doubt darker still in the
exaggeration which an accusing conscience conjures up to his
imagination. The phrase, "every one finding me," implies that the family
of Adam had now become numerous. Not only sons and daughters, but their
children and grandchildren may have been growing up when Cain was sent
into exile. But in his present terror even an excited fancy suggested an
enemy at every turn.

[Gen 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015.md)

The reply of the Lord is suited to quell the troubled breast of Cain.
"Therefore." Because thy fears of what thou deservest go beyond what it
is my purpose to permit, I give thee assurance of freedom from personal
violence. "To be avenged seven-fold" is to be avenged fully. Cain will
no doubt receive even-handed justice from the Almighty. The assurance
given to Cain is a sign, the nature of which is not further specified.

This passage unfolds to us a mode of dealing with the first murderer
which is at first sight somewhat difficult to be understood. But we are
to bear in mind that the sentence of death had been already pronounced
upon man, and therefore stood over Adam and all his posterity, Cain
among the rest. To pronounce the same sentence therefore upon him for a
new crime, would have been weak and unmeaning. Besides, the great crime
of crimes was disobedience to the divine will; and any particular form
of crime added to that was comparatively unimportant. Wrong done to a
creature, even of the deepest dye, was not to be compared in point of
guilt with wrong done to the Creator. The grave element in the
criminality of every social wrong is its practical disregard of the
authority of the Most High. Moreover, every other sin to the end of time
is but the development of that first act of disobedience to the mandate
of heaven by which man fell; and accordingly every penalty is summed up
in that death which is the judicial consequence of the first act of
rebellion against heaven.

We are also to bear in mind that God still held the sword of justice in
his own immediate hands, and had not delegated his authority to any
human tribunal. No man was therefore clothed with any right from heaven
to call Cain to account for the crime he had committed. To fall upon him
with the high hand in a willful act of private revenge, would be taking
the law into one's own hands, and therefore a misdemeanor against the
majesty of heaven, which the Judge of all could not allow to pass
unpunished. It is plain that no man has an inherent right to inflict the
sanction of a broken law on the transgressor. This right originally
belongs to the Creator, and derivatively only to those whom he has
intrusted with the dispensation of civil government according to
established laws.

Cain's offences were great and aggravated. But let us not exaggerate
them. He was first of all defective in the character of his faith and
the form of his sacrifice. His carnal mind came out still more in the
wrath and vexation he felt when his defective offering was not accepted.
Though the Almighty condescends now to plead with him and warn him
against persisting in impenitent silence and discontent, lest he should
thereby only become more deeply involved in sin, does not retreat, but,
on the contrary, proceeds to slay his brother, in a fit of jealousy;
and, lastly, he rudely and falsely denies all knowledge of him, and all
obligation to be his protector. Notwithstanding all this, it is still to
be remembered that the sentence of death from heaven already hung over
him. This was in the merciful order of things comparatively slow of
execution in its full extent, but at the same time absolutely certain in
the end. The aggravation of the first crime of man by the sins of
self-will, sullenness, envy, fratricide, and defiant falsehood, was but
the natural fruit of that beginning of disobedience. It is accordingly
visited by additional tokens of the divine displeasure, which manifest
themselves in this life, and are mercifully calculated to warn Cain
still further to repent.

Cain's guilt seems now to have been brought home in some measure to his
conscience; and he not only stands aghast at the sentence of banishment
from the divine presence, but instinctively trembles, lest, upon the
principle of retributive justice, whoever meets him may smite him to the
death, as he had done his brother. The longsuffering of God, however,
interferes to prevent such a catastrophe, and even takes steps to
relieve the trembling culprit from the apprehension of a violent death.
This leads us to understand that God, having formed a purpose of mercy
toward the human family, was sedulously bent upon exercising it even
toward the murderer of a brother. Hence, he does not punish his repeated
crimes by "immediate death," which would have defeated his design of
giving him a long day of grace and opportunity to reflect, repent,
return to God, and even yet offer in faith a typical atonement by blood
for his sin. Thus, the prohibition to slay him is sanctioned by a
seven-fold, that is, an ample and complete vengeance, and a sign of
protection mercifully vouchsafed to him. The whole dealing of the
Almighty was calculated to have a softening, conscience-awakening, and
hope-inspiring effect on the murderer's heart.

[Gen 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016.md)

The presence of the Lord - seems to have been at the entrance of the
garden where the cherubim were stationed. There, probably, the children
of men still lingered in faith and hope before the Lord, whom they still
regarded as their Maker and merciful Saviour. They acknowledged his
undeserved goodness in the form of sacrifice. The retreat of Cain from
the scene of parental affection, of home associations, and of divine
manifestation, must have been accompanied with many a deep, unuttered
pang of regret and remorse. But he has deeply and repeatedly
transgressed, and he must bear the consequence. Such is sin. Many a
similar deed of cruelty and bloodshed might the sacred writer have
recorded in the later history of man. But it is the manner of Scripture
to note the first example, and then to pass over in silence its
subsequent repetitions, unless when a particular transaction has an
important bearing on the ways of God with man.

\- XIX. The Line of Cain

17\. חניך chenôk, Chanok, "initiation, instruction."

18\. עירד ‛ı̂yrād, 'Irad, "fleet as the wild ass, citizen." מחוּיאל
mechûya'el, Mechujael, "smitten of 'El, or life of 'El." מתוּשׁאל
metûshā'ēl, Methushael, "man of 'El, or man asked." למך lāmek, Lemek,
"man of prayer, youth."

19\. עדה 'ādâh, 'Adah, "beauty." צלה tsı̂lâh, Tsillah, "shade or
tinkling."

20\. יבל yābāl, Jabal, "stream, leader of cattle, produce, the walker or
wanderer." אהל 'ohel plural: אהלים 'ohālı̂ym for אהלים 'ăhālı̂ym "tent,

constituted the original booth," סכה sŭkâh.

21\. יוּבל yûbāl, Jubal, "player on an instrument?"

22\. תוּבל־קין tûbal-qayı̂n, Tubal-qain, "brass-smith?" The scion or son
of the lance. &lt;נעמה na‛ămâh, Na'amah, "pleasant, lovely."

Mankind is now formally divided into two branches - those who still
abide in the presence of God, and those who have fled to a distance from
him. Distinguishing names will soon be given to these according to their
outward profession and practice [Gen
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md). The awful distinction according
to the inward state of the feelings has been already given in the terms,
the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.

[Gen 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017.md)

Cain is not unaccompanied in his banishment. A wife, at least, is the
partner of his exile. And soon a son is born to him. He was building a
city at the time of this birth. The city is a keep or fort, enclosed
with a wall for the defense of all who dwell within. The building of the
city is the erection of this wall or barricade. Here we find the motive
of fear and self-defense still ruling Cain. His hand has been imbrued in
a brother's blood, and he expects every man's hand will be against him.

He calls his son Henok (Enoch), and his city after the name of his son.
The same word is employed as a name in the lines of Seth [Gen
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#018.md), of Midian [Gen
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#004.md), and of Reuben [Gen
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#009.md). It signifies dedication or
initiation, and, in the present case, seems to indicate a new beginning
of social existence, or a consciousness of initiative or inventive
power, which necessity and self-reliance called forth particularly in
himself and his family. It appears, from the flocks kept by Habel, the
fear of persons meeting and slaying the murderer, the marriage and
family of Cain, and the beginning of a city, that a considerble time had
elapsed since the fall. The wife of Cain was of necessity his sister,
though this was forbidden in after times, for wise and holy reasons,
when the necessity no longer existed.

[Gen 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#018.md)

The names in this verse seem to denote, respectively, fleet as a wild
ass, stricken by God, man of prayer, and youth. They indicate a mingling
of thoughts and motives in men's minds, in which the word אל 'el
"mighty" as a name of God occurs. This name is a common noun, signifying
hero or potentate, and also power or might, and is transferred to God as
"the Potentate," or "Almighty One." It is distinguished from אלהים
'ĕlohı̂ym "God," since they are put in apposition [Jos
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022.md); and seems to be properly an
epithet applied to God by way of pre-eminence. The denomination,
"stricken of the Mighty," is a recognition of the divine power. "The man
of prayer," or "asking," may also have reference to an act of worship.
Among these higher thoughts we also find a value put upon youth and
physical superiority, as the fleetness of the wild ass. This is all we
can learn from these imperfectly understood names.

[Gen 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#019.md)

This is the first record and probably the first instance of polygamy.
The names of the two wives, Adah, "beauty," and Zillah, "shade or
tinkling," seem to refer to the charms which attracted Lamek.
Superabundance of wealth and power perhaps led Lamek to multiply wives.

[Gen 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#020.md) is the first notice of the
tent and of cattle. The tent was the thin shining and shading canvas of
goats' hair, which was placed over the poles or timbers that constituted
the original booth. In process of time it would supplant the branches
and foliage of the booth as a covering from the sun or the wind. The
cattle are designated by a word denoting property, as being chattels
personal, and consisting chiefly of sheep and oxen. The idea of property
had now been practically realized. The Cainites were now prosperous and
numerous, and therefore released from that suspicious fear which
originated the fortified keep of their progenitor. The sons of Jabal
rove over the common with their tents and cattle, undismayed by
imaginary terrors.

[Gen 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#021.md)

Here is the invention of musical instruments in their two leading
varieties, the harp and the pipe. This implies the previous taste for
music and song. It seems not unlikely that Zillah, the mother of Jubal,
was a daughter of song. The fine arts follow in the train of the useful.
All this indicates the easy circumstances in which the Cainites now
found themselves.

[Gen 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022.md)

The three names Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal are formed from root signifying
to "flow, run, go forth," perhaps "blow," from which comes יובל yôbēl
the "blast" or trumpet-note of joy and release. Accordingly, all sorts
of going forth, that were suitable to the life of a nomad, seem to have
distinguished this family. The addition of Cain to the name of Tubal may
have been a memorial of his ancestor, or an indication of his pursuit.
Tubal of the spear or lance may have been his familiar designation. The
making of tents implies some skill in carpentry, and also in spinning
and weaving. The working in brass and iron furnishes implements for war,
hunting, or husbandry. The construction of musical instruments shows
considerable refinement in carving and moulding wood. Naamah, the
lovely, seems to be mentioned on account of her personal charms.

[Gen 4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md)

In this fragment of ancient song, we have Lamek, under the strong
excitement of having slain a man in self-defense, reciting to his wives
the deed, and at the same time comforting them and himself with the
assurance that if Cain the murderer would be avenegd sevenfold, he the
manslayer in self-defense would be avenged seventy and seven-fold. This
short ode has all the characteristics of the most perfect Hebrew poetry.
Every pair of lines is a specimen of the Hebrew parallelism or rhythm of
sentiment and style. They all belong to the synthetic, synonymous, or
cognate parallel, the second member reiterating with emphasis the first.
Here we observe that Lamek was a poet; one of his wives was probably a
songstress, and the other had a taste for ornament. One daughter was the
lovely, and three sons were the inventors of most of the arts which
sustain and embellish life. This completes the picture of this
remarkable family.

It has been noticed that the inventive powers were more largely
developed in the line of Cain than in that of Sheth. And it has been
suggested that the worldly character of the Cainites accounts for this.
The Shethites contemplated the higher things of God, and therefore paid
less attention to the practical arts of life. The Cainites, on the other
hand, had not God in their thoughts, and therefore gave the more heed to
the requisites and comforts of the present life.

But besides this the Cainites, penetrating into the unknown tracts of
this vast common, were compelled by circumstances to turn their thoughts
to the invention of the arts by which the hardships of their condition
might be abated. And as soon as they had conquered the chief
difficulties of their new situation, the habits of industry and mental
activity which they had acquired were turned to the embellishments of
life.

We have no grounds, however, for concluding that the descendants of Cain
were as yet entirely and exclusively ungodly on the one hand, or on the
other that the descendants of Sheth were altogether destitute of
inventive genius or inattentive to its cultivation. With the exception
of the assault that seemed to have provoked the homicidal act of Lamek,
and the bigamy of Lamek himself, we find not much to condemn in the
recorded conduct of the race of Cain; and in the names of some of them
we discover the remembrance and recognition of God. Habel had a keeper
of cattle before Jabal. The Cainites were also an older race than the
Shethites. And when Noah was commissioned to build the ark, we have no
reason to doubt that he was qualified in some measure by natural ability
and previous training for such a task.

The line of Cain is traced no further than the seventh generation from
Adam. We cannot tell whether there were any more in that line before the
flood. The design of tracing it thus far, is to point out the origin of
the arts of life, and the first instances of bigamy and homicide in
self-defense.

[Genesis 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 4:25</span></span>

\- XX. Sheth

25\. שׁת shēt, Sheth, "placed, put."

26\. אנישׁ 'enôsh, Enosh, "man, sickly." בשׁם קרא qero' beshēm means,
first, to call an object by its name [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md); [Isa
45:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003.md); second, to call an object by
the name of another, who is the parent, leader, husband, owner [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042.md); [Jdg
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029.md); [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md); [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md); [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md); [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md); third, to proclaim the name of
[Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md); [Exo
35:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#005.md); fourth, to call upon the name
of God, to address him by his proper name with an audible voice in the
form of prayer. This is the most common meaning of the phrase. In this
sense it is followed by Yahweh as the proper name of the true God among
the Hebrews. It is not to be forgotten that names were still
significant, at this early period.

This passage completes the account of Adam's family. Henceforth, we
generally meet with two parallel lines of narrative, as the human family
is divided into two great branches, with opposing interests and
tendencies. The main line refers to the remnant of the race that are on
terms of open reconciliation with God; while a collateral line notes as
far as necessary the state of those who have departed from the knowledge
and love of the true God.

[Gen 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md)

The narrative here reverts to a point subsequent to the death of Habel,
when another son is born to Adam, whom his mother Eve regards as a
substitute for Habel, and names Sheth in allusion to that circumstance.
She is in a sadder, humbler frame than when she named her first-born,
and therefore does not employ the personal name of the Lord. Yet her
heart is not so much downcast as when she called her second son a
breath. Her faith in God is sedate and pensive, and hence she uses the
more distant and general term אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym, God.

Yet there is a special significance in the form of expression she
employs. "For God" hath given me another seed instead of Habel. He is to
be instead of Habel, and God-fearing like Habel. Far above this
consideration, God hath given him. This son is from God. She regards him
as God's son. She receives this gift from God, and in faith expects him
to be the seed of God, the parent of a godly race. Her faith was not
disappointed. His descendants earn the name of the sons of God. As the
ungodly are called the seed of the serpent, because they are of his
spirit, so the godly are designated the seed of God, because they are of
God's Spirit. The Spirit of God strives and rules in them, and so they
are, in the graphic language of Scripture, the sons of God [Gen
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001.md).

[Gen 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026.md)

A son is born to Sheth also, whom he calls Enosh. In this name there is
probably an allusion to the meaning of sickliness and dependence which
belongs to the root. These qualities were now found to be characteristic
of man in his present state.

The closing sentence signalizes a remarkable event, which took place at
the birth of Enosh, about two hundred and forty years after the creation
of Adam. "Then was it begun to call upon the name of the Lord." The
solemn invocation of God by his proper name in audible and social prayer
and praise is the most usual meaning of the phrase now before us, and is
to be adopted unless there be something in the context or the
circumstances demanding another meaning. This involves also the first of
the meanings given above, as we call God by his name in oral worship. It
includes the third in one of its forms, as in praise we proclaim the
name of our God. And it leads to the second, as those who call on the
name of the Lord are themselves called the children of God.

Some change is here intimated in the mode of approaching God in worship.
The gist of the sentence, however, does not lie in the name "Yahweh".
For this term was not then new in itself, as it was used by Eve at the
birth of Cain; nor was it new in this connection, as the phrase now
appears for the first time, and Yahweh is the ordinary term employed in
it ever afterward to denote the true God. As a proper name, Yahweh is
the fit and customary word to enter into a solemn invocation. It is, as
we have seen, highly significant. It speaks of the Self-existent One,
the Author of all existing things, and in particular of man; the
Self-manifest, who has shown himself merciful and gracious to the
returning penitent, and with him keeps promise and covenant. Hence, it
is the custom itself of calling on the name of Yahweh, of addressing God
by his proper name, which is here said to have been commenced.

At first sight, with our habits and associations, it seems a very
strange thing that calling upon the name of the Lord should only begin
two hundred and forty years after the creation of man. But let us
endeavor to divest ourselves of these limitations, and rise to the
primeval simplicity of man's thoughts in regard to God. We read of God
speaking to man in paradise, but not of man speaking to God. In the
examination that preceded the sentence passed upon the transgressors, we
hear Adam and Eve replying to the questions of God, but not venturing to
open a conversation with the Most High. If the feeling of reverence and
solemn awe did not permit such a liberty before the fall, much more
would the super-added sense of guilt after that event restrain man from
making any advances toward the infinitely holy Being whom he had so
wantonly offended. The rebuking examination, the judicial sentence, and
the necessary execution of this sentence in its preliminary form, were
so prominent and impressive as to throw into the background any
intimations of the divine mercy with which they were accompanied. The
latter, however, were not unnoticed, or without a salutary effect on the
primeval pair. Adam believed the indications of mercy, whether in word
or deed, which God gave him. Faith was prompt and natural in that early
stage of comparative nearness to God, to his manifest presence and his
conspicuous wonders of creative power. It was also a native tendency of
the human breast, and would be so still, had we not become so
sophisticated by education that doubt has come to be the prominent
attitude of our minds. This faith of the first pair led to confession;
not directly, however, to God, but indirectly in the names Adam gave his
wife, and Eve her first-born son. Here humble, distant, self-condemning
faith solilloquizes, or, at most, the penitent pair converse in humble
hope about the mercy of the Most High.

The bringing of an offering to God was a step in advance of this
penitent, humble, submissive, self-accusing faith. It was the exact
counterpart and representation by a well-devised symbol of the nature of
the offerer's faith. It was therefore a confession of faith and certain
accompanying feelings toward God by a symbolic act. It was quite natural
that this mute sign should precede the actual address. The consequences,
however, of the approach of Cain and Habel were calculated to deepen
again the feeling of dread, and to strike the onlooker mute in the
presence of the High and Holy One. Still would this be so in that
infantile state of man when one thought would take full possession of
the soul, until another was plainly and directly brought before the
attention. In this simple, unsophisticated state of the penitent, we can
conceive him to resign himself passively to the merciful will of that
Maker whom he has grievously offended, without venturing to breathe a
wish or even to lift up a note of thanksgiving. Such mute acquiescence
in the divine will for two hundred and forty years was well-befitting
the humble penitents of that infantile age, standing in solemn awe under
a sense of their own demerit and of the infinite holiness of the Majesty
on high. There were even an eloquent pathos and power in that tacit
reverence suited to move the heart of the All-searching Spirit more than
ten thousand voices less deeply penetrated with a sense of the guilt of
sin and the beauty of holiness.

At length, however, Sheth was given to Eve, and accepted by her as a
substitute for Habel. Enosh, the child of sorrow, was born to him.
Collateral with this line of descent, and all the anxieties and desires
which it involved, was the growth of a class of men who were of the
spirit of Cain, and receded further and further from God. In these
circumstances of growing iniquity on the one hand, and growing faith on
the other, believing reason comes to conceive the full import of the
mercy of God, freely and fully accepts of pardon, and realizes the peace
and privilege which it bestows. Growing man now comprehends all that is
implied in the proper name of God, יהוה yehovâh, "Jehovah," the Author
of being, of promise, and of performance. He finds a tongue, and
ventures to express the desires and feelings that have been long pent up
in his breast, and are now bursting for utterance. These petitions and
confessions are now made in an audible voice, and with a holy urgency
and courage rising above the depressing sense of self-abasement to the
confidence of peace and gratitude. These adorations are also presented
in a social capacity, and thereby acquire a public notoriety. The
father, the older of the house, is the master of words, and he becomes
the spokesman of the brotherhood in this new relationship into which
they have spontaneously entered with their Father in heaven. The spirit
of adoption has prompted the confiding and endearing terms, "Abba,
Father," and now the winged words ascend to heaven, conveying the
adorations and aspirations of the assembled saints. The new form of
worship attracts the attention of the early world, and the record is
made, "Then began they to call upon the name of the Lord," that keepeth
covenant and mercy.

Here we perceive that the holy race has passed beyond its infancy. It
has learned to speak with God in the language of faith, of conscious
acceptance, of freedom, of hope, of love. This is a far nobler
attainment than the invention of all the arts of life. It is the return
from that revulsive dread with which the conscious sinner shrank back
from the felt holiness of God. It is the drawing of the divine mercy and
love let into the penitent soul, by which it has come to itself, and
taken courage to return to the merciful Yahweh, and speak to him the
language of penitence, of confession, of gratitude. These believing
penitents, chiefly it is to be supposed in the line of Sheth, of which
this paragraph speaks, began to be distinguished as the followers of the
Lord; whereas others at the same time had forgotten the Lord, and
renounced even the form of reverence for him. The seed of the woman was
now distinguished from the seed of the serpent. The latter are in a
spiritual sense called "the seed of the serpent," because they cling to
the principles of the tempter; and the former may in the same sense be
designated "the seed or sons of God," because they follow after him as
the God of mercy and truth. Thus, the lamentable fact obtrudes itself
upon our view that a portion of the human family have persisted in the
primeval apostasy, and are no longer associated with their fellows in
acknowledging their common Maker.

The progress of moral evil in the antediluvian world was manifested in
fratricide, in going out from the presence of the Lord, in personal
violence, and in polygamy. The first is the normal character of all
murder; the second gave scope for the third, the daring and presumptuous
violence of the strong; and the fourth ultimately led to an almost total
corruption of manners. It is curious to observe that ungodliness, in the
form of disobedience and departure from God and therefore of the
practical breach of the first commandment, and unrighteousness in the
form of murder, the crime of masterful passion and violence, which is
the transgression of the first commandment concerning our neighbor, are
the starting-points of sin in the world. They do not seem to have yet
reached idolatry and adultery. This appears to point out that the
prohibitions into which the law is developed in the Ten Commandments are
arranged in the order of time as well as of nature.

The preceding chapters, if written in substance by Adam, formed the
primeval Bible of mankind. But, whether written at that time or not,
they contain the leading facts which occurred in the early history of
man in relation to his Maker. These facts were well known to the
antediluvian world, and formed the rule by which it was to be guided in
approaching to God, presenting to him an acceptable offering, calling
upon his name, and so walking with him in peace and love. Here we have
all the needful germs of a gospel for the infantile race. If we ask why
they were not effectual, the answer is at hand. They were effectual with
a few, and are thereby proved sufficient to recover man from sin, and
vindicate the mercy of God. But the All-wise Being, who made man a moral
agent, must thoroughly guard his freedom, even in the dealings of mercy.
And in the folly and madness of their self-will, some will revolt more
and more. The history was written for our learning. Let its lessons be
pondered. Let the accumulated experience of bygone wanderings recorded
in the Book of God be our warning, to return at length with our whole
heart to our merciful Father.
