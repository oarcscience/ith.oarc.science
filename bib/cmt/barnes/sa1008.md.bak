### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 8:1</span></span>

This verse implies a long period, probably not less than 20 years, of
which we have no account except what is contained in the brief notice in
[Sa1 7:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013.md). The general idea
conveyed is of a time of peace and prosperity, analogous to that under
other Judges.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 8:2</span></span>

The mention of Beer-sheba, on the extreme southern frontier of Judah, as
the place where Samuel's sons judged Israel is remarkable. It was
probably due to the recovery of territory from the usurpation of the
Philistines [Sa1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 8:6</span></span>

See the margin which implies that the thing spoken of caused anger,
indignation, or some revulsion of feeling (see [Gen
21:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#011).md). The answer of the Lord [Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md) shows that Samuel's personal
feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the
continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact,
a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the
nations," than upon Samuel (compare [Mat
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018.md), [Joh
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020).md). For a comment on this
transaction, see [Hos 13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md); [Act
13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 8:12</span></span>

This organization was as old as the time of Moses [Num
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#014.md); [Deu
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015.md), and prevailed among the
Philistines also [Sa1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md). The civil
and military divisions were identical, and the civil officers were the
same as the captains of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, in time
of war.

To ear his ground - literally, "to plow his plowing." "To ear" is an old
English word, now obsolete, for to plow.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 8:14</span></span>

See illustrations in marginal references; [Kg1
5:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md); [Kg1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 8:20</span></span>

Fight our battles - It appears from [Sa1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012.md), that the warlike movements of
Nahash had already begun to excite alarm.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 8:22</span></span>

A repetition for the third time [Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md), [Sa1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009.md) of the expression of God's will in
the matter, marks Samuel's great unwillingness to comply with the
people's request. Besides the natural aversion which he felt to being
thrust aside after so many years of faithful and laborious service, and
the natural prejudice which he would feel at his age against a new form
of government, he doubtless saw how much of the evil heart of unbelief
there was in the desire to have a visible king for their leader, instead
of trusting to the invisible Lord who had hitherto led them. But God had
His own purpose in setting up the kingdom which was to be typical of the
kingdom of His only begotten Son.
