### [Numbers Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 30:1</span></span>

The regulations respecting vows appropriately follow those given
respecting sacrifices, since a large proportion of vows would always
relate to the presentation of such offerings. Rules had already been
given Lev. 27 for the estimation of things vowed to God. It is probable
that this fresh legislation dealing especially with vows made by persons
in a state of tutelage, was occasioned by some case of practical
difficulty that had recently arisen; and it is addressed by Moses to
"the heads of the tribes" [Num 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md),
who would in their judicial capacity have to determine questions on
these subjects.

There is no provision in the chapter for annulling vows made by boys and
young men; from which it has been inferred that the vows of males were
in all cases and circumstances binding.

[Numbers 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 30:2</span></span>

The "vow" was positive; the "bond" negative or restrictive. By a vow a
man engaged to dedicate something to God, or to accomplish some work for
Him: by a bond he debarred himself from some privilege or enjoyment. A
vow involved an obligation to do: a bond, an obligation to forbear
doing.

[Numbers 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 30:3</span></span>

Being in her father's house in her youth - It was not ordinarily until
her betrothal or marriage, that the female passed (some suppose by
purchase) from the power of her father to that of her husband.

[Numbers 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 30:5</span></span>

The Lord shall forgive her - i. e., shall remit the obligation. (Compare
[Kg2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018)..md)

[Numbers 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 30:6</span></span>

Rather, And if she shall at all be an husband's, and her vows shall be
upon her, or a rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her
soul, etc. The "at all" intimates that the case of a girl betrothed but
not yet actually married is here especially contemplated. After
betrothal, a woman continued to reside, until the period of her marriage
arrived, in her father's house; but her property was from that time
forward vested in her husband, and she was so far regarded as personally
his, that an act of faithlessness to him was, like adultery, punishable
with death [Deu 22:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md). Hence, his
right to control her vows even before he actually took her home as his
wife.
