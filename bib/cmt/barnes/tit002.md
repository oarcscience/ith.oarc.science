### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

[Titus](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">tit 2:0</span></span>

In the previous chapter, the apostle had directed Titus what to do in
the organization of churches in the various cities of Crete, and had put
him on his guard in doing it, by showing the character of the people he
had to deal with. In this chapter he gives him various instructions as
to his own method of teaching, showing what kind of doctrines he should
inculcate, and what kind of instructions he should give to the various
classes of his hearers. He was, in general, to speak only such things as
became sound doctrine; [Tit 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md). In
particular he was to instruct aged men to be sober, grave, and temperate
- acting in a manner that became their time of life, [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md); the aged women to be a proper
example to the younger females, and to exercise a proper care over them,
[Tit 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md); the young men to be
sober-minded, [Tit 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006.md); Titus himself,
who evidently came under the class of young men, was to be an example to
them in all things, [Tit 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md); and
servants were to be instructed to perform their duty to their masters
with fidelity, [Tit 2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md). The duty
of giving these instructions is then enforced by a reference to the
nature and design of the gospel; [Tit
2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md). That grace which brings
salvation has appeared to all mankind, and its design is to make all
holy who embrace it, and to teach all to live for a higher and a better
world.

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

But speak thou - In thine own ministry. In the previous chapter he had
given him instructions as to the kind of persons who were to be put into
the sacred office. Here he gives him special instructions in regard to
his own preaching. "The things which become sound doctrine." To wit,
those which he proceeds immediately to specify. On the phrase sound
doctrine, see the notes at [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md);
compare [Ti2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md).

[Titus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 2:2</span></span>

That the aged men - All aged men - for there is no reason to suppose
that the apostle refers particularly to those who were in office, or who
were technically elders, or Presbyters. If he had, he would have used
the common word - πρεσβύτερος presbuteros - "presbyter" (see [Mat
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md); [Mat
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md); [Mat
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md); [Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003.md), [Mat
26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md), [Mat
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md), [Mat
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059.md); [Ti1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md), [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md), [Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019.md); [Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md); [Jam
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md); [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).md), instead of the unusual word -
πρεσβύτης presbutēs - an old or aged man - a word which occurs nowhere
else in the New Testament except in [Luk
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md), "For I am an old man," and [Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md), "being such an one as Paul the
aged." It is in no instance applied to an office. Besides, the
instructions which Titus was to give to such men was not that which
especially pertained to elders as officers in the church, but to all old
men. The idea is, that he was to adapt his instructions to the special
character of different classes of his hearers. The aged needed special
instructions, and so did the young.

Be sober - Margin, "vigilant." See the word explained in the notes at
[Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md), where it is rendered
vigilant. In [Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md), the same word
is rendered sober. -

Grave - Serious; see the notes at [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md); compare the notes at [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md), where the same word is rendered
hottest.

Temperate - σώφρονας sōphronas. Rather, prudent, or sober-minded. See it
explained in the notes, [Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md),
where it is rendered "sober." Also [Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md).

Sound in faith - [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md) note; [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md) note.

In charity - In love; Notes, 1 Cor. 13. The meaning is, that an old man
should evince love for all, especially for those who are good. He should
have overcome, at his time of life, all the fiery, impetuous, envious,
wrathful passions of his early years, and his mind should be subdued
into sweet benevolence to all mankind.

In patience - In the infirmities of old age - in the trials resulting
from the loss of the friends of their early years - in their loneliness
in the world, they should show that the effect of all God's dealings
with them has been to produce patience. The aged should submit to the
trials of their advanced years, also, with resignation - for they will
soon be over. A few more sighs, and they will sigh no more; a little
longer bearing up under their infirmities, and they will renew their
youth before the throne of God.

[Titus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 2:3</span></span>

The aged women likewise - Not only those who may have the office of
deaconesses, but all aged females.

That they be in behaviour as becometh holiness - Marg, "holy women." The
Greek word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. It means
appropriate to a sacred place or person, or becoming to religion. Their
conduct should be such as the gospel requires.

Not false accusers - - Margin, "make-bates." Greek, διαβόλους diabolous
- the word commonly applied to the devil - "as the accuser." See it
explained in the notes at [Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md),
where it is rendered slanderers.

Not given to much wine - Notes, 1 Tim. 3.

Teachers of good things - That is instructing the younger - whether
their own children, or whether they sustain the office of deaconness,
and are appointed to give instruction to younger females; compare the
notes at [Ti1 5:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002.md).

[Titus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 2:4</span></span>

That they may teach the young women to be sober - Margin, "wise" - a
word similar to that which in [Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md)
is rendered "temperate," and in [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md), "sober." The meaning is, that
they should instruct them to have their desires and passions well
regulated, or under proper control.

To love their husbands - φιλάνδρους philandrous. This word occurs
nowhere else in the New Testament. In [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md), Paul directs husbands to love
their wives, and in [Eph 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md), the
wife to reverence her husband, and here he says that it should be one of
the first duties enjoined Son the wife that she should love her husband.
All happiness in the marriage relation is based on mutual love. When
that departs, happiness departs. No wealth or splendor in a dwelling -
no gorgeousness of equipage or apparel - no magnificence of
entertainment or sweetness of music - and no forms of courtesy and
politeness, can be a compensation for the want of affection. Mutual love
between a husband and wife will diffuse comfort through the obscurest
cottage of poverty; the want of it cannot be supplied by all that can be
furnished in the palaces of the great.

To love their children - Nature prompts to this, and yet there are those
so depraved that they have no maternal affection; Notes, [Rom
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031.md). Religion reproduces natural
affection when sin has weakened or destroyed it, and it is the design of
Christianity to recover and invigorate all the lost or weakened
sensibilities of our nature.

[Titus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 2:5</span></span>

To be discreet - The same word rendered, in [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md), "temperate," and explained in
[Tit 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md).

Chaste - Pure - in heart, and in life.

Keepers at home - That is, characteristically attentive to their
domestic concerns, or to their duties in their families. A similar
injunction is found in the precepts of the Pythagoreans - τὰν γὰρ
γύναικα δεῖ οἰκουρεῖν καὶ ἔνδον μένειν tan gar gunaika dei oikourein kai
endon menein. See Creuzer's Symbolik, iii. 120. This does not mean, of
course, that they are never to go abroad, but they are not to neglect
their domestic affairs; they are not to be better known abroad than at
home; they are not to omit their own duties and become "busy-bodies" in
the concerns of others. Religion is the patron of the domestic virtues,
and regards the appropriate duties in a family as those most intimately
connected with its own progress in the world. It looks benignly on all
which makes home a place of contentment, intelligence, and peace. It
does not flourish when domestic duties are neglected; - and whatever may
be done abroad, or whatever self-denial and zeal in the cause of
religion may be evinced there, or whatever call there may be for the
labors of Christians there, or however much good may be actually done
abroad, religion has gained nothing, on the whole, if, in order to
secure these things, the duties of a wife and mother at home have been
disregarded. Our first duty is at home, and all other duties will be
well performed just in proportion as that is.

Good - In all respects, and in all relations. To a wife, a mother, a
sister, there can be no higher characteristic ascribed, than to say that
she is good. What other trait of mind will enable her better to perform
her appropriate duties of life? What other will make her more like her
Saviour?

Obedient to their own husbands - [Eph
5:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md) note; [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018.md) note.

That the word of God be not blasphemed - That the gospel may not be
injuriously spoken of (Notes, [Mat
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003).md), on account of the inconsistent
lives of those who profess to be influenced by it. The idea is, that
religion ought to produce the virtues here spoken of, and that when it
does not, it will be reproached as being of no value.

[Titus 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 2:6</span></span>

Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded - Margin, "discreet." On
the meaning of the Greek word used here (σωφρονεῖν sōphronein), see the
notes at [Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md), [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md). The idea is, that they should be
entreated to be prudent, discreet, serious in their deportment; to get
the mastery over their passions and appetites; to control the
propensities to which youth are subject; and that there should be such
self-government, under the influence of, religion, as to avoid excess in
everything. A well-governed mind, superior to the indulgence of those
passions to which the young are prone, will express the meaning of the
word here. They should be "steady in their behaviour, superior to
sensual temptations, and constant in the exercise of every part of
self-government." Doddridge. The reasons for this are obvious:

\(1\) The hopes of the church depend much on them.

\(2\) a young man who cannot govern himself, gives little promise of
being useful or happy.

\(3\) Indulgence in the propensities to which young men are prone, will,
sooner or later, bring ruin to the body and the soul.

\(4\) they are just at the period of life when they are exposed to
special temptations, and when they need to exercise a special
guardianship over their own conduct.

\(5\) like others, they may soon die; and they should be habitually in
such a frame of mind, as to be prepared to stand before God. A young man
who feels that he may be soon in the eternal world, cannot but be
sensible of the propriety of having a serious mind, and of living and
acting as in the immediate presence of his Maker and Judge.

[Titus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works - Not merely
teaching others, but showing them by example how they ought to live. On
the word rendered "pattern" (τύπον tupon, type), see the [Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md) note; [Co1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md) note; [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md) note.

In doctrine - In your manner of teaching; notes, [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md).

Showing uncorruptness - The word here used does not occur elsewhere in
the New Testament. It means, here, the same as purity - that which is
not erroneous, and which does not tend to corrupt or vitiate the morals
of others, or to endanger their salvation. Everything in his teaching
was to be such as to make men purer and better.

Gravity - See this word explained in the notes at [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md), where it is rendered "honesty;"
compare the notes at [Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md), where
it is rendered "gravity." It does not elsewhere occur; see the use of
the adjective, however, in [Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md);
[Ti1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md), [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md); [Tit
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md). The word properly means
"venerableness;" then, whatever will insure respect, in character,
opinions, deportment. The sense here is, that the manner in which a
preacher delivers his message, should be such as to command respect. He
should evince good sense, undoubted piety, an acquaintance with his
subject, simplicity, seriousness, and earnestness, in his manner.

Sincerity - See this word (ἀφθαρσία aphtharsia) explained in the notes
at [Eph 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md). It is rendered
immortality in [Rom 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md); incorruption, in [Co1
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042.md), [Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050.md), [Co1
15:53-54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md); and sincerity, [Eph
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md), and in the place before us. It
does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means incorruption,
incapacity of decay; and, therefore, would be here synonymous with
purity. It should be said, however, that it is wanting in many msS, and
is rejected in the later editions of the New Testament by Wetstein,
Tittman, and Hahn.

[Titus 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 2:8</span></span>

Sound speech - Notes, [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). He
was to use language that would be spiritually "healthful" (ὑγιῆ hugiē);
that is, true, pure, uncorrupted. - This word, and its correlatives, is
used in this sense, in the New Testament, only by the apostle Paul. It
is commonly applied to the body, meaning that which is healthful, or
whole; see [Luk 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031.md); [Luk
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010.md); [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md); [Luk
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#027.md); [Mat
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#013.md); [Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031.md); [Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md); [Mar
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034.md); [Joh
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md), [Joh
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006.md),[Joh
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009.md), [Joh
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#011.md), [Joh
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md); [Joh
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023.md); [Act
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md); [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md). For Paul's use of the word see
[Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md);[Ti2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md), [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md), [Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008.md). It does not elsewhere occur.

That cannot be condemned - Such as cannot be shown to be weak, or
unsound; such that no one could find fault with it, or such as an
adversary could not take hold of and blame. This direction would imply
purity and seriousness of language, solidity of argument, and truth in
the doctrines which he maintained.

That he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed ... - Ashamed that
he has opposed such views.

[Titus 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 2:9</span></span>

Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters - See this explained
in the notes at [Eph 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md), following,
and [Ti1 6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md).

And to please them well in all things - That is, so far as they lawfully
may, or in those things which are not contrary to the will of God;
compare [Eph 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006.md). It should be an
object with one who is a servant, to meet the approbation of his master,
as long as this relation continues. This rule would not, however, go to
the extent to require him to please his master in doing anything that is
contrary to the law of God, or that is morally wrong.

Not answering again - Margin, "gainsaying." Not contradicting, or not
disobeying. They were to do what the master required, if it did not
interfere with the rights of conscience, without attempting to argue the
matter - without disputing with the master - and without advancing their
own opinions. Where this relation exists, no one can doubt that this is
a proper frame of mind for a servant. It may be observed, however, that
all that is here said would be equally appropriate, whether the
servitude was voluntary or involuntary. A man who becomes voluntarily a
servant, binds himself to obey his master cheerfully and quietly,
without gainsaying, and without attempting to reason the matter with
him, or propounding his own opinions, even though they may be much wiser
than those of his employer. He makes a contract to obey his master, not
to reason with him, or to instruct him.

[Titus 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 2:10</span></span>

Not purloining - Not to appropriate to themselves what belongs to their
masters. The word "purloin" means, literally, to take or carry away for
oneself; and would be applied to an approbation to oneself of what
pertained to a common stock, or what belonged to one in whose employ we
are - as the embezzlement of public funds. Here it means that the
servant was not to apply to his own use what belonged to his master;
that is, was not to pilfer - a vice to which, as all know, servants, and
especially slaves, are particularly exposed; see the word explained in
the notes at [Act 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md).

But showing all good fidelity - In laboring, and in taking care of the
property intrusted to them.

That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things - That
they may show the fair influence of religion on them, in all respects,
making them industrious, honest, kind, and obedient. They were to show
that the effect of the religion which they professed was to make them
better fitted to discharge the duties of their station in life, however
humble; or that its influence on them was desirable in every respect. In
this way, they might hope also that the minds of their masters might be
reached, and that they might be brought to respect and love the gospel.
Hence, learn:

\(1\) that one in the most humble walk of life may so live as to be an
ornament to religion, as well as one favored with more advantages.

\(2\) that servants may do much good, by so living as to show to all
around them that there is a reality in the gospel, and to lead others to
love it.

\(3\) if in this situation of life, it is a duty so to live as to adorn
religion, it cannot be less so in more elevated situations. A master
should feel the obligation not to be surpassed in religious character by
his servant.

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

For the grace of God - The favor of God, shown to the undeserving; see
the notes at [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).

That bringeth salvation - Margin, to all men, hath appeared. That is, in
the margin, "the grace which brings salvation to all men has been
revealed." The marginal reading is most in accordance with the Greek,
though it will bear either construction. If that which is in the text be
adopted, it means that the plan of salvation has been revealed to all
classes of men; that is, that it is announced or revealed to all the
race that they may be saved; compare the notes at [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md). If the other rendering be
adopted, it means that that plan was fitted to secure the salvation of
all men; that none were excluded from the offer; that provision had been
made for all, and all might come and be saved. Whichever interpretation
be adopted, the sense here will not be essentially varied. It is, that
the gospel was adapted to man as man, and therefore might include
servants as well as masters; subjects, as well as kings; the por, as
well as the rich; the ignorant, as well as the learned; see [Ti1
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md) notes; [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md) note.

[Titus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 2:12</span></span>

Teaching us - That is, the "grace of God" so teaches us; or that system
of religion which is a manifestation of the grace of God, inculcates the
great and important duties which Paul proceeds to state.

That denying ungodliness and worldly lusts - "That by denying ourselves
of these, or refusing to practice them, we should lead a holy life." The
word ungodliness here means all that would be included under the word
impiety; that is, all failure in the performance of our proper duties
towards God; see the notes at [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md). The phrase "worldly lusts"
refers to all improper desires pertaining to this life - the desire of
wealth, pleasure, honor, sensual indulgence. It refers to such passions
as the people of this world are prone to, and would include all those
things which cannot be indulged in with a proper reference to the world
to come. The gross passions would be of course included, and all those
more refined pleasures also which constitute the characteristic and
special enjoyments of those who do not live unto God.

We should live soberly - See the word "soberly" (σωφρόνως sōphronōs)
explained in the notes at [Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md),
[Tit 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md). It means that we should
exercise a due restraint on our passions and propensities.

Righteously - Justly - δικαίως dikaiōs. This refers to the proper
performance of our duties to our fellow-men; and it means that religion
teaches us to perform those duties with fidelity, according to all our
relations in life; to all our promises and contracts; to our
fellow-citizens and neighbors; to the poor, and needy, and ignorant, and
oppressed; and to all those who are providentially placed in our way who
need our kind offices. Justice to them would lead us to act as we would
wish that they would towards us.

And godly - Piously; that is, in the faithful performance of our duties
to God. We have here, then, an epitome of all that religion requires:

\(1\) our duty to ourselves - included in the word "soberly" and
requiring a suitable control over our evil propensities and passions;

\(2\) our duty to our fellow-men in all the relations we sustain in
life; and,

\(3\) our duty to God - evinced in what will be properly regarded as a
pious life.

He that does these things, meets all the responsibilites of his
condition and relations; and the Christian system, requiring the
faithful performance of these duties, shows how admirably it is adapted
to man.

In this present world - That is, as long as we shall continue in it.
These are the duties which we owe in the present life.

[Titus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 2:13</span></span>

Looking for - Expecting; waiting for. That is, in the faithful
performance of our duties to ourselves, to our fellow-creatures, and to
God, we are patiently to wait for the coming of our Lord.

\(1\) We are to believe that he will return;

\(2\) We are to be in a posture of expectation, not knowing when he will
come; and,

\(3\) We are to be ready for him whenever he shall come; see the [Mat
24:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042.md) notes; [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md) note; [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md) note.

That blessed hope - The fulfillment of that hope so full of blessedness
to us.

The glorious appearing - Notes, [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md); compare [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

Of the great God - There can be little doubt, if any, that by "the great
God" here, the apostle referred to the Lord Jesus, for it is not a
doctrine of the New Testament that God himself as such, or in
contradistinction from his incarnate Son, will appear at the last day.
It is said, indeed, that the Saviour will come "in the glory of his
Father, with his angels" [Mat 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md),
but that God as such will appear is not taught in the Bible. The
doctrine there is, that God will be manifest in his Son; that the divine
approach to our world be through him to judge the race; and that though
he will be accompanied with the appropriate symbols of the divinity, yet
it will be the Son of God who will be visible. No one, accustomed to
Paul's views, can well doubt that when he used this language he had his
eye throughout on the Son of God, and that he expected no other
manifestation than what would be made through him.

In no place in the New Testament is the phrase ἐπιφάνειαν τοῦ Θεοῦ
epiphaneian tou Theou - "the manifestation or appearing of God" -
applied to any other one than Christ It is true that this is spoken of
here as the "appearing of the glory - τῆς δόξης tēs doxēs - of the great
God," but the idea is that of such a manifestation as became God, or
would appropriately display his glory. It is known to most persons who
have attended to religious controversies, that this passage has given
rise to much discussion. The ancients, in general, interpreted it as
meaning" The glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus
Christ." This sense has been vindicated by the labors of Beza, Whitby,
Bull, Matthaei, and Middleton (on the Greek article), and is the common
interpretation of those who claim to be orthodox; see Bloomfield, Rec.
Syn., and Notes, in loc. He contends that the meaning is, "the glorious
appearance of that great being who is our God and Saviour." The
arguments for this opinion are well summed up by Bloomfield. Without
going into a critical examination of this passage, which would not be in
accordance with the design of these Notes, it may be remarked in
general:

\(1\) that no plain reader of the New Testament, accustomed to the
common language there, would have any doubt that the apostle referred
here to the coming of the Lord Jesus.

\(2\) that the "coming" of God, as such, is not spoken of in this manner
in the New Testament.

\(3\) that the expectation of Christians was directed to the advent of
the ascended Saviour, not to the appearing of God as such.

\(4\) that this is just such language as one would use who believed that
the Lord Jesus is divine, or that the name God might properly be applied
to him.

\(5\) that it would naturally and obviously convey the idea that he was
divine, to one who had no theory to defend.

\(6\) that if the apostle did not mean this, he used such language as
was fitted to lead people into error.

\(7\) and that the fair construction of the Greek here, according to the
application of the most rigid rules, abundantly sustains the
interpretation which the plain reader of the New Testament would affix
to it. The names above referred to are abundant proof that no violation
is done to the rules of the Greek language by this interpretation, but
rather that the fair construction of the original demands it. If this be
so, then this furnishes an important proof of the divinity of Christ.

[Titus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 2:14</span></span>

Who gave himself for us - See the notes at [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md).

That he might redeem us from all iniquity - The word here rendered
"redeem" - λυτρόω lutroō, occurs only here and in [Luk
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md). The noun, however - λύτρον
lutron, occurs in [Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); and [Mar
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md); where it is rendered "ransom;"
see it explained in the notes at [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md). It is here said that the object
of his giving himself was to save his people from all iniquity; see this
explained in the notes at [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

And purify unto himself -

\(1\) Purify them, or make them holy. This is the first and leading
object; see the notes at [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md)

\(2\) "Unto himself;" that is, they are no longer to be regarded as
their own, but as redeemed for his own service, and for the promotion of
his glory; - Notes, [Co1 6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md).

A peculiar people - [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md). The word
here used (περιούσιος periousios) occurs nowhere else in the New
Testament. It means, properly, having abundance; and then one's own,
what is special, or peculiar (Robinson, Lexicon), and here means that
they were to be regarded as belonging to the Lord Jesus. It does not
mean, as the word would seem to imply - and as is undoubtedly true -
that they are to be a unique people in the sense that they are to be
unlike others, or to have views and principles unique to themselves; but
that they belong to the Saviour in contradistinction from belonging to
themselves - "peculiar" or his own in the sense that a man's property is
his own, and does not belong to others. This passage, therefore, should
not be used to prove that Christians should be unlike others in their
manner of living, but that they belong to Christ as his redeemed people.
From that it may indeed be inferred that they should be unlike others,
but that is not the direct teaching of the passage.

Zealous of good works - As the result of their redemption; that is, this
is one object of their having been redeemed; Notes, [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md).

[Titus 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 2:15</span></span>

These things speak and exhort - Notes, [Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md).

And rebuke with all authority - [Ti1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md), note, 20, note; [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md) note. The word "authority" here
means command - ἐπιταγὴ epitagē; [Co1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006.md), [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md); [Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md); [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md). The sense here is, he was to do
it decidedly, without ambiguity, without compromise, and without keeping
anything back. He was to state these things not as being advice or
counsel, but as the requirement of God.

Let no man despise thee - That is, conduct yourself, as you may easily
do, so as to command universal respect as a minister of God; see the
notes at [Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md).
