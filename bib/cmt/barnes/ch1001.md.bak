Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Compare the margin references and notes.

[1 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 1:7</span></span>

Dodanim - See the [Gen 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md) note.

[1 Chronicles 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 1:16</span></span>

The Zemarite - See [Gen 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018.md) note.
The inscriptions of the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, (720 B.C.) mention
Zimira, which is joined with Arpad (Arvad); and there can be little
doubt that it is the city indicated by the term "Zemarite."

[1 Chronicles 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 1:17</span></span>

The sons of Shem - i. e., descendants. Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech (or
Mash), are stated to have been "sons of Aram" [Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023.md). Meshech is the reading of all
the MSS., and is supported by the Septuagint here and in [Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023.md). It seems preferable to "Mash,"
which admits of no very probable explanation. Just as Hamites and
Semites were intermingled in Arabia ([Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md), note; [Gen
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029), note.md), so Semites and
Japhethites may have been intermingled in Cappadocia - the country of
the Meshech or Moschi ([Gen 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002.md)
note); and this Aramaean ad-mixture may have been the origin of the
notion, so prevalent among the Greeks, that the Cappadocians were
Syrians.

[1 Chronicles 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 1:28</span></span>

Isaac and Ishmael - Isaac, though younger than Ishmael, is placed first,
as the legitimate heir, since Sarah alone was Abraham's true wife
(compare the [Ch1 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036) note.md).

[1 Chronicles 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 1:29</span></span>

These are their generations - As Shem was reserved until after Japheth
and Ham [Ch1 1:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005.md), because in him
the genealogy was to be continued ([Gen
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002) note.md), so Isaac is now reserved
until the other lines of descent from Abraham have been completed. The
same principle gives the descendants of Esau a prior place to those of
Jacob 1 Chr. 1:35-51; [Ch1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md).

[1 Chronicles 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 1:30</span></span>

Hadad here and in [Ch1 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#050.md) is the
well-known Syrian name, of which Hadar (margin) is an accidental
corruption, consequent on the close resemblance between "d" (daleth) and
"r" (resh) in Hebrew, the final letters of the two names.

[1 Chronicles 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 1:32</span></span>

Keturah, Abraham's concubine - This passage, and [Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006.md), sufficiently prove that the
position of Keturah was not that of the full wife, but of the
"secondary" or "concubine wife" [Jdg
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md) so common among Orientals.

[1 Chronicles 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 1:36</span></span>

Timna - In [Gen 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011.md), Eliphaz has no
son Timna; but he has a concubine of the name, who is the mother of
Amalek, and conjectured to be Lotan's sister [Ch1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#039.md). The best explanation is, that
the writer has in his mind rather the tribes descended from Eliphaz than
his actual children, and as there was a place, Timna, inhabited by his
"dukes" ([Ch1 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051.md); compare Gen.
35:40), he puts the race which lived there among his "sons."

[1 Chronicles 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 1:41</span></span>

Amram (rather Hamran), and Hemdan (margin), differ in the original by
the same letter only which marks the difference in [Ch1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md).

[1 Chronicles 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 1:43</span></span>

The slight differences favor the view, that the writer of Chronicles has
here, as elsewhere, abridged from Genesis (see the marginal references).
