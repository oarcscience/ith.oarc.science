### [Numbers Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 8:1</span></span>

The actual lighting of the lamps (compare the marginal references) was
to be done to set forth symbolically the special presence which God had
now [Num 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md) actually established
among His people.

[Numbers 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 8:5</span></span>

The Levites could only undertake their duties Num. 3; 4 after the formal
exchange of the Levites for the first-born [Num
3:44-51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md).

The distinction between the "consecration" of the priests Lev. 8 and the
less solemn "purification" [Num 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#021.md)
of the Levites is marked. These rites of purification are similar to
those incumbent on the priests of Egypt.

[Num 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007.md)

Water of purifying - literally, "sin water:" i. e. water to cleanse from
sin; no doubt taken from the laver of the sanctuary, which was used by
the priests for purification before they went into the tabernacle to
minister (compare [Num 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#017.md); [Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018) ff.md).

The "sprinkling" of so large a body of men could have been only general,
but tokens of individual purification are specified (compare also [Lev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#008).md).

[Num 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#008.md)

The two bullocks were "to make an atonement for the Levites," and
therefore are presented in their name. These offerings are similar to
those prescribed in [Lev 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md) ff at
the consecration of the priests, except that the burnt-offering was on
that occasion a ram. The larger victim corresponds to the larger number
of the Levites.

[Num 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#010.md)

The children of Israel - i. e. through the heads of their tribes, who
[Num 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#002.md) no doubt acted for their
tribesmen. This act, the distinguishing feature of the ceremony,
represented the transfer to the Levites of the sacred duties originally
incumbent on the whole people.

[Num 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011.md)

Offer ... offering - Compare the margin Aaron pointed to the Levites,
and then waved his hands, indicating (compare [Lev
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030) note.md) that the offering was
dedicated to God, and, again, by grant from Him, withdrawn for the use
of the priests.

[Num 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019.md)

Make an atonement for the children of Israel - i. e. by performing those
services which were due from the children of Israel; the omission of
which by the children of Israel would, but for the interposition of the
Levites, have called down "wrath" from God, or [Num
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053.md) "plague." The institution of the
Levites was an extension of that mediatorial system which the people
themselves, terrified at the direct manifestations to them of the divine
presence, desired; see [Deu 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#025.md).
Further, it is suggested to us here as an act of mercy on the part of
God; yet even the priests and Levites themselves were not always
sufficiently heedful and reverent. Compare [Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md); [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md) ff; [Sa2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006.md) following.

[Num 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#021.md)

Were purified - Rather, purified themselves; as directed in [Num
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007.md).

[Numbers 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 8:24</span></span>

Twenty and five years old and upward - The permanent limit as
distinguished from the temporary [Num
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003.md), [Num
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023.md), [Num
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#030.md), though David found it necessary
to extend the period of the Levites' service by causing it to commence
at 20 years of age [Ch1 23:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md). This
rule continued in force from the time of David downward (compare on [Ch2
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md); [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md).
