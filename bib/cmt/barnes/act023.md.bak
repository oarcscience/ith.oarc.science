### [Acts Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md)

[Acts 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 23:1</span></span>

And Paul, earnestly beholding - ἀτενίσας atenisas. Fixing his eyes
intently on the council. The word denotes "a fixed and earnest gazing; a
close observation." See [Luk 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md).
Compare the notes on [Act 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004.md). Paul
would naturally look with a keen and attentive observation on the
council. He was arraigned before them, and he would naturally observe
the appearance, and endeavor to ascertain the character of his judges.
Besides, it was by this council that he had been formerly commissioned
to persecute the Christians, [Act
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md). He had not seen them since that
commission was given. He would naturally, therefore, regard them with an
attentive eye. The result shows, also, that he looked at them to see
what was the character of the men there assembled, and what was the
proportion of Pharisees and Sadducees, [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md).

The council - Greek: the Sanhedrin, [Act
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030.md). It was the great council,
composed of seventy elders, to whom was entrusted the affairs of the
nation. See the notes on [Mat 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#004.md).

Men and brethren - Greek: "Men, brethren"; the usual form of beginning
an address among the Jews. See [Act
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029.md). He addressed them still as his
brethren.

I have lived in all good conscience - I have conducted myself so as to
maintain a good conscience. I have done what I believed to be right.
This was a bold declaration, after the tumult, and charges, and
accusations of the previous day Acts 22; and yet it was strictly true.
His persecutions of the Christians had been conducted conscientiously,
[Act 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md), "I verily thought with
myself," says he, "that I ought to do many things contrary to the name
of Jesus of Nazareth." Of his conscientiousness and fidelity in their
service they could bear witness. Of his conscientiousness since, he
could make a similar declaration. He doubtless meant to say that as he
had been conscientious in persecution, so he had been in his conversion
and in his subsequent course. And as they knew that his former life had
been with a good conscience, they ought to presume that he had
maintained the same character still. This was a remarkably bold appeal
to be made by an accused man, and it shows the strong consciousness
which Paul had of his innocence. What would have been the drift of his
discourse in proving this we can only Conjecture. He was interrupted
[Act 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002.md); but there can be no doubt
that he would have pursued such a course of argument as would tend to
establish his innocence.

Before God - Greek: to God - τῷ Θεῷ tō Theō. He had lived to God, or
with reference to his commands, so as to keep a conscience pure in his
sight. The same principle of conduct he states more at length in [Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md); "And herein do I exercise
myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and
toward men."

Until this day - Including the time before his conversion to
Christianity, and after. In both conditions he was conscientious; in
one, conscientious in persecution and error, though he deemed it to be
right; in the other, conscientious in the truth. The mere fact that a
man is conscientious does not prove that he is right or innocent. See
the note on [Joh 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md).

[Acts 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 23:2</span></span>

And the high priest Ananias - This Ananias was doubtless the son of
Nebedinus (Josephus, Antiq., book 20, chapter 5, section 3), who was
high priest when Quadratus, who preceded Felix, was president of Syria.
He was sent bound to Rome by Quadratus, at the same time with Ananias,
the prefect of the temple, that they might give an account of their
conduct to Claudius Caesar (Josephus, Antiq., book 20, chapter 6,
section 2). But in consequence of the intercession of Agrippa the
younger, they were dismissed and returned to Jerusalem. Ananias,
however, was not restored to the office of high priest. For, when Felix
was governor of Judea, this office was filled by Jonathan, who succeeded
Ananias I (Josephus, Antiq., book 20, chapter 10). Jonathan was slain in
the temple itself, by the instigation of Felix, by assassins who had
been hired for the purpose. This murder is thus described by Josephus
(Antiq., book 20, chapter 8, section 5): "Felix bore an ill-will to
Jonathan, the high priest, because he frequently gave him admonitions
about governing the Jewish affairs better than he did, lest complaints
should be made against him, since he had procured of Caesar the
appointment of Felix as procurator of Judea. Accordingly, Felix
contrived a method by which he might get rid of Jonathan, whose
admonitions had become troublesome to him. Felix persuaded one of
Jonathan's most faithful friends, of the name Doras, to bring the
robbers upon him, and to put him to death."

This was done in Jerusalem. The robbers came into the city as if to
worship God, and with daggers, which they had concealed under their
garments, they put him to death. After the death of Jonathan, the office
of high priest remained vacant until King Agrippa appointed Ismael, the
son of Fabi, to the office (Josephus, Antiq., book 20, chapter 8,
section 8). It was during this interval, while the office of high priest
was vacant, that the events which are here recorded took place. Ananias
was then at Jerusalem; and as the office of high priest was vacant, and
as he was the last person who had borne the office, it was natural that
he should discharge, probably by common consent, its duties, so far, at
least, as to preside in the Sanhedrin. Of these facts Paul would be
doubtless apprised; and hence, what he said [Act
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005.md) was strictly true, and is one of
the evidences that Luke's history accords precisely with the special
circumstances which then existed. When Luke here calls Ananias "the high
priest," he evidently intends not to affirm that he was actually such,
but to use the word, as the Jews did, as applicable to one who had been
in that office, and who, on that occasion, when the office was vacant,
performed its duties.

To smite him on the mouth - To stop him from speaking; to express their
indignation at what he had said. The anger of Ananias was aroused
because Paul affirmed that all he had done had been with a good
conscience. Their feelings had been excited to the utmost; they regarded
him as certainly guilty; they regarded him as an apostate; and they
could not bear it that he, with such coolness and firmness, declared
that all his conduct had been under the direction of a good conscience.
The injustice of the command of Ananias is apparent to all. A similar
instance of violence occurred on the trial of the Saviour, [Joh
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022.md).

[Acts 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 23:3</span></span>

God shall smite thee - God shall punish thee. God is just; and he will
not suffer such a manifest violation of all the laws of a fair trial to
pass unavenged. This was a remarkably bold and fearless declaration.
Paul was surrounded by enemies. They were seeking his life. He must have
known that such declarations would only excite their wrath and make them
more thirsty for his blood. That he could thus address the president of
the council was not only strongly characteristic of the man, but was
also a strong proof that he was conscious of innocence, and that justice
was on his side. This expression of Paul, "God shall smite thee," is not
to be regarded in the light of an imprecatio, or as an expression of
angry feeling, but of a prediction, or of a strong conviction on the
mind of Paul that a man so hypocritical and unjust as Ananias was could
not escape the vengeance of God. Ananias was slain, with Hezekiah his
brother, during the agitation that occurred in Jerusalem when the
robbers, or Sicarii, under their leader, Manahem, had taken possession
of the city. He attempted to conceal himself in an aqueduct, but was
drawn forth and killed. See Josephus, Jewish Wars, book 2, chapter 17,
section 8. Thus, Paul's prediction was fulfilled.

Thou whited wall - This is evidently a proverbial expression, meaning
thou hypocrite. His hypocrisy consisted in the fact that while he
pretended to sit there to do justice, he commanded the accused to be
smitten in direct violation of the Law, thus showing that his character
was not what he professed it to be, but that of one determined to carry
the purposes of his party and of his own feelings. Our Saviour used a
similar expression to describe the hypocritical character of the
Pharisees [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md), when he compares
them to whited sepulchres. A whited wall is a wall or enclosure that is
covered with lime or gypsum, and that thus appears to be different from
what it is, and thus aptly describes the hypocrite. Seneca (De
Providentia, chapter 6) uses a similar figure to describe hypocrites:
"They are sordid, base, and like their walls adorned only externally."
See also Seneca, Epis. 115.

For sittest thou ... - The Law required that justice should be done, and
in order to that, it gave every man an opportunity of defending himself.
See the note, [Joh 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051.md). Compare [Pro
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#013.md); [Lev
19:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md); [Exo
23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md), [Deu
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#018.md).

To judge me after the law - As a judge, to hear and decide the case
according to the rules of the Law of Moses.

Contrary to the law - In violation of the Law of Moses [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md), "Ye shall do no unrighteousness
in judgment."

[Acts 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 23:4</span></span>

Revilest thou ... - Dost thou reproach or abuse the high priest of God?
is remarkable that they, who knew that he was not the high priest,
should have offered this language. He was, however, in the place of the
high priest, and they might have pretended that respect was due to the
office.

[Acts 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 23:5</span></span>

Then said Paul, I wist not - I know not; I was ignorant of the fact that
he was high priest. Interpreters have been greatly divided on the
meaning of this expression. Some have supposed that Paul said it in
irony, as if he had said, "Pardon me, brethren, I did not consider that
this was the high priest. It did not occur to me that a man who could
conduct thus could be God's highest. Others have thought (as Grotius)
that Paul used these words for the purpose of mitigating their wrath,
and as an acknowledgment that he had spoken hastily, and that it was
contrary to his usual habit, which was not to speak evil of the ruler of
the people. As if he had said, "I acknowledge my error and my haste. I
did not consider that I was addressing him whom God had commanded me to
respect." But this interpretation is not probable, for Paul evidently
did not intend to retract what he had said.

Dr. Doddridge renders it, "I was not aware, brethren, that it was the
high priest," and regards it as an apology for having spoken in haste.
But the obvious reply to this interpretation is, that if Ananias was the
high priest, Paul could not but be aware of it. Of so material a point
it is hardly possible that he could be ignorant. Others suppose that, as
Paul had been long absent from Jerusalem, and had not known the changes
which had occurred there, he was a stranger to the person of the high
priest. Others suppose that Ananias did not occupy the usual seat which
was appropriated to the high priest, and that he was not clothed in the
usual robes of office, and that Paul did not recognize him as the high
priest. But it is wholly improbable that on such an occasion the high
priest, who was the presiding officer in the Sanhedrin, should not be
known to the accused. The true interpretation, therefore, I suppose, is
what is derived from the fact that Ananias was not then properly the
high priest; that there was a vacancy in the office, and that he
presided by courtesy, or in virtue of his having been formerly invested
with that office.

The meaning then will be: "I do not regard or acknowledge him as the
high priest, or address him as such, since that is not his true
character. Had he been truly the high priest, even if he had thus been
guilty of manifest injustice, I would not have used the language which I
did. The office, if not the man, would have claimed respect. But as he
is not truly and properly clothed with that office, and as he was guilty
of manifest injustice, I did not believe that he was to be shielded in
his injustice by the Law which commands me to show respect to the proper
ruler of the people." If this be the true interpretation, it shows that
Luke, in this account, accords entirely with the truth of history. The
character of Ananias as given by Josephus, the facts which he has stated
in regard to him, all accord with the account here given, and show that
the writer of the "Acts of the Apostles" was acquainted with the history
of that time, and has correctly stated it.

For it is written - [Exo 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md). Paul
adduces this to show that it was his purpose to observe the Law; that he
would not intentionally violate it; and that, if he had known Ananias to
be high priest, he would have been restrained by his regard for the Law
from using the language which he did.

Of the ruler of thy people - This passage had not any special reference
to the high priest, but it inculcated the general spirit of respect for
those in office, whatever that office was. As the office of high priest
was one of importance and authority, Paul declares here that he would
not be guilty of showing disrespect for it, or of using reproachful
language in regard to it.

[Acts 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 23:6</span></span>

But when Paul perceived - Probably by his former acquaintance with the
men who composed the council. As he had been brought up in Jerusalem,
and had been before acquainted with the Sanhedrin [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md), he would have an acquaintance,
doubtless, with the character of most of those present, though he had
been absent from them for fourteen years, [Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md).

The one part ... - That the council was divided into two parts,
Pharisees and Sadducees. This was commonly the case, though it was
uncertain which had the majority. In regard to the opinions of these two
sects, see the notes on [Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

He cried out ... - The reasons why Paul resolved to take advantage of
their difference of opinion were, probably:

\(1\) That he saw that it was impossible to expect justice at their
hands, and he therefore regarded it as prudent and proper to consult his
own safety. He saw, from the conduct of Ananias, and from the spirit
manifested [Act 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004.md), that they, like
the other Jews, had prejudged the case, and were driven on by blind rage
and fury.

\(2\) his object was to show his innocence to the chief captain. To
ascertain that was the purpose for which he had been arraigned. Yet
that, perhaps, could be most directly and satisfactorily shown by
bringing out, as he knew he could do, the real spirit which actuated the
whole council, as a spirit of party strife, contention, and persecution.
Knowing, therefore, how sensitive they were on the subject of the
resurrection, he seems to have resolved to do what he would not have
done had they been disposed to hear him according to the rules of
justice - to abandon the direct argument for his defense, and to enlist
a large part, perhaps a majority of the council, in his favor. Whatever
may be thought of the propriety of this course, it cannot be denied that
it was a masterstroke of policy, and that it evinced a profound
knowledge of human nature.

I am a Pharisee - That is, I was of that sect among the Jews. I was born
a Pharisee, and I ever continued while a Jew to be of that sect. In the
main he agreed with them still. He did not mean to deny that he was a
Christian, but that, so far as the Pharisees differed from the
Sadducees, he was with the former. He agreed with them, not with the
Sadducees, in regard to the doctrine of the resurrection, and the
existence of angels and spirits.

The son of a Pharisee - What was the name of his father is not known.
But the meaning is, simply, that he was entitled to all the immunities
and privileges of a Pharisee. He had, from his birth, belonged to that
sect, nor had he ever departed from the great cardinal doctrine which
distinguished that sect - the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.
Compare [Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md).

Of the hope and resurrection of the dead - That is, of the hope that the
dead will be raised. This is the real point of the opposition to me.

I am called in question - Greek: I am judged; that is, I am persecuted,
or brought to trial. Orobio charges this upon Paul as an artful manner
of declining persecution, unworthy the character of an upright and
honest man. Chubb, a British Deist of the seventeenth century, charges
it upon Paul as an act of gross "dissimulation, as designed to conceal
the true ground of all the troubles that he had brought upon himself,
and as designed to deceive and impose upon the Jews." He affirms also
that "Paul probably invented this pretended charge against himself to
draw over a party of the unbelieving Jews unto him." See Chubb's
Posthumous Works, vol. ii. p. 238. Now, in reply to this, we may
observe:

\(1\) That there is not the least evidence that Paul denied that he had
been, or was then, a Christian. An attempt to deny this, after all that
they knew of him, would have been vain; and there is not the slightest
hint that he attempted it.

\(2\) the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was the main and
leading doctrine which he had insisted on, and which had been to him the
cause of much of his persecution. See [Act
17:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md); 1 Cor. 15; [Act
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034.md); [Act
26:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md), [Act
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023.md), [Act
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025.md).

\(3\) Paul defended this by an argument which he deemed invincible; and
which constituted, in fact, the principal evidence of its truth - the
fact that the Lord Jesus had been raised. That fact had fully confirmed
the doctrine of the Pharisees that the dead would rise. As Paul had
everywhere proclaimed the fact that Jesus had been raised up, and as
this had been the occasion of his being opposed, it was true that he had
been persecuted on account of that doctrine.

\(4\) the real ground of the opposition Which the Sadducees made to him,
and of their opposition to his doctrine, was the additional zeal with
which he urged this doctrine, and the additional argument which he
brought for the resurrection of the dead. Perhaps the cause of the
opposition of this great party among the Jews the Sadducees - to
Christianity, was the strong confirmation which the resurrection of
Christ gave to the doctrine which they so much hated - the doctrine of
the resurrection of the dead. It thus gave a triumph to their opponents
among the Pharisees, and Paul, as a leading and zealous advocate of that
doctrine, would excite their special hatred.

\(5\) all that Paul said, therefore, was strictly true. It was because
he advocated this doctrine that he was opposed. That there were other
causes of opposition to him might be true also; but still this was the
main and prominent cause of the hostility.

\(6\) with great propriety, therefore, he might address the Pharisees
and say, "Brethren, the doctrine which has distinguished you from the
Sadducees is at stake. The doctrine which is at the foundation of all
our hopes - the resurrection of the dead; the doctrine of our fathers,
of the Scriptures, of our sect, is in danger. Of that doctrine I have
been the advocate. I have never denied it. I have everywhere defended
it, and have devoted myself to the work of putting it on an imperishable
basis among the Jews and the Gentiles. For my zeal in that I have been
opposed. I have excited the ridicule of the Gentile and the hatred of
the Sadducee. I have thus been persecuted and arraigned; and for my zeal
in urging the argument in defense of it which I have deemed most
irrefragable the resurrection of the Messiah - I have been arraigned,
and now cast myself on your protection against the mad zeal of the
enemies of the doctrine of our fathers." Not only, therefore, was this
an act of policy and prudence in Paul, but what he affirmed was strictly
true, and the effect was as he had anticipated.

[Acts 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 23:7</span></span>

A dissension - A dispute, or difference.

And the multitude - The council. Compare [Act
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#004.md). The Pharisees embraced, as he
desired and expected, his side of the question, and became his
advocates, in opposition to the Sadducees, who were arrayed against him.

[Acts 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 23:8</span></span>

For the Sadducees say - They believe.

No resurrection - Of the dead. By this doctrine they also understood
that there was no future state, and that the soul did not exist after
death. See the notes on [Mat 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md).

Neither angel - That there are no angels. They deny the existence of
good or bad angels. See the notes on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

Nor spirit - Nor soul. That there is nothing but matter. They were
materialists, and supposed that all the operations which we ascribe to
mind could be traced to some modification of matter. The Sadducees, says
Josephus (Jewish Wars, book ii. chapter 8, section 14), "take away the
belief of the immortal duration of the soul, and the punishments and
rewards in Hades." "The doctrine of the Sadducees is this," says he
(Antiq., book 18, chapter 1, section 4), "that souls die with the
bodies." The opinion that the soul is material, and that there is
nothing but matter in the universe, has been held by many philosophers,
ancient and modern, as well as by the Sadducees.

Confess both - Acknowledge, or receive both as true; that is, that there
is a future state, and that there are spirits distinct from matter, as
angels, and the disembodied souls of people. The two points in dispute
were:

\(1\) Whether the dead would be raised and exist in a future state; and,

\(2\) Whether mind was distinct from matter. The Sadducees denied both,
and the Pharisees believed both. Their belief of the Latter point was,
that spirits existed in two forms - that of angels, and that of souls of
people distinct from the body.

[Acts 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 23:9</span></span>

A great cry - A great clamor and tumult.

The scribes - The learned men. They would naturally be the chief
speakers.

Of the Pharisees' part - Who were Pharisees, or who belonged to that
party. The scribes were not a distinct sect, but might be either
Pharisees or Sadducees.

We find no evil in this man - No opinion which is contrary to the Law of
Moses; no conduct in spreading the doctrine of the resurrection which we
do not approve. The importance of this doctrine, in their view, was so
great as to throw into the background all the other doctrines that Paul
might hold; and, provided this were propagated, they were willing to
vindicate and sustain him. A similar testimony was offered to the
innocence of the Saviour by Pilate, [Joh
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#006.md).

But if a spirit or an angel ... - They here referred, doubtless, to what
Paul had said in [Act 22:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md). He had
declared that he had gone among the I Gentiles in obedience to a command
which he received in a vision in the temple. As the Pharisees held to
the belief of spirits and angels, and to the doctrine that the will of
God was often delivered to people by their agency, they were ready now
to admit that he had received such a communication, and that he had gone
among the Gentiles in obedience to it, to defend their great doctrine of
the resurrection of the dead. We are not to suppose that the Pharisees
had become the friends of Paul or of Christianity. The true solution of
their conduct doubtless is, that they were so inflamed with hatred
against the Sadducees that they were willing to make use of any argument
against their doctrine. As the testimony of Paul might be turned to
their account, they were willing to vindicate him. It is remarkable,
too, that they perverted the statement of Paul in order to oppose the
Sadducees. Paul had stated distinctly [Act
22:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md) that he had been commanded to
go by the Lord, meaning the Lord Jesus. He had said nothing of "a spirit
or an angel." Yet they would unite with the Sadducees so far as to
maintain that he had received no such command from the Lord Jesus. But
they might easily vary his statements, and suppose that an "angel or a
spirit" had spoken to him, and thus make use of his conduct as an
argument against the Sadducees. Men are not always very careful about
the exact correctness of their statements when they wish to humble a
rival.

Let us not fight against God - See the notes on [Act
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039.md). These words are missing in many
mss. and in some of the ancient versions. The Syriac reads it, "If a
spirit or an angel have spoken to him, what is there in this?" that is,
what is there unusual or wrong?

[Acts 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 23:10</span></span>

A great dissension - A great tumult, excitement, or controversy.

Into the castle - See the notes on [Act
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md).

[Acts 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 23:11</span></span>

The Lord stood by him - Evidently the Lord Jesus. See the notes on [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md). Compare [Act
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#018.md). The appearance of the Lord in
this case was a proof that he approved the course which Paul had taken
before the Sanhedrin.

Be of good cheer - It would not be remarkable if Paul, by these constant
persecutions, should be dejected in mind. The issue of the whole matter
was as yet doubtful. In these circumstances, it must have been
especially consoling to him to hear these words of encouragement from
the Lord Jesus, and this assurance that the object of his desires would
be granted, and that he would be permitted to bear the same witness of
him in Rome. Nothing else can comfort and sustain the soul in trials and
persecutions but evidence of the approbation of God, and the promises of
his gracious aid.

Bear witness also at Rome - This had been the object of his earnest wish
[Rom 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md); [Rom
15:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md), and this promise of the Lord
Jesus was fulfilled, [Act 28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md).
The promise which was here made to Paul was not directly one of
deliverance from the present persecution, but it implied that, and made
it certain.

[Acts 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 23:12</span></span>

Certain of the Jews - Some of the Jews. They were more than forty in
number, [Act 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#013.md).

Banded together - Made an agreement or compact. They conspired to kill
him.

And bound themselves under a curse - See the margin. The Greek is, "they
anathematized themselves"; that is, they bound themselves by a solemn
oath. They invoked a curse on themselves, or devoted themselves to
destruction, if they did not do it. Lightfoot remarks, however, that
they could be absolved from this vow by the rabbis if they were unable
to execute it. Under various pretences they could easily be freed from
such oaths, and it was common to take them; and if there was any
difficulty in fulfilling them, they could easily apply to their
religious teachers and be absolved.

That they would neither eat nor drink - That is, that they would do it
as soon as possible. This was a common form of an oath, or curse, among
the Jews. Sometimes they only vowed abstinence from particular things,
as from meat, or wine. But in this case, to make the oath more certain
and binding, they vowed abstinence from all kinds of food and drink
until they had killed him. Who these were - whether they were Sadducees
or not - is not mentioned by the sacred writer. It is evident, however,
that the minds of the Jews were greatly inflamed against Paul; and as
they saw him in the custody of the Roman tribune, and as there was no
prospect that he would punish him, they resolved to take the matter into
their own hands. Michaelis conjectures that they were of the number of
the Sicarii, or cutthroats, with which Judea then abounded. See the
notes on [Act 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md). It is needless to
remark that this was a most wicked oath. It was a deliberate purpose to
commit murder; and it shows the desperate state of morals among the Jews
at that time, and the infuriated malice of the people against the
apostle, that such an oath could have been taken.

[Acts 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 23:13</span></span>

Which had made this conspiracy - This oath συνωμοσίαν sunōmosian, this
agreement, or compact. This large number of desperate men, bound by so
solemn an oath, would be likely to be successful, and the life of Paul
was therefore in special danger. The manner in which they purposed to
accomplish their design is stated in [Act
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015.md).

[Acts 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 23:14</span></span>

And they came ... - Probably by a deputation.

To the chief priests and elders - The members of the Great Council, or
Sanhedrin. It is probable that the application was made to the party of
the Sadducees, as the Pharisees had shown their determination to defend
Paul. They would have had no prospect of success had they attacked the
castle, and they therefore devised this mode of obtaining access to
Paul, where they might easily despatch him.

Under a great curse - Greek: "We have anathematized ourselves with an
anathema." We have made the vow as solemn as possible.

[Acts 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 23:15</span></span>

Ye, with the council - With the concurrence or request of the Sanhedrin.
It was only by such a request that they had any hope that the chief
captain would remove Paul from the castle.

Signify to the chief captain - Send a message or request to him.

That he bring him down unto you - That he bring him from the castle to
the usual place of the meeting of the Sanhedrin. As this was at some
distance from the castle of Antonia, where Paul was, they supposed it
would be easy to waylay him and take his life.

To-morrow - This is missing in the Syriac, Vulgate, and Ethiopic
versions. It is, however, probably the correct reading of the text, as
it would be necessary to convene the council, and make the request of
the tribune, which might require the whole of one day.

As though ye would inquire ... - This request appeared so reasonable
that they did not doubt that the tribune would grant it to the council.
And though it was obviously a false and wicked pretence, yet these
conspirators knew the character of the persons to whom they addressed
themselves so well that they did not doubt that they would prevail on
the council to make the request. Public justice must have been deeply
fallen when it was known that such an iniquitous request could be made
with the certain prospect of success.

Or ever he come near - Before he comes near to the Sanhedrin. The Great
Council will thus not be suspected of being privy to the deed. We will
waylay him, and murder him in the way. The plan was well laid; and
nothing but the interposition of Providence could have prevented its
execution.

[Acts 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 23:16</span></span>

Paul's sister's son - This is all that we know of the family of Paul.
Nor do we know for what purpose he was at Jerusalem. It is possible that
Paul might have a sister residing there; though, as Paul himself had
been sent there formerly for his education, it seems more probable that
this young man was sent there for the same purpose.

Entered into the castle - Paul had the privileges of a Roman citizen,
and as no well-founded charge had been laid against him, it is probable
that he was not very closely confined, and that his friends might have
free access to him.

[Acts 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 23:17</span></span>

Called one of the centurions - Who might at that time have had special
charge of the castle, or been on guard. Paul had the most positive
divine assurance that his life would be spared, and that he would yet
see Rome; but he always understood the divine promises and purposes as
being consistent with his own efforts, and with all proper measures of
prudence and diligence in securing his own safety. He did not rest
merely on the divine promises without any effort of his own, but he took
encouragement from those promises to put forth his own exertions for
security and for salvation.

[Acts 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 23:18</span></span>

And prayed me - And asked me.

[Acts 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 23:19</span></span>

Took him by the hand - As an expression of kindness and civility. He did
it to draw him aside from the multitude, that he might communicate his
message privately.

[Acts 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 23:20</span></span>

And he said ... - In what way this young man had received intelligence
of this, we can only conjecture. It is not improbable that he was a
student under some one of the Jewish teachers, and that he might have
learned it of him. It is not at all probable that the purpose of the 40
men would be very closely kept. Indeed, it is evident that they were not
themselves very anxious about concealing their oath, as they mentioned
it freely to the chief priests and elders, [Act
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#014.md).

[Acts 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 23:21</span></span>

Looking for a promise from thee - Waiting for your consent to bring him
down to them.

[Acts 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 23:23</span></span>

And he called unto him two centurions ... - Each centurion had under him
100 men. The chief captain resolved to place Paul beyond the power of
the Jews, and to protect him as became a Roman citizen.

Two hundred soldiers - These foot soldiers were designed only to guard
Paul until he was safely out of Jerusalem. The horsemen only were
intended to accompany him to Caesarea. See [Act
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#032.md).

And horsemen - These were commonly attached to foot soldiers. In this
case, however, they were designed to attend Paul to Caesarea.

And spearmen - δεξιολάβους dexiolabous." This word is found nowhere else
in the New Testament, and occurs in no Classical writer. It properly
means those who take, or apprehend by the right hand; and might be
applied to those who apprehend prisoners, or to those who hold a spear
or dart in the right hand for the purpose of throwing it. Some have
conjectured that it should be read δεξιοβόλους dexiobolous - those who
cast or throw (a spear) with the right hand. So the Vulgate, the Syriac,
and the Arabic understand it. They were probably those who were armed
with spears or darts, and who attended on the tribune as a guard.

At the third hour of the night - At nine o'clock. This was in order that
it might be done with secrecy, and to elude the band of desperadoes that
had resolved to murder Paul. If it should seem that this guard was very
numerous for one man, it should be remembered:

\(1\) That the number of those who had conspired against him was also
large; and,

\(2\) That they were men accustomed to scenes of blood; men of desperate
characters who had solemnly sworn that they would take his life.

In order, therefore, to deter them effectually from attacking the guard,
it was made very numerous and strong. Nearly 500 men were appointed to
guard Paul as he left Jerusalem.

[Acts 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 23:24</span></span>

And provide them beasts - One for Paul, and one for each of his
attendants. The word translated "beasts" κτήνη ktēnē is of a general
character, and may be applied either to horses, camels, or donkeys. The
latter were most commonly employed in Judea.

Unto Felix the governor - The governor of Judea. His place of residence
was Caesarea, about 60 miles from Jerusalem. See the notes on [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md). His name was Antonius Felix. He
was a freedman of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius. He was
high in the favor of Claudius, and was made by him governor of Judea.
Josephus calls him Claudius Felix. He had married three wives in
succession that were of royal families, one of whom was Drusilla,
afterward mentioned in [Act 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#024.md), who
was sister to King Agrippa. Tacitus (History, v. 9) says that he
governed with all the authority of a king, and the baseness and
insolence of a slave. "He was an unrighteous governor, a base,
mercenary, and bad man" (Clarke). See his character further described in
the notes on [Act 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md).

[Acts 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 23:26</span></span>

Unto the most excellent governor Felix - The most honored, etc. This was
a mere title of office.

Greeting - A term of salutation in an epistle wishing health, joy, and
prosperity.

[Acts 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 23:27</span></span>

Should have been killed of them - Was about to be killed by them. The
life of Paul had been twice endangered in this manner, [Act
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md); [Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md).

With an army - With a band of soldiers, [Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md).

[Acts 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 23:29</span></span>

Questions of their law - So he understood the whole controversy to be.

Worthy of death - By the Roman law. He had been guilty of no crime
against the Roman people.

Or of bonds - Of chains, or of confinement.

[Acts 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 23:31</span></span>

To Antipatris - This town was anciently called Cafar-Saba. Josephus says
(Antiq., [Act 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023).md) that it was about
17 miles from Joppa. It was about 26 miles from Caesarea, and, of
course, about 35 miles from Jerusalem. Herod the Great changed its name
to Antipatris, in honor of his father Antipater. It was situated in a
fine plain, and watered with many springs and fountains. Eli Smith, late
missionary to Palestine, who took a journey from Jerusalem to Joppa for
the purpose of ascertaining Paul's route, supposes that the site of
Antipatris is the present Kefr Saba. Of this village he gives the
following description in the Bibliotheca Sacra for 1843: "It is a Muslim
village of considerable size, and wholly like the most common villages
of the plain, being built entirely of mud. We saw but one stone
building, which was apparently a mosque, but without a minaret. No old
ruins, nor the least relic of antiquity, did we anywhere discover. A
well by which we stopped, a few rods east of the houses, exhibits more
signs of careful workmanship than anything else. It is walled with hewn
stone, and is 57 feet deep to the water. The village stands upon a
slight circular eminence near the western hills, from which it is
actually separated, however, by a branch of the plain."

[Acts 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 23:32</span></span>

They left the horsemen - As they were then beyond the danger of the
conspirators, the soldiers who had guarded them thus far returned to
Jerusalem.

[Acts 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 23:34</span></span>

Of what province he was - Greek: of what heparchy ἐπαρχίας eparchias he
was. He knew from the letter of Lysias that he was a Roman, but he was
not informed of what place or province he was. This he doubtless did in
order to ascertain whether he properly belonged to his jurisdiction.
Roman provinces were districts of country which were entrusted to the
jurisdiction of procurators. How far the jurisdiction of Felix extended
is not certainly known. It appears, however, that it included Cilicia.

Was of Cilicia - Tarsus, the birthplace of Paul, was in this province,
[Act 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md).

[Acts 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 23:35</span></span>

In Herod's judgment hall - Greek: in the praetorium of Herod. The word
used here denoted formerly "the tent of the Roman praetor"; and since
that was the place where justice was administered, it came to be applied
to "halls (courts) of justice." This had been raised probably by Herod
the Great as his palace, or as a place for administering justice. It is
probable, also, that prisons, or places of security, would be attached
to such places.
