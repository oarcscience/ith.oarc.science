### [Jeremiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 27:0</span></span>

In Jer. 27-29 we see with what energy, and yet thoughtfulness, Jeremiah
enforced the lessons of Jer. 25. These chapters belong to the first four
years of Zedekiah.

The spelling of certain proper names in these chapters has led some to
argue that they were revised and corrected in Ezra's time, if not by
Ezra himself. Others think the fact of no importance whatever.

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

Of Jehoiakim - Really, of Zedekiah, as the Syriac reads (see [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003).md). In the Septuagint the verse is
missing. Some scribe has confused the title of this chapter with that of
Jer. 26.

[Jeremiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 27:2</span></span>

Yokes - Two curved pieces of wood, the one put over the neck of the ox,
the other under, and then fastened together by bonds or cords (compare
[Psa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003).md). Compare the marginal
references.

[Jeremiah 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 27:3</span></span>

Come - Or, are come. The ambassadors of these five kings had probably
come to Jerusalem to consult about forming a league to throw off the
Babylonian supremacy. The attempt failed.

[Jeremiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 27:7</span></span>

His son, and his son's son - Evil-Merodach and Nabonadius (see [Dan
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001) note.md).

Shall serve themselves of him - See the marginal reference. After long
servitude to the Persian and Median kings, the Selucidae ruined the
remains of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 27:9</span></span>

Dreamers - literally, as in the margin. People dream dreams for
themselves, and go to diviners to ask the explanation of them.

[Jeremiah 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 27:10</span></span>

To remove you far ... - That would be the result of their vaticinations.

[Jeremiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 27:11</span></span>

Nations ... - Rather, the nation.

[Jeremiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 27:13</span></span>

Zedekiah was restless under the Babylonian yoke, and the false prophets
found only too ready a hearing from him. He is addressed in the plural
because his feelings were fully shared by the mass of the officers of
state and by the people.
