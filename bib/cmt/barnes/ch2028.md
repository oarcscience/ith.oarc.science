### [2 Chronicles Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 28:1</span></span>

This chapter is supplemental in character, The writer seems to assume
that the narrative of Kings (marginal reference) is known, and is mainly
anxious to add points which the author of that narrative has omitted.

[2 Chronicles 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 28:2</span></span>

Images for Baalim - Or, to serve as Baalim, i. e as representatives of
the different forms or characters of the chief Phoenician deity.

[2 Chronicles 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 28:3</span></span>

Compare the [Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 28:4</span></span>

He sacrificed also etc - Compare [Kg2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 28:5</span></span>

The two battles here mentioned, one with Rezin (king of Syria), and the
other with Pekah (king of Israel) are additions to the narrative of the
writer of Kings (marginal reference "g"). The events of the
Syro-Israelite war were probably spread over several years.

[2 Chronicles 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 28:6</span></span>

The fearful loss here described may have been due to a complete defeat
followed by panic.

[2 Chronicles 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 28:7</span></span>

Maaseiah was either an officer called "the king's son" (compare [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026).md), or perhaps a son of Jotham,
since Ahaz could hardly have had a son old enough to take part in the
battle (compare [Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001).md).

Elkanah, as "second to the king," was probably the chief of the royal
counselors.

[2 Chronicles 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 28:9</span></span>

Nothing more is known of this Oded. Compare [Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md).

He went out before the host - Rather, "He went out to meet the host," as
the same phrase is translated in [Ch2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002.md).

A rage that reacheth up to heaven - i. e. not merely an exceedingly
great and violent rage, but one that has displeased God.

[2 Chronicles 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 28:10</span></span>

Are there not with you ... sins against the Lord? - The ten tribes had
fallen away from the true faith far more completely and more hopelessly
than the two. It was not for them to press hard against their erring
brothers, and aggravate their punishment.

[2 Chronicles 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 28:12</span></span>

"Ephraim" is used herein the generic sense so common in the prophets, as
synonymous with the ten tribes.

[2 Chronicles 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 28:15</span></span>

Jericho, which lies much farther from Samaria than many points of the
territory of Judah, was perhaps selected because the captives had been
carried off principally from this point; or because there may have been
less danger of falling in with portions of Pekah's army on this than on
the direct route.

[2 Chronicles 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 28:17</span></span>

The Edomites took advantage of the reverses of Ahaz, and were perhaps in
league with Rezin (see [Kg2 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006.md)
note). The pitilessness of Edom, and her readiness to turn against Judah
in any severe distress, is noticed and sternly rebuked by the prophets
([Amo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md); [Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md); [Oba
1:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010), etc..md).

[2 Chronicles 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 28:18</span></span>

Philistia also, eager to retaliate the blows she had received from
Uzziah [Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md), seized her
opportunity. Ajalon and Shocho were among the cities fortified by
Rehoboam [Ch2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#007.md), [Ch2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#010.md); Beth-shemesh [Jos
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md) was famous as the scene of
Amaziah's defeat [Ch2 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#021.md). Gimzo,
which is not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture has been probably
identified with the modern Jimzu, a large village about 2 12 miles from
Ludd (the ancient Lydda).

[2 Chronicles 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 28:19</span></span>

Ahaz king of Israel - An instance of the lax use of the word "Israel"
[Ch2 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md); [Ch2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md). It is simply equivalent to "king
of Judah."

He made Judah naked - literally, "he had caused licentiousness in Judah"
- i. e. he had allowed Judah to break loose from all restraints of true
religion, and to turn to any idolatry that they preferred [Ch2
28:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md). In this and in the following
expression there is implied an apostasy resembling the unfaithfulness of
a wife.

[2 Chronicles 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 28:20</span></span>

Tilgath-pilneser - This form of the name is doubly corrupt. See the
properly Hebraized form in [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md).

Distressed him, but strengthened him not - This statement, and that at
the end of [Ch2 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#021.md), is supplemental
to, and not contradictory of, [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md). Here it is the writer's object
to note that the material assistance rendered by Tiglath-pileser to
Ahab, was no real "help" or "strength," but rather a cause of
"distress."

[2 Chronicles 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 28:23</span></span>

His adoption of the Syrian gods, Hadad, Rimmon, and others, as objects
of worship, no doubt preceded the destruction of Damascus by the
Assyrians [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md).

Israel - i. e. "Judah;" so in [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md). Compare [Ch2
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019.md).

[2 Chronicles 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 28:24</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md) note. The
temple-worship was suspended, the lamps put out, and the doors shut, to
prevent the priests from entering. The Jews still celebrate a yearly
fast in commemoration of this time of affliction.

Altars - As the one altar for sacrifice, which alone the Law allowed,
symbolized the doctrine of one God, so these many altars spoke
unmistakeably of the all-embracing polytheism affected by Ahaz.
