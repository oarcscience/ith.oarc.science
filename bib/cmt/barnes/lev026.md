### [Leviticus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001)

[Leviticus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 26:1</span></span>

Idols - literally, "things of nought." Hebrew אלילים 'ĕlı̂ylı̂m. There
appears to have been a play on the similarity in sound of this word to
אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym (God). Compare [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).

Standing image - Either an upright statue, or a pillar, such as an
obelisk or a Celtic menhir, set up for an idolatrous purpose (compare
[Exo 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013) note). The public worship
of Yahweh required, first, the exclusion of all visible symbols of deity
as well as of all idolatrous objects, and next [Lev
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#002), the keeping holy the times and
the place appointed by the Law for His formal service. The word
"sabbaths" must here include the whole of the set times. See [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003) note.

[Leviticus 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 26:3</span></span>

As "the book of the covenant" Exo. 20:22-23:33 concludes with promises
and warnings [Exo 23:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020), so does
this collection of laws contained in the Book of Leviticus. But the
former passage relates to the conquest of the land of promise, this one
to the subsequent history of the nation. The longer similar passage in
Deuteronomy Deut. 27-30 is marked by broader and deeper promises and
denunciations having immediate reference not only to outward
consequences, but to the spiritual death incurred by transgressing the
divine will.

[Lev 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004)

Rain in due season - The periodical rains, on which the fertility of the
holy land so much depends, are here spoken of. There are two wet
seasons, called in Scripture the former and the latter rain [Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014); [Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023); [Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003); [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007). The former or Autumn rain falls
in heavy showers in November and December. In March the latter or Spring
rain comes on, which is precarious in quantity and duration, and rarely
lasts more than two days.

[Lev 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005)

Compare the margin reference; [Joe
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#019); [Job
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018).

[Lev 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008)

Five of you shall chase - A proverbial mode of expression for
superiority in warlike prowess [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030); [Isa
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017).

[Lev 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#009)

Establish my covenant - All material blessings were to be regarded in
the light of seals of the "everlasting covenant." Compare [Gen
17:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004); [Neh
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#023).

[Lev 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010)

Bring forth the old because of the new - Rather, clear away the old
before the new; that is, in order to make room for the latter. Compare
the margin reference.

[Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016)

The first warning for disobedience is disease. "Terror" (literally
trembling) is rendered trouble in [Psa
78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033); [Isa
65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023). It seems here to denote that
terrible affliction, an anxious temperament, the mental state ever at
war with Faith and Hope. This might well be placed at the head of the
visitations on a backslider who had broken the covenant with his God.
Compare [Deu 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025); [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008); [Pro
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001); [Job
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).

Consumption, and the burning ague - Compare the margin reference. The
first of the words in the original comes from a root signifying to waste
away; the latter (better, fever), from one signifying to kindle a fire.
Consumption is common in Egypt and some parts of Asia Minor, but it is
more rare in Syria. Fevers of different kinds are the commonest of all
diseases in Syria and all the neighboring countries. The opposite
promise to the threat is given in [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026); [Exo
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#025).

[Lev 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018)

For all this - i. e. for all the afflictions in [Lev
26:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016).

Seven times - The sabbatical number is here proverbially used to remind
the people of the covenant. Compare [Gen
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015), [Gen
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024); [Psa
119:164](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#164); [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016); [Luk
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#004).

[Lev 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019), [Lev
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020)

The second warning is utter sterility of the soil. Compare [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017); [Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018); [Eze
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#028); [Eze
36:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#034).

[Lev 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021), [Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022)

The third warning is the multiplication of destructive animals, etc.
Compare [Deu 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024); [Eze
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017); [Eze
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#015); [Jdg
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006); [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008).

[Lev 26:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023)

The fourth warning. Yahweh now places Himself as it were in a hostile
position toward His people who "will not be reformed" (rather, brought
unto God: [Jer 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030)). He will avenge
the outraged cause of His covenant, by the sword, pestilence, famine,
and captivity.

[Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026)

Omit "and." "To break the staff of bread," was a proverbial expression
for cutting off the supply of bread, the staff of life ([Psa
105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016); [Eze
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016); [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016); [Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013); compare [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001)). The supply was to be so reduced
that one oven would suffice for baking the bread maple by ten women for
ten families, and when made it was to be dealt out in sparing rations by
weight. See [Kg2 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025); [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018); [Lam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009); [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012); [Hos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010); [Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014); [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006).

[Lev 26:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#027)

The fifth warning. For [Lev 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029) see
[Kg2 6:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#028); [Jer
19:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008); [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020); [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010); [Eze
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010), for [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030) see [Ch2
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003); [Eze
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004); [Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019), for [Lev
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031) see [Kg2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009); [Psa
74:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006) : for [Lev
26:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#032) see [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037); [Psa
44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011); [Jer
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016); [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016); Ezek. 5:1-17; [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007); [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006); [Eze
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015); [Zac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014).

[Lev 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030)

High places - There is no doubt that the word here denotes elevated
spots dedicated to false worship (see [Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002)), and especially, it would seem,
to that of Baal [Num 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041); [Jos
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017). Such spots were, however,
employed and approved for the worship of Yahweh, not only before the
building of the temple, but afterward ([Jdg
6:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025); [Jdg
13:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016); [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010); [Sa1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#005); [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002); [Kg1
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#030); [Kg2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003); [Ch1
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026), etc.). The three altars built
by Abraham at Shechem, between Bethel and Ai, and at Mamre, appear to
have been on heights, and so was the temple.

The high places in the holy land may thus have been divided into those
dedicated to the worship of Yahweh, and those which had been dedicated
to idols. And it would seem as if there was a constant struggle going
on. The high places polluted by idol worship were of course to be wholly
condemned. They were probably resorted to only to gratify a degraded
superstition. See [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031); [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002). The others might have been
innocently used for prayer and religious teaching. But the temptation
appears to have been too great for the temper of the people. They
offered sacrifice and burnt incense on them; and hence, thorough
reformers of the national religion, such as Hezekiah and Josiah, removed
the high places altogether [Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004);
[Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005).

Your images - The original word is rendered in the margin of our Bible
sun images ([Ch2 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005); [Isa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008); [Eze
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004), etc.). Phoenician inscriptions
prove that the word was commonly applied to images of Baal and Astarte,
the god of the sun and the goddess of the moon. This exactly explains
[Ch2 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004) following.

Idols - The Hebrew word here literally means things which could be
rolled about, such as a block of wood or a lump of dirt. It was no doubt
a name given in derision. Compare [Isa
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020); [Isa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#019); [Kg2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002).

[Lev 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031)

Sanctuaries - The holy places in the tabernacle and the temple ([Psa
68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035). Compare [Psa
74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007)).

I will not smell the savor ... - See [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009).

[Lev 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#035)

More literally: All the days of its desolation shall it rest that time
which it rested not in your Sabbaths while ye dwelt upon it. That is,
the periods of rest of which the land had been deprived would be made up
to it. Compare [Ch2 36:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#020).

[Lev 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038)

The land of your enemies shall eat you up - Compare [Num
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032); [Eze
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#013).

[Lev 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039)

Iniquity - The meaning here is, in the punishment of their iniquity,
and, in the next clause, in the punishment of the iniquity (as in [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041), [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043)) of their fathers. In the next
verse the same Hebrew word is properly represented by "iniquity." Our
translators have in several places put one of the English words in the
text and the other in the margin ([Gen
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013); [Gen
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015); [Kg2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#009); [Psa
69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027), etc.). The language of
Scripture does not make that trenchant division between sin and
punishment which we are accustomed to do. Sin is its own punishment,
having in itself, from its very commencement, the germ of death. "Sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth death" [Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015); [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005); [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).

[Lev 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040)

trespass - The Hebrew word signifies an injury inflicted on the rights
of a person, as distinguished from a sin or iniquity regarded as an
outrage of the divine law. Every wrong act is of course both a sin and a
trespass against God. In this place Yahweh takes the breach of the
covenant as a personal trespass.

[Lev 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041)

Uncircumcised hearts - The outward sign of the covenant might be
preserved, but the answering grace in the heart would be wanting ([Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051); [Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028); [Jer
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010); [Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026); compare [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011)).

Accept of the punishment of their iniquity - literally, enjoy their
iniquity. The word here and in [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043) rendered "accept" in this
phrase, is the same as is rendered "enjoy" in the expression "the land
shall enjoy her sabbaths" [Lev 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034).
The antithesis in [Lev 26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043) is this:
The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - and they shall enjoy the punishment
of their iniquity. The meaning is, that the land being desolate shall
have the blessing of rest, and they having repented shall have the
blessing of chastisement. The feelings of a devout captive Israelite are
beautifully expressed in Tobit 13:1-18.
