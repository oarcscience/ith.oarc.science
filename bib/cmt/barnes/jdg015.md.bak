### [Judges Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md)

[Judges 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 15:1</span></span>

Visited his wife with a kid - A common present (see [Gen
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#017.md); [Luk
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029).md). From Samson's wife being still
in her father's house, it would seem that she was only betrothed, not
actually married, to his companion.

[Judges 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 15:2</span></span>

I gave her - In marriage. Samson had probably not heard of this before.
Samson's father had paid the dowry for the older sister; her father
therefore offers her sister in her room. The fear of Samson probably
also influenced him.

[Judges 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 15:3</span></span>

See the margin. Before, when the Philistines injured him he was in
covenant with the Timnathites through his marriage and by the rites of
hospitality, for which reason he went off to Ashkelon to take his
revenge [Jdg 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019.md). But now the
Philistines themselves had broken this bond, and so he was free to take
his revenge on the spot.

[Judges 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 15:4</span></span>

Foxes - Rather, "jackals," which are still very common in Palestine,
especially about Joppa and Gaza. [Sa1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md) and [Jos
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#028.md); [Jos
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#003.md), are indications of the abundance
of foxes or jackals giving names to places, especially in the country of
the Phililstines. It belongs to Samson's character, and agrees with the
incident about the lion, that he should be an expert hunter. Ovid
relates a very curious custom at Rome of letting loose foxes with
lighted torches fastened to their tails in the circus at the Cerealia,
in commemoration of the damage once done to the standing grain by a fox
which a rustic had wrapped in hay and straw and set on fire, and which,
running away, put the grain-fields in a blaze. This custom, which may
have had a Phoenician origin, is a curious illustration of the
narrative.

[Judges 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 15:6</span></span>

burnt her and her father - Out of revenge on Samson's nearest relations;
or, as others think, as an act of justice in favor of Samson, and in
hope of pacifying his anger. Burning was the punishment for adultery and
kindred crimes among the Jews [Gen
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024.md); [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md); [Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md). Samson's wife brought upon
herself the very punishment which she sought to escape by betraying her
husband [Jdg 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015.md).

[Judges 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 15:8</span></span>

Hip and thigh - A proverbial expression of doubtful origin, meaning all
the "great" and "mighty," all the choice pieces like the thigh and
shoulder.

In the top of the rock - Rather, "the cleft of the rock." These clefts
of the rock were the natural fortresses and hiding places of the land.
([Isa 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021.md); [Isa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005.md). Compare [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md); [Kg1
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013)..md)

Etam - Not the same as the place in the territory of Simeon [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md). Its situation is uncertain, but
a site near Eleutheropolis ("Beth-jibrin") is required; and there exist
some extraordinary caverns in the soft limestone or chalky rock, fifteen
or twenty feet deep, with perpendicular sides, opening into extensive
excavations in the rock, about two hours from Eleutheropolis. (Conder
conjectures it to be the same as Atab, a village 12 miles southwest of
Jerusalem, in the ‛arkub or Ridge.)

[Judges 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 15:9</span></span>

Spread themselves - An expression used of the Philistine mode of war
[Sa2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018.md), [Sa2
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md), alluding to the compact way in
which they came up the wadys, and then distpersed. Lehi is so called by
anticipation (see [Jdg 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#017).md).

[Judges 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 15:11</span></span>

The dispirited men of Judah were prepared to give up their champion, in
order to conciliate their masters. This shows how hard was the task of
the Judge, whose office it was to restore his countrymen to freedom and
independence.

[Judges 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 15:14</span></span>

The cords ... became as flax ... - i. e. were as weak against his
strength as half-burned flax which yields to the least pressure.

[Judges 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 15:15</span></span>

Slew a thousand men therewith - Compare the marginal references. The
Philistines, seized with a panic at seeing Samson suddenly burst his
cords and rush at them, offered no resistance, but fell an easy prey to
the blows of their mighty foe. Some perhaps were dashed down the cliffs
in their flight.

[Judges 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 15:16</span></span>

There is a play upon the word, three times repeated, which means both
"an ass" and also "a heap." The spirit of riddle-making [Jdg
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md), [Jdg
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md) is apparent in this song of
triumph (compare [Jdg 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001.md); [Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md); [Sa1
18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md).

[Judges 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 15:17</span></span>

Ramath-lehi - Either the "height or hill of Lehi," or, "of the
jaw-bone;" or, as in the margin, "the crestlag away of the jaw-bone,"
with allusion to Samson casting it out of his hand, when he had finished
his war-song.

[Judges 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 15:19</span></span>

An hollow place that was in the jaw - The right translation is, "the
hollow place which is in Lehi." The word translated "hollow place,"
means a "mortar" [Pro 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022.md), and is
here evidently a hollow or basin among the cliffs of Lehi, which, from
its shape, was called "the mortar." A spring, on the way from Socho to
Eleutheropolis, was commonly called Samson's spring in the time of
Jerome and writers in the 7th, 12th, and 14th centuries.
