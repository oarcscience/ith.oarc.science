Introduction to the Minor Prophets, And Chiefly To Hosea

The twelve prophets, at the head of whom Hosea has been placed, were
called of old "the lesser, or minor prophets," by reason of the smaller
compass of their prophecies, not as though their prophecies were less
important than those of the four greater prophets . Hosea, at least,
must have exercised the prophetic office longer than any besides; he
must have spoken as much and as often, in the Name of God. A prophecy of
Micah and words of Joel are adopted by Isaiah; Jeremiah employs verses
of Obadiah to denounce anew the punishment of Edom; a prophecy of Joel
is expanded by Ezekiel. The "twelve" were the organs of important
prophecy, as to their own people, or foreign nations, or as to Him whom
they looked for, our Lord. Now, since the first five were earlier than
Isaiah, and next, in order of time, to the prophetic Psalms of David,
Solomon, Asaph and the sons of Korah, the revelations made to these
lesser prophets even ante-date those given through the four greater.

The general outpouring of the Spirit on all flesh and the Day of the
Lord were first spoken of by Joel. Our resurrection in Christ on the 3rd
day; the inward graces which Christ should bestow on His Church in its
perpetual union with Him; the entire victory over death and the grave;
and the final conversion of Judah and Israel, were first prophesied by
Hosea. When James wished to show that the conversion of the Gentiles had
been foretold by a prophet, he quoted a passage of Amos. "The twelve,"
as they begun, so they closed the cycle of those whom God employed to
leave written prophecies. Yet God, who willed that of all the earlier
prophets, who prophesied from the time of Samuel to Elisha, no prophecy
should remain, except the few words in the books of Kings, willed also,
that little, in comparison, should be preserved, of what these later
prophets spoke in His Name. Their writings altogether are not equal in
compass to those of the one prophet, Isaiah. And so, like the twelve
Apostles, they were enrolled in one prophetic band; their writings, both
in the Jewish and Christian Church (see Cosin. Section 47ff), have been
counted as one book; and, like the Apostles, they were called "the
twelve" (see Carpzov iii. 270, and Cosin).

The earliest of this band followed very closely upon the ministry of
Elijah and Elisha. Elisha, in his parting words [Kg2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md), [Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md). foretold to Joash the three
victories whereby he recovered from Syria the cities of Israel which
Hazael had taken from his father Jehoahaz. In the next reign, namely,
that of Jeroboam II, there arose the first of that brilliant
constellation of prophets, whose light gleamed over the fall of Israel
and Judah, shone in their captivity, and set at last, with the
prediction of him, who should precede the rising of the Sun of
Righteousness.

In the reign of Jeroboam II, Hosea, Amos, Jonah, prophesied in the
kingdom of Israel. Joel was probably called at the same time to prophesy
in Judah, and Obadiah to deliver his prophecy as to Edom; Isaiah, a few
years later. Micah, we know, began his office in the following reign of
Jotham, and then prophesied, together with Isaiah, to and in the reign
of Hezekiah.

The order, then, of "the twelve" was probably, for the most part, an
order of time. We know that the greater prophets are placed in that
order, as also the three last of the twelve, Haggai, Zechariah, and
Malachi. Of the five first, Hosea, Amos and Jonah were nearly
contemporary; Joel was prior to Amos ; and of the four remaining, Micah
and Nahum were later than Jonah, whom they succeed in order; Nahum
refers to Jonah; Zephaniah quotes Habakkuk. It may be from an old Jewish
tradition, that Jerome says , "know that those prophets, whose time is
not prefixed in the title, prophesied under the same kings, as those
other prophets, who are placed before them, and who have titles."

Hosea, the first of the twelve, must have prophesied during a period, as
long as the ordinary life of man. For he prophesied (the title tells us)
while Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam II, king of Israel, were both
reigning, as also during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. But
Uzziah survived Jeroboam, 26 years. Jotham and Ahaz reigned, each, 16
years. Thus, we have already 58 years complete, without counting the
years of Jeroboam, during which Hosea prophesied at the beginning of his
office, or those of Hezekiah which elapsed before its close. But since
the prophecy of Hosea is directed almost exclusively to Israel, it is
not probable that the name of Jeroboam would alone have been selected
for mention, unless Hosea had prophesied for some time during his reign.
The house of Jehu, which sunk after the death of Jeroboam, was yet [Jos
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md) standing, and in its full
strength, when Hosea first prophesied.

Its might apparently is contrasted with the comparative weakness of
Judah [Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md). On the other hand, the
office of Hosea probably closed before the end of the 4th year of
Hezekiah [Kg2 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md). For in that year,
721 b.c., the judgment denounced by Hosea upon Samaria was fulfilled,
and all his prophecy looks on to this event as yet to come: the 13th
chapter closes with the prophecy of the utter destruction of Samaria;
and of the horrible cruelties which would befall her helpless ones. The
last chapter alone winds up the long series of denunciations by a
prediction of the future conversion of Israel. This chapter, however, is
too closely connected with the preceding, to admit of its being a
consolation after the captivity had begun. If then we suppose that Hosea
prophesied during 2 years only of the reign of Hezekiah, and 10 of those
in which the reigns of Jeroboam II and Uzziah coincided, his ministry
will have lasted 70 years.

A long and heavy service for a soul full of love like his, mitigated
only by his hope of the coming of Christ, the final conversion of his
people, and the victory over the grave! But the length is nothing
incredible, since, about this time, Jehoiada [Ch2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015.md) "did good in Israel both toward
God and toward His House;" until he "was 130 years." The shortest
duration of Hosea's office must have been some 65 years. But if God
called him quite young to his office, he need but have lived about 95
years, whereas Anna the prophetess served God in the temple with fasting
and prayer night and day, after a widowhood probably of 84 years ; and
John the Evangelist lived probably until 104 years; and Polycarp became
a martyr when he was about 104 years old, having served Christ for 86
years , and having, when 95, sailed from Asia to Italy. Almost in our
own days, we have heard of 100 centenarians, deputed by a religious
order who ate no animal food, to bear witness that their rule of life
was not unhealthy. Not then the length of Hosea's life but his endurance
was superhuman. So long did God will that His prophets should toil; so
little fruit were they content to leave behind them. For these few
chapters alone remain of a labor beyond the ordinary life of man. But
they were content to have God for their exceeding great reward.

The time, during which Hosea prophesied, was the darkest period in the
history of the kingdom of Israel. Jeroboam II was almost the last king
who ruled in it by the appointment of God. The promise of God to Jehu
[Kg2 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md) in reward of his partial
obedience, that his [Kg2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md)
"children of the fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel,"
expired with Jeroboam's son, who reigned but for 6 months (see [Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), [Kg2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md), [Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md), [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030).md) after an anarchy of 11 years.
The rest of Hosea's life was passed amid the decline of the kingdom of
Israel. Politically all was anarchy or misrule; kings made their way to
the throne through the murder of their predecessors, and made way for
their successors through their own [Kg2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md). Shallum killed Zechariah;
Menahem killed Shallum; Pekah killed the son of Menahem; Hoshea killed
Pekah. The whole kingdom of Israel was a military despotism, and, as in
the Roman empire, those in command came to the throne. Baasha, Zimri,
Omri, Jehu, Menahem, Pekah, held military office before they became
kings [Kg2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014.md). Pekah was a captain
of Romaliah 2 Kings 16:25).

Each usurper seems to have strengthened himself by a foreign alliance.
At least, we find Baasha in league with Benhadad, king of Syria [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019.md); Ahab marrying Jezebel, daughter
of a king of Tyre and Zidon [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md); Menahem giving Pul king of
Assyria tribute, that he might "confirm the kingdom in his hand" [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); Pekah confederate with Rezin
[Isa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md), [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md), [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md); [Ch2
28:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005.md). These alliances brought with
them the corruptions of the Phoenician and Syrian idolatry, wherein
murder and lust became acts of religion. Jehu also probably sent tribute
to the king of Assyria, to secure to himself the throne which God had
given him. The fact appears in the cuneiform inscriptions ; it falls in
with the character of Jehu and his half belief, using all means, human
or divine, to establish his own end. In one and the same spirit, he
destroyed the Baal-worshippers, as adherents of Ahab, retained the
calf-worship, courted the ascetic Jonadab, son of Rechab, spoke of the
death of Jehoram as the fulfillment of prophecy, and sought help from
the king of Assyria.

These irreligions had the more deadly sway, because they were
countenanced by the corrupt worship, which Jeroboam I had set up as the
state religion, over against the worship at Jerusalem. To allow the
people to go up to Jerusalem, as the center of the worship of God, would
have risked their owning the line of David as the kings of God's
appointment. To prevent this, Jeroboam set up a great system of rival
worship. Himself a refugee in Egypt [Kg1
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040.md); [Kg1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#002.md), he had there seen nature (i. e.,
what are God's workings in nature) worshiped under the form of the calf
. He adopted it, in the words in which Aaron had been overborne to
sanction it, as the worship of the One True God under a visible form:
"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt" [Exo 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md); [Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md).

With great human subtlety, he laid hold of Israel's love for
idol-worship, and their reverence for their ancestors, and words which
even Aaron had used, and sought to replace, by this symbol of God's
working. His actual presence over the mercy-seat. Around this he
gathered as much of the Mosaic ritual as he could. The priests and
Levites remaining faithful to God [Ch2
11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md), he made others priests, not
of the line of Aaron . Then, while he gratified the love of idolatry, he
decked it out with all the rest of the worship which God had appointed
for Himself. He retained the feasts which God had appointed, the three
great festivals , their solemn assemblies, [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md) the new moons and sabbaths [Hos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md); and these last feasts were
observed even by those, to whose covetousness the rest on the festival
was a hindrance [Amo 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md).

Every kind of sacrifice was retained, the daily sacrifice, [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md) the burnt-offering, [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md) the meal-offering [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md); [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md), the drink-offering [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md), thank-offerings ([Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md), perhaps [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008).md), peace-offerings [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022.md), free-will offerings ([Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md), perhaps [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008).md), sin-offerings ([Amo
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md), and of this class generally, [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013).md). They had hymns and instrumental
music [Amo 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023.md); [Amo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md). They paid the tithes of the third
year [Amo 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md); probably they gave the
first fruits ; they had priests [Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md); [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md), [Hos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009.md); [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md); [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md) and prophets [Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md); [Hos
9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md) and temples [Kg1
12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md); [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md); the temple at Bethel was the
king's chapel, the temple of the state [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013.md).

The worship was maintained by the civil authority [Hos
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011.md); [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md). But all this outward show was
rotten at the core. God had forbidden man so to worship Him, nor was it
He who was worshiped at Bethel and Dan, though Jeroboam probably meant
it. People, when they alter God's truth, alter more than they think for.
Such is the lot of all heresy. Jeroboam probably meant that God should
be worshiped under a symbol, and he brought in a worship, which was not,
in truth, a worship of God at all. The calf was the symbol, not of the
personal God, but of ever-renewed life, His continued vivifying of all
which lives, and renewing of what decays. And so what was worshiped was
not God, but much what people now call "nature." The calf was a symbol
of "nature;" much as people say, "nature does this or that;" "nature
makes man so and so;" "nature useth simplicity of means;" "nature
provides," etc.; as if "nature were a sort of semi-deity," or creation
were its own Creator. As men now profess to own God, and do own Him in
the abstract, but talk of "nature," until they forget Him, or because
they forget Him, so Jeroboam, who was a shrewd, practical, irreligious
man, slipped into a worship of nature, while he thought, doubtless, he
was doing honor to the Creator, and professing a belief in Him.

But they were those same workings in creation, which were worshiped by
the neighboring pagan, in Baal and Ashtaroth; only there the name of the
Creator was altogether dropped. Yet it was but a step from one to the
other. The calf was the immediate and often the sole object of worship.
They "sacrificed to the calves" [Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md); "kissed the calves" [Hos
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md), in token of worship; swore by
them as living gods [Amo 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md). They had
literally [Psa 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020.md) "changed their
Glory (i. e., God) into the similitude of a bull which eateth hay."
Calf-worship paved the way for those coarser and more cruel worships of
nature, under the names of Baal and Ashtaroth, with all their
abominations of consecrated child-sacrifices, and degrading or horrible
sensuality. The worship of the calves led to sin. The pagan festival was
one of unbridled licentiousness. The account of the calf-festival in the
wilderness agrees too well with the pagan descriptions. The very least
which can be inferred from the words "Aaron had made them naked to their
shame before their enemies" [Exo
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md), is an extreme relaxedness, on
the borders of further sin.

And now in Hosea's time, these idolatries had yielded their full bitter
fruits. The course of iniquity had been run. The stream had become
darker and darker in its downward flow. Creature worship (as Paul points
out, Rom. 1), was the parent of every sort of abomination; and religion
having become creature-worship, what God gave as the check to sin became
its incentive. Every commandment of God was broken, and that,
habitually. All was falsehood [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md); [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md), [Hos
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#003.md), adultery [Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md); [Hos
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md); [Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md); [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md), bloodshedding [Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md); [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md); deceit to God [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md); [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md); [Hos
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md) produced faithlessness to man;
excess [Hos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md); [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md) and luxury [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md) were supplied by secret [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md); [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md) or open robbery [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md), oppression [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md); [Amo
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md); [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md), false dealing [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md); [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md), perversion of justice [Hos
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md); [Amo
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md); [Amo
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md), [Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012.md); [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003.md), [Amo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012.md), grinding of the poor [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md); [Amo
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006.md).

Blood was shed like water, until one stream met another [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md), and overspread the land with one
defiling deluge. Adultery was consecrated as an act of religion (see the
note at [Hos 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014).md). Those who were
first in rank were first in excess. People and king vied in debauchery
[Hos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md), and the Scottish king joined
and encouraged the free-thinkers and blasphemers of his court [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md). The idolatrous priests loved and
shared in the sins of the people [Hos
4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md); nay, they seem to have set
themselves to intercept those on either side of Jordan, who would go to
worship at Jerusalem, laying wait to murder them [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md); [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md). Corruption had spread throughout
the whole land [Hos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md); even the
places once sacred through God's revelations or other mercies to their
forefathers, Bethel [Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md), [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md); [Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md); [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md); [Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md), [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013.md), Gilgal [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); [Hos
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md), Gilead [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md), Mizpah [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md), Shechem (see the note at [Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009).md), were special scenes of
corruption or of sin. Every holy memory was effaced by present
corruption. Could things be worse? There was one aggravation more.
Remonstrance was useless [Hos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md); the
knowledge of God was willfully rejected [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md); the people hated rebuke [Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md); the more they were called, the
more they refused ([Hos 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002), add 7.md);
they forbade their prophets to prophesy [Amo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012.md); and their false prophets hated
God greatly [Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md), [Hos
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md). All attempts to heal all this
disease only showed its incurableness [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md).

Such was the condition of the people among whom Hosea had to prophesy
for some 70 years. They themselves were not sensible of their decay [Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md), moral or political. They set
themselves, in despite of the prophet's warning, to prop up their
strength by aid of the two pagan nations, Egypt or Assyria. In Assyria
they chiefly trusted ([Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md); [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md); and with Egypt, [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md), and Assyria, he had to denounce
to them, should carry them captive ([Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md); [Hos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009), denying it of Egypt.md); stragglers
at least, from them fled to Egypt [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), and in Egypt they should be a
derision [Hos 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md), and should find
their grave [Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md). This captivity
he had to foretell as imminent [Hos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md); [Hos
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md), certain [Hos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md); [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md), and irreversible [Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md); [Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md). Once only, in the commencement of
his prophecy, does he give any hope, that the temporal punishment might
be averted through repentance.

This too he follows up by renewing the declaration of God expressed in
the name of his daughter, "I will not have mercy" [Hos
1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md). He gives them in God's Name, a
distant promise of a spiritual restoration in Christ, and forewarns them
that it is distant [Hos 3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md). But,
that they might not look for any temporal restoration, he tells them, on
the one hand, in peremptory terms, of their dispersion; on the other, he
tells them of their spiritual restoration without any intervening
shadows of temporal deliverance. God tells them absolutely ([Hos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md), [Hos
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md); [Hos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md); [Hos
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md), and of distant captivity, [Hos
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019.md), [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md), "I will cause the kingdom of
the house of Israel to cease;" "I will no more have mercy upon the house
of Israel;" "they shall be wanderers among the nations;" "they shall not
dwell in the Lord's land;" "Israel is swallowed up; she shall be among
the nations like a vessel in which is no pleasure." On the other hand,
the promises are markedly spiritual ([Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md) ff; [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Hos
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md); [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md); "Ye are the sons of the living
God;" "I will betroth her to Me for ever;" "they shall fear the Lord and
His goodness;" "He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight;"
"till He come and rain righteousness upon you." "I will ransom them from
the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death." Again, God
contrasts [Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md); [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md) with this His sentence, on
Israel, His future dealings with Judah, and His mercies to her, of which
Israel should not partake, while of Judah's spiritual mercies, He says,
that Israel should partake by being united with Judah [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md).

The ground of this difference was, that Israel's separate existence was
bound up with that sin of Jeroboam, which clave to them throughout their
history, and which none of their least bad kings ventured to give up.
God tried them for two centuries and a half; and not one king was found,
who would risk his throne for God. In merciful severity then, the
separate kingdom of Israel was to be destroyed, and the separate
existence of the ten tribes was to be lost.

This message of woe gives a unique character to the prophecies of Hosea.
He, like Paul, was of the people, whose temporary excision he had to
declare. He calls the wretched king of Israel "our king" [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md); and God calls the rebellious
people "thy people" [Hos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md) . Of that
people, he was specially the prophet. Judah he mentions incidentally,
when he does mention them, not in his warnings only, but in his
prophecies of good also. His main commission lay among the ten tribes.
Like Elijah and Elisha whom he succeeded, he was raised up out of them,
for them. His love could not be tied down to them; and so he could not
but warn Judah against sharing Israel's sin. But it is, for the most
part, incidentally and parenthetically . He does not speak of them
equally, except as to that which was the common sin of both, the seeking
to Assyria for help, and unfulfilled promise of amendment [Hos
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md). And so, on the other hand,
mercies, which belong to all as God's everlasting betrothal of His
Church [Hos 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md), and our
redemption from death [Hos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md) and
the grave, he foretells with special reference to Ephraim, and in one
place only expressly includes Judah ([Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md); Judah is included virtually in
[Hos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md).

The prophecies of Hosea (as he himself collected them) form one whole,
so that they cannot be distinctly separated, In one way, as the second
chapter is the expansion and application of the first, so the remainder
of the book after the third is an expansion and application of the
third, The first and third chapters illustrate, summarily, Ephraim's
ingratitude and desertion of God and His dealings with her, by likening
them to the wife which Hosea was commanded to take, and to her children.
The second chapter expands and applies the picture of Israel's
unfaithfulness, touched upon in the first, but it dwells more on the
side of mercy; the remaining chapters enlarge the picture of the third,
although, until the last, they dwell chiefly on the side of judgment.
Yet while the remainder of the book is an expansion of the third
chapter, the three first chapters, (as every reader has felt) are united
together, not by their narrative form only, but by the prominence given
to the history of Hosea which furnishes the theme of the book, the
shameful unfaithfulness of Israel, and the exceeding tenderness of the
love of God, who, "in wrath, remembers mercy."

The narrative leads us deep into the prophet's personal sorrows. There
is no ground to justify our taking as a parable, what Holy Scripture
relates as a fact. There is no instance in which it can be shown, that
Holy Scripture relates that a thing was done, and that, with the names
of persons, and yet that God did not intend it to be taken as literally
true . There would then be no test left of what was real, what
imaginary; and the histories of Holy Scripture would be left to be a
prey to individual caprice, to be explained away as parables, when
people disliked them. Hosea, then, at God's command, united to himself
in marriage, one who, amid the widespread corruption of those times, had
fallen manifoldly into fleshly sin. With her he was commanded to live
holily, as his wife, as Isaac lived with Rebecca whom he loved. Such an
one he took, in obedience to God's command, one Gomer. At some time
after she bore the prophet's children, she fell into adultery, and
forsook him. Perhaps she fell into the condition of a slave (see the
note at [Hos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002).md). God anew commanded
him to show mercy to her, to redeem her from her fallen condition, and,
without restoring to her the rights of marriage (see the note at [Hos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003).md), to guard and protect her from
her sins. Thus, by the love of God and the patient forbearance which He
instructed the prophet to show, a soul was rescued from sin unto death,
and was won to God; to the children of Israel there was set forth
continually before their eyes a picture and a prophecy of the punishment
upon sin, and of the close union with Himself which He vouchsafes to
sinners who repent and return to Him.

"Not only in visions which were seen," says Irenaeus (iv. 20. 12. p. 374
Old Testament), "and in words which were preached, but in acts also was
He (the Word) seen by the prophets, so as to prefigure and foreshew
things future, through them. For which cause also, the prophet Hosea
took 'a wife of whoredoms,' prophesying by his act, that the earth, i.
e., the people who are on the earth, shall commit whoredoms, departing
from the Lord; and that of such people God will be pleased to take to
Himself a Church, to be sanctified by the communication of His Son, as
she too was sanctified by the communion of the prophet. Wherefore Paul
also saith, that [Co1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md) the
unbelieving woman is sanctified in her believing husband." "What," asks
Augustine of the scoffers of his day, "is there opposed to the clemency
of truth, what contrary to the Christian faith, that one unchaste,
leaving her fornication, should be converted to a chaste marriage? And
what so incongruous and alien from the faith of the prophet, as it would
have been, not to believe that all the sins of the unchaste were
forgiven, when she was converted and amended? So then, when the prophet
made the unchaste one his wife, a kind provision was made for the woman
to amend her life, and the mystery (of the union of Christ Himself with
the Church of Jews and Gentiles) was expressed" (Augustine, ib. 89).
"Since the Lord, through the same Scripture, lays clearly open what is
figured by this command and deed, and since the apostolic Epistles
attest that this prophecy was fulfilled in the preaching of the New
Testament, who would venture to say that it was not commanded and done
for that end, for which He who commanded it, explains in the holy
Scripture that He commanded, and that the prophet did it?"

The names which Hosea, by God's command gave to the children who were
born, expressed the temporal punishment, which was to come upon the
nation. The prophet himself, in his relation to his restored yet
separated wife, was, so long as she lived, one continued, living
prophecy of the tenderness of God to sinners. Fretful, wayward, jealous,
ungovernable, as are mostly the tempers of those who are recovered from
such sins as her's, the prophet, in his anxious, watchful charge, was a
striking picture of the forebearing loving-kindness of God to us amid
our provocations and infirmities. Nay, the love which the prophet bare
her, grew the more out of his compassion and tenderness for her whom God
had commanded him to take as his own. Certain it is, that Holy Scripture
first speaks of her as the object of his love, when God commanded him a
second time to take charge of her who had betrayed and abandoned him.
God bids him show active love to her, whom, amid her unfaithfulness, he
loved already. "Go yet, love a woman, beloved of her husband, yet an
adulteress." Wonderful picture of God's love for us, for whom He gave
His Only-begotten Son, loving us, while alien from Him, and with nothing
in us to love!

Such was the tenderness of the prophet, whom God employed to deliver
such a message of woe; and such the people must have known to be his
personal tenderness, who had to speak so sternly to them.

The three first prophecies, contained severally in the three first
chapters, form each, a brief circle of mercy and judgment. They do not
enter into any detail of Israel's sin, but sum up all in the one, which
is both center and circumference of all sin, the all-comprehending sin,
departure from God, choosing the creature rather than the Creator. On
this, the first prophecy foretells the entire irrevocable destruction of
the kingdom; God's temporary rejection of His people, but their
acceptance, together with Judah, in One Head, Christ. The second follows
the same outline, rebuke, chastisement, the cessation of visible
worship, banishment, and then the betrothal forever. The third speaks of
offence against deeper love, and more prolonged punishment. It too ends
in the promise of entire restoration; yet only in the latter days, after
many days of separation, both from idolatry and from the true worship of
God, such as is Israel's condition now.

The rest is one continuous prophecy, in which the prophet has probably
gathered into one the substance of what he had delivered in the course
of his ministry. Here and there, yet very seldom in it [Hos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md); [Hos
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md), [Hos
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md); [Hos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md), the prophet refers to the image
of the earlier chapters. For the most part he exhibits his people to
themselves, in their varied ingratitude, folly, and sin. The prophecy
has many pauses, which with one exception coincide with our chapters .
It rises and falls, and then bursts out in fresh tones of upbraiding
(see the beginnings of [Hos 5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md);
Hos. 7; [Hos 8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md); Hos. 9; [Hos
10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md); [Hos
11:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); [Hos
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001); Hos. 13.md), and closes mostly
in notes of sorrow and of woe , for the destruction which is coming. Yet
at none of these pauses is there any complete break, such as would
constitute what preceded, a separate prophecy; and on the other hand,
the structure of the last portion of the book corresponds most with that
of the first three chapters, if it is regarded as one whole. For as
there, after rebuke and threatened chastisement, each prophecy ended
with the promise of future mercy, so here, after finally foreannouncing
the miseries at the destruction of Samaria, the prophet closes his
prophecy and his whole book with a description of Israel's future
repentance and acceptance, and of his flourishing with manifold grace.

The brief summary, in which the prophet calls attention to all which he
had said, and foretells, who would and who would not understand it, the
more marks the prophecy as one whole.

Yet, although these prophecies, as worked into one by the prophet, bear
a strong impress of unity, there yet seem to be traces, here and there,
of the different conditions of the kingdom of Israel, amid which
different parts were first uttered. The order, in which they stand,
seems, upon the whole, to be an order of time. In the first chapters,
the house of Jeroboam is still standing in strength, and Israel appears
to have trusted in its own power, as the prophet Amos [Amo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014.md), [Amo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#016.md); [Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013.md) also, at the same time, describes
them. The fourth chapter is addressed to the "house of Israel" [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md) only, without any allusion to the
king, and accords with that time of convulsive anarchy, which followed
the death of Jeroboam II. The omission of the king is the more
remarkable, inasmuch as the "house of the king" is included in the
corresponding address in [Hos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md). The
"rulers" [Hos 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md) of Israel are also
spoken of in the plural; and the bloodshed [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md) described seems to be more than
individual insulated murders.

In this case, the king upbraided in [Hos
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md) would, naturally, be the next
king, Zechariah, in whom God's promise to the house of Jehu expired. In
Hos. 7 a weak and sottish king is spoken of, whom his princes misled to
debauchery, disgusting drunkenness and impiety. But Menahem was a
general of fierce determination, energy and barbarity. Debauchery and
brutal ferocity are natural associates; but this sottishness here
described was rather the fruit of weak compliance with the debauchery of
others. "The princes made him sick" [Hos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md), it is said. This is not likely to
have been the character of successful usurpers, as Menahem, or Pekah, or
Hoshea. It is far more likely to have been that of Zechariah, who was
placed on the throne for 6 months, "did evil in the sight of the Lord,"
and then was "slain publicly before the being people" [Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), no one resisting. Him, as the
last of the line of Jehu, and sanctioned by God, Hosea may the rather
have called "our king" [Hos 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md),
owning in him, evil as he was, God's appointment.

The words, "they have devoured their judges, all their kings have
fallen" [Hos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md), had anew their
fulfillment in the murder of Zechariah and Shallum (772 B. C) as soon as
the promise to the house of Jehu had expired. The blame of Judah for
"multiplying fenced cities" [Hos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md),
instead of trusting in God, probably relates to the temper in which they
were built in the days of Jotham [Ch2
27:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002.md), between 758, and 741 b.c.
Although Jotham was a religious king, the corruption of the people at
this time is especially recorded; "the people did corruptly." Later yet,
we have mention of the dreadful battle, when Shalman, or Shalmanezer,
took and massacred women and children at Betharbel [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md) in the valley of Jezreel, about
729 b.c. Hosea, thus, lived to see the fulfillment of his earlier
prophecy, "I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel"
([Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md), see the note at [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014).md). It has been thought that the
question "where is thy king?" relates to the captivity of Hoshea, three
years before the destruction of Samaria. This sort of question, however,
relates not to the actual place where the king was, but to his ability
or inability to help.

It belongs to the mournful solemnity of Hosea's prophecy, that he
scarcely speaks to the people in his own person. The ten chapters, which
form the center of the prophecy, are almost wholly one long dirge of
woe, in which the prophet rehearses the guilt and the punishment of his
people. If the people are addressed, it is, with very few exceptions,
God Himself, not the prophet, who speaks to them; and God speaks to them
as their judge . Once only does the prophet use the form, so common in
the other prophets, "saith the Lord" [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md). As in the three first chapters,
the prophet, in his relation to his wife, represented that of God to His
people, so, in these ten chapters, after the first words of the fourth
and fifth chapters, "Hear the word of the Lord, for the Lord hath a
controversy with the inhabitants of the land," "Hear ye this, O priests"
[Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md); [Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md), whenever the prophet uses the
first person, he uses it not of himself, but of God. "I" "My" are not
Hosea, and the things of Hosea, but God and what belongs to God. God
addresses the prophet himself in the second person [Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md), [Hos
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md); [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md).

In four verses only of these chapters does the prophet himself
apparently address his own people Israel, in two [Hos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md), [Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md) expostulating with them; in two,
([Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); (but followed by a
declaration of the fruitlessness of his call [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md) [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006).md) calling them to repentance. In
two other verses he addresses Judah [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md), or foretells to him judgment
mingled with mercy (see the note at [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011).md). The last chapter alone is one
of almost unmingled brightness; the prophet calls to repentance [Hos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md), [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md), and God in His own Person [Hos
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004.md), [Hos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008.md) accepts it, and promises large
supply of grace. But this too closes the prophecy with the warning, that
righteous as are the ways of God, the transgressors should stumble in
them.

It is this same solemn pathos, which has chiefly occasioned the
obscurity, complained of in Hosea. The expression of Jerome has often
been repeated ; "Hosea is concise, and speaketh, as it were, in detached
sayings." The words of upbraiding, of judgment, of woe, burst out, as it
were, one by one, slowly, heavily, condensed, abrupt, from the prophet's
heavy and shrinking soul, as God commanded and constrained him, and put
His words, like fire, in the prophet's mouth. An image of Him Who said,
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them
which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye
would not" [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md), he delivers his
message, as though each sentence burst with a groan from his soul, and
he had anew to take breath, before he uttered each renewed woe.

Each verse forms a whole for itself, like one heavy toll in a funeral
knell. The prophet has not been careful about order and symmetry, so
that each sentence went home to the soul. And yet the unity of the
prophecy is so evident in the main, that we cannot doubt that it is not
broken, even when the connection is not apparent on the surface. The
great difficulty consequently in Hosea is to ascertain that connection
in places where it evidently exists, yet where the prophet has not
explained it. The easiest and simplest sentences (for example, [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md), [Hos
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012).md) are sometimes, in this
respect, the most difficult. It is in remarkable contrast with this
abruptness in the more mournful parts, that when Hosea has a message of
mercy to deliver, his style becomes easy and flowing. Then no sign of
present sin or impending misery disturbs his brightness. He lives wholly
in the future bliss which he was allowed to foretell.

Yet, meanwhile, no prophet had a darker future to declare. The prophets
of Judah could mingle with their present denunciations a prospect of an
early restoration. The ten tribes, as a whole, had no future. The
temporal part of their punishment was irreversible. Hosea lived almost
to see its fulfillment. Yet not the less confidently does he foretell
the spiritual mercies in store for his people. He promises them as
absolutely as if he saw them. It is not a matter of hope, but of
certainty. And this certainty Hosea announces, in words expressive of
the closest union with God; an union shadowed by the closest union which
we know, that, whereby a man and his wife are "no more twain, but one
flesh." Here, as filled and overfilled with joy, instead of abrupt
sentences, he gladly lingers on his subject, adding in every word
something to the fullness of the blessing contained in the preceding"
[Hos 2:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md); [Hos
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001.md). He is, indeed, (if one may
venture so to speak) eminently a prophet of the tenderness of the love
of God. In foretelling God's judgments, he ventures to picture Him to
us, as overcome (so to speak) by mercy, so that He would not execute His
full sentence [Hos 11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md). God's
mercies he predicts in the inmost relation of love, that those whom He
had rejected, He would own, as "sons of the living God;" that He would
betroth them to Himself in righteousness, in judgment, loving-kindness,
mercies, faithfulness, and that, forever; that He would raise us up on
the third day, and that we should live in His sight, ransoming us,
Himself, and redeeming us, as our Kinsman, from death and the grave (see
the notes at [Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); notes at [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md) ff; notes at [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md); notes at [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md).

In this prophecy of the betrothal of the Church to God, he both applies
and supplies the teaching of Ps. 45 and of the Song of Solomon. Moses
had been taught to declare to his people that God had, in a special way,
made them His people, and was Himself their God. The violation of this
relation, by taking other gods, Moses had also spoken of under the image
of married faithlessness. But faithlessness implies the existence of the
relation, to which they were bound to be faithful. The whole human
family, however, had once belonged to God, and had fallen away from Him.
And so Moses speaks of the pagan idolatry also under this name, and
warned Israel against sharing their sin. "Lest thou make a covenant with
the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods -
and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
a whoring after their gods" [Exo
34:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015.md). The relation itself of
betrothal Moses does not mention; yet it must have been suggested to the
mind of Israel by his describing this special sin of choosing other
gods, under the title of married faithlessness [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md); [Lev
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005.md); [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md) and of desertion of God [Deu
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md), and by his attributing to God
the title of "Jealous" [Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); [Exo
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#014.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009.md); [Deu
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md); [Num
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002.md). It was reserved to Hosea, to
exhibit at once to Israel under this image, God's tender love for them
and their ingratitude, to dwell on their relation to God whom they
forsook , and explicitly to foretell to them that new betrothal in
Christ which should abide forever.

The image, however, presupposes an acquaintance with the language of the
Pentateuch; and it has been noticed that Hosea incidentally asserts that
the written Pentateuch was still used in the kingdom of Israel. For God
does not say, "I have given to him," but "I have written," or "I write
[Hos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md) to him the great" or
"manifold" things of the law. The "ten thousand things" which God says
that He had written, cannot be the decalogue only, nor would the word
"written" be used of an unwritten tradition. God says moreover, "I
write," in order to express that the law, although written once for all,
still came from the ever-present authority of Him Who wrote it.

The language of Hosea is, for the most part, too concise and broken, to
admit of his employing actual sentences from the Pentateuch. This he
does sometimes (see [Hos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md); [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md), [Hos
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md); [Hos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md), [Hos
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md), [Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md); [Hos
6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md); [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md); [Hos
11:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md), [Hos
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md); [Hos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md), [Hos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md); [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002).md), as has been pointed out . On
the other hand, his concise allusions would scarcely be understood by
those who were not familiar with the history and laws of the Pentateuch
(see [Hos 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); [Hos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002.md); [Hos
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md), [Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md); [Hos
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md), [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md), [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md); [Hos
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md), [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md); [Hos
12:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md), [Hos
12:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md); [Hos
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003).md). Since then plainly a prophet
spoke so as to be understood by the people, this is an evidence of the
continual use of the Pentateuch in Israel, after the great schism from
Judah. The schools of the prophets, doubtless, maintained the teaching
of the law, as they did the public worship. The people went to Elisha on
new-moons and sabbaths, and so to other prophets also [Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md). Even after the great massacre of
the prophets by Jezebel [Kg1 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013.md), we
have incidental notices of schools of the prophets at Bethel [Kg2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003.md), Jericho [Kg2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005.md), Gilgal [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md), Mount Ephraim [Kg2
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#022.md), Samaria , from which other
schools were formed [Kg2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md). The
selection of Gilgal, Bethel, and Samaria, shows that the spots were
chosen, in order to confront idolatry and corruption in their chief
abodes. The contradiction of people's lives to the law, thus extant and
taught among them, could scarcely have been greater than that of
Christians now to the Bible which they have in their houses and their
hands and their ears, but not in their hearts.
