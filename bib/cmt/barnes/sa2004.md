### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 4:2</span></span>

Beeroth - See the marginal reference. From [Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017), it might have been expected that
the population of Beeroth would be Canaanite. But from some unknown
cause the Canaanite inhabitants of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim - perhaps
the same as Gath - and continued there as sojourners. If this flight of
the Beerothites took place at the time of Saul's cruel attack upon the
Gibeonites [Sa2 21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001), Baanah and
Reehab may have been native Beerothites, and have been instigated to
murder the son of Saul by a desire to avenge the blood of their
countrymen. The fact of their being reckoned as Benjamites is quite
compatible with their being Canaanites by blood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 4:4</span></span>

This mention of Mephibosheth seems to be inserted here partly to show
that with the death of Ish-bosheth the cause of the house of Saul became
hopeless, and partly to prepare the way for the subsequent mention of
him [Sa2 9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001); [Sa2
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001); [Sa2
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#025).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 4:5</span></span>

Lay on a bed at noon - Render, "was taking his midday rest," according
to the custom of hot countries.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 4:6</span></span>

As though they would have fetched wheat - This is a very obscure
passage, and the double repetition in [Sa2
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006) of the murder of the king and of
the escape of the assassin, is hard to account for. Rechab and Baanah
came into the house under the pretence of getting grain, probably for
the band which they commanded out of the king's storehouse, and so
contrived to get access into the king's chamber; or, they found the
wheat-carriers (the persons whose business it was to carry in grain for
the king's household) just going into the king's house, and by joining
them got into the midst of the house unnoticed. If the latter be the
sense, the literal translation of the words would be: "And behold (or,
and there) there came into the midst of the house the carriers of wheat,
and they (i. e. Rechab and Baanah) smote him, etc."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 4:12</span></span>

Cut off their hands ... - After they were dead. Their hands and feet
were hung up in a place of public resort, both to deter others and also
to let all Israel know that David was not privy to the murder of
Ish-bosheth.
