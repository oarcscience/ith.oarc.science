### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 20:1</span></span>

Ben-hadad, the king of Syria - Probably the son of the Ben-hadad who
assisted Asa against Baasha ([Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018) note.md).

Thirty and two kings with him - Not allies, but feudatories [Kg1
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024.md). Damascus had in the reign of
this Ben-hadad become the center of an important monarchy, which may not
improbably have extended from the Euphrates to the northern border of
Israel. The Assyrian inscriptions show that this country was about the
period in question parcelled out into a multitude of petty kingdoms, the
chief tribes who possessed it being the Hittites, the Hamathites, and
the Syrians of Damascus.

Horses and chariots - The Assyrian inscriptions show us how very
important an arm of the service the chariot force was reckoned by the
Syrians. A king, who has been identified with this Ben-hadad, brought
into the field against Assyria nearly four thousand chariots.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 20:2</span></span>

It may be supposed that a considerable time had passed in the siege,
that the city had been reduced to an extremity, and that ambassadors had
been sent by Ahab to ask terms of peace short of absolute surrender,
before Ben-hadad would make such a demand. He would expect and intend
his demand to be rejected, and this would have left him free to plunder
the town, which was evidently what he desired and purposed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 20:6</span></span>

Ben-hadad, disappointed by Ahab's consent to an indignity which he had
thought no monarch could submit to, proceeds to put a fresh construction
on his former demands.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 20:7</span></span>

The political institution of a Council of elders ([Exo
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016), etc..md), which had belonged to the
undivided nation from the sojourn in Egypt downward, had therefore been
continued among the ten tribes after their separation, and still held an
important place in the system of Government. The Council was not merely
called together when the king needed it, but held its regular sittings
at the seat of government; and hence, "all the elders of the land" were
now present in Samaria. On the "elders of towns," see [Kg1
21:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md).

Apparently the king had not thought it necessary to summon the Council
when the first terms were announced to him, inasmuch as they touched
only himself. The fresh demands affected the people at large, and it
became necessary, or at any rate fitting, that "the elders" should be
consulted.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 20:8</span></span>

"The people" had no distinct place in the ordinary Jewish or Israelite
constitution; but they were accustomed to signify their approbation or
disapprobation of the decisions of the elders by acclamations or
complaints ([Jos 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md); [Jdg
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011), etc..md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 20:10</span></span>

If the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls ... - In its general
sense this phrase is undoubtedly a boast that the number of Ben-hadad's
troops was such as to make resistance vain and foolish. We may parallel
it with the saying of the Trachinian at Thermopylae, that the Persian
arrows would darken the light of the sun. Probably the exact meaning is,
"When your town is reduced to ruins, as it will be if you resist, the
entire heap will not suffice to furnish a handful of dust to each
soldier of my army, so many are they." There was a threat in the message
as well as a boast.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 20:11</span></span>

Ahab's reply has the air of a proverb, with which Orientals always love
to answer a foe.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 20:12</span></span>

Pavilions - "Booths" ([Gen 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#017.md)
margin; [Lev 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md); [Jon
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005).md). The term seems to be properly
applied to a stationary "booth" or "hut," as distinguished from a
moveable "tent." On military expeditions, and especially in the case of
a siege, such "huts" were naturally constructed to shelter the king and
his chief officers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 20:13</span></span>

The rabbinical commentators conjecture that this prophet was Micaiah,
the son of Imlah, who is mentioned below [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md).

Hast thou seen all this great multitude? - The boast of Ben-hadad [Kg1
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#010.md), was not without a basis of
truth; his force seems to have exceeded 130, 000 (compare [Kg1
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#025.md), [Kg1
20:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#029).md). In his wars with the
Assyrians we find him sometimes at the head of 100, 000 men.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 20:14</span></span>

The "princes of the provinces" are the governors of districts, many of
whom may have fled to the capital, as the hostile army advanced through
Galilee and northern Samaria. The "young men" are their attendants,
youths unaccustomed to war.

Who shall order the battle? - i. e., "Who shal join battle, begin the
attack? We or the enemy?" The reply was, that the Israelites were to
attack.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 20:15</span></span>

Seven thousand - Considering how populous Palestine was in the time of
the earlier Israelite kings (see [Ch2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003.md); [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008.md); [Ch2
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014).md), the smallness of this
number is somewhat surprising. If the reading be sound, we must suppose,
first, that Ben-hadad's attack was very sudden, and that Ahab had no
time to collect forces from distant parts of the country; and secondly,
that during the long siege the garrison of Samaria had been greatly
reduced, until it now did not exceed 7,000 men fit for service.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 20:16</span></span>

drinking himself drunk - Ben-hadad meant probably to mark his utter
contempt of his foe. Compare the contempt of Belshazzar [Dan
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 20:17</span></span>

Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him - The Septuagint has a better
reading: "they sent and told the king of Syria."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 20:22</span></span>

Go, strengthen thyself ... - That is, "collect troops, raise
fortifications, obtain allies ... take all the measures thou canst to
increase thy military strength. Be not rash, but consider well every
step ... for a great danger is impending."

At the return of the year - i. e., "When the season for military
operations again comes round." The wars of the Oriental monarchs at this
time, like those of early Rome, were almost always of the nature of
annual incursions into the territories of their neighbors, begun in
spring and terminating in early autumn. Sustained invasions, lasting
over the winter into a second or a third year, are not found until the
time of Shalmaneser [Kg2 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md); [Kg2
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md), and do not become common
until the Median and Babylonian period.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 20:23</span></span>

Their gods are gods of the hills - The local power and influence of
deities was a fixed principle of the ancient polytheism. Each country
was considered to have its own gods; and wars were regarded as being to
a great extent struggles between the gods of the nations engaged in
them. This is apparent throughout the Assyrian inscriptions. Compare
also [Kg2 18:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#033.md); [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012.md). The present passage gives an
unusual modification of this view. The suggestion of the Syrian chiefs
may have been a mere politic device - they being really anxious, "an
military grounds," to encounter their enemy on the plain, where alone
their chariots would be of much service. In the plain the Israelites had
always fought at a disadvantage, and had proved themselves weaker than
on the hills (see [Jdg 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019.md), [Jdg
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md), [Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 20:24</span></span>

The Syrian chiefs evidently thought that want of unity had weakened
their army. They therefore proposed the deposition of the kings, and the
substitution, in their place, of Syrian governors: not "captains." The
term used always denotes a civil office.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 20:26</span></span>

Aphek - There were several places of this name in Palestine (see the
marginal reference). This Aphek has been almost certainly identified
with the modern Fik, a large village on the present high road from
Damascus to Nablous and Jersalem. The expression "went up to Aphek" is
appropriate, for Fik, though in a level country, is at a much higher
elevation than Damascus.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 20:27</span></span>

Were all present - The marginal rendering is adopted by almost all
critics.

Like two little flocks of kids - The word translated "little flocks"
does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. It seems to mean simply "flocks."
Compare the Septuagint, who render ὡσεί δύο ποίμνια αἰγῶν hōsei duo
poimnia aigōn.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 20:28</span></span>

A man of God - Evidently not the prophet who had spoken to Ahab the year
before [Kg1 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#013.md), [Kg1
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#022.md). He probably dwelt in the
neighborhood of Samaria. Now that Ahab and his army had marched out into
the Trans-Jordanic territory, another prophet, a native probably of that
region, announced God's will to them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 20:30</span></span>

A wall - "The wall," i. e., the wall of the town. We may suppose a
terrific earthquake during the siege of the place, while the Syrians
were manning the defenses in full force, which threw down the wall where
they were most thickly crowded upon it, and buried them in its ruins.
Ben-hadad fled from the wall, where he had been at the time of the
disaster, into the inner parts of the city - probably to some massive
stronghold - and there concealed himself.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 20:31</span></span>

And ropes upon our heads - "Ropes about our necks" is probably meant.
They, as it were, put their lives at Ahab's disposal, who, if he
pleased, might hang them at once.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 20:32</span></span>

Ben-hadad is now as humble as Ahab had been a year before [Kg1
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#009.md). He professes himself the mere
"slave" of his conqueror.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 20:33</span></span>

The meaning of this verse is that the men from the first moment of their
arrival were on the watch to note what Ahab would say; and the moment he
let fall the expression "He is my brother," they caught it up and
repeated it, fixing him to it, as it were, and preventing his retreat.
By the Oriental law of "dakheel" anyone is at any time entitled to put
himself under the protection of another, be that other his friend or his
greatest enemy; and if the man applied to does not at once reject him,
if the slightest forms of friendly speech pass between the two, the bond
is complete, and must not be broken. Ben-hadad's friends were on the
watch to obtain for him "dakheel;" and the single phrase "He is my
brother," having been accepted by them on his part, was sufficient to
complete the bond, and secure the life of the captive. Ahab having
called Ben-hadad his brother, treated him as he would a brother; he took
him up into his chariot, than which there could not be a greater honor.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 20:34</span></span>

Ben-hadad, secure of his life, suggests terms of peace as the price of
his freedom. He will restore to Ahab the Israelite cities taken from
Omri by his father, among which Ramoth Gilead was probably the most
important [Kg1 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003.md); and he will allow
Ahab the privilege of making for himself "streets," or rather squares,
in Damascus, a privilege which his own father had possessed with respect
to Samaria. Commercial advantages, rather than any other, were probably
sought by this arrangement.

So he made a covenant with him ... - Ahab, without "inquiring of the
Lord," at once agreed to the terms offered; and, without even taking any
security for their due observance, allowed the Syrian monarch to depart.
Considered politically, the act was one of culpable carelessness and
imprudence. Ben-hadad did not regard himself as bound by the terms of a
covenant made when he was a prisoner - as his after conduct shows [Kg1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003.md). Ahab's conduct was even more
unjustifiable in one who held his crown under a theocracy. "Inquiry at
the word of the Lord" was still possible in Israel [Kg1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#005.md), [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md), and would seem to have been the
course that ordinary gratitude might have suggested.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 20:35</span></span>

The sons of the prophets - The expression occurs here for the first
time. It signifies (marginal references), the schools or colleges of
prophets which existed in several of the Israelite, and probably of the
Jewish, towns, where young men were regularly educated for the
prophetical office. These "schools" make their first appearance under
Samuel [Sa1 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020.md). There is no
distinct evidence that they continued later than the time of Elisha; but
it is on the whole most probable that the institution survived the
captivity, and that the bulk of the "prophets," whose works have come
down to us belonged to them. Amos [Amo
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014.md) seems to speak as if his were
an exceptional case.

Said unto his neighbor - Rather, "to his friend" or "companion " - to
one who was, like himself, "a prophet's son," and who ought therefore to
have perceived that his colleague spoke "in the word of the Lord."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 20:38</span></span>

Ashes - Rather, "a bandage" (and in [Kg1
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#041).md). The object of the wound and
bandage was double. Partly, it was to prevent Ahab from recognizing the
prophet's face; partly, to induce him to believe that the man had really
been engaged in the recent war.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 20:41</span></span>

He was of the prophets - Josephus and others conjecture that this
prophet was Micaiah, the son of Imlah (but compare [Kg1
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#013) note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 20:42</span></span>

A man whom I appointed to utter destruction - or to חרם chērem, i. e., a
man on whom My curse had been laid ([Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028) note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 20:43</span></span>

Heavy and displeased - Rather, "sullen and angry" (and so marginal
reference), not repentant, as after Elijah's warning [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md) - not acknowledging the justice
of his sentence - but full of sullenness and suppressed anger.
