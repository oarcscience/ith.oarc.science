### [John Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md)

[John 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 16:1</span></span>

These things - The things spoken in the two previous chapters, promising
them divine aid and directing them in the path of duty.

Be offended - For the meaning of the word offend, see the notes at [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). It means here the same as to
stumble or fall - that is, to apostatize. He proceeds immediately to
tell them, what he had often apprised them of, that they would be
subject to great persecutions and trials. He was also himself about to
be removed by death. They were to go into an unfriendly world. All these
things were in themselves greatly fitted to shake their faith, and to
expose them to the danger of apostasy. Compare [Luk
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md). If they had not been apprised
of this, if they had not known why Jesus was about to die, and if they
had not been encouraged with the promised aid of the Holy Spirit, they
would have sunk under these trials, and forsaken him and his cause. And
we may learn hence:

1\. that if Christians were left to themselves they would fall away and
perish.

2\. that God affords means and helps beforehand to keep them in the path
of duty.

3\. that the instructions of the Bible and the help of the Holy Spirit
are all granted to keep them from apostasy.

4\. that Jesus beforehand secured the fidelity and made certain the
continuance in faith of his apostles, seeing all their dangers and
knowing all their enemies. And, in like manner, we should be persuaded
that "he is able to keep that which we commit to him against that day,"
[Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md).

[John 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 16:2</span></span>

Out of the synagogues - See the notes at [Joh
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md). They would excommunicate them
from their religious assemblies. This was often done. Compare [Act
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013.md); [Act
9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023.md); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md); [Act
21:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md).

Whosoever killeth you - This refers principally to the Jews. It is also
true of the Gentiles, that in their persecution of Christians they
supposed they were rendering acceptable service to their gods.

God's service - The Jews who persecuted the apostles regarded them as
blasphemers, and as seeking to overthrow the temple service, and the
system of religion which God had established. Thus, they supposed they
were rendering service to God in putting. them to death, [Act
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013.md); [Act
21:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028.md). Sinners, especially
hypocrites, often cloak enormous crimes under the pretence of great zeal
for religion. Men often suppose, or profess to suppose, that they are
rendering God service when they persecute others; and, under the
pretence of great zeal for truth and purity, evince all possible
bigotry, pride, malice, and uncharitableness. The people of God have
suffered most from those who have been conscientious persecutors; and
some of the most malignant foes which true Christians have ever had have
been in the church, and have been professed ministers of the gospel,
persecuting them under pretence of great zeal for the cause of purity
and religion. It is no evidence of piety that a man is full of zeal
against those whom he supposes to be heretics; and it is one of the best
proofs that a man knows nothing of the religion of Jesus when he is
eminent for self-conceit in his own views of orthodoxy, and firmly fixed
in the opinion that all who differ from him and his sect must of course
be wrong.

[John 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 16:3</span></span>

See [Joh 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021.md).

[John 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 16:4</span></span>

These things - These things which are about to happen, [Joh
16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md). He had foretold them that they
would take place.

Ye may remember ... - By calling to mind that he had foretold these
things they would perceive that he was omniscient, and would remember,
also, the consolations which he had afforded them and the instructions
which he had given them. Had these calamities come upon them without
their having been foretold, their faith might have failed; they might
have been tempted to suppose that Jesus was not aware of them, and of
course that he was not the Messiah. God does not suffer his people to
fall into trials without giving them sufficient warning, and without
giving all the grace that is needful to bear them.

At the beginning - In the early part of the ministry of Jesus. The
expression these things here refers, probably, to all the topics
contained in these chapters. He had, in the early part of his ministry,
forewarned them of calamities and persecutions [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md); [Mat
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md); [Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015.md), but he had not so fully
acquainted them with the nature, and design, and sources of their
trials; he had not so fully apprised them of the fact, the
circumstances, and the object of his death and of his ascension to
heaven; he had not revealed to them so clearly that the Holy Spirit
would descend, and sanctify, and guide them; and especially he had not,
in one continued discourse, grouped all these things together, and
placed their sorrows and consolations so fully before their minds. All
these are included, it is supposed, in the expression "these things."

Because I was with you - This is the reason which he gives why he had
not at first made known to them clearly the certainty of their
calamities and their joys; and it implies:

1\. that it was not needful to do it at once, as he was to be with them
for more than three years, and could have abundant opportunity gradually
to teach these things, and to prepare them for the more full
announcement when he was about to leave them.

2\. that while he was with them he would go before them, and the weight
of calamities would fall on him, and consequently they did not so much
then need the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit as they would when he
was gone.

3\. that his presence was to them what the presence of the Holy Spirit
would be after his death, [Joh 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md).
He could teach them all needful truth. He could console and guide them.
Now that he was to leave them, he fully apprised them of what was before
them, and of the descent of the Holy Spirit to do for them what he had
done when with them.

[John 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 16:5</span></span>

Now I go my way - Now I am about to die and leave you, and it is proper
to announce all these things to you.

None of you asketh me ... - They gave themselves up to grief instead of
inquiring why he was about to leave them. Had they made the inquiry, he
was ready to answer them and to comfort them. When we are afflicted we
should not yield ourselves to excessive grief. We should inquire why it
is that God thus tries us; and we should never doubt that if we come to
him, and spread out our sorrows before him, he will give us consolation.

[John 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 16:7</span></span>

It is expedient for you ... - The reason why it was expedient for them
that he should go away, he states to be, that in this way only would the
Comforter be granted to them. Still, it may be asked why the presence of
the Holy Spirit was more valuable to them than that of the Saviour
himself? To this it may be answered:

1\. That by his departure, his death, and ascension - by having these
great facts before their eyes they would be led by the Holy Spirit to
see more fully the design of his coming than they would by his presence.
While he was with them, notwithstanding the plainest teaching, their
minds were filled with prejudice and error. They still adhered to the
expectation of a temporal kingdom, and were unwilling to believe that he
was to die. When he should have actually left them they could no longer
doubt on this subject, and would be prepared to understand why he came.
And this was done. See the Acts of the Apostles everywhere. It is often
needful that God should visit us with severe affliction before our pride
will be humbled and we are willing to understand the plainest truths.

2\. While on the earth the Lord Jesus could be bodily present but in one
place at one time. Yet, in order to secure the great design of saving
men, it was needful that there should be some agent who could be in all
places, who could attend all ministers, and who could, at the same time,
apply the work of Christ to people in all parts of the earth.

3\. It was an evident arrangement in the great plan of redemption that
each of the persons of the Trinity should perform a part. As it was not
the work of the Spirit to make an atonement, so it was not the work of
the Saviour to apply it. And until the Lord Jesus had performed this
great work, the way was not open for the Holy Spirit to descend to
perform his part of the great plan; yet, when the Saviour had completed
his portion of the work and had left the earth, the Spirit would carry
forward the same plan and apply it to men.

4\. It was to be expected that far more signal success would attend the
preaching of the gospel when the atonement was actually made than
before. It was the office of the Spirit to carry forward the work only
when the Saviour had died and ascended; and this was actually the case.
See Acts 2. Hence, it was expedient that the Lord Jesus should go away,
that the Spirit might descend and apply the work to sinners. The
departure of the Lord Jesus was to the apostles a source of deep
affliction, but had they seen the whole case they would not have been
thus afflicted. So God often takes away from us one blessing that he may
bestow a greater. All affliction, if received in a proper manner, is of
this description; and could the afflicted people of God always see the
whole case as God sees it, they would think and feel, as he does, that
it was best for them to be thus afflicted.

It is expedient - It is better for you.

The Comforter - See the notes at [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md).

[John 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 16:8</span></span>

He will reprove - The word translated "reprove" means commonly to
demonstrate by argument, to prove, to persuade anyone to do a thing by
presenting reasons. It hence means also to convince of anything, and
particularly to convince of crime. This is its meaning here. He will
convince or convict the world of sin. That is, he will so apply the
truths of God to men's own minds as to convince them by fair and
sufficient arguments that they are sinners, and cause them to feel this.
This is the nature of conviction always.

The world - Sinners. The men of the world. All men are by nature
sinners, and the term the world may be applied to them all, [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md).

[John 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 16:9</span></span>

Of sin - The first thing specified of which the world would be convinced
is sin. Sin, in general, is any violation of a law of God, but the
particular sin of which men are here said to be convinced is that of
rejecting the Lord Jesus. This is placed first, and is deemed the sin of
chief magnitude, as it is the principal one of which men are guilty.
This was particularly true of the Jews who had rejected him and
crucified him; and it was the great crime which, when brought home to
their consciences by the preaching of the apostles, overwhelmed them
with confusion, and filled their hearts with remorse. It was their
rejection of the Son of God that was made the great truth that was
instrumental of their conversion. [Act
2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md), [Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md); [Act
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md); [Act
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md), [Act
4:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#026.md); compare [Joh
16:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#031.md). It is also true of other
sinners. Sinners, when awakened, often feel that it has been the great
crowning sin of their lives that they have rejected the tender mercy of
God, and trampled on the blood of his Son; and that they have for months
and years refused to submit to him, saying that they would not have him
to reign over them. Thus is fulfilled what is spoken by Zechariah, [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); "And they shall look upon me
whom they have pierced, and mourn." Throughout the New Testament this is
regarded as the sin that is pre-eminently offensive to God, and which,
if unrepented of, will certainly lead to perdition, [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md). Hence, it is placed first in
those sins of which the Spirit will convince men; and hence if we have
not yet been brought to see our guilt in rejecting God's tender mercy
through his Son, we are yet in the gall of bitterness and under the bond
of iniquity.

[John 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 16:10</span></span>

Of righteousness - This seems clearly to refer to the righteousness or
innocence of Jesus himself. He was now persecuted. He was soon to be
arraigned on heavy charges, and condemned by the highest authority of
the nation as guilty. Yet, though condemned, he says that the Holy
Spirit would descend and convince the world that he was innocent.

Because I go to my Father - That is, the amazing miracle of his
resurrection and ascension to God would be a demonstration of his
innocence that would satisfy the Jews and Gentiles. God would not raise
up an impostor. If he had been truly guilty, as the Jews who condemned
him pretended, God would not have set his seal to the imposture by
raising him from the dead; but when he did raise him up and exalt him to
his own right hand, he gave his attestation to his innocence; he showed
that he approved his work, and gave evidence conclusive that Jesus was
sent from God. To this proof of the innocence of Jesus the apostles
often refer, [Act 2:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Co1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014.md), etc.; [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). This same proof of the innocence
or righteousness of the Savior is as satisfactory now as it was then.
One of the deepest feelings which an awakened sinner has, is his
conviction of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He sees that he is
holy; that his own opposition to him has been unprovoked, unjust, and
base; and it is this which so often overwhelms his soul with the
conviction of his own unworthiness, and with earnest desires to obtain a
better righteousness than his own.

And ye see me no more - That is, he was to be taken away from them, and
they would not see him until his return to judgment; yet this source of
grief to them would be the means of establishing his religion and
greatly blessing others.

[John 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 16:11</span></span>

Of judgment - That God is just, and will execute judgment. This is
proved by what he immediately states.

The prince of this world - Satan. See the notes at [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md). The death of Christ was a
judgment or a condemnation of Satan. In this struggle Jesus gained the
victory and subdued the great enemy of man. This proves that God will
execute judgment or justice on all his foes. If he vanquished his great
enemy who had so long triumphed in this world, he will subdue all others
in due time. All sinners in like manner may expect to be condemned. Of
this great truth Jesus says the Holy Spirit will convince men. God
showed himself to be just in subduing his great enemy. He showed that he
was resolved to vanquish his foes, and that all his enemies in like
manner must be subdued. This is deeply felt by the convicted sinner. He
knows that he is guilty. He learns that God is just. He fears that he
will condemn him, and trembles in the apprehension of approaching
condemnation. From this state of alarm there is no refuge but to flee to
Him who subdued the great enemy of man, and who is able to deliver him
from the vengeance due to his sins. Convinced, then, of the
righteousness of Jesus Christ, and of his ability and willingness to
save him, he flees to his cross, and seeks in him a refuge from the
coming storm of wrath.

In these verses we have a condensed and most striking view of the work
of the Holy Spirit. These three things comprise the whole of his agency
in the conversion of sinful men; and in the accomplishment of this work
he still awakens, convinces, and renews. He attends the preaching of the
gospel, and blesses the means of grace, and manifests his power in
revivals of religion. He thus imparts to man the blessings purchased by
the death of Jesus, carries forward and extends the same plan of mercy,
and will yet apply it to all the kingdoms and tribes of men. Have we
ever felt his power, and been brought by his influence to mourn over our
sins, and seek the mercy of a dying Saviour?

[John 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 16:12</span></span>

I have yet many things to say ... - There were many things pertaining to
the work of the Spirit and the establishment of religion which might be
said. Jesus had given them the outline; he had presented to them the
great doctrines of the system, but he had not gone into details. These
were things which they could not then bear. They were still full of
Jewish prejudices, and were not prepared for a full development of his
plans. He probably refers here to the great change which were to take
place in the Jewish system - the abolition of sacrifices and the
priesthood, the change of the Sabbath, the rejection of the Jewish
nation, etc. For these doctrines they were not prepared, but they would
in due time be taught them by the Holy Spirit.

[John 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 16:13</span></span>

The Spirit of truth - So called because he would teach them all
necessary truth.

Will guide you into all truth - That is, truth which pertained to the
establishment of the Christian system, which they were not then prepared
to hear. We may here remark that this is a full promise that they would
be inspired and guided in founding the new church; and we may observe
that the plan of the Saviour was replete with wisdom. Though they had
been long with him, yet they were not prepared then to hear of the
changes that were to occur; but his death would open their eyes, and the
Holy Spirit, making use of the striking and impressive scenes of his
death and ascension, would carry forward with vast rapidity their views
of the nature of the Christian scheme. Perhaps in the few days that
elapsed, of which we have a record in the first and second chapters of
the Acts of the Apostles, they learned more of the true nature of the
Christian plan than they would have done in months or years even under
the teaching of Jesus himself. The more we study the plan of Christ, the
more shall we admire the profound wisdom of the Christian scheme, and
see that it was eminently fitted to the great design of its Founder - to
introduce it in such a manner as to make on man the deepest impression
of its wisdom and its truth.

Not speak of himself - Not as prompted by himself. He shall declare what
is communicated to him. See the notes at [Joh
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018.md).

Whatsoever he shall hear - What he shall receive of the Father and the
Son; represented by hearing, because in this way instruction is commonly
received. See the notes at [Joh 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md).

Things to come - Probably this means the meaning of things which were to
take place after the time when he was speaking to them - to wit, the
design of his death, and the nature of the changes which were to take
place in the Jewish nation. It is also true that the apostles were
inspired by the Holy Spirit to predict future events which would take
place in the church and the world. See [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md); [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md); [Act
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md); [Ti1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md); 2 Tim. 3; [Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md); and the whole book of
Revelation.

[John 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 16:14</span></span>

Shall glorify me - Shall honor me. The nature of his influence shall be
such as to exalt my character and work in view of the mind.

Shall receive of mine - Literally, "shall take of or from me." He shall
receive his commission and instructions as an ambassador from me, to do
my will and complete my work.

Shall show it - Shall announce or communicate it to you. This is always
the work of the Spirit. All serious impressions produced by him lead to
the Lord Jesus [Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md), and by this
we may easily test our feelings. If we have been truly convicted of sin
and renewed by the Holy Spirit, the tendency of all his influences has
been to lead us to the Saviour; to show us our need of him; to reveal to
us the loveliness of his character, and the fitness of his work to our
needs; and to incline us to cast our eternal interests on his almighty
arm, and commit all to his hands.

[John 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 16:15</span></span>

All things ... - See [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md). No one could have said this who
was not equal with the Father. The union was so intimate, though
mysterious, that it might with propriety be said that whatever was done
in relation to the Son, was also done in regard to the Father. See [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md).

[John 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 16:16</span></span>

A little while - His death would occur in a short time. It took place
the next day. See [Joh 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md).

Ye shall not see me - That is, he would be concealed from their view in
the tomb.

And again a little while - After three days he would rise again and
appear to their view.

Because I go ... - Because it is a part of the plan that I should ascend
to God, it is necessary that I should rise from the grave, and then you
will see me, and have evidence that I am still your Friend. Compare [Joh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033.md). Here are three important events
foretold for the consolation of the disciples; yet they were stated in
such a manner that, in their circumstances and with their prejudices, it
appeared difficult to understand him.

[John 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 16:20</span></span>

Ye shall weep ... - At my crucifixion, sufferings, and death. Compare
[Luk 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027.md).

The world - Wicked men. The term world is frequently used in this sense.
See [Joh 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md). It refers particularly,
here, to the Jews who sought his death, and who would rejoice that their
object was obtained.

Shall be turned into joy - You will not only rejoice at my resurrection,
but even my death, now the object of so much grief to you, will be to
you a source of unspeakable joy. It will procure for you peace and
pardon in this life, and eternal joy in the world to come. Thus their
greatest apparent calamity would be to them, finally, the source of
their highest comfort; and though then they could not see how it could
be, yet if they had known the whole case they would have seen that they
might rejoice. As it was, they were to be consoled by the assurance of
the Saviour that it would be for their good. And thus, in our
afflictions, if we could see the whole case, we should rejoice. As it
is, when they appear dark and mysterious, we may trust in the promise of
God that they will be for our welfare. We may also remark here that the
apparent triumphs of the wicked, though they may produce grief at
present in the minds of Christians, will be yet overruled for good.
Their joy shall be turned into mourning, and the mourning of Christians
into joy; and wicked men may be doing the very thing - as they were in
the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus - that shall yet be made the means of
promoting the glory of God and the good of his people, [Psa
76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md).

[John 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 16:22</span></span>

I will see you again - After my resurrection.

Your joy no man taketh from you - You shall be so firmly persuaded that
I have risen and that I am the Messiah, that neither the threats nor
persecutions of men shall ever be able to shake your faith and produce
doubt or unbelief, and thus take away your joy. This prediction was
remarkably fulfilled. It is evident that after his ascension not one of
the apostles ever doubted for a moment that he had risen from the dead.
No persecution or trial was able to shake their faith; and thus, amid
all their afflictions, they had an unshaken source of joy.

[John 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 16:23</span></span>

In that day - After my resurrection and ascension.

Ye shall ask me nothing - The word rendered "ask" here may have two
significations, one to ask by way of inquiry, the other to ask for
assistance. Perhaps there is reference here to both these senses. While
he was with them they had been accustomed to depend on him for the
supply of their wants, and in a great degree to propose their trials to
him, expecting his aid. See [Mat 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#025.md);
[Joh 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003.md). They were also dependent on
his personal instructions to explain to them the mysteries of his
religion, and to remove their perplexities on the subject of his
doctrines. They had not sought to God through him as the Mediator, but
they had directly applied to the Saviour himself. He now tells them that
henceforward their requests were to be made to God in his name, and that
he, by the influences of his Spirit, would make known to them what Jesus
would himself do if bodily present. The emphasis in this verse is to be
placed on the word "me." Their requests were not to be made to him, but
to the Father.

Whatsoever ye shall ask ... - See [Joh
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013.md).

[John 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 16:24</span></span>

Hitherto - During his ministry, and while he was with them.

Have ye asked ... - From the evangelists, as well as from this
declaration, it seems that they had presented their requests for
instruction and aid to Jesus himself. If they had prayed to God, it is
probable that they had not done it in his name This great truth that we
must approach God in the name of the Mediator was reserved for the last
that the Saviour was to communicate to them. It was to be presented at
the close of his ministry. Then they were prepared in some degree to
understand it; and then, amid trials, and wants, and a sense of their
weakness and unworthiness, they would see its preciousness, and rejoice
in the privilege of being thus permitted to draw near to God. Though he
would be bodily absent, yet their blessings would still be given through
the same unchanging Friend.

Ask ... - Now they had the assurance that they might approach God in his
name; and, amid all their trials, they, as well as all Christians since,
might draw near to God, knowing that he would hear and answer their
prayers.

That your joy ... - See [Joh 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011.md).

[John 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 16:25</span></span>

In proverbs - In a manner that appears obscure, enigmatical, and
difficult to be understood. It is worthy of remark, that though his
declarations in these chapters about his death and resurrection appear
to us to be plain, yet to the apostles, filled with Jewish prejudices,
and unwilling to believe that he was about to die, they would appear
exceedingly obscure and perplexed. The plainest declarations to them on
the subject would appear to be involved in mystery.

The time cometh - This refers, doubtless, to the time after his
ascension to heaven, when he would send the Holy Spirit to teach them
the great truths of religion. It does not appear that he himself, after
his resurrection, gave them any more clear or full instruction than he
had done before.

I shall show you plainly - As Jesus said that he would send the Holy
Spirit [Joh 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md), and as he came to
carry forward the work of Christ, so it may be said that the teachings
of the Holy Spirit were the teachings of Christ himself.

Of the Father - Concerning the will and plan of the Father; particularly
his plan in the establishment and spread of the Christian religion, and
in organizing the church. See Acts 10.

[John 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 16:26</span></span>

I say not unto you that I will pray ... - In [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md), Jesus says that he would pray
the Father, and that he would send the Comforter. In John 17 he offered
a memorable prayer for them. In [Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md), it is said that Jesus ever
liveth to make intercession for us; and it is constantly represented in
the New Testament that it is by his intercession in heaven now that we
obtain the blessings of pardon, peace, strength, and salvation. Compare
[Heb 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md). This declaration of Jesus,
then, does not mean that he would not intercede for them, but that there
was no need then of his mentioning it to them again. They knew that;
and, in addition to that, he told them that God was ready and willing to
confer on them all needful blessings.

[John 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 16:27</span></span>

See [Joh 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md), [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md).

[John 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 16:28</span></span>

I came forth from the Father - I came sent by the Father.

And am come into the world - See [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); [Joh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md), [Joh
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md).

[John 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 16:29</span></span>

Now speakest thou plainly - What he had said that perplexed them was
that which is contained in [Joh 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md).
Compare [Joh 16:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#017.md); "A little while
and ye shall not see me," etc. This he had now explained by saying [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md), "Again, I leave the world, and
go to the Father." In this there was no ambiguity, and they expressed
themselves satisfied with this explanation.

[John 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 16:30</span></span>

Now are we sure that thou knowest ... - Their difficulty had been to
understand what was the meaning of his declaration in [Joh
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md). About this they conversed among
themselves, [Joh 16:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#017.md). It is
evident that they had not mentioned their difficulty to him, and that he
had not even heard their conversation among themselves, [Joh
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#019.md). When, therefore, by his answers
to them [Joh 16:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md), he showed that
he clearly understood their doubts; and when he gave them an answer so
satisfactory without their having inquired of him, it satisfied them
that he knew the heart, and that he assuredly came from God. They were
convinced that there was" no need that any man should ask him," or
propose his difficulties to him, since he knew them all and could answer
them.

[John 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 16:31</span></span>

Do ye now believe? - Do you truly and really believe? This question was
evidently asked to put them on a full examination of their hearts.
Though they supposed that they had unshaken faith - faith that would
endure every trial, yet he told them that they were about to go through
scenes that would test them, and where they would need all their
confidence in God. When we feel strong in the faith we should examine
ourselves. It may be that we are deceived; and it may be that God may
even then be preparing trials for us that will shake our faith to its
foundation. The Syriac and Arabic read this in the indicative as an
affirmation - "Ye do now believe." The sense is not affected by this
reading.

[John 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 16:32</span></span>

The hour cometh - To wit, on the next day, when he was crucified.

Ye shall be scattered - See [Mat
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md).

Every man to his own - That is, as in the margin, to his own home. You
shall see me die, and suppose that my work is defeated, and return to
your own dwellings. It is probable that the two disciples going to
Emmaus were on their way to their dwellings, Luke 24. After his death
all the disciples retired into Galilee, and were engaged in their common
employment of fishing, [Joh 21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md);
[Mat 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md).

Leave me alone - Leave me to die without human sympathy or compassion.
See the notes at [Mat 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md), [Mat
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056.md).

Because the Father is with me - His Father was his friend. He had all
along trusted in God. In the prospect of his sufferings he could still
look to him for support. And though in his dying moments he suffered so
much as to use the language, "Why hast thou forsaken me?" yet it was
language addressed to him still as his God - "My God, my God." Even then
he had confidence in God - confidence so strong and unwavering that he
could say, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit," [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md). In all these sufferings he had
the assurance that God was his friend, that he was doing his will, that
he was promoting his glory, and that he looked on him with approbation.
It matters little who else forsakes us if God be with us in the hour of
pain and of death; and though poor, forsaken, or despised, yet, if we
have the consciousness of his presence and his favor, then we may fear
no evil. His rod and his staff, they will comfort us. Without his favor
then, death will be full of horrors, though we be surrounded by weeping
relatives, and by all the honor, and splendor, and wealth which the
world can bestow. The Christian can die saying, I am not alone, because
the Father is with me. The sinner dies without a friend that can
alleviate his sufferings - without one source of real joy.

[John 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 16:33</span></span>

In me - In my presence, and in the aid which I shall render you by the
Holy Spirit.

In the world - Among the men to whom you are going. You must expect to
be persecuted, afflicted, tormented.

I have overcome the world - He overcame the prince of this world by his
death, [Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md). He vanquished the
great foe of man, and triumphed over all that would work our ruin. He
brought down aid and strength from above by his death; and by procuring
for us the friendship of God and the influence of the Spirit; by his own
instructions and example; by revealing to us the glories of heaven, and
opening our eyes to see the excellence of heavenly things, he has
furnished us with the means of overcoming all our enemies, and of
triumphing in all our temptations. See the notes at [Joh
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md); also [Rom
8:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md); [Rev
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md). Luther said of this verse "that
it was worthy to be carried from Rome to Jerusalem upon one's knees."
the world is a vanquished enemy; Satan is a humbled foe; and all that
believers have to do is to put their trust in the Captain of their
salvation, putting on the whole armor of God, assured that the victory
is theirs, and that the church shall yet shine forth fair as the moon,
clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners, [Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md).
