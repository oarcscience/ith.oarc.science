### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 4:0</span></span>

In Ezek. 4-5, the coming siege of Jerusalem and the dispersion of its
inhabitants is foretold under divers symbols. If the 5th year of
Jehoiachins captivity be taken (as is most probable) for the year in
which Ezekiel received this communication, it was a time at which such
an event would, according to human calculation, have appeared
improbable. It could scarcely have been expected that Zedekiah - the
creature of the king of Babylon and ruling by his authority in the place
of Jehoiachin - would have been so infatuated as to provoke the anger of
the powerful Nebuchadnezzar. It is indeed to infatuation that the sacred
historian ascribes the act [Kg2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 4:1</span></span>

A tile - Rather, a brick. Sun-dried or kiln-burned bricks were from very
early times used for building walls throughout the plain of Mesopotamia.
The bricks of Nineveh and Babylon are sometimes stamped with what
appears to be the device of the king in whose reign they were made, and
often covered with a kind of enamel on which various scenes are
portrayed. Among the subjects depicted on such bricks discovered at
Nimroud are castles and forts.

[Ezekiel 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 4:2</span></span>

Lay siege against it - The prophet is represented as doing that which he
portrays. The leading features of a siege are depicted. See the [Jer
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006.md) note.

The camp - Encampments. The word denotes various hosts in various
positions around the city.

Fort - It was customary in sieges to construct towers of vast height,
sometimes of 20 stories, which were wheeled up to the walls to enable
the besiegers to reach the battlements with their arrows; in the lower
part of such a tower there was commonly a battering-ram. These towers
are frequently represented in the Assyrian monuments.

Battering rams - Better than the translation in the margin. Assyrian
monuments prove that these engines of war are of great antiquity. These
engines seem to have been beams suspended by chains generally in
moveable towers, and to have been applied against the walls in the way
familiar to us from Greek and Roman history. The name "ram" was probably
given to describe their mode of operation; no Assyrian monument yet
discovered exhibits the ram's head of later times.

[Ezekiel 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 4:3</span></span>

An iron pan - Another figure in the coming siege. On Assyrian sculptures
from Nimroud and Kouyunjik there are sieges of cities with "forts,
mounts, and rams;" and together with these we see a kind of shield set
up on the ground, behind which archers are shooting. Such a shield would
be represented by the "flat plate" (margin). Ezekiel was directed to
take such a plate (part of his household furniture) and place it between
him and the representation of the city.

A sign to the house of Israel - This "sign" was not necessarily acted
before the people, but may simply have been described to them as a vivid
representation of the event which it foretold. "Israel" stands here for
the kingdom of Judah (compare [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md), [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md); [Eze
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004.md); [Eze
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006).md). After the captivity of the ten
tribes the kingdom of Judah represented the whole nation. Hence,
prophets writing after this event constantly address their countrymen as
the house of Israel without distinction of tribes.

[Ezekiel 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 4:4</span></span>

The siege being thus represented, the condition and suffering of the
inhabitants is exhibited by the condition of one, who, bound as a
prisoner or oppressed by sickness, cannot turn from his right side to
his left. The prophet was in such a state.

Bear their iniquity - The prophet was, in a figure, to bear their
iniquities for a fixed period, in order to show that, after the period
thus foretold, the burden of their sins should be taken off, and the
people be forgiven. Compare [Lev
16:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md).

[Ezekiel 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 4:5</span></span>

According to the number of the days - Or, "to be to thee as a number of
days (even as)" etc. Compare the margin reference. Some conceive that
these "days" were the years during which Israel and Judah sinned, and
date in the case of Israel from Jeroboam's rebellion to the time at
which Ezekiel wrote (circa 390 years); and in the case of Judah from
Josiah's reformation. But it seems more in accordance with the other
"signs," to suppose that they represent not that which had been, but
that which shall be. The whole number of years is 430 [Eze
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md), the number assigned of old for
the affliction of the descendants of Abraham [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md); [Exo
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040.md). The "forty years" apportioned
to Judah [Eze 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md), bring to mind the
40 years passed in the wilderness; and these were years not only of
punishment, but also of discipline and preparatory to restoration, so
Ezekiel would intimate the difference between the punishments of Israel
and of Judah to be this, that the one would be of much longer duration
with no definite hope of recovery, but the other would be imposed with
the express purpose of the renewal of mercy.

[Ezekiel 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 4:7</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt set thy face - Or, "And etc." i. e., direct thy
mind to that subject.

Thine arm shall be uncovered - A sign of the execution of vengeance [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md).

[Ezekiel 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 4:8</span></span>

I will lay bands upon thee - Contrast margin reference. The Lord will
put constraint upon him, to cause him to exercise his office. In the
retirement of his house, figuratively bound and under constraint, he
shall not cease to proclaim the doom of the city.

The days of thy siege - Those during which he should thus foretell the
approaching calamity.

[Ezekiel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 4:9</span></span>

Two things are prefigured in the remainder of this chapter,

\(1\) the hardships of exile,

\(2\) the straitness of a siege.

To the people of Israel, separated from the rest of the nations as holy,
it was a leading feature in the calamities of their exile that they must
be mixed up with other nations, and eat of their food, which to the Jews
was a defilement (compare [Eze 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013.md);
[Amo 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md); [Dan
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008)..md)

Fitches - A species of wheat with shorn ears.

In one vessel - To mix all these varied seeds was an indication that the
people were no longer in their own land, where precautions against such
mixing of seeds were prescribed.

Three hundred and ninety days - The days of Israel's punishment; because
here is a figure of the exile which concerns all the tribes, not of the
siege which concerns Judah alone.

[Ezekiel 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 4:10</span></span>

meat - A general term for food, which in this case consists of grain.
Instead of measuring, it was necessary in extreme scarcity to weigh it
[Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Rev
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#006.md).

Twenty shekels a day - The shekel contained about 220 grains, so that 20
shekels would be about 56 of a pound.

From time to time - Thou shalt receive and eat it at the appointed
interval of a day.

[Ezekiel 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 4:11</span></span>

Water by measure - This probably corresponds to the water of affliction
[Kg1 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md); [Isa
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#020.md). The measure of the hin is
variously estimated by Jewish writers. The sixth part of a hin will be
according to one estimate about 610ths, according to another 910ths of a
pint. The lesser estimate is more suitable here.

[Ezekiel 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 4:12</span></span>

In eastern countries where fuel is scarce the want is supplied by dried
cow-dung laid up for the winter. Barley cakes were (and are) baked under
hot ashes without an oven. The dung here is to be burned to ashes, and
the ashes so employed.

[Ezekiel 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 4:13</span></span>

The ceremonial ordinances in relation to food were intended to keep the
nation free from idolatrous usages; everywhere among the pagan idol
feasts formed a leading part in their religious services, and idol meats
were partaken of in common life. Dispersion among the Gentiles must have
exposed the Jews to much which they regarded as common and unclean. In
Ezekiel's case there was a mitigation [Eze
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#015.md) of the defilement, but still
legal defilement remained, and the chosen people in exile were subjected
to it as to a degradation.

[Ezekiel 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 4:14</span></span>

Abominable flesh - Flesh that had become corrupt and foul by
overkeeping. Compare [Lev 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#007.md).

[Ezekiel 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 4:16</span></span>

The staff of bread - Bread is so called because it is that on which the
support of life mainly depends.

With astonishment - With dismay and anxiety at the calamities which are
befalling them.
