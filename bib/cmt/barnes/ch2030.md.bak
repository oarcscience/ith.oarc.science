### [2 Chronicles Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 30:1</span></span>

Compare [Ch2 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 30:2</span></span>

In the second month - Hezekiah and his counselors considered that the
permission of the Law (see the marginal reference) might, under the
circumstances, be extended to the whole people. It had been found
impossible to complete the cleansing of the temple until the fourteenth
day of the first month was past [Ch2
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md). It was, therefore, determined
to defer it to the 14th of the second month, which allowed time for the
priests generally to purify themselves, and for proclamation of the
festival to be made throughout all Israel.

[2 Chronicles 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 30:3</span></span>

At that time - i. e. in the first month, at the time of the events
mentioned in 2 Chr. 29.

[2 Chronicles 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 30:5</span></span>

They had not done it ... - Some prefer, "they had not kept it in full
numbers, as it was written" - i. e. "they (the Israelites of the
northern kingdom) had not (for some while) kept the Passover in full
numbers, as the Law required."

[2 Chronicles 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 30:6</span></span>

The posts went - The bearers of the letters were probably the "runners"
who formed a portion of the king's body-guard ([Kg2
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025) note.md).

The kings of Assyria - Pul, Tiglath-pileser, and Shalmaneser may all be
referred to in this passage (compare the marginal reference and [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md). The passage by no means implies
that the fall of Samaria and final captivity of the Israelites had as
yet taken place.

[2 Chronicles 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 30:10</span></span>

Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned as the two tribes nearest to Judah,
Zebulun as one of the furthest off.

[2 Chronicles 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 30:11</span></span>

Compare [Ch2 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018.md). Hence, five of the
ten tribes certainly sent representatives. Two - Reuben and Gad - were
in captivity. One - Dan - was absorbed into Judah. Simeon and Naphtali,
which alone remained, seem to have been more than ordinarily idolatrous
[Ch2 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md).

[2 Chronicles 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 30:14</span></span>

The continuance of the idolatrous altars to this time shows that
Hezekiah had been more anxious to construct than to destroy, to
establish the Yahweh-worship than to root out idolatry. Now, however,
that the more important work was done, the temple open, and the daily
service restored, attention could be turned to the secondary object of
removing from the city all traces of the late apostasy.

[2 Chronicles 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 30:15</span></span>

The laggart priests and Levites, who from want of zeal for the
Yahweh-worship, or from actual inclination to idolatry, had neglected to
purify themselves ([Ch2 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md) and
marginal reference), were now shamed by the general ardor, and
sanctified themselves for the Paschal festival.

And brought in the burnt offerings - Received them, i. e. from the
offerers at the doors of the inner court, and took them up to the brass
altar in front of the porch. No part of the burnt offerings was ever
taken inside the temple building.

[2 Chronicles 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 30:16</span></span>

After their manner - According to the Mishna, the custom was for the
priests to stand in two rows extending from the altar to the outer
court, where the people were assembled. As each offerer killed his lamb
the blood was caught in a basin, which was handed to the nearest priest,
who passed it on to his neighbor, and he to the next; the blood was thus
conveyed to the altar, at the base of which it was thrown by the last
priest in the row. While basins full of blood were thus passed up, empty
basins were passed down in a constant succession, so that there was no
pause or delay.

Which they received of the hand of the Levites - Ordinarily, the blood
was received at the hand of the offerer. But the greater number of the
Israelites [Ch2 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md) who had come to
keep the feast were involved in some ceremonial or moral defilement,
from which there had not been time for them to purify themselves. On
account of this uncleanness, they did not slay their own lambs, but
delegated the office to the Levites.

[2 Chronicles 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 30:22</span></span>

The "knowledge" intended is perhaps chiefly ritualistic and musical -
such knowledge as enabled them to conduct the service of the sanctuary
satisfactorily.

They did eat throughout the feast - literally, "they did eat the feast;"
i. e. "they kept the feast," which was essentially kept by the eating of
unleavened bread. The Levites kept the feast during the full term
appointed for it, never failing in their duties, but taking their part
day after day, both in the sacrifice of the victims and in singing
praises to God.

[2 Chronicles 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 30:23</span></span>

To keep other seven days - This was a voluntary addition to the
requirements of the Law - the fruit and sign of the abounding zeal which
characterized the time. Hezekiah and the princes probably proposed it to
the people, and presented them with sacrificial animals.

[2 Chronicles 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 30:25</span></span>

The strangers - See the [Ch2 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md)
note.

[2 Chronicles 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 30:26</span></span>

Since the time of Solomon - Compare [Ch2
7:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md).
