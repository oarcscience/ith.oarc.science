### [Acts Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md)

[Acts 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 15:1</span></span>

And certain men - These were undoubtedly men who had been Jews, but who
were now converted to Christianity. The fact that they were willing to
refer the matter in dispute to the apostles and elders [Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md) shows that they had professedly
embraced the Christian religion. The account which follows is a record
of the first internal dissension which occurred in the Christian church.
Hitherto the church had been struggling against external foes. Violent
persecutions had raged, and had fully occupied the attention of
Christians. But now the churches were at peace. They enjoyed great
external prosperity in Antioch, and the great enemy of souls took
occasion then, as he has often done in similar circumstances since, to
excite contentions in the church itself, so that when external violence
could not destroy it, an effort was made to secure the same object by
internal dissension and strife. This history, therefore, is particularly
important, as it is the record of the first unhappy debate which arose
in the bosom of the church. It is further important, as it shows the
manner in which such controversies were settled in apostolic times, and
as it established some very important principles respecting the
perpetuity of the religious rites of the Jews.

Came down from Judea - To Antioch, and to the regions adjacent, which
had been visited by the apostles, [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md). Judea was a high and hilly
region, and going from that toward the level countries adjacent to the
sea was represented to be descending, or going down.

Taught the brethren - That is, Christians. They endeavored to convince
them of the necessity of keeping the laws of Moses.

Except ye be circumcised - This was the leading or principal rite of the
Jewish religion. It was indispensable to the name and privileges of a
Jew. Proselytes to their religion were circumcised as well as
native-born Jews, and they held it to be indispensable to salvation. It
is evident from this that Paul and Barnabas had dispensed with this rite
in regard to the Gentile converts, and that they intended to found the
Christian church on the principle that the Jewish ceremonies were to
cease. When, however, it was necessary to conciliate the minds of the
Jews and to prevent contention, Paul did not hesitate to practice
circumcision, [Act 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md).

After the manner of Moses - According to the custom which Moses
commanded; according to the Mosaic ritual.

Ye cannot be saved - The Jews regarded this as indispensable to
salvation. The grounds on which they would press it on the attention of
Gentile converts would be very plausible, and such as would produce much
embarrassment. For:

\(1\) It would be maintained that the laws of Moses were the laws of
God, and were therefore unchangeable; and,

\(2\) It would doubtless be maintained that the religion of the Messiah
was only a completing and perfecting of the Jewish religion that it was
designed simply to carry out its principles according to the promises,
and not to subvert and destroy anything that had been established by
divine authority. It is usually not difficult to perplex and embarrass
young converts with questions of modes, and rites, and forms of
religion; and it is not uncommon that a revival is followed by some
contention just like this. Opposing sects urge the claims of their
special rites, and seek to make proselytes, and introduce contention and
strife into an otherwise peaceful and happy Christian community.

[Acts 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 15:2</span></span>

Had no small dissension an disputation - The word rendered "dissension"
στάσις stasis denotes sometimes "sedition" or "intestine war," and
sometimes "earnest and violent disputation or controversy," [Act
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#007.md), [Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md). In this place it clearly
denotes that there was earnest and warm discussion; but it is not
implied that there was any improper heat or temper on the part of Paul
and Barnabas. Important principles were to be settled in regard to the
organization of the church. Doctrines were advanced by the Judaizing
teachers which were false, and which tended to produce great disorder in
the church. Those doctrines were urged with zeal, were declared to be
essential to salvation, and would therefore tend to distract the minds
of Christians, and to produce great anxiety. It became, therefore,
necessary to meet them with a determined purpose, and to establish the
truth on an immovable basis. And the case shows that it is right to
"contend earnestly for the faith" [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md); and, when similar cases occur,
that it is proper to resist the approach of error with all the arguments
which may be at our command, and with all the weapons which truth can
furnish. It is further implied here that it is the duty of the ministers
of the gospel to defend the truth and to oppose error. Paul and Barnabas
regarded themselves as set for this purpose (compare [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md), "Knowing that I am set for the
defense of the gospel"); and Christian ministers should be qualified to
defend the truth, and should be willing with a proper spirit and with
great earnestness to maintain the doctrines revealed.

They determined - There was no prospect that the controversy would be
settled by contention and argument. It would seem, from this statement,
that those who came down from Judea were also willing that the whole
matter should be referred to the apostles at Jerusalem. The reason for
this may have been:

\(1\) That Jerusalem would be regarded by them as the source of
authority in the Christian church, as it had been among the Jews.

\(2\) most of the apostles and the most experienced Christians were
there. They had listened to the instructions of Christ himself; had been
long in the church; and were supposed to be better acquainted with its
design and its laws.

\(3\) those who came from Judea would not be likely to acknowledge the
authority of Paul as an apostle: the authority of those at Jerusalem
they would recognize.

\(4\) they might have had a very confident expectation that the decision
there would be in their favor. The question had not been agitated there.
They had all been Jews, and it is certain that they continued as yet to
attend in the temple service, and to conform to the Jewish customs. They
might have expected, therefore, with great confidence, that the decision
would be in their favor, and they were willing to refer it to those who
resided at Jerusalem.

Certain other of them - Of the brethren; probably of each party. They
did not go to debate, or to give their opinion, or to vote in the ease
themselves, but to lay the question fairly before the apostles and
elders.

Unto the apostles - The authority of the apostles in such a case would
be acknowledged by all. They had been immediately instructed by the
Saviour, and had the promise of infallible guidance in the organization
of the church. See the notes on [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md).

And elders - See the note at [Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md). Greek: presbyters. See the
notes on [Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). Who these were,
or what was their office and authority, is not easy now to determine. It
may refer either to the aged men in the church at Jerusalem, or to those
who were appointed to rule and to preach in connection with the
apostles. As in the synagogue it was customary to determine questions by
the advice of a bench of elders, there is no improbability in the
supposition that the apostles would imitate that custom, and appoint a
similar arrangement in the Christian church (Grotius). It is generally
agreed that this is the journey to which Paul refers in [Gal
2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md). If so, it happened fourteen
years after his conversion, [Gal 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md).
It was done in accordance with the divine command, "by revelation," [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md). Among those who went with him was
Titus, who was afterward so much distinguished as his companion, [Gal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003.md).

About this question - The question whether the ceremonial laws of Moses
were binding on Christian converts. In regard to the nature and design
of this council at Jerusalem, see the notes on [Act
15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#030.md).

[Acts 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 15:3</span></span>

And being brought on their way by the church - Being attended and
conducted by the Christian brethren. See the notes on [Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024.md). It was customary for the
Christians to attend the apostles in their travels. Compare [Co1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006.md), [Co1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011.md); [Jo3
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md).

Through Phenice - See the note at [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md).

And Samaria - These places were directly on their route to Jerusalem.

Declaring the conversion ... - Of the Gentiles in Antioch, and in the
regions in Asia Minor through which they had traveled. These remarkable
events they would naturally communicate with joy to the Christians with
whom they would have contact in their journey.

Caused great joy - At the news of the extensive spread of the gospel. It
was an indication of their deep feeling in the interests of religion
that they thus rejoiced. Where Christians are themselves awake, and
engaged in the service of Christ, they rejoice at the news of the
conversion of sinners. Where they are cold, they hear such news with
indifference, or with the utmost unconcern. One way of testing our
feelings on the subject of religion is by the emotions which we have
when we hear of extensive and glorious revivals of religion. Compare the
notes on [Act 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#008.md).

[Acts 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 15:4</span></span>

They were received of the church - By the church, in a hospitable and
friendly manner. They were acknowledged as Christian brethren, and
received with Christian kindness. See [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).

And they declared - Paul and Barnabas, and those with them. That is,
they stated the case; the remarkable conversion of the Gentiles, the
evidence of their piety, and the origin of the present dispute.

[Acts 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 15:5</span></span>

But there rose up ... - It has been doubted whether these are the words
of Paul and Barnabas, relating what occurred at Antioch, or whether they
are the words of Luke recording what took place at Jerusalem. The
correct exposition is probably what refers it to the latter. For:

\(1\) This seems to be the most obvious interpretation.

\(2\) the use of the words "rose up" implies that. Those who disturbed
the church at Antioch are said to have come down from Judea [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md), and if this place referred to
that occurrence, the same words would have been retained.

\(3\) the particular specification here of "the sect of the Pharisees"
looks as if this was an occurrence taking place at Jerusalem. No such
specification exists respecting those who came down to Antioch; but it
would seem here as if this party in Jerusalem resolved still to abide by
the Law, and to impose those rites on the Christian converts. However,
this interpretation is by no means certain.

Which believed - Who maintained or taught.

That it was needful ... - See the notes on [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md).

[Acts 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 15:6</span></span>

And the apostles and elders ... - They came together in accordance with
the authority in [Mat 18:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md). It
would seem, also, that the whole church was convened on this occasion,
and that the church concurred, at least, in the judgment expressed in
this case. See [Act 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md), [Act
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md).

For to consider of this matter - Not to decide it arbitrarily, or even
by authority, without deliberation; but to compare their views, and to
express the result of the whole to the church at Antioch. It was a grave
and difficult question, deeply affecting the entire constitution of the
Christian church, and they therefore solemnly engaged in deliberation on
the subject.

[Acts 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 15:7</span></span>

Much disputing - Or rather, much inquiry or deliberation. With our word
disputing we commonly connect the idea of heat and anger. This is not
necessarily implied in the word used here. It might have been calm,
solemn, deliberate inquiry; and there is no evidence that it was
conducted with undue warmth or anger.

Peter rose up and said - Peter was probably the most aged, and was most
accustomed to speak, [Act 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md), etc.;
[Act 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md), [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md). Besides, there was a particular
reason for his speaking here, as he had been engaged in similar scenes,
and understood the case, and had had evidence that God had converted
sinners without the Mosaic rites, and knew that it would have been
inexpedient to have imposed these rites on those who had thus been
converted.

A good while ago - See Acts 10: Some time since. So long since that
there had been opportunity to ascertain whether it was necessary to
observe the laws of Moses in order to the edification of the church.

God made choice ... - That is, of all the apostles, he designated me to
engage in this work. Compare the notes on [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md), with Acts 10.

That the Gentiles - Cornelius, and those who were assembled with him at
Caesarea. This was the first case that had occurred, and therefore it
was important to appeal to it.

[Acts 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 15:8</span></span>

And God, which knoweth the hearts - [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md). God thus knew whether they were
true converts or not, and gave a demonstration that he acknowledged them
as his.

Giving them the Holy Ghost ... - [Act
10:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045.md).

[Acts 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 15:9</span></span>

And put no difference ... - Though they had not been circumcised, and
though they did not conform to the Law of Moses. Thus, God showed that
the observance of these rites was not necessary in order to the true
conversion of people, and to acceptance with him. He did not give us,
who are Jews, any advantage over them, but justified and purified all in
the same manner.

Purifying their hearts - Thus, giving the best evidence that he had
renewed them, and admitted them to favor with him.

By faith - By believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. This demonstrated that
the plan on which God was now about to show favor to people was not by
external rites and ceremonies, but by a scheme which required faith as
the only condition of acceptance. It is further implied here that there
is no true faith which does not purify the heart.

[Acts 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 15:10</span></span>

Why tempt ye God? - Why provoke him to displeasure? Why, since he has
shown his determination to accept them without such rites, do you
provoke him by attempting to impose on his own people rites without his
authority, and a against his manifest will? The argument is, that God
had already accepted them. To attempt to impose these rites would be to
provoke him to anger; to introduce observances which he had shown it was
his purpose should now be abolished.

To put a yoke - That which would be burdensome and oppressive, or which
would infringe on their just freedom as the children of God. It is
called in [Gal 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md), "a yoke of
bondage." Compare the notes on [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md). A "yoke" is an emblem of slavery
or bondage [Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md); or of affliction
[Lam 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027.md); or of punishment [Lam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md); or of oppressive and burdensome
ceremonies, as in this place, or of the restraints of Christianity, [Mat
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md). In this place those rites
are called a yoke, because:

\(1\) They were burdensome and oppressive; and,

\(2\) Because they would be an infringement of Christian freedom. One
design of the gospel was to set people free from such rites and
ceremonies.

Which neither our fathers ... - Which have been found burdensome at all
times. They were expensive, and painful, and oppressive; and as they had
been found to be so, it was not proper to impose them on the Gentile
converts, but should rather rejoice at any evidence that the people of
God might be delivered from them.

Were able to bear - Which are found to be oppressive and burdensome.
They were attended with great inconvenience and many transgressions, as
the consequence.

[Acts 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 15:11</span></span>

But we believe - We apostles, who have been with them, and have seen the
evidences of their acceptance with God.

Through the grace ... - By the grace or mercy of Christ alone, without
any of the rites and ceremonies of the Jews.

We shall be saved, even as they - In the same manner, by the mere grace
of Christ. So far from being necessary to their salvation, they are
really of no use in ours. We are to be saved, not by these ceremonies,
but by the mere mercy of God in the Redeemer. They should not,
therefore, be imposed on others.

[Acts 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 15:12</span></span>

Then all the multitude - Evidently the multitude of private Christians
who were assembled on this occasion. That it does not refer to a synod
of ministers and elders merely is apparent:

\(1\) Because the church, the brethren, are represented as having been
present, and as concurring in the final opinion [Act
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md); and,

\(2\) Because the word "multitude" τὸ πλῆθος to plēthos would not have
been used in describing the collection of apostles and elders merely.
Compare [Luk 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010.md), [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md); [Luk
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006.md); [Luk
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md); [Luk
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037.md); [Joh
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#003.md); [Joh
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006.md); [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md); [Act
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md); [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

Gave audience - Heard, listened attentively to.

Barnabas and Paul - They were deeply interested in it, and they were
qualified to give a fair statement of the facts as they had occurred.

Declaring what miracles and wonders ... - The argument here evidently
is, that God had approved their work by miracles; that he gave evidence
that what they did had his approbation; and that as all this was done
without imposing on them the rites of the Jews, so it would follow that
those were not now to be commanded.

[Acts 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 15:13</span></span>

James answered - James the Less, son of Alpheus. See the notes on [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md).

Hearken unto me - This whole transaction shows that Peter had no such
authority in the church as the papists pretend, for otherwise his
opinion would have been followed without debate. James had an authority
not less than that of Peter. It is possible that he might have been next
in age (compare [Co1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007).md); and it
seems morally certain that he remained for a considerable part of his
life in Jerusalem, [Act 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md); [Act
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md); [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md), [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md).

[Acts 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 15:14</span></span>

Simeon - This is a Hebrew name. The Greek mode of writing it commonly
was Simon. It was one of the names of Peter, [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

To take out of them a people - To choose from among the Gentries those
who should be his friends.

[Acts 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 15:15</span></span>

The words of the prophets - [Amo
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md). It was a very material point
with them, as Jews, to inquire whether this was in accordance with the
predictions of the Scriptures. The most powerful revivals of religion,
and the most striking demonstrations of the divine presence, will be in
accordance with the Bible, and should be tested by them. This habit was
always manifested by the apostles and early Christians, and should be
followed by Christians at all times. Unless a supposed work of grace
accords with the Bible, and can be defended by it, it must be false, and
should be opposed. Compare [Isa 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md).

[Acts 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 15:16</span></span>

After this - This quotation is not made literally either from the Hebrew
or the Septuagint, which differs also from the Hebrew. The 17th verse is
quoted literally from the Septuagint, but in the 16th the general sense
only of the passage is retained. The main point of the quotation, as
made by James, was to show that, according to the prophets, it was
contemplated that the Gentiles should be introduced to the privileges of
the children of God; and on this point the passage has a direct bearing.
The prophet Amos [Amo 9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md) had
described the calamities which would come upon the nation of the Jews by
their being scattered and driven away. This implied that the city of
Jerusalem, the temple, and the walls of the city would be destroyed. But
after that (Heb: "on that day," [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md), that is, the day when he should
revisit them and recover them) he would restore them to their former
privileges - would rebuild their temple, their city, and their walls,
[Amo 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md). And not only so, not only
would the blessing descend on the Jews, but it would also be extended to
others. The "remnant of Edom," "the pagan upon whom" his "name would be
called" [Amo 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md), would also partake
of the mercy of God, and be subject to the Jewish people, and a time of
general prosperity and of permanent blessings would follow, [Amo
9:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md). James understands this as
referring to the times of the Messiah, and to the introduction of the
gospel to the Gentiles. And so the passage [Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md) is rendered in the Septuagint.
See ver. 17.

I will return - When the people of God are subjected to calamities and
trials, it is often represented as if God had departed from them. His
returning, therefore, is an image of their restoration to his favor and
to prosperity. This is not, however, in the Hebrew, in [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md).

I will build again - In the calamities that would come upon the nation
[Amo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md), it is implied that the
temple and the city would be destroyed. To build them again would be a
proof of his returning favor.

The tabernacle of David - The tent of David. Here it means the house or
royal residence of David and the kings of Israel. That is, he would
restore them to their former glory and splendor as his people. The
reference here is not to the temple, which was the work of Solomon, but
to the magnificence and splendor of the dwelling-place of David; that
is, to the full enjoyment of their former high privileges and blessings.

Which is fallen down - Which would be destroyed by the King of Babylon,
and by the long neglect and decay resulting from their being carried to
a distant land,

The ruins thereof - Heb. "close up the breaches thereof." That is, it
would be restored to its former prosperity and magnificence; an emblem
of the favor of God, and of the spiritual blessings that would in future
times descend on the Jewish people.

[Acts 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 15:17</span></span>

That the residue of men - This verse is quoted literally from the
Septuagint, and differs in some respects from the Hebrew. The phrase,
"the residue of men," here is evidently understood, both by the
Septuagint and by James, as referring to others than Jews, to the
Gentiles the rest of the world - implying that many of them would be
admitted to the friendship and favor of God. The Hebrew is, "that they
may possess the remnant of Edom." This change is made in the Septuagint
by a slight difference in the reading of two Hebrew words. The
Septuagint, instead of the Hebrew וירשׁו w-y-r-sh-w, shall inherit, read
ודרשׁו w-d-r-sh-w, shall seek of thee; and instead of אדום 'd-w-m, Edom,
they read אדם '̇̀̇d-m, man, or mankind; that is, people. Why this variation
occurred cannot be explained; but the sense is not materially different.
In the Hebrew the word "Edom" has undoubted reference to another nation
than the Jewish nation; and the expression means that, in the great
prosperity of the Jews after their return, they would extend the
influence of their religion to other nations; that is, as James applies
it, the Gentiles might be brought to the privileges of the children of
God.

And all the Gentiles - Heb. all the pagan; that is, all who were not
Jews. This was a clear prediction that other nations were to be favored
with the true religion, and that without any mention of their conforming
to the rites of the Jewish people.

Upon whom my name is called - Who are called by my name, or who are
regarded as my people.

Who doeth all these things - That is, who will certainly accomplish this
in its time.

[Acts 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 15:18</span></span>

Known unto God ... - See the notes on [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md). The meaning of this verse, in
this connection, is this. God sees everything future; he knows what he
will accomplish; he has a plan; all his works are so arranged in his
mind that he sees everything distinctly and clearly. As he foretold
these, it was a part of his plan; and as it was a part of his plan long
since foretold, it should not be opposed and resisted by us.

[Acts 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 15:19</span></span>

My sentence - Greek: I judge κρίνω krinō that is, I give my opinion. It
is the usual language in which a judge delivers his opinion; but it does
not imply here that James assumed authority to settle the case, but
merely that he gave his opinion, or counsel.

That we trouble not them - That we do not molest, disturb, or oppress
them by imposing on them unnecessary fires and ceremonies.

[Acts 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 15:20</span></span>

That we write unto them - Expressing our judgment, or our views of the
case.

That they abstain - That they refrain from these things, or wholly avoid
them.

Pollutions of idols - The word rendered "pollutions" means any kind of
"defilement." But here it is evidently used to denote the flesh of those
animals that were offered in sacrifice to idols. See [Act
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029.md). That flesh, after being offered
in sacrifice, was often exposed for sale in the markets, or was served
up at feasts, [Co1 10:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md). It became
a very important question whether it was right for Christians to partake
of it. The Jews would contend that it was, in fact, partaking of
idolatry. The Gentile converts would allege that they did not eat it as
a sacrifice to idols, or lend their countenance in any way to the
idolatrous Worship where it had been offered. See this subject discussed
at length in [Co1 8:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md). As idolatry
was forbidden to the Jews in every form, and as partaking even of the
sacrifices of idols in their feasts might seem to countenance idolatry,
the Jews would be utterly opposed to it; and for the sake of peace,
James advised that the Christians at Antioch be recommended to abstain
from this. To partake of that food might not be morally wrong [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), but it would give occasion for
scandal and offence; and, therefore, as a matter of expediency, it was
advised that they should abstain from it.

And from fornication - The word used here πορνεία porneia is applicable
to "all illicit sexual intercourse," and may refer to adultery, incest,
or licentiousness in any form. There has been much diversity of opinion
in regard to this expression. Interpreters have been greatly perplexed
to understand why this violation of the moral law has been introduced
amidst the violations of the ceremonial law, and the question is
naturally asked whether this was a sin about which there could be any
debate between the Jewish and Gentile converts? Were there any who would
practice it, or plead that it was lawful? If not, why is it prohibited
here? Various explanations of this have been proposed. Some have
supposed that James refers here to the offerings which harlots would
make of their gains to the service of religion, and that James would
prohibit the reception of it. Beza, Selden, and Schleusner suppose the
word is taken for idolatry, as it is often represented in the Scriptures
as consisting in unfaithfulness to God, and as it is often called
adultery. Heringius supposes that marriage between idolaters and
Christians is here intended. But, after all, the usual interpretation of
the word, as referring to illicit sexual intercourse of the sexes of any
kind, is undoubtedly here to be retained. If it be asked, then, why this
was particularly forbidden, and was introduced in this connection, we
may reply:

\(1\) That this vice prevailed everywhere among the Gentiles, and was
that to which all were particularly exposed.

\(2\) that it was not deemed by the Gentiles disgraceful. It was
practiced without shame and without remorse. (Terence, Adelphi, 1, 2,
21. See Grotius.) It was important, therefore, that the pure laws of
Christianity on this subject should be known, and that special pains
should be taken to instruct the early converts from paganism in those
laws. The same thing is necessary still in pagan lands.

\(3\) this crime was connected with religion. It was the practice not
only to introduce indecent pictures and emblems into their worship, but
also for females to devote themselves to the service of particular
temples, and to devote the avails of indiscriminate prostitution to the
service of the god, or the goddess. The vice was connected with no small
part of the pagan worship; and the images, the emblems, and the customs
of idolatry everywhere tended to sanction and promote it. A mass of
evidence on this subject which sickens the heart, and which would be too
long and too indelicate to introduce here, may be seen in Tholuck's
Nature and Moral Influence of Paganism, in the Biblical Repository for
July, 1832, p. 441-464. As this vice was almost universal; as it was
practiced without shame or disgrace; as there were no laws among the
pagan to prevent it; as it was connected with all their views of idol
worship and of religion, it was important for the early Christians to
frown upon and to oppose it, and to set a special guard against it in
all the churches. It was the sin to which, of all others, they were the
most exposed, and which was most likely to bring scandal on the
Christian religion. It is for this cause that it is so often and so
pointedly forbidden in the New Testament [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md); [Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md), [Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md); [Gal
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md); [Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md); [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md).

And from things strangled - That is, from animals or birds that were
killed without shedding their blood. The reason why these were
considered by the Jews unlawful to. be eaten was, that thus they would
be under a necessity of eating blood, which was positively forbidden by
the Law. Hence, it was commanded in the Law that when any beast or fowl
was taken in a snare, the blood should be poured out before it was
lawful to be eaten, [Lev 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#013.md).

And from blood - The eating of blood was strictly forbidden to the Jews.
The reason of this was that it contained the life, [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011.md), [Lev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#014.md). See notes on [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md). The use of blood was common
among the Gentiles. They drank it often at their sacrifices, and in
making covenants or compacts. To separate the Jews from them in this
respect was one design of the prohibition. See Spencer, De Ley Hebrae.,
p. 144, 145, 169, 235, 377, 381, 594, edit. 1732. See also this whole
passage examined at length in Spencer, p. 588-626. The primary reason of
the prohibition was, that it was thus used in the feasts and compacts of
idolaters. That blood was thus drank by the pagans, particularly by the
Sabians, in their sacrifices, is fully proved by Spencer, De Leg., p.
377-380 But the prohibition specifies a higher reason, that the life is
in the blood, and that therefore it should not be eaten. On this opinion
see the notes on [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md). This
reason existed before any ceremonial law; it is founded in the nature of
things; it has no particular reference to any custom of the Jews; and it
is as forcible in any other circumstances as in theirs. It was proper,
therefore, to forbid it to the early Christian converts; and for the
same reason, its use should be abstained from everywhere. It adds to the
force of these remarks when we remember that the same principle was
settled before the laws of Moses were given, and that God regarded the
fact that the life was in the blood as of so much importance as to make
the shedding of it worthy of death, [Gen
9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004.md). It is supposed, therefore, that
this law is still obligatory. Perhaps, also, there is no food more
unwholesome than blood; and it is a further circumstance of some moment
that all people naturally revolt from it as an article of food.

[Acts 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 15:21</span></span>

For Moses - The meaning of this verse is, that the Law of Moses,
prohibiting these things, was read in the synagogues constantly. As
these commands wore constantly read, and as the Jewish converts would
not soon learn that their ceremonial law had ceased to be binding, it
was deemed to be a matter of expediency that no needless offence should
be given to them. For the sake of peace, it was better that they should
abstain from meat offered to idols than to give offence to the Jewish
converts. Compare [Co1 8:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md).Of old
time - Greek: from ancient generations. It is an established custom, and
therefore his laws are well known, and have, in their view, not only the
authority of revelation, but the venerableness of antiquity.

In every city - Where there were Jews. This was the case in all the
cities to which the discussion here had reference.

Them that preach him - That is, by reading the Law of Moses. But, in
addition to reading the Law, it was customary also to offer an
explanation of its meaning. See the notes on [Luk
4:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016.md).

[Acts 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 15:22</span></span>

Then pleased it - It seemed fit and proper to them.

The apostles and elders - To whom the business had been particularly
referred, [Act 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md). Compare [Act
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#004.md).

With the whole church - All the Christians who were there assembled
together. They concurred in the sentiment, and expressed their
approbation in the letter that was sent, [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md). Whether they were consulted
does not particularly appear. But as it is not probable that they would
volunteer an opinion unless they were consulted, it seems most
reasonable to suppose that the apostles and elders submitted the case to
them for their approbation. It would seem that the apostles and elders
deliberated on it, and decided it; but still, for the sake of peace and
unity, they also took measures to ascertain that their decision agreed
with the sentiment of the church.

Chosen men - Men chosen for this purpose.

Of their own company - From among themselves. Greater weight and
authority would thus be attached to their message.

Judas surnamed Barsabas - Possibly the same who was nominated to the
vacant place in the apostleship, [Act
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023.md). But Grotius supposes that it was
his brother.

And Silas - He was afterward the traveling companion of Paul, [Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040.md); [Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md), [Act
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#029.md); [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004.md), [Act
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010.md), [Act
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015.md). He is also the same person,
probably, who is mentioned by the name of Silvanus, [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md); [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md); [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md); [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md).

Chief men among the brethren - Greek: leaders. Compare [Luk
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026.md). Men of influence, experience,
and authority in the church. Judas and Silas are said to have been
prophets, [Act 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md). They had,
therefore, been engaged as preachers and rulers in the church at
Jerusalem.

[Acts 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 15:23</span></span>

And wrote letters - Greek: "Having written." It does not mean that they
wrote more than one epistle.

By them - Greek: by their hand."

After this manner - Greek: these things.

Send greeting - A word of salutation, expressing their desire of the
happiness (χαίρειν chairein) of the persons addressed. Compare [Mat
26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049.md); [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029.md); [Luk
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md); [Joh
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#003.md).

In Antioch - Where the difficulty first arose.

And Syria - Antioch was the capital of Syria, and it is probable that
the dispute was not confined to the capital.

And Cilicia - See the notes on [Act
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009.md). Cilicia was adjacent to Syria.
Paul and Barnabas had traveled through it, and it is probable that the
same difficulty would exist there which had disturbed the churches in
Syria.

[Acts 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 15:24</span></span>

Forasmuch - Since we have heard.

That certain - That some, [Act 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md).

Have troubled you with words - With doctrines. They have disturbed your
minds, and produced contentions.

Subverting your souls - The word used here occurs nowhere else in the
New Testament ἀνασκευάζοντες anaskeuazontes. It properly means "to
collect together the vessels used in a house the household furniture -
for the purpose of removing it." It is applied to marauders, robbers,
and enemies who remove and bear off property, thus producing distress,
confusion, and disorder. It is thus used in the sense of disturbing or
destroying, and here denotes that they "unsettled their minds" - that
they produced anxiety, disturbance, and distress by these doctrines
about Moses.

To whom we gave no such commandment - They went, therefore, without
authority. Self-constituted and self-sent teachers not infrequently
produce disturbance and distress. Had the apostles been consulted on
this subject, the difficulty would have been avoided. By thus saying
that they had not given them a command to teach these things, they
practically assured the Gentile converts that they did not approve of
the course which those who went from Judea had taken.

[Acts 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 15:26</span></span>

Men that have hazarded their lives ... - See Acts 14: This was a noble
testimony to the character of Barnabas and Paul. It was a commendation
of them to the confidence of the churches, and an implied expression
that they wished their authority to be regarded in the establishment and
organization of the church.

For the name - In the cause of the Lord Jesus.

[Acts 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 15:27</span></span>

The same things - The same things that we wrote to you They will confirm
all by their own statements.

[Acts 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 15:28</span></span>

For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost - This is a strong and undoubted
claim to inspiration. It was with special reference to the organization
of the church that the Holy Spirit had been promised to them by the Lord
Jesus, [Mat 18:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md); [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md).

No greater burden - To impose no greater restraints to enjoin no other
observances. See the notes on [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md).

Than these necessary things - Necessary:

\(1\) In order to preserve the peace of the church.

\(2\) to conciliate the minds of the Jewish converts, [Act
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021.md).

\(3\) in their circumstances particularly, because the crime which is
specified - licentiousness was one to which all early converts were
especially exposed. See the notes on [Act
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md).

[Acts 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 15:29</span></span>

From meats offered to idols - This explains what is meant by "pollutions
of idols," [Act 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md).

Ye shall do well - You will do what ought to be done in regard to the
subjects of dispute.

[Acts 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 15:31</span></span>

They rejoiced for the consolation - They acquiesced in the decision of
the apostles and elders, and rejoiced that they were not to be subjected
to the burdensome rites and ceremonies of the Jewish religion. This
closes the account of the first Christian council. It was conducted
throughout on Christian principles; in a mild, kind, conciliatory
spirit, and is a model for all similar assemblages. It came together,
not to promote, but to silence disputation; not to persecute the people
of God, but to promote their peace; not to be a scene of harsh and angry
recrimination, but to be an example of all that was mild, and tender,
and kind. Those who composed it came together, not to carry a point, not
to overreach their adversaries, not to be party people, but to mingle
their sober counsels, to inquire what was right, and to express, in a
Christian manner, what was proper to be done. Great and important
principles were to be established in regard to the Christian church, and
they engaged in their work evidently with a deep sense of their
responsibility, and with a just view of their dependence on the aid of
the Holy Spirit. How happy Would it have been if this spirit had been
possessed by all professedly Christian councils; if all had really
sought the peace and harmony of the churches; if none had ever been
convened to kindle the fires of persecution, or to rend and destroy the
church of God!

This council has been usually appealed to as the authority for councils
in the church as a permanent arrangement, and especially as an authority
for courts of appeal and control. But it establishes neither, and should
be brought as authority for neither. For:

\(1\) It was not a court of appeal in any intelligible sense. It was an
assembly convened for a special purpose; designed to settle an inquiry
which arose in a particular part of the church, and which required the
collected wisdom of the apostles and elders.

\(2\) it had none of the marks or appendages of a court. The term
"court," or judicature, is nowhere applied to it, nor to any assembly of
Christian people in the New Testament. Nor should these terms be used
now in the churches. courts of judicature imply a degree of authority
which cannot be proved from the New Testament to have been conceded to
any ecclesiastical body of people.

\(3\) there is not the slightest intimation that anything like
permanency was to be attached to this council, or that it would be
periodically or regularly repeated. It proves, indeed, that, when cases
of difficulty occur - when Christians are perplexed and embarrassed, or
when contentions arise - it is proper to refer to Christian people for
advice and direction. Such was the case here, and such a course is
obviously proper. If it should be maintained that it is well that
Christian ministers and laymen should assemble periodically, at stated
intervals, on the supposition that such cases may arise, this is
conceded; but the example of the apostles and elders should not be
pleaded as making such assemblies of divine right and authority, or as
being essential to the existence of a church of God. Such an arrangement
has been deemed to be so desirable by Christians, that it has been
adopted by Episcopalians in their regular annual and triennial
Conventions; by Methodists in their conferences; by Presbyterians in
their General Assembly; by Friends in their Yearly Meetings; by Baptists
and congregationalists in their Associations, etc.; but the example of
the council summoned on a special emergency at Jerusalem should not be
pleaded as giving divine authority to these periodical assemblages. They
are wise and prudent arrangements, contributing to the peace of the
church, and the example of the council at Jerusalem can be adduced as
furnishing as reach divine authority for one as for another; that is, it
does not make all or either of them of divine authority, or obligatory
on the church of God.

\(4\) it should be added that a degree of authority (compare [Act
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#004).md) would, of course, be attached to
the decision of the apostles and elders at that time which cannot be to
any body of ministers and laymen now. Besides, it should never be
forgotten - what, alas! it seems to have been the pleasure and the
interest of ecclesiastics to forget that neither the apostles nor elders
asserted any jurisdiction over the churches of Antioch, Syria, and
Cilicia; that they did not claim a right to have these cases referred to
them; that they did not attempt to "lord it" over their faith or their
consciences. The case was a single, specific, definite question referred
to them, and they decided it as such. They asserted no abstract right of
such jurisdiction; they sought not to intermeddle With the case; they
enjoined no future reference of such cases to them, to their successors,
or to any ecclesiastical tribunal. They evidently regarded the churches
as blessed with the most ample freedom, and contemplated no arrangement
of a permanent character asserting a right to legislate on articles of
faith, or to make laws for the direction of the Lord's freemen.

[Acts 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 15:32</span></span>

Being prophets - See the notes on [Act
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027.md). This evidently implies that
they had been preachers before they went to Antioch. What was the
precise nature of the office of a prophet in the Christian church it is
not easy to ascertain. Possibly it may imply that they were teachers of
unusual or remark able ability. Compare the notes on [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md).

Confirmed them - Strengthened them; that is, by their instructions and
exhortations. See the notes on [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md).

[Acts 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 15:33</span></span>

A space - For some time.

They were let go in peace - An expression implying that they departed
with the affectionate regard of the Christians to whom they had
ministered, and with their highest wishes for their prosperity, [Co1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011.md); [Jo2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md).

Unto the apostles - At Jerusalem. Many mss., however, instead of "unto
the apostles," read "unto those who had sent them." The sense is not
materially different.

[Acts 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 15:34</span></span>

Notwithstanding ... - This whole verse is missing in many mss.; in the
Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic versions; and is regarded as spurious by
Mill, Griesbach, and by other critics. It was probably introduced by
some early transcriber, who judged it necessary to complete the
narrative. The Latin Vulgate reads, "It seemed good to Silas to remain,
but Judas went alone to Jerusalem."

[Acts 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 15:35</span></span>

Paul also, and Barnabas, continued in Antioch - How long a time is
unknown. It is probable that at this time the unhappy incident occurred
between Paul and Peter which is recorded in [Gal
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md).

[Acts 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 15:36</span></span>

Let us go again and visit our brethren - That is, in the churches which
they had established in Asia Minor, [Act
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014.md). This was a natural wish, and
was an enterprise that might be attended with important advantages to
those feeble churches.

[Acts 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 15:37</span></span>

And Barnabas determined - Greek: willed, or was disposed to
(ἐβουλεύσαντο ebouleusanto).

John ... - See the notes on [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md). He had been with them before as
a traveling companion, [Act 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md);
[Act 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md). He was the son of a sister
of Barnabas [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), and it is
probable that Barnabas' affection for his nephew was the main reason for
inducing him to wish to take him with him in the journey.

[Acts 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 15:38</span></span>

But Paul thought not good - Did not think it proper. Because he could
not confide in his perseverance with them in the toils and perils of
their journey.

Who departed from them ... - [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md). Why he did this is not known.
It was evidently, however, for some cause which Paul did not consider
satisfactory, and which, in his view, disqualified him from being their

To the work - Of preaching the gospel.

And the contention was so sharp - The word used here παροξυσμός
paroxusmos is that from which our word "paroxysm" is derived. It may
denote "any excitement of mind," and is used in a good sense in [Heb
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md). It here means, however, "a
violent altercation" that resulted in their separation for a time, and
in their engaging in different spheres of labor.

And sailed into Cyprus - This was the native place of Barnabas. See the
notes on [Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md).

Being recommended - Being commended by prayer to God. See notes on [Act

Syria and Cilicia - These were countries lying near to each other, which
Paul, in company with Barnabas, had before visited.

Confirming the churches - Strengthening them by instruction and
exhortation. It has no reference to the rite of confirmation. See the
notes on [Act 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md).

In regard to this unhappy contention between Paul and Barnabas, and
their separation from each other, we may make the following remarks:

\(1\) That no apology or vindication of it is offered by the sacred
writer. It was undoubtedly improper and evil. It was a melancholy
instance in which even apostles evinced an improper spirit, and engaged
in improper strife.

\(2\) in this contention it is probable that Paul was, in the main,
right. Barnabas seems to have been influenced by attachment to a
relative; Paul sought a helper who would not shrink from duty and
danger. It is clear that Paul had the sympathies and prayers of the
church in his favor [Act 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040.md), and it
is more than probable that Barnabas departed without any such sympathy,
[Act 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md).

\(3\) there is reason to think that this contention was overruled for
the furtherance of the gospel. They went to different places, and
preached to different people. It often happens that the unhappy and
wicked strifes of Christians are the means of exciting their mutual
zeal, and of extending the gospel, and of establishing churches. But no
thanks to their contention; nor is the guilt of their anger and strife
mitigated by this.

\(4\) this difference was afterward reconciled, and Paul and Barnabas
again became traveling companions, [Co1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).

\(5\) there is evidence that Paul also became reconciled to John Mark,
[Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md); [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md). How long this separation
continued is not known; but perhaps in this journey with Barnabas John
gave such evidence of his courage and zeal as induced Paul again to
admit him to his confidence as a traveling companion, and as to become a
profitable fellow-laborer. See [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md), "Take Mark, and bring him with
thee; for he is profitable to me for the ministry."

\(6\) this account proves that there was no collusion or agreement among
the apostles to impose upon mankind. Had there been such an agreement,
and had the books of the New Testament been an imposture, the apostles
would have been represented as perfectly harmonious, and as united in
all their views and efforts. What impostor would have thought of the
device of representing the early friends of the Christian religion as
divided, and contending, and separating from each other? Such a
statement has an air of candor and honesty, and at the same time is
apparently so much against the truth of the system, that no impostor
would have thought of resorting to it.
