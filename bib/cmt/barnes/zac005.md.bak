### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 5:1</span></span>

Hitherto all had been bright, full of the largeness of the gifts of God;
of God's favor to His people ; the removal of their enemies ; the
restoration and expansion and security of God's people and Church under
His protection ; the acceptance of the present typical priesthood and
the promise of Him, through whom there should be entire forgiveness :
the abiding illumining of the Church by the Spirit of God . Yet there is
a reverse side to all this, God's judgments on those who reject all His
mercies. Augustine, de Civ. Del. 17:3. Ribera: "Prophecies partly
appertain to those in whose times the sacred writers prophesied, partly
to the mysteries of Christ. And therefore it is the custom of the
prophets, at one time to chastise vices and set forth punishments, at
another to predict the mysteries of Christ and the Church."

And I turned and - Or, "Again I lifted up my eyes" [Gen
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018.md); [Kg2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#011.md), [Kg2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#013.md); [Jer
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md), having again sunk down in
meditation on what he had seen, "and behold a roll flying;" as, to
Ezekiel was shown "a hand with a roll of a book therein, and he spread
it before me." Ezekiel's roll also was "written within and without, and
there was written, therein lamentation and mourning and woe" [Eze
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md). It was a wide unfolded roll,
as is involved in its flying; but its "flight signified the very swift
coming of punishment; its flying from heaven that the sentence came from
the judgment-seat above" (Ribera).

[Zechariah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 5:2</span></span>

And he - (the interpreting angel) said unto me It cannot be without
meaning, that the dimensions of the roll should be those of the
tabernacle , as the last vision was that of the candlestick, after the
likeness of the candlestick therein. The explanations of this
correspondence do not exclude each other. It may be that "judgment shall
begin at the house of God" [Pe1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md);
that the punishment on sin is proportioned to the nearness of God and
the knowledge of Him; that the presence of God, which was for life,
might also be to death, as Paul says; "God maketh manifest the savor of
this knowledge by us in every place; for we are unto God a sweet savor
of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish; to the one we
are the savor of death unto death, and to the other the savor of life
unto life" [Co2 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md); and Simeon
said, "This child is set for the fall and rising again of many in
Israel" [Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md).

[Zechariah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 5:3</span></span>

Over the face of the whole earth - primarily land, since the perjured
persons, upon whom the curse was to fall [Zac
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md), were those who swore falsely by
the name of God: and this was in Judah only. The reference to the two
tables of the law also confines it primarily to those who were under the
law. Yet, since the moral law abides under the Gospel, ultimately these
visions related to the Christian Church, which was to be spread over the
whole earth. The roll apparently was shown, as written on both sides;
the commandments of the first table, in which perjury is forbidden, on
the one side; those relating to the love of our neighbor, in which
stealing is forbidden, on the other. Theodoret: "He calleth curse that
vengeance, which goeth through the whole world, and is brought upon the
workers of iniquity. But hereby both prophets and people were taught,
that the God of all is the judge of all people, and will exact meet
punishment of all, bringing utter destruction not on those only who live
ungodly toward Himself, but on those also who are unjust to their
neighbors. For let no one think that this threat was only against
thieves and false-swearers; for He gave sentence against all iniquity.
For since all the law and the prophets hang on this word, "Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself,"
He comprised every sort of sin under false swearing and theft. The
violation of oaths is the head of all ungodliness. One who so doeth is
devoid of the love of God. But theft indicates injustice to one's
neighbor; for no one who loves his neighbor will endure to be unjust to
him. These heads then comprehend all the other laws."

Shall be cut off - Literally, "cleansed away" , as something defiled and
defiling, which has to be cleared away as offensive: as God says, "I
will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh
away dung, until it be all gone" ([Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md), add [Kg1
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021).md), and so often in Deuteronomy,
"thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee" ([Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005) (6 Heb..md); [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md); [Deu
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019.md); [Deu
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021.md); [Deu
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md); [Deu
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007).md), or "of Israel" [Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md); [Deu
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#022.md), and in Ezekiel, "I will
disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of
thee" [Eze 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015.md). Set it empty upon
the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot and may burn, and the
filthiness of it may be molten, that the scum of it may be consumed"
[Eze 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#011.md).

[Zechariah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 5:4</span></span>

I will bring it forth - Out of the treasure-house, as it were; as he
says, "He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures" [Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md); [Jer
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016.md); and, "Is not this laid up in
store with Me, sealed up among My treasures?" To Me belongeth "vengeance
and recompense" [Deu 32:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md). And it
shall remain, literally, "lodge for the night," until it has
accomplished that for which it was sent, its utter destruction. Lap.:
"So we have seen and see at this day powerful families, which attained
to splendor by rapine or ill-gotten goods, destroyed by the just
judgment of God, that those who see it are amazed, how such wealth
perceptibly yet insensibly disappeared." Chrys. on the statues 15. n.
13. p. 259. Oxford Translation: "Why doth it overthrow the stones and
the wood of the swearer's house? In order that the ruin may be a
correction to all. For since the earth must hide the swearer, when dead,
his house, overturned and become a heap, will by the very sight be an
admonition to all who pass by and see it, not to venture on the like,
lest they suffer the like, and it will be a lasting witness against the
sin of the departed."

Paganism was impressed with the doom of him who consulted the oracle,
whether he should foreswear himself for gain. "Swear," was the answer,
"since death awaits too the man, who keeps the oath; yet Oath hath a
son, nameless, handless, footless; but swift he pursueth, until he grasp
together and destroy the whole race and house." "In the third
generation, there was nought descended from him," who had consulted
about this perjury, "nor hearthstone reputed to be his. It had been
uprooted and effaced." A pagan orator relates, as well known, that "the
perjurer escapes not the vengeance of the gods, and if not himself, yet
the sons and whole race of the foresworn fall into great misfortunes."
God left not Himself without witness.

Lap.: "The prophet speaks of the curse inflicted on the thieves and
false swearers of his own day; but a fortiori he includes that which
came upon them for slaying Christ. For this was the greatest of all,
which utterly overthrew and consumed Jerusalem, the temple and polity,
so that that ancient and glorious Jerusalem exists no longer, as Christ
threatened. "They shall lay thee even with the ground, and they shall
not leave in thee one stone upon another" [Luk
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044.md). This resteth upon them these"
1800 "years."

[Zechariah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 5:5</span></span>

Then the angel went forth - From the choirs of angels, among whom, in
the interval, he had retired, as before ([Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003) (7 Hebrew).md) he had gone forth to
meet another angel.

[Zechariah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 5:6</span></span>

This is the ephah that goeth forth - Theodoret: "We too are taught by
this, that the Lord of all administers all things in weight and measure.
So, foretelling to Abraham that his seed should be a sojourner and the
cause thereof, He says, "for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet
full" [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md), that is, they have
not yet committed sins enough to merit entire destruction, wherefore I
cannot yet endure to give them over to the slaughter, but will wait for
the measure of their iniquity." The relation then of this vision to the
seventh is, that the seventh tells of God's punishment on individual
sinners; this, on the whole people, when the iniquity of the whole is
full.

This is their resemblance, as we say, their look, that is, the look,
appearance, of the inhabitants "in all the land." This then being the
condition of the people of the land, at the time to which the vision
relates, the symbolical carrying away of the full measure of sin cannot
be its forgiveness, since there was no repentance, but the taking away
of the sin with the sinner. Cyril: "The Lord of all is good and loving
to mankind; for He is patient toward sinners and endures transgressors,
waiting for the repentance of each; but if one perseveres long in
iniquity, and come to the term of the endurance allowed, it remains that
he should be subjected to punishment, and there is no account of this
long forebarance, nor can he be exempt from judgment proportioned to
what he has done. So then Christ says to the Jewish people, rushing with
unbridled phrensy to all strange excess, "Fill ye up the measure of your
fathers" [Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md). The measure then,
which was seen, pointed to the filling up of the measure of the
transgression of the people against Himself." Jerome: "The angel bids
him behold the sins of the people Israel, heaped together in a perfect
measure, and the transgression of all fulfilled - that the sins, which
escaped notice, one by one, might, when collected together, be laid open
to the eyes of all, and Israel might go forth from its place, and it
might be shown to all what she was in her own land." Ribera: "I think
the Lord alluded to the words of the prophet, as though He would say,
"Fill up the measure of sins" which your fathers began of old, as it is
in Zechariah, that is, ye will soon fill it; for ye so haste to do evil,
that ye will soon fill it to the utmost."

[Zechariah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 5:7</span></span>

And behold there was lifted up a talent of lead - the heaviest Hebrew
weight, elsewhere of gold or silver; the golden talent weighing,
1,300,000 grains; the silver, 660,000; here, being lead, it is obviously
an undefined mass, though circular , corresponding to the Ephah. The
Ephah too was the largest Hebrew measure, whose compass cannot now, with
certainty, be ascertained . Both probably were, in the vision, ideal.
Theodoret: "Holy Scripture calleth the punishment of sin, lead, as being
by nature heavy. This the divine David teacheth us, "mine iniquities are
gone over my head: as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me" [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md). The divine Zechariah seeth sin
under the image of a woman; for most evils are engendered by luxury. But
he seeth the punishment, like most heavy lead, lying upon the mouth of
iniquity, according to a Psalm, "all iniquity shall stop her mouth" [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md). Ambr. in Ps. 35. n. 9. Opp. i.
769: "Iniquity, as with a talent of lead, weighs down the conscience."

This is a woman - Literally, "one woman," all sin being concentrated and
personified in one, as he goes on to speak of her as the, personified,
wickedness. The sitting may represent her abiding tranquil condition in
her sins, according to the climax in [Psa
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), "and hath not sat in the seat
of the scornful" [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md); and, "thou
sittest and speakest against thy brother" [Psa
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020); (Lap..md), "not standing as by the
way, but sitting, as if of set purpose, of custom and habit." "Whoso
hath peace in sins is not far from lying down in them, so that,
oppressed by a spirit of slumber, he neither sees light, nor feels any
blow, but is kept down by the leaden talent of his obduracy."

[Zechariah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 5:8</span></span>

And cast her into the midst of the Ephah - As yet then the measure was
not full. Ribera: "She had the lower part within the Ephah, but the
upper, especially the head, without. Though the Jews had slain the
prophets and done many grievous things, the greatest sin of all remained
to be done. But when they had crucified Christ and persecuted the
Apostles and the Gospel, the measure was full; she was wholly within the
Ephah, no part remained without, so that the measure was filled."

And he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof - that is,
doubtless of the Ephah; as in Genesis, "a great stone was on the mouth
of the well" [Gen 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#002.md), so that there
should be no access to it.

[Zechariah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 5:9</span></span>

There came out two women - It may be that there may be no symbol herein,
but that he names women because it was a woman who was so carried; yet
their wings were the wings of an unclean bird, strong, powerful, borne
by a force not their own; with their will, since they flew; beyond their
will, since the wind was in their wings; rapidly, inexorably,
irresistibly, they flew and bore the Ephah between heaven and earth. No
earthly power could reach or rescue it. God would not. It may be that
evil spirits are symbolized, as being like to this personified human
wickedness, such as snatch away the souls of the damned, who, by serving
them, have become as they.

[Zechariah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 5:11</span></span>

To build it an house in the land of Shinar - The name of Shinar, though
strictly Babylonia, carries back to an older power than the world-empire
of Babylon; which now too was destroyed. "In the land of Shinar" [Gen
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md) was that first attempt to array a
world-empire against God, ere mankind was ye dispersed. And so it is the
apter symbol of the antitheist or anti-Christian world, which by
violence, art, falsehood, sophistry, wars against the truth. To this
great world-empire it was to be removed; yet to live there, no longer
cramped and confined as within an Ephah, but in pomp and splendor. A
house or temple was to be built for it, for its honor and glory; as
Dagon [Sa1 5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md) or Ashtaroth [Sa1
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010.md), or Baal [Kg2
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023.md) had their houses or temples, a
great idol temple, in which the god of this world should be worshiped.

And it - - "The house," "shall be established" firmly on its base, like
the house of God, and it, (wickedness) shall be tranquilly rested on its
base, as an idol in its temple, until the end come. In the end, the
belief of those of old was, that the Jews would have great share in the
antagonism to Christ and His empire. At the first, they were the great
enemies of the faith, and sent forth, Justin says, , those everywhere
who should circulate the calumnies against Christians, which were made a
ground of early persecutions. In the end, it was believed, that
antichrist should be from them, that they would receive him as their
Christ, the last fulfillment of our Lord's words, "I am come in My
Father's name and ye receive Me not; another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive" [Joh 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043.md).
