### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 12:1</span></span>

Nathan came to David as if to ask his judicial decision on the case
about to be submitted to him (compare [Sa2
14:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md); [Kg1
20:35-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035).md). The circumstances of the
story are exquisitely contrived to heighten the pity of David for the
oppressed, and his indignation against the oppressor [Sa1
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#013.md), [Sa1
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 12:6</span></span>

Fourfold - The exact number prescribed by the Law (see the marginal
references), and acted upon by Zaccheus. The Septuagint has "sevenfold,"
as in [Pro 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 12:8</span></span>

And thy master's wives ... - According to Eastern custom, the royal
harem was a part of the royal inheritance. The prophets spoke in such
matters according to the received opinions of their day, and not always
according to the abstract rule of right. (Compare [Mat
19:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004)..md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 12:11</span></span>

See the marginal references. In both the points of David's crime the
retribution was according to his sin. His adultery was punished by
Absalom's outrage, his murder by the bloodshed of domestic fights, which
cost the lives of at least three of his favorite sons, Amnon, Absalom,
and Adonijah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 12:13</span></span>

For a comment on David's words, read Ps. 51; [Psa
32:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md).

Thou shalt not die - Not spoken of the punishment of death as affixed to
adultery by the Mosaic Law: the application of that law [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md); [Joh
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005.md) to an absolute Eastern monarch was
out of the question. The death of the soul is meant (compare [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md), [Eze
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md), [Eze
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#018).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 12:16</span></span>

The death of the infant child of one of the numerous harem of an
Oriental monarch would in general be a matter of little moment to the
father. The deep feeling shown by David on this occasion is both an
indication of his affectionate and tender nature, and also a proof of
the strength of his passion for Bath-sheba. He went into his most
private chamber, his closet [Mat 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006.md),
and "lay upon the earth" [Sa2 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031.md),
rather "the ground," meaning the floor of his chamber as opposed to his
couch.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 12:24</span></span>

Solomon - Or "peaceable," a name given to him at his circumcision.
Compare [Luk 1:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#059.md). The giving of the
name Jedidiah, by the Lord through Nathan, signified God's favor to the
child, as in the cases of Abraham, Sarah, and Israel. The name Jedidiah
(which contains the same root as the name David, namely, "to love")
indicated, prophetically, what God's Providence brought about actually,
namely, the succession and glorious reign of Solomon over Israel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 12:27</span></span>

The city of waters - The lower town of Rabbah (the modern Ammam), so
called from a stream which rises within it and flows through it. The
upper town with the citadel lay on a hill to the north of the stream,
and was probably not tenable for any length of time after the supply of
water was cut off.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 12:30</span></span>

Their king's crown - The word rendered their king (Malcham) is also the
name of the national idol of the Ammonites ([Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md), [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md) margin; [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md). Moreover, the weight of the
crown, which is calculated to be equal to 100 or 125 pounds weight, is
far too great for a man to wear. On the whole, it seems most probable
that the idol Malcam is here meant.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 12:31</span></span>

For the saw as an implement of torture compare [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md).

Harrows of iron - Or rather thrashing-machines ([Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md); [Isa
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015), etc..md).

Axes - The word so rendered occurs only here and in [Ch1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003.md). It evidently means some cutting
instrument.

Made them pass through the brick-kiln - The phrase is that always used
of the cruel process of making their children pass through the fire to
Moloch, and it is likely that David punished this idolatrous practice by
inflicting something similar upon the worshippers of Moloch. The cruelty
of these executions belongs to the barbarous manners of the age, and was
provoked by the conduct of the Ammonites [Sa2
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md); [Sa1
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001.md), but is utterly indefensible
under the light of the Gospel. If Rabbah was taken before David's
penitence, he may have been in an unusually harsh and severe frame of
mind. The unpleasant recollection of Uriah's death would be likely to
sour and irritate him to the utmost.
