### [Numbers Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 22:0</span></span>

With this chapter begins the fourth and last division of the Book of
Numbers, comprising 14 chapters. In them are narrated the events which
befell Israel while encamped in the plains of Moab, and certain
instructions and arrangements are laid down by Moses with reference to
their actual entry upon the promised inheritance.

[Numbers 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 22:1</span></span>

The plains - Hebrew ערבה ‛ărābâh; the word is the plural of that which
is used to denote the whole depressed tract along the Jordan and the
Dead Sea, and onward, where it is still called the Arabah (compare [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004) note.md), to the Elanitic gulf.

On this side Jordan by Jericho - Rather, across the Jordan of Jericho,
i. e., that part of Jordan which skirted the territory of Jericho. This
form of expression indicates the site of the camp in its relation to the
well-known city of Jericho. See [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md).

[Numbers 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 22:2</span></span>

Balak the son of Zippor - The comparison of [Num
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004.md) with [Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md) suggests that Balak was not the
hereditary king but a Midianite, and that a change of dynasty had taken
place. His father's name, Zippor, "Bird," reminds us of those of other
Midianites, e. g., Oreb, "Crow," Zeeb, "Wolf." Possibly the Midianite
chieftains had taken advantage of the weakness of the Moabites after the
Amorite victories to establish themselves as princes in the land.

[Numbers 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 22:5</span></span>

Balaam the son of Beor was from the first a worshipper in some sort of
the true God; and had learned some elements of pure and true religion in
his home in the far East, the cradle of the ancestors of Israel. But
though prophesying, doubtless even before the ambassadors of Balak came
to him, in the name of the true God, yet prophecy was still to him as
before a mere business, not a religion. The summons of Balak proved to
be a crisis in his career: and he failed under the trial. When the gold
and honors of Balak seemed to be finally lost, he became reckless and
desperate; and, as if in defiance, counseled the evil stratagem by which
he hoped to compass indirectly that ruin of God's people which he had
been withheld from working otherwise. He thus, like Judas and
Ahithophel, set in motion a train of events which involved his own
destruction.

The name Balaam signifies "destroyer," or "glutton," and is in part
identical with "Bela, son of Beor," the first king of Edom [Gen
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#032). The name "Beor" ("to burn up".md)
is that of the father, or possibly ancestor, of the prophet.

Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people
- Rather, Pethor which was ... land. Pethor (Pitru, Assyrian) was on the
river Sagura (modern: Sajur) near its junction with the Euphrates.

[Numbers 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 22:7</span></span>

Rewards of divination - Rightly interpreted in [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md) as "the wages of
unrighteousness."

[Numbers 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 22:8</span></span>

Balaam must surely have known that God's blessing was on the people with
whose marvelous march forth from Egypt he was acquainted [Exo
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#014.md); [Exo
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md); [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md), and from whom he had himself
probably learned much (compare the language of [Num
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#012.md) with [Gen
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006.md), and that of [Num
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md) with [Gen
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009).md). But his reply to the messengers
next morning [Num 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013.md), betrays the
desire to venture to the utmost of that which God would not forbid
rather than to carry out God's will in hearty sincerity.

[Numbers 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 22:15</span></span>

Balak, like the ancient pagan world generally, not only believed in the
efficacy of the curses and incantations of the soothsayers, but regarded
their services as strictly venal. Hence, when his first offer was
declined, he infers at once that he had not bid high enough.

[Numbers 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 22:19</span></span>

Ye also - i. e., as the other envoys before you. Had Balaam possessed a
sincere spirit of obedience, he would have found in the first
instructions [Num 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012.md) a final
decision upon the matter. His hypocritical importunity with God when the
fresh messengers came from Balak demonstrates his aversion to God's
declared will.

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 22:22</span></span>

The angel - i. e., the Angel that led the Israelites through the
wilderness (compare [Num 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md) and
references), and subsequently appeared as the Captain of the Lord's host
to Joshua [Jos 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#013.md). In desiring to
curse Israel, Balaam was fighting against Israel's Leader. The presence
of the Angel in his path was designed to open his eyes, blinded by sin,
to the real character of his course of conduct.

[Numbers 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 22:24</span></span>

In a path of the vineyards - i. e., in a path shut in by vineyard-walls
on each side. The progress from the road through the open field [Num
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#023.md) to that walled in, and thence to
the strait place, where there was no room to turn [Num
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#026.md), shows that Balaam was
approaching a city, no doubt that which was the goal of his journey.

[Numbers 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 22:28</span></span>

And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass - The account was perhaps given
by Balaam to the Israelites after his capture in the war against Midian.
Compare [Num 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md). That which is here
recorded was apparently perceived by him alone among human witnesses.
God may have brought it about that sounds uttered by the creature after
its kind became to the prophet's intelligence as though it addressed him
in rational speech. Indeed to an augur, priding himself on his skill in
interpreting the cries and movements of animals, no more startling
warning could be given than one so real as this, yet conveyed through
the medium of his own art.

[Numbers 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 22:32</span></span>

Is perverse - Rather, is headlong. Compare Peter's words [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md), "the madness of the prophet."

[Numbers 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 22:35</span></span>

Go with the men - A command, not a permission merely. Balaam, no longer
a faithful servant of God, was henceforth overruled in all his acts so
that he might subserve the divine purpose as an instrument.

[Num 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#026.md)

A city of Moab - Or, Ir-Moab, probably the same with Ar-Moab [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015.md). As Balaam in his journey would
avoid the districts occupied by the Israelites, he must have approached
this city from the east, by the course of the Nahaliel; and in the name
Balu'a, still borne by one of the upper branches of this stream, there
is perhaps a reminiscence of the name of the prophet.

[Numbers 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 22:39</span></span>

Kirjath-buzoth - i. e., "city of streets," within Balak's dominions,
south of the Arnon, and identified either with the ruins of Shihan, 4
miles west by south of the site assigned to Ar or Ir, or with Kirjathaim
(Kureivat).

[Numbers 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 22:41</span></span>

That thence he might see - Rather, and thence he saw.
