### [Exodus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 20:1</span></span>

The Hebrew name which is rendered in our King James Version as the ten
commandments occurs in [Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md);
[Deu 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md); [Deu
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004.md). It literally means "the Ten
Words." The Ten Commandments are also called the law, even the
commandment [Exo 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md), the words of
the covenant [Exo 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md), the tables of
the covenant [Deu 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009.md), the covenant
[Deu 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md), the two tables [Deu
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010.md), [Deu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017.md), and, most frequently, the
testimony (e. g. [Exo 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034.md); [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016).md), or the two tables of the
testimony (e. g. [Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).md). In the
New Testament they are called simply the commandments (e. g. [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017).md). The name decalogue is found
first in Clement of Alexandria, and was commonly used by the Fathers who
followed him.

Thus we know that the tables were two, and that the commandments were
ten, in number. But the Scriptures do not, by any direct statements,
enable us to determine with precision how the Ten Commandments are
severally to be made out, nor how they are to be allotted to the Two
tables. On each of these points various opinions have been held (see
[Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md).

Of the Words of Yahweh engraven on the tables of Stone, we have two
distinct statements, one in Exodus Exo. 20:1-17 and one in Deuteronomy
[Deu 5:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#007.md), apparently of equal
authority, but differing principally from each other in the fourth, the
fifth, and the tenth commandments.

It has been supposed that the original commandments were all in the same
terse and simple form of expression as appears (both in Exodus and
Deuteronomy) in the first, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth, such as
would be most suitable for recollection, and that the passages in each
copy in which the most important variations are found were comments
added when the books were written.

The account of the delivery of them in Exo. 19 and in [Exo
20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md) is in accordance with their
importance as the recognized basis of the covenant between Yahweh and
His ancient people ([Exo 34:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027.md);
[Deu 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md); [Kg1
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021), etc..md), and as the divine
testimony against the sinful tendencies in man for all ages. While it is
here said that "God spake all these words," and in [Deu
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004.md), that He "talked face to face," in
the New Testament the giving of the law is spoken of as having been
through the ministration of Angels [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md); [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md). We can reconcile these contrasts
of language by keeping in mind that God is a Spirit, and that He is
essentially present in the agents who are performing His will.

[Exo 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md)

Which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage - It has been asked: Why, on this occasion, was not the Lord
rather proclaimed as "the Creator of Heaven and Earth"? The answer is,
Because the Ten Commandments were at this time addressed by Yahweh not
merely to human creatures, but to the people whom He had redeemed, to
those who had been in bondage, but were now free men [Exo
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md); [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md). The commandments are expressed
in absolute terms. They are not sanctioned by outward penalties, as if
for slaves, but are addressed at once to the conscience, as for free
men. The well-being of the nation called for the infliction of
penalties, and therefore statutes were passed to punish offenders who
blasphemed the name of Yahweh, who profaned the Sabbath, or who
committed murder or adultery. (See [Lev
18:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024) note..md) But these penal
statutes were not to be the ground of obedience for the true Israelite
according to the covenant. He was to know Yahweh as his Redeemer, and
was to obey him as such (Compare [Rom
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005).md).

[Exo 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md)

Before me - Literally, "before my face." The meaning is that no god
should be worshipped in addition to Yahweh. Compare [Exo
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#023.md). The polytheism which was the
besetting sin of the Israelites did not in later times exclude Yahweh,
but associated Him with false deities. (Compare the original of [Sa1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025)..md)

[Exo 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004.md)

Graven image - Any sort of image is here intended.

As the first commandment forbids the worship of any false god, seen or
unseen, it is here forbidden to worship an image of any sort, whether
the figure of a false deity [Jos 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#007.md)
or one in any way symbolic of Yahweh (see [Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004).md). The spiritual acts of worship
were symbolized in the furniture and ritual of the tabernacle and the
altar, and for this end the forms of living things might be employed as
in the case of the Cherubim (see [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018) note.md): but the presence of the
invisible God was to be marked by no symbol of Himself, but by His words
written on stones, preserved in the ark in the holy of holies and
covered by the mercy-seat. The ancient Persians and the earliest
legislators of Rome also agreed in repudiating images of the Deity.

A jealous God - [Deu 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md); [Jos
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#019.md); [Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md); [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md); [Nah
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md). This reason applies to the First,
as well as to the second commandment. The truth expressed in it was
declared more fully to Moses when the name of Yahweh was proclaimed to
him after he had interceded for Israel on account of the golden calf
([Exo 34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006); see the note.md).

Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children - (Compare [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018).md). Sons and remote descendants
inherit the consequences of their fathers' sins, in disease, poverty,
captivity, with all the influences of bad example and evil
communications. (See [Lev 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md); [Lam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007) following.md) The "inherited curse"
seems to fall often most heavily on the least guilty persons; but such
suffering must always be free from the sting of conscience; it is not
like the visitation for sin on the individual by whom the sin has been
committed. The suffering, or loss of advantages, entailed on the
unoffending son, is a condition under which he has to carry on the
struggle of life, and, like all other inevitable conditions imposed upon
men, it cannot tend to his ultimate disadvantage, if he struggles well
and perseveres to the end. The principle regulating the administration
of justice by earthly tribunals [Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md), is carried out in spiritual
matters by the Supreme Judge.

[Exo 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md)

Unto thousands - unto the thousandth generation. Yahweh's visitations of
chastisement extend to the third and fourth generation, his visitations
of mercy to the thousandth; that is, forever. That this is the true
rendering seems to follow from [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md); Compare [Sa2
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015.md).

[Exo 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md)

Our translators make the Third commandment bear upon any profane and
idle utterance of the name of God. Others give it the sense, "Thou shalt
not swear falsely by the name of Jehovah thy God." The Hebrew word which
answers to "in vain" may be rendered either way. The two abuses of the
sacred name seem to be distinguished in [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md) (see [Mat
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033).md). Our King James Version is
probably right in giving the rendering which is more inclusive. The
caution that a breach of this commandment incurs guilt in the eyes of
Yahweh is especially appropriate, in consequence of the ease with which
the temptation to take God's name "in vain" besets people in their
common conversation with each other.

[Exo 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008.md)

Remember the sabbath day - There is no distinct evidence that the
Sabbath, as a formal ordinance, was recognized before the time of Moses
(compare [Neh 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#014.md); [Eze
20:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#010.md); [Deu
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015).md). The word "remember" may either
be used in the sense of "keep in mind" what is here enjoined for the
first time, or it may refer back to what is related in [Exo
16:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022.md).

[Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010.md)

The sabbath ... - a Sabbath to Yahweh thy God. The proper meaning of
"sabbath" is, "rest after labor." Compare [Exo
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#026.md).

Thy stranger that is within thy gates - Not a "stranger," as is an
unknown person, but a "lodger," or "sojourner." In this place it denotes
one who had come from another people to take up his permanent abode
among the Israelites, and who might have been well known to his
neighbors. That the word did not primarily refer to foreign domestic
servants (though all such were included under it) is to be inferred from
the term used for "gates," signifying not the doors of a private
dwelling, but the gates of a town or camp.

[Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md)

Honour thy father and thy mother - According to our usage, the fifth
commandment is placed as the first in the second table; and this is
necessarily involved in the common division of the commandments into our
duty toward God and our duty toward men. But the more ancient, and
probably the better, division allots five commandments to each table
(compare [Rom 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009).md), proceeding on the
distinction that the First table relates to the duties which arise from
our filial relations, the second to those which arise from our fraternal
relations. The connection between the first four commandments and the
fifth exists in the truth that all faith in God centers in the filial
feeling. Our parents stand between us and God in a way in which no other
beings can. On the maintenance of parental authority, see [Exo
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#015.md), [Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017.md); [Deu
21:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md).

That thy days may be long upon the land - Filial respect is the ground
of national permanence (compare [Jer
35:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md); [Mat
15:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md); [Mar
7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010).md). The divine words were
addressed emphatically to Israel, but they set forth a universal
principle of national life [Eph 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002.md).

[Exo 20:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013.md)

[Mat 5:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md) is the best comment on
these two verses.

[Exo 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#015.md)

The right of property is sanctioned in the eighth commandment by an
external rule: its deeper meaning is involved in the tenth commandment.

[Exo 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017.md)

As the sixth, seventh, and eighth commandments forbid us to injure our
neighbor in deed, the ninth forbids us to injure him in word, and the
tenth, in thought. No human eye can see the coveting heart; it is
witnessed only by him who possesses it and by Him to whom all things are
naked and open [Luk 12:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md). But it
is the root of all sins of word or deed against our neighbor [Jam
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md).

[Exodus 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 20:18</span></span>

Compare [Deu 5:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md). Aaron [Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024.md) on this occasion accompanied
Moses in drawing near to the thick darkness.

[Exo 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md) to [Exo
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#033.md) is a series of laws which we may
identify with what was written by Moses in the book called the book of
the covenant, and read by him in the audience of the people [Exo
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md).

The document cannot be regarded as a strictly systematic whole. Portions
of it were probably traditional rules handed down from the patriarchs,
and retained by the Israelites in Egypt.

[Exodus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 20:22</span></span>

Nothing could be more appropriate as the commencement of the book of the
covenant than these regulations for public worship. The rules for the
building of altars must have been old and accepted, and are not
inconsistent with the directions for the construction of the altar of
the court of the tabernacle, [Exo
27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md) (compare [Jos
22:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#026).md).
