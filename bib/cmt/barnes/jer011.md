### [Jeremiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 11:1</span></span>

The prophecy contained in Jer. 11-12 seems to belong to an early period
of Jeremiah's life. The covenant [Jer
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md) was that renewed by Josiah in his
18th year, after the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md); while [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md) apparently refers to the public
establishment of idolatry by Manasseh [Jer
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#003.md). The people took no hearty part
in Josiah's reformation, and the prophet therefore sets before them the
consequences that will inevitably fellow upon their disloyalty to their
covenant-God. The prophecy was probably called forth by the conspiracy
of the men of Judah and of his own relatives of Anathoth to murder
Jeremiah [Jer 11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md); [Jer
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md), for such deeds, which but too
well represented the nation's whole course, punishment must come, if
unrepented of.

[Jeremiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 11:2</span></span>

The words of this covenant - The phrase used [Kg2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003.md) to describe the contents of the
Book of the Law.

[Jeremiah 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 11:4</span></span>

From the iron furnace - Rather, out of "the iron furnace," Egypt (see
[Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020).md). The constant reference to
Deuteronomy shows how great had been the effect upon Jeremiah's mind of
the public recitation of the "Book of the covenant" found in the temple.

[Jeremiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 11:5</span></span>

As it is this day - God had kept the terms of the covenant. Whether the
promised land would permanently remain the property of the Jews would
depend upon their observance of their part of the covenant.

So be it, O Lord - Or, "Amen, Yahweh." The prophet was literally obeying
the command given in [Deu 27:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014.md),
and the same word should be kept in both places.

[Jeremiah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 11:6</span></span>

Proclaim ... - Probably Jeremiah accompanied Josiah in his progress [Kg2
23:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015.md), and everywhere read to the
people the words of the newly-found book.

[Jeremiah 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 11:8</span></span>

I will bring - Rather, I have brought. The breach of the covenant upon
their part had always brought temporal calamity. The last examples were
the deportation of the ten tribes by Salmanezer, and the leading of
Manasseh prisoner to Babylon in chains ([Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 11:9</span></span>

A conspiracy - The defection from the covenant was as general as if it
had been the result of preconcerted arrangement. The decided course
taken by Josiah may, however, have led the opposite party to secret
combinations against him.

[Jeremiah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 11:10</span></span>

Their forefathers - literally, "their fathers, the first ones:" in
allusion to the idolatries committed in the wilderness, and by the
generations whose history is given in the Book of Judges.

And they went after - Rather, yea! they have walked "after other gods to
serve them." The "they" refers to the men of Jeremiah's day.

[Jeremiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 11:11</span></span>

I will bring - Or, am bringing.

[Jeremiah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 11:13</span></span>

That shameful thing - i. e., Baal; public establishment of idolatry,
such as actually took place in the reign of Manasseh ([Ch2
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#003.md). Contrast [Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 11:14</span></span>

A parenthesis. As in [Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md), all
intercession is forbidden, and for this reason. Prayer for others for
the forgiveness of their sins avails only when they also pray. The cry
of the people now was that of the guilty smarting under punishment, not
of the penitent mourning over sin.

[Jer 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015.md)

This passage, like [Isa 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md), rebukes
the inconsistency of Judah's public worship of Yahweh with their private
immorality and preference for idolatry. Translate it: "What hath My
beloved in My house to practice guile there? The great men and the holy
flesh (i. e., the sacrifices) shall pass away from thee."

[Jer 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016.md)

The "goodly" or "shapely fruit," signifies the righteousness and faith
which ought to have been the result of Israel's possession of
extraordinary privileges. The tree did not bear this fruit, and God now
destroys it by a thunderstorm.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

Rather, "gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it." Jeremiah shows [Jer
11:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md), that the general conspiracy
of the people against Yahweh and the special plot against himself was
revealed to him by God.

[Jeremiah 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 11:19</span></span>

Like a lamb or an ox - Rather, "like a tame lamb." Jeremiah had lived at
Anathoth as one of the family, never suspecting that, like a tame lamb,
the time would come for him to be killed.

The tree with the fruit thereof - The words are those of a proverb or
dark saying. All the Churches agree in understanding that under the
person of Jeremiah these things are said by Christ.

[Jeremiah 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 11:22</span></span>

The young men - i. e., those of the legal age for military service.

[Jeremiah 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 11:23</span></span>

No remnant - 128 men of Anathoth returned from exile [Ezr
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#023.md); [Neh
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#027.md). Jeremiah's denunciation was
limited to those who had sought his life. The year of their visitation
would be the year of the siege of Jerusalem, when Anathoth being in its
immediate vicinity would have its share of the horrors of war.
