### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 97:0</span></span>

The author of this psalm is unknown, and the occasion on which it was
composed cannot be ascertained. Its structure is similar to that of the
two preceding psalms, and it may have been written by the same author,
and at the same time; but it is of so general a nature that it may be
employed at all times, and in all lands. From the contents, it would
seem not improbable that it may have been composed in view of some
victory over the enemies of the Hebrew people, and especially over
idolaters; but when this occurred, if the psalm had such an origin, it
is impossile now to determine. Venema supposes that it had reference to
the times of the Maccabees, but of that there is no proof. Many of the
expressions in the psalm are taken from the older portions of the
Scriptures; and it has been remarked (Hengstenberg) that none are taken
from the writings after the return from the Babylonian captivity. From
this it has been inferred that it must have been composed before the
exile. Still, this inference is not certain, for a writer after the
return from Babylon may have made his references solely to the more
ancient writings of his country.

The author of the Septuagint version regarded this as a psalm of David,
when the land was restored to peace. The title in that version is, Τῷ
Δαυὶδ, ὅτ ̓ ἡ γῆ αὐτοῦ καθίσταται Tō Dauid, hot' hē gē autou
kathistatai; "by David, when his land was restored," (or, was at peace).
The same title occurs in the Latin Vulgate. Luther entities it, "Of
Christ and his kingdom." The general subject of the psalm is the
sovereignty or the supremacy of God, and the manifestation of that
sovereignty or supremacy in vindicating his people, and in bringing to
pass events which gave them ground of confidence and rejoicing in him.

Perhaps the most that can be said now on the origin and design of the
psalm is, that these "six" psalms Ps. 95-100 seem to have been composed
with reference to the same occasion, and may been designed to be used
together. They are similar in their contents and structure; and they
refer to the same thing - the sovereignty or the supremacy of God. Dr.
Horsley regards these psalms as "one entire prophetic poem." "Each
psalm," says he, "has its proper subject, which is some particular
branch of the general argument, the establishment of the Messiah's
kingdom. [Psa 95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md) asserts Yahweh's
Godhead power over all nature, and exhorts people to serve him. In [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md), all nations are exhorted to
join in his service, because he cometh to judge all mankind, Jew and
Gentile. In [Psa 97:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md), Yahweh
reigns over all the world, the idols are deserted, and the Just One is
glorified. In [Psa 98:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md), Yahweh hath
done wonders, and performed deliverance for himself; he hath remembered
his mercy toward the house of Israel; he comes to judge the whole world
...In [Psa 99:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md), Yahweh, seated
between the cherubim in Zion (the visible church), reigns over all the
world, to be praised for the justice of his government. ...In [Psa
100:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001.md), all the world is called upon
to praise Yahweh the Creator, whose mercy and truth are everlasting."
There may be something fanciful in this position, but the views thus
expressed the general course of thought in this group of psalms.

In this psalm [Psa 97:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md) the
particular point, then, is, that Yahweh is supreme over all the world;
that the idols are proved to be nought; and that the righteous are
vindicated.

The psalm embraces the following points:

I. A description of the majesty and glory of God as a sovereign, [Psa
97:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md). Clouds and darkness are around
him; fire goes before him; the lightnings play, and the earth trembles;
the hills melt, and are dissolved; the heavens in their splendor declare
his righteousness.

II\. In view of this, all idol images and gods are confounded, and are
shown to be nothing; and the friends of the true God have occasion for
joy, [Psa 97:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md).

III\. The prosperity and happiness of the righteous under the reign of
God, [Psa 97:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010.md). God will deliver
them; light is sown for them in darkness; gladness is their portion, and
they are called on to rejoice and give thanks at the remembrance of his
holiness.

[Psalms 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 97:1</span></span>

The Lord reigneth - See the notes at [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md). This is the general fact to be
dwelt upon; this is the foundation of joy and praise. The universe is
not without a sovereign. It is not the abode of anarchy. It is not the
production of chance. It is not subject to mere physical laws. It is not
under the control of evil. It is under the government of a God: a wise,
holy, intelligent, just, benevolent Being, who rules it well, and who
presides over all its affairs. If there is anything for which we should
rejoice, it is that there is One Mind, everlasting and most glorious,
who presides over the universe, and conducts all things according to his
own wise and eternal plan.

Let the earth rejoice - The earth itself; all parts of it; all that
dwell upon it. As the earth everywhere derives whatever it has of
fertility, beauty, grandeur, or stability, from God - as order, beauty,
productiveness are diffused everywhere over it - as it has received so
many proofs of the divine beneficence toward it, it has occasion for
universal joy.

Let the multitude of isles be glad thereof - Margin, "Many, or great
isles." The Hebrew is many. So the Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, the
Chaldee, and the Syriac. The eye of the psalmist is evidently on the
many islands which are scattered over the sea. Not merely the continents
- the extended countries where nations dwell - have occasion for joy,
but the beautiful islands - the spots of earth which have risen from the
deep, and which are covered with fruits and flowers - these, too, have
occasion to rejoice: to rejoice that God has raised them from the
waters; that he keeps them from being overflowed or washed away; that he
clothes them with beauty; that he makes them the abode of happy life;
that he places them in the wastes of the ocean as he does the stars in
the wastes of the sky, to beautify the universe. The idea in the verse
is, that all the earth has cause to rejoice that Yahweh reigns.

[Psalms 97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 97:2</span></span>

Clouds and darkness are round about him - This is a description of the
majesty of God, derived probably from the manner in which he manifested
himself at Mount Sinai. [Exo 19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md).
God is often thus represented as encompassed with clouds. [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md); [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md); [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007.md). See the notes at [Psa
18:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md). The word rendered "clouds" is
the common word to denote a cloud; the word translated "darkness" means
properly "thick clouds, cloudy darkness, gloom." It would refer to a
cloud considered as dark, and as casting a gloom over the world. There
is no reference here to the fact that the dealings of God are dark,
mysterious, and incomprehensible, as if he were surrounded by clouds and
darkness. This is indeed often true; but that is not the truth taught
here. The meaning here is, that the character of God is suited to fill
the mind with solemn awe, or with emotions of sublimity.

Righteousness and judgment - He is a righteous God; he is a God who will
execute just judgment. Though he is encompassed with clouds, yet he is a
just God; and this is suited to impress the mind with profound
reverence. That he will do right we may be assured, even when he covers
himself with clouds; the fact that he will thus do right is suited to
calm the minds of those who love and obey him, and at the same time to
fill the minds of the wicked with alarm.

Are the habitation of his throne - Margin, "establishment." The Hebrew
word means "place;" the place where one stands, or where one abides; a
habitation, or a dwelling. It then means a foundation or basis, [Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014.md); [Psa
104:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005.md). This would seem to be the idea
here. His throne rests upon, or is sustained by, justice and
righteousness. Nothing else would uphold the government of the universe;
nothing else will sustain any government.

[Psalms 97:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 97:3</span></span>

A fire goeth before him - See [Psa
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md), note; [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md), note.

And burneth up his enemies round about - Is especially directed against
his foes. That is, he manifests himself as a just God, inflicting
vengeance on his enemies. He comes to reign, and in his reign all his
foes will be destroyed.

[Psalms 97:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 97:4</span></span>

His lightnings enlightened the world ... - See the notes at [Psa
77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018.md). Compare [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md); [Hab
3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 97:5</span></span>

The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord - They seemed to
flow down as if they were like melted wax: that is, they could not stand
before him. The most firm, solid, lofty things were as nothing in his
presence. Compare [Rev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md); [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md); [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004.md); [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005.md). The object here is to describe
the sublimity, the greatness, the majesty of God, as if nothing could
stand before him; as if everything fled away when he approached. There
is perhaps a general allusion to his glory and power as manifested at
Sinai.

At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth - The Creator and Ruler
of the entire world. The God who thus manifested himself is not a local
Deity, or the God of a particular nation or country, but the God of the
whole world, before whom all created things are as nothing.

[Psalms 97:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 97:6</span></span>

The heavens declare his righteousness - See the notes at [Psa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#006.md). Compare the notes at [Psa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md).

And all the people see his glory - As manifested in the heavens, and in
the power which he puts forth on the earth. That is, (they have the
opportunity of seeing it; it is made manifest in all his works. They see
what in fact is a manifestation of his glory, to wit, his great and
wondrous works. It is not affirmed that they "appreciate" all this, or
that they see this to be a manifestation of his glory - which would not
be true - but that they see what is in fact a revelation of his
greatness, his wisdom, and his power.

[Psalms 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 97:7</span></span>

Confounded be all they that serve graven images - Hebrew, "Let them be
ashamed." The idea is, that they would be disappointed. They would find
that these were not real gods; that their trust in them was vain; and
that they had evinced great folly in relying on that which could not aid
them in the day of necessity. See [Job
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#020.md), note; [Psa
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005.md), note; [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md), note. Compare [Isa
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005.md). What is here affirmed of the
worshippers of idols will be found to be true at last of all who put
their trust in anything but the true God.

That boast themselves of idols - That worship idols, and glory in them
as if they could save; or, that glory in their own idol-gods as if they
were more powerful than those of other people. It would not be unnatural
that nations which worshipped idols should glory in them, or that one
people should boast of their gods as more powerful - more worthy to be
trusted - than those which were worshipped in other lands.

Worship him, all ye gods - Hebrew, אלהים 'Elohiym. The Septuagint and
the Vulgate render this, "all his angels." The original word אלהים
'Elohiym is that which is commonly applied to the true God ([Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001), et saepe.md), though it may be
applied to angels, or to magistrates. See [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md), note; [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md), note. On the general meaning of
this passage, and the question respecting its reference to the Messiah,
see the notes at [Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md). The
reference here, according to the quotation in [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md), is to the angels. The original
word will admit of this interpretation, and the entire structure of the
psalm will justify its application to the Messiah.

[Psalms 97:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 97:8</span></span>

Zion heard, and was glad - The good news came to Zion that all the idols
of the pagan were confounded or were overcome: that is, that the Lord
reigned. There was joy in Zion that the evils and abominations of
idolatry were at an end, and that the worship of Yahweh had taken the
place of idol-worship. The idea is, that the displacement of idols, or
the fact that they had ceased to be worshipped, was a cause of joy to
the worshippers of the true God. Whatever tends to remove the worship of
idols from the world, and to extend and establish the worship of the
living God, is an occasion of gladness.

And the daughters of Judah rejoiced ... - See the notes at [Psa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md). Woman has special occasion to
rejoice in the spread of the true religion. It is that only which has
lifted her from a state of deep degradation; which has elevated her to
be a companion instead of a slave; which has made her the intelligent
wife and mother, rather than the mere inmate of a harem.

[Psalms 97:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 97:9</span></span>

For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth - See the notes at [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md).

Thou art exalted far above all gods - See the notes at [Psa
95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 97:10</span></span>

Ye that love the Lord, hate evil - Show your love for the Lord "by"
hating all that is evil; that is, all that he hates, or that is evil in
his sight. There can be no true love for God where evil is not hated in
all its forms, since it is the object of the divine abhorrence. We
cannot be like God unless we love what he loves, and hate what he hates.
There is nothing more clearly affirmed in the Scriptures than that in
order to the love of God there must be the hatred of all that is wrong,
and that where there is the love of sin in the heart, there can be no
true religion. Compare the notes at [Isa
1:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md).

He preserveth the souls of his saints - The lives of his saints, or his
holy ones. That is, he guards them from danger, and watches over them
with a careful eye. See [Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md); [Psa
37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md).

He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked - That is, he often
does this; they may expect that he will do it. He does not, indeed,
always deliver them from the temporal calamities which wicked people
bring upon them - for they are not unfrequently persecuted and wronged;
but ultimately he will deliver them altogether from the power of the
wicked. In heaven none of the machinations of wicked people can reach
them. At the same time it is also true that God often interposes in
behalf of his people, and delivers them as such from the designs of the
wicked: that is, he delivers them because they are righteous, or because
they are his friends. Compare the notes at [Dan
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016.md), notes at [Dan
3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#024.md); notes at [Dan
6:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#018.md).

[Psalms 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 97:11</span></span>

Light is sown for the righteous - That is, There is light for the
righteous; or, they shall be brought into light, though they may be for
a time in darkness. The word rendered "sown" - זרע zâra‛ - is from a
verb which properly denotes to scatter, to disperse - as seed is
scattered or dispersed when sown in a field. It is hence used with
reference to moral subjects, as to sow righteousness, [Pro
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md); to sow iniquity, [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md); to sow mischief, [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); that is, these things are
scattered or sown, as seed is in a field, and produce a corresponding
harvest. Thus light is scattered abroad, and will produce an appropriate
harvest - a harvest of joy. It will spring up around the righteous, and
he shall reap that which light tends to produce - happiness,
intelligence, and peace. The figure of sowing light is an unusual one,
but the meaning is plain. It is, that the righteous will not always be
in darkness; that there is in preparation for him a harvest of joy; that
it will as certainly be produced as a harvest will from grain that is
sown; that though there may be present calamities, there will be
ultimate peace and triumph.

And gladness for the upright in heart - The word gladness here - joy, or
rejoicing - is parallel to the word light. Joy or gladness is sown for
the righteous; that is, arrangements are made for producing joy, as
preparations are made by sowing seed for a harvest. The world is full of
arrangements for conferring happiness on the righteous.

[Psalms 97:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 97:12</span></span>

Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous - See the notes at [Psa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md).

And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness - Margin, "to the
memorial" (compare [Psa 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004).md). The
idea is, "to the memory of his holiness;" that is, when his holiness
comes before the mind; when it is remembered; when it is thought of.
Give thanks or rejoice,

\(a\) that God is holy; that he is of purer eyes than to behold
iniquity; that there is One eternally pure who presides over the
universe; that there is One who will always do what is right;

\(b\) that such a Being is our God - our covenant-keeping God; that we
may look to him, trust in him, enjoy him.

Wicked people do not rejoice that there is a God at all, and especially
that God is a "holy God;" but it is one of the characteristics of true
piety to rejoice in the thought that there is a God, and that he is
perfectly holy, and hence, to feel conscious happiness whenever his name
is mentioned, and whenever his attributes are referred to. The highest
source of joy for man is that there is a God, and that God is exactly
what he is, pure and holy. It would be a source of deepest sorrow if
there were no God, or if God were in any respect, even the slightest, a
different being from what he is.
