### [Psalms Chapter 118](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 118:0</span></span>

Of the authorship of this psalm, and the occasion on which it was
composed, nothing can now be ascertained with certainty. The common
opinion has been that it is a psalm of David, and that it was composed
when his troubles with Saul ceased, and when he was recognized as king.
Some, however, have referred it to Hezekiah on the occasion of his
restoration from sickness; others to the time of the return from the
Babylonian exile; and others to the time of the Maccabees. It would be
useless to examine these opinions, as they are all of them mere
conjecture, and as no certainty can now be arrived at.

What is apparent on the face of the psalm is, that it was a psalm of
thanksgiving, to be employed in the temple when an offering or sacrifice
was led up to the altar [Psa 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md) to
be presented as an acknowledgment of mercy from God, on some occasion of
deliverance from danger, by someone whose claim to rule had been
rejected, but who was now victorious over his enemies, and recognized as
the rightful leader and ruler of the people. The psalm is in a measure
dramatic. The author is the speaker in the first twenty-one verses; in
the remainder of the psalm the priests and the people speak, and at the
close, the psalmist again utters praise.

The psalm consists of the following parts:

I. The author of the psalm speaks, Ps. 118:1-21.

\(1\) he calls on all to praise the Lord, and to unite with him in the
expression of thanks, because what had occurred was a matter of interest
to all the people; to Israel, to the house of Aaron, to the priesthood
to all that feared God, [Psa 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md).

\(2\) a description of his peril and deliverance, [Psa
118:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md). He had been in distress; he
had called on the Lord; he had seen the benefit of trusting in the Lord
rather than in man. All nations had compassed him about as bees; they
had thrust sore at him; they had sought his life; but he had not been
dismayed; he had felt, even in the midst of his dangers, that he would
live to declare the works of the Lord, [Psa
118:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md)

\(3\) The speaker approaches the temple. He asks that the doors may be
opened that he may enter and praise the Lord. He addresses those who
have charge of the temple - the ministers of religion - and desires
leave to come and present his offering, [Psa
118:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md).

II\. The priests and people speak, [Psa
118:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md).

\(1\) they recognize him now as the Ruler - the cornerstone - the
foundation of the nation's prosperity, and its hope. He had been
rejected by those who were professedly laying the foundation of empire,
but he had now established his claims to being regarded as the very
cornerstone on which the whole edifice must rest, [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md).

\(2\) they recognize this as a marvelous work of God, and as suited to
excite the deepest admiration, [Psa
118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md).

\(3\) they recognize this as a joyful day, as if God had created a day
for the very purpose of celebrating an event so joyous, [Psa
118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md).

\(4\) they pronounce him blessed who thus came in the name of the Lord;
they bless him out of the house of the Lord, [Psa
118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md).

\(5\) they direct him to bring his offering, and to bind it to the horns
of the altar preparatory to sacrifice. He is permitted freely to come.
His offering is recognized as proper, so that he can approach with an
assurance of acceptance, [Psa 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md).

III\. The author of the psalm again speaks, [Psa
118:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md). He acknowledges God as his
God, and calls on all to praise him.

Portions of the psalm are, in the New Testament, applied to Christ; and
it has been made a question whether it had, or had not, an original
reference to him. Thus in [Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md);
[Mar 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#011.md); [Luk
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#017.md), it is quoted by the Saviour as
illustrating a truth in regard to himself In [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md), the twenty-second verse of the
psalm is applied by Peter to the Saviour, as having been fulfilled in
him - or, as meaning that the language of the psalm would properly
describe the fact which had occurred in the treatment of Jesus of
Nazareth. Many of the Jewish rabbins regarded the psalm as referring to
the Messiah, and not a few Christian interpreters have supposed that it
had such an original reference.

It seems clear, however, from the psalm itself that it could not have
been composed primarily with reference to him. There are portions of it
which cannot, without a very forced use of language, be applied to him,
as for example, the allusion to the attack made by "all nations" on the
person referred to in the psalm [Psa
118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md), and in the allusion to the
danger of death [Psa 118:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md). The
person referred to in the psalm was in danger of death, but he was not
given over to death. He had the assurance in the very midst of the
danger that he would not die, but would continue to live [Psa
118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md). The Redeemer, however, did
die. His enemies accomplished their purpose in this respect. They put
him to death, though he rose again from the dead.

It is clear, therefore, I think, that the psalm had not an original
reference to the Messiah. Still, there is much in it which is applicable
to him, and which might be used as expressive of what occurred to him.
It contains principles also which may be as applicable to him as they
were to the psalmist; and, therefore, it is used by the Saviour to
enforce the moral of his own parable in reference to himself, as having
had a counterpart in their own history, in a case which must have been
familiar to them all. As such, it is right to use it now, as
illustrating what occurred in the treatment of the Redeemer.

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the Lord ... - Let others unite with me in giving
thanks to the Lord; let them see, from what has occurred in my case,
what occasion there is for praise. Every instance of a particular favor
shown to anyone is to others an occasion for praise, inasmuch as it is
an illustration of the general character of God. On this verse compare
the notes at [Psa 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md). The language
is nearly the same.

[Psalms 118:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 118:2</span></span>

Let Israel now say ... - The Hebrew people; the people of God. They have
now, in my case, a new illustration of the mercy of God which ought to
animate them, and to encourage their hearts. Compare [Psa
115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 118:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 118:3</span></span>

Let the house of Aaron now say ... - Compare [Psa
115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010.md). The ministers of religion.
They are appointed to serve God; to lead in his worship; to defend his
truth; to keep up faith in the truth of religion. They are, therefore,
interested in my case, and may derive from it a new proof of the
merciful character of God which they may employ, not only for their own
encouragement in personal piety, but in the duties of their office. My
case furnishes a new argument, of which they can make use in defending
the truth, and in illustrating the power of religion.

[Psalms 118:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 118:4</span></span>

Let them now that fear the Lord say ... - Compare [Psa
115:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#011.md). All that worship God are
interested in what God has done for me. It is a manifestation of the
divine character which should cheer them. They are called, therefore, to
unite with the author of the psalm in praise and thanksgiving, not
merely from sympathy with him, but because great truths of religion had
been illustrated, in his case, which were of as much importance to them
as to him.

[Psalms 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 118:5</span></span>

I called upon the Lord in distress - Margin, as in Hebrew, "out of
distress." In the very midst of trouble he called upon the Lord; his
voice was heard, as it were, coming from the depth of his sorrows. See
the notes at [Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md).

The Lord answered me - That is, he heard my prayers, and delivered me.
See the notes at [Psa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md).

And set me in a large place - I was before pressed on every side;
sorrows compassed me around; I could not move; I had no liberty. Now he
gave me space and freedom on every side, so that I could move without
obstruction or pain. This is literally, "The Lord" - (not יהוה Yahweh
here, but יה Yâhh) "answered me in a large place." See [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md), note; [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md), note.

[Psalms 118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 118:6</span></span>

The Lord is on my side - Margin, as in Hebrew," for me." The Lord is
with me. He is my helper. He defends my cause.

I will not fear - I have nothing to be afraid of. God is more mighty
than any or all of my foes, and he can deliver me from them all. Compare
[Psa 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004.md), [Psa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009.md),[Psa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011.md).

What can man do unto me? - Any person; all people. They can do no more
than God permits. They cannot destroy me when he means to save me; they
cannot defeat his gracious designs toward me. I am safe if God is my
Friend. Compare the notes at [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md).

[Psalms 118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 118:7</span></span>

The Lord taketh my part with them that help me - The psalmist had
friends. There were those who stood by him. He relied, indeed, on their
aid, but not on their aid without God. He felt that even their help was
valuable to him only as God was with them. There was direct dependence
on God in reference to himself; and there was the same sense of
dependence in respect to all who were engaged in his defense. This might
be rendered, however, simply "for my help," and is so rendered by
DeWette. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render it, "The Lord is my
helper."

Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me - literally, "I
shall see upon those that hate me;" that is, I shall look upon them
according to my wish; I shall see them overthrown and subdued. See the
notes at [Psa 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007.md). Compare [Psa
92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md); [Psa
112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 118:8</span></span>

It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man - This
is stated apparently as the result of his own experience. He had found
people weak and faithless; he had not so found God. Compare [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md); [Psa
62:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008.md). Literally, "Good is it to
trust in Yahweh more than to confide in man." This is the Hebrew form of
comparison, and is equivalent to what is stated in our version, "It is
better," etc. It is better,

\(1\) because man is weak - but God is Almighty;

\(2\) because man is selfish - but God is benevolent;

\(3\) because man is often faithless and deceitful - God never;

\(4\) because there are emergencies, as death, in which man cannot aid
us, however faithful, kind, and friendly he may be - but there are no
circumstances in this life, and none in death, where God cannot assist
us; and

\(5\) because the ability of man to help us pertains at best only to
this present life - the power of God will be commensurate with eternity.

[Psalms 118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 118:9</span></span>

It is better ... than to put confidence in princes - Even in the most
mighty of the human race; in those who of all people may be supposed to
have the most ability to aid us; in those whose favor is often sought
more than the favor of God. Princes are only men; often as faithless and
deceitful as other men; often less reliable in their character than
those in more humble life. and in the great matters where we most need
aid - in sickness, in danger, in death, in the eternal world - as
absolutely powerless as men in the lowest condition of poverty, or in
the most humble rank.

[Psalms 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 118:10</span></span>

All nations compassed me about - They surrounded me; they hemmed me in
on every side, so that I seemed to have no chance to escape. It would
seem from this that the psalm was composed by someone who was at the
head of the government, and whose government had been attacked by
surrounding nations. This would accord well with many things that
occurred in the life of David; but there were also other times in the
Jewish history to which it would be applicable, and there is nothing
that necessarily confines it to the time of David.

But in the name of the Lord will I destroy them - Margin, as in Hebrew,"
cut them off." This is the language which he used at that time; the
purpose which he then formed; an expression of the confidence which he
then cherished. He meant to subdue them; he had no doubt that he would
be able to do it.

[Psalms 118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 118:11</span></span>

They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about ... - The
sentiment and the language of the previous verse are here repeated, as
if to give force to what he had said, or to deepen the impression. His
own mind dwelt upon it, and the events to which he referred came so
vividly to his recollection, and were so important, that he dwells upon
them. The subject was worth more than a passing remark. The mind was
full, and the language comes from an overflowing heart.

[Psalms 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 118:12</span></span>

They compassed me about like bees -

\(a\) As thick or numerous as bees;

\(b\) armed as bees - or, their weapons might be compared to the stings
of bees.

They are quenched as the fire of thorns - The Septuagint and the Vulgate
render this, "They burn as the fire of thorns." The connection would
seem to demand this, but the Hebrew will not bear it. The figure is
changed in the Hebrew, as is not uncommon. The mind of the psalmist at
first recalls the number and the malignity of his foes; it then
instantly adverts to the rapid manner in which they were destroyed. The
illustration from the "fire of thorns" is derived from the fact that
they quickly kindle into a blaze, and then the flame soon dies away. In
Eastern countries it was common to burn over their fields in the dry
time of the year, and thus to clear them of thorns and briars and weeds.
Of course, at such a time they would kindle quickly, and burn rapidly,
and would soon be consumed. So the psalmist says it was with his
enemies. He came upon them, numerous as they were, as the fire runs over
a field in a dry time, burning everything before it. Compare the notes
at [Isa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md).

For in the name of the Lord I will destroy them - That is, such was his
purpose then; such was the reason why they so soon and suddenly
disappeared.

[Psalms 118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 118:13</span></span>

Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall - literally, "Thrusting
thou hast thrust at me." This is the Hebrew mode of expressing
intensity, repetition, or emphasis. The meaning is, that they had made a
deadly thrust at him; that they had repeated the blows; that they had
come with a fierce determination to crush and destroy him. The psalmist,
as it were, sees the enemy again before him, and addresses him as if he
were present. Everything is vivid to the mind; the whole scene appears
again to pass before him.

[Psalms 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 118:14</span></span>

The Lord is my strength and song - He is the source of strength to me;
and he is the subject of my praise. There is no ground of praise in
myself for anything that I have done, but all is due to him.

And is become my salvation - He has saved me. I live because he
preserved me. So we shall be saved in heaven solely because he saves us,
and there, more than can be possible here, we shall say, "God is our
strength and our song, and is become our salvation."

[Psalms 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 118:15</span></span>

The voice of rejoicing and salvation - Rejoicing for salvation; song,
praise, thanksgiving. Luther renders this beautifully; "They sing with
joy for victory in the houses of the righteous."

Is in the tabernacles of the righteous - The tents of the righteous;
their dwellings. That is,

\(a\) it is a fact that the voice of joy and rejoicing is there;

\(b\) it is appropriate that it should be so, or that a righteous family
should be happy - the dwelling-place of praise;

\(c\) God will add to the happiness of the righteous, or will make their
habitation happy, peaceful, blessed.

There is nothing that diffuses so much happiness through a family as
religion; there is no joy like that when a member of a family is
converted; there is no place on earth more happy than that where a
family bows before God with the feeling that all are children of God and
heirs of salvation.

The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly - Hebrew "Doeth strength."
That is, God does great things, laying the foundation for joy and
praise.

[Psalms 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 118:17</span></span>

I shall not die, but live - Evidently the psalmist had apprehended that
he would die; or, he had felt that he was in imminent danger of dying.
In this language he seems, as in [Psa
118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013.md), to go back again to the scenes
referred to in the psalm. He lives them over again. He describes the
feelings which he had then. He saw that he was in danger. His enemies
were thick round about him, and sought his life. But he had then the
assurance that they would not be victorious; that they would not
accomplish their object; that he would be protected; that he would live
to declare what God had done for him. He does not say how he had this
assurance, but there is no impropriety in supposing that he had it, as
Hezekiah had in similar circumstances (see [Isa
38:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md), [Isa
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021).md), by a direct divine intimation.
Things like this are not uncommon now, when, in danger or in sickness,
the mind is strongly impressed with the belief that there will be a
restoration to health and safety, and when the mind is made calm and
peaceful by that belief - the very calmness of the mind under such a
belief contributing not a little to that result. Why should we hesitate
to believe that such a faith and hope may come from the Lord? Compare
[Act 27:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#022.md).

And declare the works of the Lord - Declare what he has done.

[Psalms 118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 118:18</span></span>

The Lord hath chastened me sore - Hebrew, "The Lord has chastened - has
chastened me." See the notes at [Psa
118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013.md). The psalmist had been greatly
afflicted, and he now looked upon his affliction in the light of a
fatherly chastisement or correction. It had been a severe trial, and he
was not insensible to its severity, though he regarded it as designed
for his own good.

But he hath not given we over unto death - He interposed when I was in
danger; he rescued me when I was on the verge of the grave. This is the
close of the psalmist's statement in regard to the divine dealings with
him. He had passed through great danger; he had been sorely afflicted;
but he had been rescued and spared, and he came now to express his
thanks to God for his recovery. In the following verse he addresses
those who had the care of the sanctuary, and asks that he might be
permitted to enter and offer his thanks to God.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

Open to me the gates of righteousness ... - The gates of the house
devoted to a righteous God; the gates of a house where the principles of
righteousness are strengthened, and where the just emotions of the heart
may be expressed in the language of praise. Compare the notes at [Isa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002.md). The language here may be
regarded as addressed to those who had charge of the house of the Lord -
the priests - requesting that they would open the doors and permit him
to enter to praise God for his mercy. Compare [Isa
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 118:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 118:20</span></span>

This gate of the Lord - This gate dedicated to the service of the Lord;
that belongs to the house of the Lord.

Into which the righteous shall enter - Through which the righteous pass.
That is, It is for such persons, and all who come with a purpose to
serve and worship God should be permitted to pass through them; I claim
the privilege, therefore, of so passing through these gates into the
house of God, for I come to praise him. All who are truly righteous, all
who desire to worship God, all who wish and purpose to be holy, have a
right thus to enter the house of God - to be recognized as his friends -
to be permitted to join in all the devotions of his people; all such
will have a right to enter the temple above. None have a right to
exclude them here; none in heaven will be disposed to exclude them
there.

[Psalms 118:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 118:21</span></span>

I will praise thee - Within thy courts.

For thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation - See [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md).

[Psalms 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 118:22</span></span>

The stone which the builders refused - See the notes at [Mat
21:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md). Compare [Mar
12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md); [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md). This is an allusion to a
building, as if a stone should be cast away by workmen as unfit to be
worked into the edifice. The figure would then be applicable to anyone
who, for any purpose, was rejected. Thus it might have been applied many
a time to David; so, doubtless, to others who urged claims to authority
and power; and so, eminently, to the Lord Jesus Christ. We are not to
suppose that this had original reference to the Messiah, but the
language was applicable to him; and it is used in the passages above
referred to, in addresses to the Jews, merely to show them how the
principle was found in their own writings, that one who was rejected,
like a stone regarded as unfit to be worked into any part of a building,
might be in reality so important that it would be laid yet at the very
corner, and become the most valuable stone in the edifice - that on
which the whole superstructure would rest.

Is become the head stone of the corner - The principal stone placed at
the corner of the edifice. This is usually one of the largest, the most
solid, and the most carefully constructed of any in the edifice. Of
course one would be needed at each corner of the building to constitute
a firm support, but usually there is one placed at one corner of an
edifice larger and more carefully made than the others, often laid with
imposing ceremonies, and prepared to contain whatever it may be thought
necessary to deposit in the foundation of the building to be transmitted
to future times as preserving the names of the builders, or expressing
the design of the edifice. Such a position he who had been rejected was
to occupy in the civil polity of his country; such a position eminently
the Lord Jesus occupies in relation to the church. [Eph

[Psalms 118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 118:23</span></span>

This is the Lord's doing - Margin, as in Hebrew, "This is from the
Lord." That is, It is to be traced to the Lord alone. It is not the
result of human wisdom or power. The deliverance from danger - the
raising up from the low condition - the change by which he who was
rejected was restored to his rightful place - all this was to be traced
to God alone. So it was in the case of the psalmist; so it was in the
case of the Redeemer. None but God could have made him who was rejected,
despised, crucified, and laid in the grave, the Saviour of a world. The
place which the once rejected Redeemer now bears in the church - the
honors bestowed on him as the head of the church - the triumph of his
gospel in the world - all prove that it is the work of God.

It is marvelous in our eyes - It is suited to excite wonder. It is not
one of those things which are to be ranked with the common and
well-known events that are easily explained, and that excite no wonder;
it is one of those things which cannot be explained by any known law;
which belong to the "supernatural;" which bear the marks of a direct
divine interposition; which are suited to excite the admiration of
mankind. Thus it was in the case of the psalmist; thus, pre-eminently,
it was in the case of the Redeemer. No operation of natural laws will
constitute a sufficient explanation of the latter. It is a matter for
wonder, for rejoicing, and for praise, that one, despised, rejected,
crucified, has been raised from the grave; that his religion has spread
so far over the world; that it influences mankind as it does; and that
he himself is exalted to a rank "far above all principality, and power,
and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come." [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md).

[Psalms 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 118:24</span></span>

This is the day which the Lord hath made - As if it were a new day, made
for this very occasion; a day which the writer of the psalm did not
expect to see, and which seemed therefore to have been created out of
the ordinary course, and added to the other days. He was in danger of
death; his days were likely to be cut off and ended, so that he should
see no more. But God had spared him, and added this joyous day to his
life; and it was meet that for this he should be praised. It was so full
of joy, so unexpected, so bright, so cheerful, that it appeared to be a
new day coming fresh from the hand of the Almighty, unlike the other
days of the year. So the Sabbath - the day that commemorates the
resurrection of the Redeemer - is God's day. He claims it. He seems to
have made it anew for man. Amidst the other days of the week - in a
world where the ordinary days are filled up with so much of earth, so
much toil, trouble, care, vexation, vanity, wickedness - it seems like
one of the days that God made when he first made the world; before sin
and sorrow entered; when all was calm, serene, happy. The Sabbath is so
calm, so bright, so cheerful, so benign in its influence; it is so full
of pleasant and holy associations and reminiscences, that it seems to be
a day fresh from the hand of God, unlike the other days of the week, and
made especially, as if by a new act of creation, for the good of
mankind. So when a man is raised up from sickness - from the borders of
the grave - it seems to be a new life given to him. Each day, week,
month, year that he may live, is so much added to his life, as if it
were created anew for this very purpose. He should, therefore, regard it
not as his own, but as so much given to him by the special mercy and
providence of God - as if added on to his life. Compare [Isa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md).

We will rejoice and be glad in it - The psalmist, and all who united
with him in his thanksgivings. So the Christian Sabbath. It is a day of
joy - all joy, and no sorrow. It is a day to be happy in; a day of rest;
a day, when the cares and toils of life are suspended; a day, when we
are no longer harassed with those things which vex us in the worldliness
of the week; a day, when we think of God, of redemption, of hope, of
heaven. The Sabbath should be a day of joy, and not of gloom; it would
be the happiest of all days to weary and jaded people everywhere, if
they observed it aright. In a world of toil and sorrow, it is among the
richest of God's blessings to people; it strengthens, refreshes, and
cheers the heart of burdened and sorrowful man here; it lifts the soul
to joyous contemplation of that eternal Sabbath where wearisome toll and
sorrow shall be no more.

[Psalms 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 118:25</span></span>

Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord ... - The word save here seems to be
used in the general sense of imploring the divine interposition and
mercy. It is a part of the word which in the New Testament is rendered
"Hosanna" - save now [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md) - and
is the language which the multitudes employed when they followed the
Saviour as he went from the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem. The language
which they used on that occasion was borrowed from this psalm, and was
eminently appropriate to the occasion - "Hosanna - blessed be he that
cometh in the name of the Lord;" but the fact that it was thus employed
does not prove that the psalm had original reference to the Messiah. The
language was not improbably used on high festivals, and would be
naturally employed when the Messiah came.

Send now prosperity - Give success; be favorable. God had interposed,
and now the prayer is, that there might be continued and uninterrupted
prosperity; that as the tide had begun to turn in the psalmist's favor,
it might recede no more; that the calamities and woes which he had
experienced might not be repeated. This was omitted in the acclamations
of the multitude that attended the Saviour [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); but it is eminently an
appropriate prayer to be used in connection with his coming - since his
coming, whether to the world, to an individual, to a church, or to a
community, brings the highest kind of "prosperity" in its train.

[Psalms 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 118:26</span></span>

Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord - See the notes at
[Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md). This is the language of
those who had charge of the sanctuary, addressing him who came in the
name of the Lord to present his thank-offering. It is the language of
welcome; the assurance that his offering would be acceptable to God. It
was applicable to the Messiah, as coming in the name of the Lord, and
was so used by the multitudes [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md), and by the Saviour himself [Mat
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039.md); but this use of the language
does not prove that it had original reference to him. The Old Testament
abounds in language which may thus be employed to express ideas under
the Christian dispensation; but this does not prove that all such
language was originally designed to refer to that dispensation.

We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord - We, the priests, the
ministers of religion, have pronounced and do pronounce you blessed. We
welcome your approach. You may come freely with your thank-offering. It
will be accepted of the Lord. You come under our benediction, and the
benediction of God.

[Psalms 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 118:27</span></span>

God is the Lord - Still the language of the priests in their official
capacity. The meaning here seems to be "God is Yahweh;" or, Jehovah is
the true God. It is an utterance of the priesthood in regard to the
great truth which they were appointed specifically to maintain - that
Yahweh is the true God, and that he only is to be worshipped. This truth
it was appropriate to enunciate on all occasions; and it was especially
appropriate to be enunciated when a prince, who had been rescued from
danger and death, came, as the restored leader of the people of God, to
acknowledge his gracious intervention. On such an occasion - in view of
the rank and character of him who came - and in view of what God had
done for him - it was proper for the ministers of religion to announce
in the most solemn manner, that Yahweh was the only true and living God.

Which hath showed us light - Who has given us light in the days of our
darkness and adversity; who has restored us to prosperity, and bestowed
on us the blessings of safety and of peace.

Bind the sacrifice with cords - Come freely with the sacrificial victim;
with the offering which is to be presented to God in sacrifice. The word
- חג châg - commonly means a festival or feast, [Exo
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#009.md); [Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md); and then it means a
festival-sacrifice, a victim, [Exo
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md); [Mal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#003.md). The Septuagint and Vulgate render
it, "Prepare a solemn feast." Our translation probably expresses the
true sense. The word rendered cords, means properly anything interwoven
or interlaced. Then it means a cord, a braid, a wreath; and then a
branch with thick foliage. Different interpretations have been given of
the passage here, but probably the word is correctly rendered cords.

Unto the horns of the altar - altars were often made with projections or
"horns" on the four corners. [Exo
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002.md); [Exo
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#002.md); [Exo
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#025.md); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028.md). Whether the animal was actually
bound to the altar when it was slain, is not certain; but there would
seem to be an allusion to such a custom here. Lead up the victim; make
it ready; bind it even to the altar, preparatory to the sacrifice. The
language is that of welcome addressed to him who led up the victim -
meaning that his sacrifice would be acceptable.

[Psalms 118:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 118:28</span></span>

Thou art my God, and I will praise thee - This is the language of the
author of the psalm - his solemn profession before the sanctuary and the
altar; his response to the priesthood. In [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md), they had declared that
"Jehovah alone was God;" to this he now replies, that he acknowledges,
it; he recognizes him as the true God, and as his God; he comes to
praise him; and he professes his purpose always to exalt him as his God.

Thou art my God, I will exalt thee - Repeating the solemn declaration
that Yahweh alone was the God whom he worshipped, and that it was his
purpose always to magnify his name.

[Psalms 118:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 118:29</span></span>

O give thanks unto the Lord ... - The psalm closes, as it began, with an
exhortation to praise God. In the beginning of the psalm, it was a
general exhortation; here it is an exhortation founded on the course of
thought in the psalm, or as a proper conclusion from what had been
referred to in the psalm. Evidence had been given that the Lord was
good; on the ground of that, all people are exhorted to give him thanks.
