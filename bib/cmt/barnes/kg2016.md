### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 16:3</span></span>

Ahaz was the worst of all the kings of Judah. He imitated the worst of
the Israelite kings - Ahab and Ahaziah - by a re-introduction of the
Baal worship, which had been rooted out of Israel by Jehu and out of
Judah by Jehoiada.

And made Iris son to pass through the fire - i. e. Ahaz adopted the
Moloch worship of the Ammonites and Moabites [Kg2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027); [Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007), and sacrificed at least one son,
probably his firstborn, according to the horrid rites of those nations,
and the Canaanite tribes [Deu 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031);
[Psa 106:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037). Hereto, apparently,
the Jews had been guiltless of this abomination. They had been warned
against it by Moses (marginal reference; [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)); and if (as some think) they
had practiced it in the wilderness [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026); [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026), the sin must have been rare and
exceptional; from the date of their entrance into the promised land they
had wholly put it away. Now, however, it became so frequent (compare
[Kg2 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017); [Kg2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006)) as to meet with the strongest
protest from Jeremiah and Ezekiel ([Jer
7:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031); [Jer
19:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035); [Eze
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020); [Eze
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026); [Eze
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#037), etc.).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 16:4</span></span>

He sacrificed ... - Other kings of Judah bad allowed their people to do
so. Ahaz was the first, so far as we know, to countenance the practice
by his own example.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 16:5</span></span>

Rezin and Pekah, who had already begun their attacks upon Judaea in the
reign of Jotham [Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037), regarded
the accession of a boy-king, only 16 years of age, as especially
favorable to their projects, and proceeded without loss of time to carry
them out. The earlier scenes of the war, omitted by the writer of Kings,
are given at some length in [Ch2
28:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 16:6</span></span>

Either during the siege, or on breaking up from before Jeruasalem, Rezin
made an expedition to the lied Sea coast, and became master of the city
which had belonged to Judaea about 70 years (marginal reference). Most
moderns render this verse, "Rezin recovered (or restored) Elath to Edom
... and the Edomites came to Elath." On the resemblance of the words
Aram and Edom in the original, see [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 16:7</span></span>

Ahaz was threatened on all sides, on the north by Rezin and Pekah; on
the southeast by Edom [Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017); and
on the southwest by the Philistines [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018). To these external dangers was
added the still greater peril of disaffection at home. A large party in
Judah was "weary" of the house of David [Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013), ready to join the confederacy
[Isa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006), [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012), and to accept for king "the son
of Tabeal." Ahaz saw no hope of safety unless he could obtain a powerful
protector; and, Egypt being particularly weak at this time, he turned to
Assyria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 16:8</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference and [Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018). Political necessity was always
held to justify the devotion of the temple treasure to secular purposes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 16:9</span></span>

The submission of Judah, which Ahaz proffered, would be of the utmost
importance in connection with any projects that might be entertained of
Egyptian conquests. Naturally, Damascus was the first object of attack.
It was the head of the confederacy, and it lay nearest to an army
descending upon Lower Syria, as all Asiatic armies would descend, from
the north. It appears from an inscription of Tiglath-pileser's, that
Rezin met him in the field, was defeated, and slain. An attack upon
Pekah followed. Now probably it was that the entire trans-Jordanic
region was overrun: and that the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026). Megiddo and Dor appear also to
have been occupied, and the Arabs of the south chastised. Tiglathpileser
then returned to Damascus, where a son of Rezin had assumed the crown;
he besieged and took the city, and punished Rezin's son with death.
Tiglath-pileser appears by one of his inscriptions to have held a court
at Damascus, to which it is probable that the tributary kings of the
neighborhood were summoned to pay their tributes and do homage for their
kingdoms. Among the tributes brought to him at this time, those of
Judaea, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Gaza, Ascalon, and Tyre, are mentioned.

Kir - Kir is mentioned by Amos [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007) as the country from which the
Syrians came. It is joined by Isaiah [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006) with Elam or Elymais. Its
position can only be conjectured. Perhaps the word designates a region
adjoining Elymais, in the extreme southeastern limits of Assyria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 16:10</span></span>

And saw an altar - Rather, "The altar," i. e. an Assyrian altar, and
connected with that formal recognition of the Assyrian deities which the
Ninevite monarchs appear to have required of all the nations whom they
received into their empire.

The fashion of the altar - Assyrian altars were not very elaborate, but
they were very different from the Jewish. They were comparatively small,
and scarcely suited for "whole burnt-offerings." One type was square,
about half the height of a man, and ornamented round the top with a sort
of battlement. Another had a triangular base and a circular top
consisting of a single flat stone. A third was a sort of portable stand,
narrow, and about the height of a man. This last was of the kind which
the kings took with them in their expeditions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 16:14</span></span>

Hereto the "Brasen altar" (marginal reference) had, it would seem,
occupied a position directly in front of the temple porch, which it
exactly equalled in width. Now Ahaz removed it from this place, and gave
the honorable position to his new altar, which he designed to supersede
the old far all ordinary purposes [Kg2
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015).

From between the altar ... - Urijah, having received no official
directions, had placed the new altar in front of the old, between it and
the eastern gate of the court. Ahaz consequently on his arrival found
the brasen altar "between the (new) altar and the house of the Lord."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 16:15</span></span>

The brasen altar shall be for me to inquire by - The bulk of modern
commentators translate - "As for the Brasen altar, it will be for me to
inquire (or consider) what I shall do with it."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 16:16</span></span>

The writer condemns the obsequiousness of Urijah, whose conduct was the
more inexcusable after the noble example of his predecessor Azariah [Ch2
26:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 16:17</span></span>

See the marginal references. The acts recorded here, were probably not
mere wanton acts of mutilation, but steps in the conversion of these
sacred objects to other uses, as to the ornamentation of a palace or of
an idol temple. The bases, the oxen, and the sea were not destroyed -
they remained at Jerusalem until its final capture [Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017), [Jer
52:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020). Probably they were restored to
their original uses by Hezekiah [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019).

A pavement of stones - Probably a pavement made expressly, for the
stones of the court seem to have been covered with a planking of cedar
[Kg1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036); [Kg1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 16:18</span></span>

The covert ... in the house - A canopied seat in the temple for the king
and his family when they attended public worship on the sabbath. It
stood no doubt in the inner court of the temple.

The king's entry without - This would seem to have been a private
passage by which the king crossed the outer court to the east gate of
the inner court when he visited the temple [Eze
46:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001).

Turned he from the house of the Lord for the king of Assyria - This
passage is very obscure. Some translate - "altered he in the house of
the Lord, because of the kine of Assyria," supposing the "covert" and
the "passage" to have been of rich materials, and Ahaz to have taken
them to eke out his "presents to the king of Assyria." Others render,
"removed he into the house of the Lord from fear of the king of
Assyria."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 16:19</span></span>

The rest of the acts of Ahaz - Such as are described in [Isa
7:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010); [Ch2
28:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023); [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003), [Ch2
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#007).
