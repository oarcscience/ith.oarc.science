### [Deuteronomy Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 31:2</span></span>

I am an hundred and twenty years old - The 40 years of the wandering had
passed since Moses, then 80 years old, "spake unto Pharaoh" ([Exo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007); Compare [Deu
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007)).

I can, no more go out and come in - Render I shall not longer be able to
go out and come in: i. e., discharge my duties among you. There is no
inconsistency with [Deu 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007). Moses
here adverts to his own age as likely to render him in future unequal to
the active discharge of his office as leader of the people: the writer
of [Deu 34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001), one of Moses'
contemporaries, remarks of him that up to the close of life "his eye was
not dim, nor his natural force abated" [Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007); i. e. that he was to the last,
in the judgment of others, in full possession of faculties and strength.

[Deuteronomy 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 31:7</span></span>

Moses hands over to Joshua that office as leader of the people, to which
he had already been designated [Deu
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038); [Num
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#023). He assigns also to the
Levitical priests and the elders, as the ecclesiastical and civil heads
of the nation, the responsibility of teaching the law and enforcing its
observance [Deu 31:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010). Both these
were symbolic acts, designed to mark the responsibility of the parties
concerned after the death of Moses.

[Deuteronomy 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 31:11</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. It is not to be supposed that the whole
of the Pentateuch was read, nor does the letter of the command require
that it should be so. This reading could not be primarily designed for
the information and instruction of the people, since it only took place
once in seven years; but was evidently a symbolic transaction, intended,
as were so many others, to impress on the people the conditions on which
they held possession of their privileges and blessings.

[Deuteronomy 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 31:14</span></span>

The transaction recorded in these verses may be regarded as the solemn
inauguration of Joshua to the office to which he had some time before
[Num 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#022) been called, and his
recognition in it by God, which were manifested by his being summoned
into the tabernacle with Moses while the Lord appeared in the pillar of
cloud (compare [Num 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025); [Num
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005)).

[Deu 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016)

The future apostasy of the people is announced in the presence of Joshua
that the latter might be fully aware of the danger and strive in his day
to avert it. This he faithfully did (compare [Jos
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031)); but we find him in his own
last address to Israel repeating [Jos
23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#015) the self-same prediction and
warning.

[Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019)

A witness for me against them - i. e., an attestation from their own
mouths at once of God's benefits, their own duties, and their deserts
when they should fall away. Being in verse it would be the more easily
learned and kept in memory. The use of songs for such didactic purposes
was not unknown to the legislators of antiquity. Compare also the advice
of Paul, "teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs" [Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016).

[Deu 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#023)

He gave - i. e., the Lord gave.

[Deuteronomy 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 31:24</span></span>

Moses completes the writing out of the book of the Law, and directs it
to be placed by the ark of the covenant.

[Deu 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#024)

The "book" here spoken of would contain the whole Pentateuch up to this
verse, and be "the Book of Moses," called generally by the Jews "the
Law" (compare [Mat 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040); [Gal
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021)).

[Deu 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#025)

The Levites, which bare the ark - i. e., as in [Deu
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009), "the priests the sons of Levi."
The non-priestly Levites could not so much as enter the sanctuary or
touch the ark (compare [Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015)).
Though in the journeys through the wilderness the ark was borne by the
non-priestly Kohathites, yet on occasions of a more solemn and public
character it was carried by the priests themselves ([Jos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003) ff, [Jos
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009); [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006), [Jos
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#012); [Jos
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033); [Kg1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003)).

[Deu 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026)

Put it in the side of the ark - Rather, by the side of the ark. The two
tables of the Decalogue were in the ark [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009); the Book of the Law was to be
laid up in the holy of holies close by the ark of the covenant, probably
in a chest. Compare [Kg2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).

[Deu 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027)

How much more after my death - Hence, [Deu
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#024) and the rest of the book (with
the exception of the song, [Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019))
must be regarded as a kind of appendix added after Moses' death by
another hand; though the Blessing Deut. 33 is of course to be regarded
as a composition of Moses.
