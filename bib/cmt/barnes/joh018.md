### [John Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

[John 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 18:1</span></span>

The brook Cedron - This was a small stream that flowed to the east of
Jerusalem, through the valley of Jehoshaphat, and divided the city from
the Mount of Olives. It was also called Kidron and Kedron. In summer it
is almost dry. The word used here by the evangelist - χειμάῤῥου
cheimarrou - denotes properly a water-stream (from χεῖρμα cheimōn,
shower or water, and ῥέω reō, ῥόος roos, to flow, flowing), and the idea
is that of a stream that was swollen by rain or by the melting of the
snow (Passow, Lexicon). This small rivulet runs along on the east of
Jerusalem until it is joined by the water of the pool of Siloam, and the
water that flows down on the west side of the city through the valley of
Jehoshaphat, and then goes off in a southeast direction to the Dead Sea.
(See the map of the environs of Jerusalem.) Over this brook David passed
when he fled from Absalom, [Sa2 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md).
It is often mentioned in the Old Testament, [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); [Ch2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md); [Ch2
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md); [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md), [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md).

Where was a garden - On the west side of the Mount of Olives. This was
called Gethsemane. See the notes at [Mat
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md). It is probable that this was
the property of some wealthy man in Jerusalem - perhaps some friend of
the Saviour. It was customary for the rich in great cities to have
country-seats in the vicinity. This, it seems, was so accessible that
Jesus was accustomed to visit it, and yet so retired as to be a suitable
place for devotion.

[John 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 18:2</span></span>

Jesus ofttimes resorted thither - For what purpose he went there is not
declared, but it is probable that it was for retirement and prayer. He
had no home in the city, and he sought this place, away from the bustle
and confusion of the capital, for private communion with God. Every
Christian should have some place - be it a grove, a room, or a garden -
where he may be alone and offer his devotions to God. We are not told
much of the private habits of Jesus, but we are permitted to know so
much of him as to be assured that he was accustomed to seek for a place
of retirement, and during the great feasts of the Jews the Mount of
Olives was the place which he chose, [Luk
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037.md); [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md); [Joh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001.md).

[John 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 18:3</span></span>

A band - See the notes at [Mat 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md);
[Mat 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md). John passes over the agony
of Jesus in the garden, probably because it was so fully described by
the other evangelists.

Lanterns ... - This was the time of the full moon, but it might have
been cloudy, and their taking lights with them shows their determination
to find him.

[John 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 18:6</span></span>

They went backward ... - The cause of their retiring in this manner is
not mentioned. Various things might have produced it. The frank, open,
and fearless manner in which Jesus addressed them may have convinced
them of his innocence, and deterred them from prosecuting their wicked
attempt. His disclosure of himself was sudden and unexpected; and while
they perhaps anticipated that he would make an effort to escape, they
were amazed at his open and bold profession. Their consciences reproved
them for their crimes, and probably the firm, decided, and yet mild
manner in which Jesus addressed them, the expression of his unequalled
power in knowing how to find the way to the consciences of men, made
them feel that they were in the presence of more than mortal man. There
is no proof that there was here any miraculous power, any mere physical
force, and to suppose that there was greatly detracts from the moral
sublimity of the scene.

[John 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 18:8</span></span>

Let these go their way - These apostles. This shows his care and love
even in the hour of danger. He expected to die. They were to carry the
news of his death to the ends of the earth. Hence he, the faithful
Captain of salvation, went foremost into trials; he, the Good Shepherd,
secured the safety of the flock, and went before them into danger. By
the question which he asked those who came out against him, he had
secured the safety of his apostles. He was answered that they sought for
him. He demanded that, agreeably to their declaration, they should take
him only, and leave his followers at liberty. The wisdom, caution, and
prudence of Jesus forsook him in no peril, however sudden, and in no
circumstances, however difficult or trying.

[John 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 18:9</span></span>

The saying - [Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md). As he had
kept them for more than three years, so he still sought their welfare,
even when his death was near.

[John 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 18:10</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051.md).

The servant's name was Malchus - His name is mentioned by neither of the
other evangelists, nor is it said by the other evangelists who was the
disciple that gave the blow. It is probable that both Peter and the
servant were alive when the other gospels were written.

[John 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 18:12</span></span>

See [Mat 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050.md).

[John 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 18:13</span></span>

To Annas first - Probably his house was nearest to them, and he had
great authority and influence in the Jewish nation. He had been himself
a long time high priest; he had had five sons who had successively
enjoyed the office of high priest, and that office was now filled by his
son-in-law. It was of importance, therefore, to obtain his sanction and
counsel in their work of evil.

That same year - [Joh 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049.md).

[John 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 18:14</span></span>

Which gave counsel ... - [Joh
11:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049.md). This is referred to here,
probably, to show how little prospect there was that Jesus would have
justice done him in the hands of a man who had already pronounced on the
case.

[John 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 18:15</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:57-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md).

Another disciple - Not improbably John. Some critics, however, have
supposed that this disciple was one who dwelt at Jerusalem, and who, not
being a Galilean, could enter the palace without suspicion. John,
however, mentions the circumstance of his being known to them, to show
why it was that he was not questioned as Peter was. It is not probable
that any danger resulted from its being known that he was a follower of
Jesus, or that any harm was meditated on them for this. The questions
asked Peter were not asked by those in authority, and his apprehensions
which led to his denial were groundless.

[John 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 18:19</span></span>

The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples - To ascertain their
number and power. The charge on which they wished to arraign him was
that of sedition, or of rebellion against Caesar. To make that
plausible, it was necessary to show that he had made so many disciples
as to form a strong and dangerous faction; but, as they had no direct
proof of that, the high priest insidiously and improperly attempted to
draw the Saviour into a confession. Of this he was aware, and referred
him to the proper source of evidence - his open, undisguised conduct
before the world.

His doctrine - His teaching. The sentiments that he inculcated. The
object was doubtless to convict him of teaching sentiments that tended
to subvert the Mosaic institutions, or that were treasonable against the
Roman government. Either would have answered the design of the Jews, and
they doubtless expected that he - an unarmed and despised Galilean, now
completely in their power - would easily be drawn into confessions which
art and malice could use to procure his condemnation.

[John 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 18:20</span></span>

Openly to the world - If his doctrine had tended to excite sedition and
tumult, if he had aimed to overthrow the government, he would have
trained his friends in secret; he would have retired from public view,
and would have laid his plans in private. This is the case with all who
attempt to subvert existing establishments. Instead of that, he had
proclaimed his views to all. He had done it in every place of public
concourse in the synagogue and in the temple. He here speaks the
language of one conscious of innocence and determined to insist on his
rights.

Always resort - Constantly assemble. They were required to assemble
there three times in a year, and great multitudes were there constantly.

In secret ... - He had taught no private or concealed doctrine. He had
taught nothing to his disciples which he had not himself taught in
public and commanded them to do, [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027.md); [Luk
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md).

[John 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 18:21</span></span>

Why askest thou me? Ask them ... - Jesus here insisted on his rights,
and reproves the high priest for his unjust and illegal manner of
extorting a confession from him. If he had done wrong, or taught
erroneous and seditious doctrines, it was easy to prove it, and the
course which he had a right to demand was that they should establish the
charge by fair and incontrovertible evidence. We may here learn:

1\. That, though Jesus was willing to be reviled and persecuted, yet he
also insisted that justice should be done him.

2\. He was conscious of innocence, and he had been so open in his
conduct that he could appeal to the vast multitudes which had heard him
as witnesses in his favor.

3\. It is proper for us, when persecuted and reviled, meekly but firmly
to insist on our rights, and to demand that justice shall be done us.
Laws are made to protect the innocent as well as to condemn the guilty.

4\. Christians, like their Saviour, should so live that they may
confidently appeal to all who have known them as witnesses of the
sincerity, purity, and rectitude of their lives, [Pe1
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md).

[John 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 18:22</span></span>

One of the officers - One of the inferior officers, or those who
attended on the court.

With the palm, of his hand - This may mean: "Gave him a blow either with
the open hand or with a rod" - the Greek does not determine which. In
whatever way it was done, it was a violation of all law and justice.
Jesus had showed no disrespect for the office of the high priest, and if
he had, this was not the proper way to punish it. The Syriac reads thus:
"Smote the cheek of Jesus." The Vulgate and Arabic: "Gave him a blow."

[John 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 18:23</span></span>

Spoken evil - In my answer to the high priest. If there was any
disrespect to the office, and lack of regard for the law which appointed
him, then testify to the fact, and let punishment be inflicted according
to the law; compare [Exo 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md).

But if well ... - While an accused person is on trial he is under the
protection of the court, and has a right to demand that all legal
measures shall be taken to secure his rights. On this right Jesus
insisted, and thus showed that, though he had no disposition to take
revenge, yet he claimed that, when arraigned, strict justice should be
done. This shows that his precept that when we are smitten on one cheek
we should turn the other [Mat 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md), is
consistent with a firm demand that justice should be done us. That
precept refers, besides, rather to private masters than to judicial
proceedings. It does not demand that, when we are unjustly arraigned or
assaulted, and when the law is in our favor, we should sacrifice our
rights to the malignant accuser. Such a surrender would be injustice to
the law and to the community, and be giving legal triumph to the wicked,
and destroying the very end of all law. In private matters this effect
would not follow, and we should there bear injuries without reviling or
seeking for vengeance.

[John 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 18:24</span></span>

Compare [Joh 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md) with [Mat
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md).

[John 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 18:25</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:72-74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072.md).

[John 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 18:28</span></span>

See [Mat 27:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md).

Hall of judgment - The praetorium - the same word that in [Mat
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md), is translated "common hall."
See the notes on that place. It was the place where the Roman proctor,
or governor, heard and decided cases brought before him. Jesus had been
condemned by the Sanhedrin, and pronounced guilty of death [Mat
26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066.md); but they had not power to carry
their sentence into execution [Joh
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md), and they therefore sought that
he might be condemned and executed by Pilate.

Lest they should be defiled - They considered the touch of a Gentile to
be a defilement, and on this occasion, at least, seemed to regard it as
a pollution to enter the house of a Gentile. They took care, therefore,
to guard themselves against what they considered ceremonial pollution,
while they were wholly unconcerned at the enormous crime of putting the
innocent Saviour to death, and imbruing their hands in their Messiah's
blood. Probably there is not anywhere to be found among men another such
instance of petty regard to the mere ceremonies of the law and
attempting to keep from pollution, at the same time that their hearts
were filled with malice, and they were meditating the most enormous of
all crimes. But it shows us how much more concerned men will be at the
violation of the mere forms and ceremonies of religion than at real
crime, and how they endeavor to keep their consciences at ease amid
their deeds of wickedness by the observance of some of the outward
ceremonies of religion by mere sanctimoniousness.

That they might eat the passover - See the notes at [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md), [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md). This defilement, produced by
contact with a Gentile, they considered as equivalent to that of the
contact of a dead body [Lev 22:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md);
[Num 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md), and as disqualifying them to
partake of the passover in a proper manner. The word translated
"passover" means properly the paschal lamb which was slain and eaten on
the observance of this feast. This rite Jesus had observed with his
disciples the day before this. It has been supposed by many that he
anticipated the usual time of observing it one day, and was crucified on
the day on which the Jews observed it; but this opinion is improbable.
The very day of keeping the ordinance was specified in the law of Moses,
and it is not probable that the Saviour departed from the commandment.
All the circumstances, also, lead us to suppose that he observed it at
the usual time and manner, [Mat 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md),
[Mat 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#019.md). The only passage which has
led to a contrary opinion is this in John; but here the word passover
does not, of necessity, mean the paschal lamb. It probably refers to the
Feast which followed the sacrifice of the lamb, and which continued
seven days. Compare [Num 28:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016.md). The
whole feast was called the Passover, and they were unwilling to defile
themselves, even though the paschal lamb had been killed, because it
would disqualify them for participating in the remainder of the
ceremonies (Lightfoot).

[John 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 18:30</span></span>

If he were not a malefactor - A violator of the law. If we had not
determined that he was such, and was worthy of death, [Mat
26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066.md). From this it appears that they
did not deliver him up to be tried, but hoped that Pilate would at once,
give sentence that he should be executed according to their request. It
is probable that in ordinary cases the Roman governor was not accustomed
to make very strict inquiry into the justice of the sentence. The Jewish
Sanhedrin tried causes and pronounced sentence, and the sentence was
usually approved by the governor; but in this case Pilate, evidently
contrary to their expectations, proceeded himself to rehear and retry
the cause. He had doubtless heard of the miracles of Jesus. He seems to
have been strongly pre-possessed with the belief of his innocence. He
knew that they had delivered him from mere envy [Mat
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#018.md), and hence, he inquired of them
the nature of the case, and the kind of charge which they expected to
substantiate against him.

[John 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 18:31</span></span>

Judge him ... - The Jews had not directly informed him that they had
judged him and pronounced him worthy of death. Pilate therefore tells
them to inquire into the ease; to ascertain the proof of his guilt, and
to decide on what the law of Moses pronounced. It has been doubted
whether this gave them the power of putting him to death, or whether it
was not rather a direction to them to inquire into the case, and inflict
on him, if they judged him guilty, the mild punishment which they were
yet at liberty to inflict on criminals. Probably the former is intended.
As they lied already determined that in their view this case demanded
the punishment of death, so in their answer to Pilate they implied that
they had pronounced on it, and that he ought to die. They still,
therefore, pressed it on his attention, and refused to obey his
injunction to judge him.

It is not lawful ... - The Jews were accustomed to put persons to death
still in a popular tumult [Act
7:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md), but they had not the power to
do it in any case in a regular way of justice. When they first laid the
plan of arresting the Saviour, they did it to kill him [Mat
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#004.md); but whether they intended to do
this secretly, or in a tumult, or by the concurrence of the Roman
governor, is uncertain. The Jews themselves say that the power of
inflicting capital punishment was taken away about 40 years before the
destruction of the temple; but still it is probable that in the time of
Christ they had the power of determining on capital cases in instances
that pertained to religion (Josephus, Antiq., b. 14: John 10, Section 2;
compare Jewish Wars, b. 6 chapter 2, Section 4). In this case, however,
it is supposed that their sentence was to be confirmed by the Roman
governor. But it is admitted on all hands that they had not this power
in the case of seditions, tumults, or treason against the Roman
government. If they had this power in the case of blasphemy and
irreligion, they did not dare to exert it here, because they were afraid
of tumult among the people [Mat 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005.md);
hence, they sought to bring in the authority of Pilate. To do this, they
endeavored to make it appear that it was a case of sedition and treason,
and one which therefore demanded the interference of the Roman governor.
Hence, it was on this charge that they arraigned him, [Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md). Thus, a tumult might be avoided,
and the odium of putting him to death which they expected would fall,
not on themselves, but upon Pilate!

[John 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 18:32</span></span>

That the saying of Jesus ... - To wit, that he would be delivered into
the hands of the Gentiles and be crucified, [Mat
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019.md). Neither of these things would
have happened if he had been put to death in the way that the Jews first
contemplated, [Mat 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#004.md). Though it
should be admitted that they had the power, in religious cases, to do
this, yet in such a case it would not have been done, as Jesus
predicted, by the Gentiles; and even if it should be admitted that they
had the right to take life, yet they had not the right to do it by
crucifixion. This was particularly a Roman punishment. And thus it was
ordered, in the providence of God, that the prediction of Jesus in both
these respects was fulfilled.

[John 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 18:33</span></span>

Art thou the King of the Jews? - This was after they had accused him of
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, [Luk
23:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md).

[John 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 18:34</span></span>

Of thyself - From any conviction of your own mind, or any apprehension
of danger. During all the time in which you have been praetor, have you
seen anything in me that has led you to apprehend sedition or danger to
the Roman power? This evidently was intended to remind Pilate that
nothing was proved against him, and to caution him against being
influenced by the malicious accusations of others. Jesus demanded a just
trial, and claimed that Pilate should not be influenced by any reports
that he might have heard of him.

[John 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 18:35</span></span>

Am I a Jew? - Am I likely to be influenced by Jewish prejudices and
partialities? Am not I, being a Roman, likely to judge impartially, and
to decide on the accusations without being blessed by the malignant
charges of the accusers?

Thine own nation ... - In this Pilate denies that it was from anything
that he had observed that Jesus was arraigned. He admits that it was
from the accusation of others; but then he tells the Saviour that the
charge was one of moment, and worthy of the deepest attention. It had
come from the very nation of Jesus, from his own countrymen, and from
the highest authority among the people. As such it demanded
consideration, and Pilate besought him to tell him what he had done -
that is, what there had been in his conduct that had given occasion for
this charge.

[John 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 18:36</span></span>

My kingdom ... - The charge on which Jesus was arraigned was that of
laying claim to the office of a king. He here substantially admits that
he did claim to be a king, but not in the sense in which the Jews
understood it. They charged him with attempting to set up an earthly
kingdom, and of exciting sedition against Caesar. In reply to this,
Jesus says that his kingdom is not of this world - that is, it is not of
the same nature as earthly kingdoms. It was not originated for the same
purpose, or conducted on the same plan. He immediately adds a
circumstance in which they differ. The kingdoms of the world are
defended by arms; they maintain armies and engage in wars. If the
kingdom of Jesus had been of this kind, he would have excited the
multitudes that followed him to prepare for battle. He would have armed
the hosts that attended him to Jerusalem. He would not have been alone
and unarmed in the garden of Gethsemane. But though he was a king, yet
his dominion was over the heart, subduing evil passions and corrupt
desires, and bringing the soul to the love of peace and unity.

Not from hence - That is, not from this world.

[John 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 18:37</span></span>

Art thou a king then? - Dost thou admit the charge in any sense, or dost
thou lay claim to a kingdom of any kind?

Thou sayest ... - This is a form of expression denoting affirmation. It
is equivalent to yes.

That I am a king - This does not mean simply that Pilate affirmed that
he was a king; it does not appear that he had done this; but it means,
"Thou affirmest the truth; thou declarest what is correct, for I am a
king." I am a king in a certain sense, and do not deny it.

To this end ... - Compare [Joh
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md), etc. Jesus does not here
affirm that he was born to reign, or that this was the design of his
coming; but it was to bear witness to and to exhibit the truth. By this
he showed what was the nature of his kingdom. It was not to assert
power; not to collect armies; not to subdue nations in battle. It was
simply to present truth to men, and to exercise dominion only by the
truth. Hence, the only power put forth in restraining the wicked, in
convincing the sinner, in converting the heart, in guiding and leading
his people, and in sanctifying them, is that which is produced by
applying truth to the mind. Men are not forced or compelled to be
Christians. They are made to see that they are stoners, that God is
merciful, that they need a Redeemer, and that the Lord Jesus is fitted
to their case, and yield themselves then wholly to his reign. This is
all the power ever used in the kingdom of Christ, and no men in his
church have a right to use any other. Alas! how little have persecutors
remembered this! And how often, under the pretence of great regard for
the kingdom of Jesus, have bigots attempted by force and flames to make
all men think as they do! We see here the importance which Jesus
attached to truth. It was his sole business in coming into the world. He
had no other end than to establish it. We therefore should value it, and
seek for it as for hid treasures, [Pro
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#023.md).

Every one ... - See [Joh 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md).

What is truth? - This question was probably asked in contempt, and hence
Jesus did not answer it. Had the question been sincere, and had Pilate
really sought it as Nicodemus had done John 3, Jesus would not have
hesitated to explain to him the nature of his kingdom. They were now
alone in the judgment-hall [Joh 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033.md),
and as soon as Pilate had asked the question, without waiting for an
answer, he went out. It is evident that he was satisfied, from the
answer of Jesus [Joh 18:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md), that he
was not a king in the sense in which the Jews accused him; that he would
not endanger the Roman government, and consequently that he was innocent
of the charge alleged against him. He regarded him, clearly, as a
fanatic poor, ignorant, and deluded, but innocent and not dangerous.
Hence, he sought to release him; and, hence, in contempt, he asked him
this question, and immediately went out, not expecting an answer.

This question had long agitated the world. It was the great subject of
inquiry in all the schools of the Greeks. Different sects of
philosophers had held different opinions, and Pilate now, in derision,
asked him, whom he esteemed an ignorant fanatic, whether he could solve
this long-agitated question. He might have had an answer. If he had
patiently waited in sincerity, Jesus would have told him what it was.
Thousands ask the question in the same way. They have a fixed contempt
for the Bible; they deride the instructions of religion; they are
unwilling to investigate and to wait at the gates of wisdom; and hence,
like Pilate, they remain ignorant of the great Source of truth, and die
in darkness and in error. All might find truth if they would seek it;
none ever will find it if they do not apply for it to the great source
of light the God of truth, and seek it patiently in the way in which he
has chosen to communicate it to mankind. How highly should we prize the
Bible! And how patiently and prayerfully should we search the
Scriptures, that we may not err and die forever! See the notes at [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md).

I find in him no fault - See [Luk
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004.md).
