### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 6:2</span></span>

The word for "priest" here is the same as that used for the priests of
the true God; that for diviners is everywhere used of idolatrous or
superstitious divining. Three modes of divination are described [Eze
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md), by arrows, by teraphim, and
by the entrails of beasts. (Compare [Exo
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011.md); [Dan
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#002).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 6:3</span></span>

Send it not empty - See the marginal references. The pagan idea of
appeasing the gods with gifts, and the scriptural idea of expressing
penitence, allegiance, or love to God, by gifts and offerings to His
glory and to the comfort of our fellow worshippers, coincide in the
practical result.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 6:4</span></span>

It was a prevalent custom in pagan antiquity to make offerings to the
gods expressive of the particular mercy received. Thus, those saved from
shipwreck offered pictures of the shipwreck, etc., and the custom still
exists among Christians in certain countries.

The plague of the mice is analogous to that of the frogs in Egypt. The
destructive power of field-mice was very great.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 6:7</span></span>

A new cart ... kine on which there hath come no yoke - This was so
ordered in reverence to the ark, and was a right and true feeling. See
[Mar 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002.md); [Mat
27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060.md). For the supposed special virtue
of new things, see [Jdg 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#007.md), [Jdg
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 6:9</span></span>

Bethshemesh was the first Israelite town they would come to, being on
the border of Judah. (See the marginal reference.)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 6:12</span></span>

Lowing as they went - Milking cows had been chosen on purpose to make
the sign more significant. Nature would obviously dispose the cows to go
toward their calves; their going in an opposite direction was therefore
plainly a divine impulse overruling their natural inclination. And this
is brought out more distinctly by the mention of their lowing, which was
caused by their remembering their calves.

And the lords ... - This circumstance of the five satraps of the
Philistines accompanying the ark in person both made it impossible for
the Israelites to practice any deceit (compare [Mat
27:63-66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063).md), and is also a striking
testimony to the agitation caused among the Philistines by the plagues
inflicted on them since the ark had been in their country.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 6:13</span></span>

The whole population was in the field. The harvest work was suspended in
an instant, and all the workmen ran to where the ark was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 6:14</span></span>

A great stone - (Compare [Gen 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md);
[Jdg 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019).md). This great stone was
probably used as an altar on this occasion, and the kine stopping at it
of their own accord was understood by the Bethshemites as an intimation
that they were to offer sacrifices on it to the Lord God of Israel, who
had so wonderfully brought back the ark from its captivity.

And they clave the wood of the cart ... - A similar expedient was
resorted to by Araunah [Sa2 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#022.md), and
by Elisha [Kg1 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 6:15</span></span>

The word "Levites" here probably means priests [Exo
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014.md), sons of Levi, since Bethshemesh
was one of the cities of the priests [Jos
21:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013.md). The burnt offering of the
kine was not in any sense the offering of the men of Bethshemesh, but
rather of the Philistine lords to whom the cart and the kine belonged.
But the Bethshemites themselves, in token of their gratitude for such a
signal mercy, now offered both burnt offerings and sacrifices, probably
peace offerings, and doubtless feasted together with great joy and
gladness (see [Kg1 8:62-66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md); [Ezr
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#016).md). There is nothing whatever in
the text to indicate that these sacrifices were offered otherwise than
in the appointed way by the priests.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 6:18</span></span>

The great stone of Abel ... - Probably so called from the "lamentation"
described in [Sa1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 6:19</span></span>

Fifty thousand and three score and ten - Read "three" score and "ten",
omitting "fifty thousand", which appears to have crept into the text
from the margin. It is not improbable that in their festive rejoicing
priests, Levites, and people may have fallen into intemperance, and
hence, into presumptuous irreverence (compare [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md), [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009).md). God had just vindicated His own
honor against the Philistines; it must now be seen that He would be
sanctified in them that come near Him [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md). It is obvious to observe how the
doctrine of atonement, and its necessity in the case of sinners, is
taught in this and similar lessons as to the awesome HOLINESS of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 6:21</span></span>

Kirjath-jearim - See [Jos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md) note.
It has been thought that there was a high place at Kirjath-jearim (the
hill, [Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001).md), the remnant of its
old pagan sanctity when it was called Kirjath-Baal, "the city of Baal"
(see [Jos 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014.md); [Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002).md); and that for this reason it was
selected as a proper place to send the ark to.
