### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 12:2</span></span>

All his days ... - i. e., so long as Jehoiada was his adviser" (compare
[Ch2 24:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015).md). Jehoida was,
practically speaking, regent during the minority of Jehoash, i. e., 10
or 12 years. An increase of power to the priestly order was the natural
consequence. Jehoiada bore the title of "high priest" [Kg2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010.md), which had been dropped since
the time of Eleazar [Jos 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006.md), and the
Levitical order from this time became more mixed up with public affairs
and possessed greater influence than previously. Jehoiada's successors
traced their office to him rather than to Aaron [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 12:3</span></span>

The worship on the "high places" seems to have continued uninterruptedly
to the time of Hezekiah, who abolished it [Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md). It was, however, again
established by Manasseh, his son [Kg2
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md). The priests at this time cannot
have regarded it as idolatrous, or Jehoiada would have put it during his
regency.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 12:4</span></span>

It is remarkable that the first movement toward restoring the fabric of
the temple should have come, not from Jehoiada, but from Jehoash
(compare [Ch2 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#004).md). Jehoiada had, it
seems, allowed the mischief done in Athaliah's time to remain unrepaired
during the whole term of his government.

The money of every one ... - Three kinds of sacred money are here
distinguished - first, the half shekel required in the Law [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md) to be paid by every one above
twenty years of age when he passed the numbering; secondly, the money to
be paid by such as had devoted themselves, or those belonging to them,
by vow to Yahweh, which was a variable sum dependent on age, sex, and
property [Lev 27:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002.md); and thirdly, the
money offered in the way of free-will offerings.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 12:5</span></span>

The collection was not to be made in Jerusalem only, but in all "the
cities of Judah" [Ch2 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#005.md); the
various priests and Levites being collectors in their own neighborhoods.

Breaches - The word in the original includes every kind and degree of
ruin or dilapidation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 12:6</span></span>

No money had for some time been brought in (marginal reference "g").
Perhaps it was difficult for the priests and Levites to know exactly
what proportion of the money paid to them was fairly applicable to the
temple service and to their own support; and what, consequently, was the
balance which they ought to apply to the repairs.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 12:9</span></span>

The priests that kept the door - The north door into the priests' court
[Eze 40:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#035.md) seems to be intended,
not the door of the temple building. The chest must have been placed a
little to the right of this north door, between it and the altar of
burnt-offering, so that the people could see it from the doorway. The
people were not ordinarily allowed to go within the doorway into this
court, which belonged to the priests and Levites only.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 12:10</span></span>

The king's scribe - Or "secretary" ([Kg1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003) note.md). Such persons are often seen
in the Assyrian sculptures, with a roll, apparently of parchment, in one
hand and a pen in the other, taking account for the king of the spoil
brought in from foreign expeditions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 12:13</span></span>

Comparing this verse with the marginal reference, it will be seen that
the author of Kings desires to point out, that the repairs were not
delayed by any deductions from the money that flowed in. The writer of
Chronicles describes what became of the surplus in the chest after the
last repairs were completed.

The need of supplying fresh bowls, snuffers, etc., arose from the
pollution of those previously used in the temple service by their
application to the Baal worship during the reigns of Ahaziah and
Athaliah (see [Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 12:16</span></span>

The trespass money and the sin money - In all cases of injury done to
another, a man was bound by the Law to make compensation, to the
sufferer, if possible; if not, to his nearest kinsman. If the man was
dead and had left no kinsman, then the compensation was to be made to
the priest [Num 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008.md). This would form a
part of the trespass and sin money. The remainder would accrue from the
voluntary gifts made to the priests by those who came to make atonement
for sins or trespasses [Num 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#010.md). On
the difference between "sins" and "trespasses," see [Lev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014.md) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 12:17</span></span>

There was probably a considerable interval between the conclusion of the
arrangement for the repairs and the Syrian expedition related in these
verses. For the events which had happened, see [Ch2
24:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015.md).

[Kg2 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017.md)

This is the first and last time that we hear of the Damascene Syrians
undertaking so distant an expedition. Gath (see [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003) note.md) could only be reached from
Syria through Israel or Judah. It was not more than 25 or 30 miles from
Jerusalem. It is uncertain whether the city belonged at this time to
Judah or to the Philistines.

Hazael set his face ... - This is a phrase for determination generally,
but especially for determination to proceed somewhere (compare [Jer
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md); [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051).md). Jerusalem can scarcely have
been the primary object of this expedition, or it would have been
attacked by a less circuitous route. Perhaps the Syrians were induced to
make a sudden march against the Jewish capital, by learning, while at
Gath, that a revolution had occurred there (compare [Ch2
24:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018).md).

[Kg2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018.md)

Jehoash did not submit without a struggle. See the details in
Chronicles. It was not until his army was defeated that he followed the
example of his ancestor, Asa, and bought the friendship of the Syrians
with the temple treasures ([Kg1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018.md).
Compare the conduct of Hezekiah, [Kg2
18:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#015).md).

Jehoram and Ahaziah - Though these two monarchs had been worshippers of
Baal, yet they had combined with that idolatrous cult a certain amount
of decent respect for the old religion. It is evident from this passage
that they had made costly offerings to the temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 12:20</span></span>

A conspiracy - Compare the marginal reference Joash, either from a
suspicion of intended treason, or from some other unknown cause, took up
his abode in the fortress of Millo [Kg1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024.md). This conspiracy was connected
with religion. Soon after the death of Jehoiada, Joash had apostatised;
had renewed the worship of Baal; and, despite of many prophetic
warnings, had persisted in his evil courses, even commanding Zechariah
to be slain when he rebuked them [Ch2
24:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018.md). The conspirators, who wished
to avenge Zechariah, no doubt wished also to put down the Baal worship.
In this it appears that they succeeded. For, though Amaziah punished the
actual murderers after a while [Kg2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md), yet he appears not to have been
a Baal-worshipper. The only idolatries laid to his charge are the
maintenance of the high places [Kg2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#004.md), and a worship of the gods of
Edom [Ch2 25:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md).

Silla - This place is quite unknown.
