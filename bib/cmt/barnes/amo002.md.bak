### [Amos Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

[Amos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 2:1</span></span>

Moab - The relation of Moab to Israel is only accidentally different
from that of Ammon. One spirit actuated both, venting itself in one and
the same way, as occasion served, and mostly together (see the note at
[Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013).md). Beside those more formal
invasions, the history of Elisha mentions one probably of many in-roads
of "bands of the Moabites." It seems as though, when "the year entered
in," and with it the harvest, "the bands of the Moabites entered in"
too, like "the Midianites and Amalekites and the children of the east"
[Jdg 6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md), [Jdg
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md) in the time of Gideon, or their
successors the Bedouins, now. This their continual hostility is related
in the few words of a parenthesis. There was no occasion to relate at
length an uniform hostility, which was as regular as the seasons of the
year, and the year's produce, and the temptation to the cupidity of
Moab, when Israel was weakened by Hazael.

Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom - The deed here
condemned, is unknown. Doubtless it was connected with that same hatred
of Edom, which the king of Moab showed, when besieged by Israel. People
are often more enraged against a friend or ally who has made terms with
one whom they hate or fear, than with the enemy himself. Certainly,
"when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him" [Kg2
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#026.md), his fury was directed
personally against the king of Edom. He "took with him" 700 chosen men
"to cut through to the king of Edom, and they could not." Escape was not
their object. They sought not "to cut through" the Edomite contingent
into the desert, but "to the king of Edom." Then "he took his oldest
son," that is, probably the oldest son of the king of Edom whom he
captured, "and offered him up as a burnt offering on the wall."

Such is the simplest structure of the words; He "strove to cut through
to the king of Edom, and they could not, and he took his oldest son,
etc., and there was great indignation against Israel." That
"indignation" too on the part of Edom (for there was no other to be
indignant "against Israel") is best accounted for, if this expedition,
undertaken because Moab had rebelled against Israel, had occasioned the
sacrifice of the son of the king of Edom, who took part in it only as a
tributary of Judah. Edom would have had no special occasion to be
indignant with Israel, if on occasion of an ordinary siege, the king of
Moab had, in a shocking way, performed the national idolatry of
child-sacrifice. That hatred the king of Moab carried beyond the grave,
hatred which the pagan too held to be unnatural in its implacableness
and unsatiableness. The soul being, after death, beyond man's reach, the
hatred, vented upon his remains, is a sort of impotent grasping at
eternal vengeance.

It wreaks on what it knows to be insensible, the hatred with which it
would pursue, if it could, the living being who is beyond it. Its
impotence evinces its fierceness, since, having no power to wreak any
real revenge, it has no object but to show its hatred. Hatred, which
death cannot extinguish, is the beginning of the eternal hate in hell.
With this hatred Moab hated the king of Edom, seemingly because he had
been, though probably against this will, on the side of the people of
God. It was then sin against the love of God, and directed against God
Himself. The single instance, which we know, of any feud between Moab
and Edom was, when Edom was engaged in a constrained service of God. At
least there are no indications of any conquest of each other. The Bozrah
of Moab, being in the Mishor, "the plain" [Jer
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#021.md), [Jer
48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md), is certainly distinct from the
Bozrah of Edom, which Jeremiah speaks of at the same time, as belonging
to Edom [Jer 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md). Each kingdom, Edom
and Moab, had its own strong city, Bozrah, at one and the same time. And
if "the rock," which Isaiah speaks of as the strong hold of Moab [Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md), was indeed the Petra of Edom,
(and the mere name, in that country of rock-fortresses is not strong,
yet is the only, proof,) they won it from Judah who had taken it from
Edom, and in whose hands it remained in the time of Amos ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); see above the note at [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012).md), not from Edom itself. Or,
again, the tribute "may" have been only sent through Petra, as the great
center of commerce. Edom's half-service gained it no good, but evil;
Moab's malice was its destruction.

The proverb, "speak good only of the dead," shows what reverence human
nature dictates, not to condemn those who have been before their Judge,
unless He have already openly condemned them. "Death," says Athanasius
in relating the death of Arius on his perjury, "is the common end of all
people, and we ought not to insult the dead, though he be an enemy, for
it is uncertain whether the same event may not happen to ourselves
before evening."

[Amos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 2:2</span></span>

It shall devour the palaces of Kerioth - Literally, "the cities," that
is, a collection of cities. It may have received a plural form upon some
enlargement, as Jerusalem received a dual form, as a double city. The
name is, in different forms, very common . In the plain or high downs of
Moab itself, there were both Kiriathaim, "double city" and Kerloth [Jer
48:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#023.md); in Naphthali, a Kiriathaim,
([Ch1 6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076.md), ([Ch1
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061) in Hebrew).md) or Kartan [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md); in Judah, the Kerioth [Jos
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025.md) from where the wretched Judas
has his name Iscariot; in Zebulon, Kartah [Jos
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md) also, which reappears as the
Numidian Cirta. Moab had also a Kiriath-huzoth, "city of streets" [Num
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#039.md), within the Arnon . This alone
was within the proper border of Moab, such as the Armorites had left it.

Kerioth and Kiriathaim were in the plain country which Israel had won
from the Amorites, and its possession would imply an aggression of Moab.
Jeroboam II had probably at this time brought Moab to a temporary
submission (see the note at [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014).md); but Israel only required fealty
and tribute of Moab; Moab appears even before the captivity of the 2 12
tribes, to have invaded the possessions of Israel. Kerioth was probably
a new capital, beyond the Arnon, now adorned with "palaces" and
enlarged, as "Paris, Prague, Cracow , "London, are composed of different
towns. In Jerome's time, it had probably ceased to be .

Shall die with tumult - Jeremiah, when prophesying the destruction of
Moab, designates it by this same name "sons of tumult [Jer
48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045.md). A flame shall devour the corner
of Moab and the crown of the sons of tumult." And probably herein he
explains the original prophecy of Balaam, "shall smite the corners of
Moab, and destroy all the children of tumult" [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md). As they had done, so should it
be done to them; tumults they caused, "in tumult" they should perish.

After the subdual of Moab by Nebuchadnezzar, it disappears as a nation,
unless indeed Daniel in his Prophecy, "Edom and Moab and the chief of
the children of Ammon shall escape out of his hand" Amos 11:41
(Antiochus Epiphanes,) means the nations themselves, and not such as
should be like them. Else the intermarriage with Moabite women [Ezr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md) is mentioned only as that with
women of other pagan nations which had ceased to be. The old name,
Moabitis, is still mentioned; but the Arabs had possessed themselves of
it, and bore the old name. Alexander Jannaeus "subdued" we are told, "of
the Arabians, the Moabites and Gileadires," and then, again, when in
difficulty, made it over with its fortified places, to the king of the
Arabians . Among the cities which Alexander took from the king of the
Arabians , are cities throughout Moab, both in that part in which they
had succeeded to Israel, and their proper territory south of the Arnon .

[Amos 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 2:3</span></span>

And I will cut off the judge - The title "judge" (shophet) is nowhere
used absolutely of a king. Holy Scripture speaks in several places of
"all the judges of the earth" [Job
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024.md); [Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md); [Psa
148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011.md); [Pro
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#016.md); [Isa
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#023.md). Hosea [Hos
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md), under "judges," includes "kings
and princes," as judging the people. The word "judge" is always used as
one invested with the highest, but not regal authority, as of all the
judges from the death of Joshua to Samuel. In like way it (Sufetes) was
the title of the chief magistrates of Carthage , with much the same
authority as the Roman Consuls . The Phoenician histories, although they
would not own that Nebuchadnezzar conquered Tyre, still own that, after
his 13 years' siege , Baal reigned 10 years, and after him judges were
set up, one for two months, a second for ten, a third, a high priest,
for three, two more for six, and between these one reigned for a year.
After his death, they sent for Merbaal from Babylon, who reigned for
four years, and on his death, they sent for Hiram his brother who
reigned for twenty. The judges then exercised the supreme authority, the
king's sons having been carried away captive. Probably, then, when
Jeroboam II recovered the old territory of Israel, Moab lost its kings.
It agrees with this, that Amos says, "the princes thereof," literally,
"her princes," the princes of Moab, not as of Ammon, "his princes," that
is, the princes of the king.

[Amos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 2:4</span></span>

For three transgressions of Judah etc. - Rup.: "Here too there is no
difference of Jew and Gentile. The word of God, a just judge, spareth no
man's person. whom sin joins in one, the sentence of the Judge disjoins
not in punishment" [Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md). "As many
as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law, and as many
as have signed in the law, shall be judged by the law." Jerome: "Those
other nations, Damascus and the rest, he upbraids not for having cast
away the law of God, and despised His commandments, for they had not the
written law, but that of nature only. So then of them he says, that
"they corrupted all their compassions" - and the like. But Judah, who,
at that time, had the worship of God and the temple and its rites, and
had received the law and commandments and judgments and precepts and
testimonies, is rebuked and convicted by the Lord, for that it had "cast
aside His law and not kept His commandments;" wherefore it should be
punished as it deserved.

And since they rejected and despised these, then, in course, "their lies
deceived them," that is, their idols; "lies" on their part who made them
and worshiped them for the true God, and "lies" and lying to them, as
deceiving their hopes. "For an idol is nothing in the world" [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), as neither are all the vanities
in the world whereof people make idols, but they deceive by a vain show,
as though they were something. Jerome: "They would not have been
deceived by their idols, unless they had first rejected the law of the
Lord and not done His commandments." They had sinned with a high hand:
"despising" and so rejecting the law of God; and so He despised and
rejected them, leaving them to be deceived by the lies which they
themselves had chosen. So it ever is with man. Man must either "love
God's law and hate and abhor lies" [Psa
119:163](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#163.md), or he will despise God's law
and cleave to lies.

He first in act "despises" God's law, (and whoso does not keep it,
despises it,) and then he must needs be deceived by some idol of his
own, which becomes his God. He first chooses willfully his own "lie,"
that is, whatever he chooses out of God, and then his own "lie" deceives
him. So, morally, liars at last believe themselves. So, whatever false
maxim anyone has adopted against his conscience, whether in belief or
practice, to justify what he wills against the will of God, or to
explain away what God reveals and he mislikes, stifling and lying to his
conscience, in the end deceives his conscience, and at the last, a man
believes that to be true, which, before he had lied to his conscience,
he knew to be false. The prophet uses a bold word in speaking of man's
dealings with his God, "despises." Man carries on the serpent's first
fraud, "Hath God indeed said?" Man would not willingly own, that he is
directly at variance with the Mind of God. Man, in his powerlessness, at
war with Omnipotence, and, in his limited knowledge, with Omniscience!
It were too silly, as well as too terrible.

So he smoothes it over to himself, "lying" to himself. "God's word must
not be taken so precisely;" "God cannot have meant;" "the Author of
nature would not have created us so, if He had meant;" and all the other
excuses, by which he would evade owning to himself that he is directly
rejecting the Mind of God and trampling it under foot. Scripture draws
off the veil. Judah had the law of God, and did not keep it; then, he
"despised" it. On the one side was God's will, His Eternal Wisdom, His
counsel for man for good; on the other, what debasements! On the one
side were God's awful threats, on the other, His exceeding promises. Yet
man chose whatever he willed, lying to himself, and acting as though God
had never threatened or promised or spoken. This ignoring of God's known
Will and law and revelation is to despise them, "as effectually as to
curse God to His face" [Job 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md). This
rejection of God was hereeditary.

Their lies were those "after which their fathers walked," in Egypt and
from Egypt onward, in the wilderness (see the note at [Amo
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025).md) , "making the image of the
calf of Egypt and worshiping Baalpeor and Ashtoreth and Baalim." Evil
acquires a sort of authority by time. People become inured to evils, to
which they have been used. False maxims, undisputed, are thought
indisputable. They are in possession; and "possession" is held a good
title. The popular error of one generation becomes the axiom of the
next. The descent "of the image of the great goddess Diana from Jupiter"
or of the Coran, becomes a "thing" which cannot be spoken against" [Act
19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035.md). The "lies after which the
fathers walked" deceive the children. The children canonize the errors
of their fathers." Human opinon is as dogmatic as revelation. The second
generation of error demands as implicit submission as God's truth.

The transmission of error against himself, God says, aggravates its
evil, does not excuse it [Neh 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005.md).
"Judah is the Church. In her the prophet reproves whosoever, worshiping
his own vices and sins, cometh to have that as a god by which he is
overcome; as Peter saith, "Whereby a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage" [Pe2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md). The
covetous worshipeth mammon; the glutton, his belly [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md); the impure, Baalpeor; she who,
"living in pleasure, is dead while she liveth" [Ti1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md), the pleasure in which she
liveth." Of such idols the world is full. Every fair form, every idle
imagination, everything which gratifies self-love, passion, pride,
vanity, intellect, sense, each the most refined or the most debased, is
such a "lie," so soon as man loves and regards it more than his God.

[Amos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 2:5</span></span>

I will send a fire upon Judah - All know now, how Jerusalem, its temple,
and its palaces perished by fire, first by Nebuchadnezzar, then by the
Romans. Yet some two centuries passed, before that first destruction
came. The ungodly Jews flattered themselves that it would never come. So
we know that a "fiery stream" [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md) will issue and come forth from
Him; "a fire" that "consumeth to destruction" [Job
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#012.md), all who, whether or no they are
in the body of the Church, are not of the heavenly Jerusalem; dead
members in the body which belongs to the Living Head. And it will not
the less come, because it is not regarded. Rather, the very condition of
all God's judgments is, to be disregarded and to come, and then most to
come, when they are most disregarded.

[Amos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 2:6</span></span>

For three transgressions of Israel, and for four - In Israel, on whom
the divine sentence henceforth rests, the prophet numbers four classes
of sins, running into one another, as all sins do, since all grievous
sins contain many in one, yet in some degree distinct:

\(1\) Perversion of justice;

\(2\) oppression of the poor;

\(3\) uncleanness;

\(4\) luxury with idolatry.

They sold the righteous for silver - It is clear from the opposite
statement, "that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair
of shoes," that the prophet is not speaking of judicial iniquity, but of
actual buying and selling. The law allowed a Hebrew who was poor to sell
himself , and a Hebrew to buy him until the year of release; yet this
too with the express reserve, that the purchaser was forbidden to "serve
himself with him with the service of a slave, but as a hired servant and
a sojourner stroll he be with thee" [Lev
25:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md). The thief who could not
repay what he stole, was to "be sold for his theft" [Exo
22:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#002.md). But the law gave no power to
sell an insolvent debtor. It grew up in practice. The sons and daughters
of the debtor [Neh 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005.md), or "his wife
and children" [Mat 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025.md), nay even the
sons of a deceased debtor [Kg2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md),
were sold. Nehemiah rebuked this sharply. In that case, the hardness was
aggravated by the fact that the distress had been fomented by usury. But
the aggravation did not constitute the sin. It seems to be this
merciless selling by the creditor, with Amos rebukes. The "righteous" is
probably one who, without any blame, became insolvent. The "pair of
shoes," that is, sandals, express the trivial price, or the luxury for
which he was sold. They had him sold "for the sake of a pair of
sandals," that is, in order to procure them. Trivial in themselves, as
being a mere sole, the sandals of the Hebrew women were, at times,
costly and beautiful ([Sol 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md); Ezra
10; Judith 16:9). Such a sale expressed contempt for man, made in the
image of God, that he was sold either for some worthless price, or for
some needless adornment.

[Amos 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 2:7</span></span>

That pant after the dust of the earth - Literally, "the panters!" with
indignation. Not content with having rent from him the little hereditary
property which belonged to each Israelite, these creditors grudged him
even the "dust," which, as a mourner, he strewed on his head [Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md), since it too was "earth."
Covetousness, when it has nothing to feed it, craves for what is absurd
or impossible. What was Naboth's vineyard to a king of Israel with his
"ivory palace?" What was Mordecai's refusal to bow to one in honor like
Haman? What a trivial gain to a millionaire? The sarcasm of the prophet
was the more piercing, because it was so true. People covet things in
proportion, not to their worth, but to their worthlessness. No one
covets what he much needs. Covetousness is the sin, mostly not of those
who have not, but of those who have. It grows with its gains, is the
less satisfied, the more it has to satisify it, and attests its own
unreasonableness, by the uselessness of the things it craves for.

And turn aside the way of the meek - So Solomon said, "A wicked" man
"taketh a bribe out of the bosom, to pervert the ways of judgment."
([Pro 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md). God had laid down the
equality of man, made in His own image, and had forbidden to favor
either poor [Exo 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003.md) or rich [Exo
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md). Amos calls these by different
names, which entitled them to human sympathy; "poor, depressed, lowly;
poor," in their absolute condition; "depressed," as having been brought
low; "lowly," as having the special grace of their state, the wonderful
meekness and lowliness off the godly poor. But all these qualities are
so many incentives to injury to the ungodly. They hate the godly, as a
reproach to them; because "he is clean contrary to their doings, his
life is not like other people's; his ways are of another fashion"
(Wisdom [Amo 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012.md), [Amo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#015).md). Wolves destroy not wolves but
sheep. Bad people circumvent not the bad but the good. Besides the
easiness of the gain, there is a devilish fascinating pleasure to the
bad, to overreach the simple and meek, because they are such.

They love also to "turn aside the way of the meek," by , "turning them
from what is truly right and good; "or from the truth; or again to
thwart them in all their ways and endeavors, by open injustice or by
perverting justice. Every act of wrong prepares the way for the crowning
act; and so "the turning aside the way of the meek" foreshadowed and
prepared for the unjust judgment of Him who was "the Meek and Lowly" One
[Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), the selling the righteous
for a trilling sum prepared for the selling "the Holy One and the Just"
[Act 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md) for "the thirty pieces of
silver." : "Contrariwise, whoso is truly wise, cordially venerates the
humble and abject, the poor and simple, and prefers them in his own
heart to himself, knowing that God has 'chosen the poor, and the weak
things of the world, and things despised, and things which are not' [Co1
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md); and that Christ hath likened
Himself to such, saying in the Psalm, 'I am poor and sorrowful' [Psa
69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md)."

The same damsel - This is not expressly forbidden by the law, except in
the case of marriage, the father being forbidden to marry his son's
widow, and the son to take his father's widow to wife [Lev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md), [Lev
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#015.md). Abominations, unless they had
become known to Israel in Egypt, were not expressly forbidden, but were
included in the one large prohibition, which, as our Lord explains,
forbade every offence, bearing upon it. Israel must have so understood
the law, since Amos could upbraid them with this, which is not forbidden
by the letter of the law, as a willful insult to the Majesty of God.
Reverence was due from the son to the father, example from the father to
the son. But now the father was an example of evil to the son; and the
son sinned in a way which had no temptation except its irreverence.
People, sated with ordinary sin seek incitement to sin, in its very
horrors. Probably this sin was committed in connection with their idol
worship (see the note at [Hos 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014).md).
The sin of marrying the father's widow was "fornication not so much as
named among the Gentiles" [Co1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md); it
was unknown, as seemingly legalizing what was so unnatural. Oppression
of the poor, wronging the righteous, perverting the way of the meek,
laid the soul open for any abomination.

To profane My Holy Name - that is, as called upon them, as the people of
God. God had said, "ye shall keep My commandments and do them ([Lev
22:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031.md); add [Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003.md); [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006).md). "I" am "the Lord, and ye shall
not defile My Holy Name. For I will be sanctified among the children of
Israel. I am the Lord who sanctifies you." The sins of God's people are
a reproach upon Himself. They bring Him, so to say, in contact with sin.
They defeat the object of His creation and revelation. He created man in
His Image, to bear His likeness, to have one will with Himself. In
effect, through sin, He has created rebels, deformed, unlike. So long as
He bears with them, it seems as if He were indifferent to them. Those to
whom He has not revealed Himself, must needs think that He takes no
account of what He permits unnoticed. Israel, whom God had separated
from the pagan, did, by "mingling with the pagan and learning their
works" [Psa 106:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035.md), all which in them
lay, to "profane" His "Holy Name." They acted as if they had no other
purpose than to defile it (see the note at [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md).

Had such been their object, they could not have done it more
effectually, they could not have done otherwise. In deliberate sin,
people act, at last, in defiance of God, in set purpose to dishonor Him.
The Name of God has ever since been blasphemed, on account of the sins
of the Jews, as though it were impossible that God should have chosen
for His own, a people so "laden with iniquities" [Isa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004.md). Nathan's words to David, "Thou
hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme" [Sa2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#014.md), have been fulfilled until this
day. How much more, Christians, who not only are called "the people of
God" but bear the name of Christ incorporated in their own. Yet have we
not known Muslims flee from our Christian capital, in horror at its
sins? "He lives like a Christian," is a proverb of the Polish Jews,
drawn from the debased state of morals in Socinian Poland. The religion
of Christ has no such enemies as Christians. Dionysius: "As the devout
by honoring God, shew that He is Holy, Great, Most High, who is obeyed
in holiness, fear and reverence, so the ungodly, by dishonoring God,
exhibit God as far as in them lies, as if lie were not holy. For they
act so as if evil were well-pleasing to Him, and induce others to
dishonor Him. Wherefore the Apostle saith; "the name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024.md); and by Ezekiel the Lord saith
oftentimes, "Ye have profaned My Holy Name. And I will sanctify My great
Name which wets profaned among the pagan, which ye hare profaned in the
midst of them" [Eze 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023.md). The devout
then are said to "magnify," sanctify, "exalt God;" the unrighteous to
"profane [Eze 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md), despise, God."

[Amos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 2:8</span></span>

They lay themselves down - They condensed sin. By a sort of economy in
the toil of sinning, they blended many sins in one; idolatry,
sensuality, cruelty, and, in all, the express breach of God's
commandments. The "clothes" here are doubtless the same as the "raiment"
in the law, the large enfolding cloak, which by day was wrapped over the
long loose shirt , the poor man's only dress besides, and by night was
his only bedding [Exo 22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026.md). God
had expressly commanded, "If the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with
his pledge" [Deu 24:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#012.md); in any case
"thou shalt deliver him the pledge again, when the sun goeth down, that
he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee; and it shall be
righteousness to thee before the Lord thy God." Here the "garments laid
to pledge" are treated as the entire property of the creditors.

They "stretch" their listless length along upon them in their
idol-feasts "by every altar." Ezekiel speaks of a "stately bed," upon
which they "sat, and a table prepared before it" [Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041.md). Isaiah; "Upon a lofty and high
mountain, hast thou set up thy bed; even thither wentest thou up to
offer sacrifice; thou hast enlarged thy bed; thou hast loved their bed;
thou providedst room" [Isa 57:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007.md). In
luxury and state then, and withal in a shameless publicity, they "lay on
the garments" of the despoiled "by every altar." The multiplication of
altars [Hos 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md); [Hos
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md) was, in itself, sin. By each of
these multiplied places of sin they committed fresh sins of luxury and
hard-heartedness, (perhaps, from the character of the worship of nature,
yet grosser sins,) "and drink the wine of the condemned," or (as the
English margin more exactly) "the amerced," those whom, unjustly,
persons in any petty judicial authority had "amerced," expending in
revelry and debanchery in the idol's temple what they had unjustly
extorted from the oppressed.

There is no mask too transparent to serve to hide from himself one who
does not wish to see himself. Nothing serves so well as religion for
that self-deceit, and the less there is of it, or the more one-sided it
is, the better it serves. For the narrower it is, the less risk of
impinging on the awful reality of God's truth; and half a truth as to
God is mostly, a lie which its half-truth makes plausible. So this
dreadful assemblage of cruelty, avarice, malice, mockery of justice,
unnatural debauchery, hard-heartedness, was doubtless smoothed over to
the conscience of the ten tribes by that most hideous ingredient of all,
that "the house of their god" was the place of their ill-purchased
revelry. People do not serve their idols for nothing; this costly
service at Bethel was not for nought. They did all these things; but
they did something for "the Deity" or "Nature" or "Ashtoreth;" and so
"the Deity" was to be at peace with them. Amos, with wonderful irony,
marks the ghastly mixture of sin and worship, "they drank the wine of
the amerced" - where? "in the house of their God," condemning in five
words their luxury, oppression, perversion of justice, cruelty,
profaneness, unreal service and real apostasy. What hard-heartedness to
the willfully-forgotten poor is compensated by a little Church-going!

[Amos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 2:9</span></span>

Yet - (and I) I (Emphatic) destroyed Such were "their" doings; such
their worship of "their God." And what had "God" done? what was it,
which they thus requited?

The Amorite - These, as one of the mightiest of the Canaanite tribes,
stand in Moses for all. Moses, in rehearsing to them the goodness of God
and their backsliding, reminds them, how he had said, "Ye have come to
the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord your God giveth you" [Deu
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020.md); and that they, using this same
word, said, "Because the Lord hateth us, He hath brought us forth out of
the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy
us" [Deu 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#027.md). The aged Joshua, in
rehearsing God's great deeds for Israel, places first by itself the
destruction of the Amorite before them, with the use of this same idiom
, "I brought you into the land of the Amorites which dwelt on the other
side of Jordan - and I destroyed them before you." The Amorites were
descended from the 4th son of Canaan [Gen
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#016.md).

At the invasion of Chedorlaomer, a portion of them dwelt at
Hazezon-Tamar or Engedi, half way on the west side of the Dead Sea, and
at Hebron near it ([Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007.md), [Gen
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md); compare [Gen
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#018.md); [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002).md). Their corruption had not yet
reached its height, and the return of Israel was delayed to the four
hundredth year, "because the iniquity of the Amorite was not yet full"
[Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md). When Israel returned, the
Amorites, (together with the Hittites and the Jebusites) held the hill
country [Num 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md); [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md), [Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md), Jerusalem, Hebron, Gibeon [Sa2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#002.md), and, on the skirts of the
mountains westward Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon [Jos
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md), [Jos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md). They dwelt on the side of the
Jordan westward [Jos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md), besides the
two kingdoms which they had formed east of Jordan, reaching to Mount
Hermon [Deu 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md) and Bashan up to the
territory of Damascus. Afterward a small remnant remained only in the
portion of Dan, and in the outskirts of Judah, from the south of the
Dead Sea, Maaleh Akrabbim (Scorpion-pass) and Petra [Jdg
1:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035.md). Those near Idumea were
probably absorbed in Edom; and the remnant in Dan, after becoming
tributary to Ephraim [Jdg 1:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035.md),
lost their national existence perhaps among the Philistines, since we
have thenceforth only the single notice in the days of Samuel after the
defeat of the Philistines, "there was peace between Israel and the
Amorites" [Sa1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014.md).

Whose height was like the height of the cedars - The giant sons of Anak
were among the Amorites at "Hebron" [Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md) (called for a time Kiriath Arba
[Jos 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md); [Jos
15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013) from their giant father.md)
"Debir, Ahab, and the mountains of Judah and Israel [Jos
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021.md). The valley of Rephaim" [Sa2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018.md), southwest of Jerusalem, connects
this giant race with the Amorites, as does the fact that Og, king of the
Amorites in Basan, was "of the remnant of the Rephaim" [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md); [Jos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004.md); [Jos
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#019.md). Basan and Argob were, in Moses'
time, still called "the land of Rephaim" [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md). The Rephaim, with the
Perizzites, dwelt still in woody mountains near Ephraim; from where, on
the complaint that the lot of the sons of Joseph was too narrow, Joshua
bade his tribe to expel them [Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md), [Jos
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md). The Rephaim are mentioned
between the Perizzites and the Amorites [Gen
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#020.md), in God's first promise of
the land to Abraham's seed, and perhaps some intermixture of race gave
the giant stature to the Amorites. It is clear from Amos that the report
of the spies, "all the people that we saw in it were men of stature"
[Num 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md), was no exaggeration, nor
did Joshua and Caleb deny "this." The name of the Amorite is probably
connected with "commanding," describing some quality of their
forefather, which descended to his race.

Whose height was like the height of cedars - Giant height is sometimes a
cause of weakness. Amos, in a degree like Hosea combines distinct images
to make up the idea of stateliness and strength. The cedar is the ideal
of eastern trees for height [Isa 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013.md);
[Eze 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md); [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md); [Kg1
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md); [Kg2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009.md), stretching forth its arms as for
protection , "It groweth to an exceeding height, and with increasing
time ever riseth higher." The oak has its Hebrew name from strength. The
more majestic the tall strength of the Amorite, the more manifest that
Israel "got not the land in possession by their own sword" [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md), who had counted themselves, in
sight of the Amorite, "as grasshoppers" [Num
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033.md). God, who gave him that
strength, took it away, as we say, "root and branch," leaving him no
show above, no hope of recovered life below (see [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md); [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md); [Eze
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009).md). Having compared each Amorite to
a majestic tree, he compares the excision of the whole nation to the
cutting down of that one tree , so swift, so entire, so irrecoverable.
Yet the destruction of the Amorite, a mercy to Israel in the purpose of
God, was a warning to israel when it became as they. God's terrors are
mercies to the repentant; God's mercies are terrors to the impenitent.
"Ye shall keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not commit any of
these abominations," was the tenure upon which they held the Lord's
land, "that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
spued out the nations that were before you" [Lev
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026.md), 38.

[Amos 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 2:10</span></span>

Also I - (Literally, "And I," I, emphatic; thus and thus did ye to Me;
and thus and thus, with all the mercy from the first, did I to you,) I
brought you up from the land of Egypt It is this language in which God,
in the law, reminded them of that great benefit, as a motive to
obedience; "I brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage" [Exo 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md); [Deu
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006.md); [Deu
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012.md); only there, since God has not as
yet "brought them up" into the land which He promised them, but they
were yet in the wilderness, He says, "brought them forth;" here,
"brought them up," as to a place of dignity, His own land.

And led you forty years through the wilderness - These are the very
words of the law ([Deu 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md), (5
English), and reminded them of so many benefits during the course of
those "forty years," which the law rehearsed; the daily supply of manna,
the water from the rock, the deliverance from the serpents and other
perils, the manifold forgivenesses. To be "led forty years through the
wilderness," alone, had been no kindness, but a punishment. It was a
blending of both. The abiding in the wilderness was punishment or
austere mercy, keeping them back from the land which they had shown
themselves unqualified to enter: God's "leading" them was, His
condescending mercy. The words, taken from the law, must have
re-awakened in the souls of Israelites the memory of mercies which they
did not mention, how that same book relates "He found him in a desert
land, and in the waste howling wilderness; He led him about; He
instructed him; He kept him as the apple of His eye. The Lord alone did
lead him" [Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md), [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012.md). In the wilderness, where thou
hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his
son, in all the way that ye went until ye came to this place" [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md); or that minute tender care,
mentioned in the same place ([Deu
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004), (5, English).md), "your clothes are
not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot."
But unless Israel had known the law well, the words would only have been
very distantly suggestive of mercy, that it must have been well with
them even in the wilderness, since God "led them." They had then the law
in their memories, in Israel also , but distorted it or neglected it.

[Amos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 2:11</span></span>

And I raised up of your sons for prophets - Amos turns from outward
mercies to inward, front past to present, from miracles of power to
miracles of grace. God's past mercies live on in those of today; the
mercies of today are the assurance to us that we have a share in the
past; His miracles of grace are a token that the miracles of His power
are not our condemnation. God had, from the time of Moses, "raised up"
prophets. Eldad and Medad [Num
11:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#026.md) were images Of those, whom
God would raise up beyond the bounds of His promise. Samuel was an
Ephrathite [Sa1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md); Ahijah the
Shilonite, that is, of Shiloh in Ephraim, lived on to old age in the
kingdom of the ten tribes after their schism, the witness against the
apostasy of Jeroboam [Kg1 14:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#007.md);
[Kg1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029.md), yet acknowledged by the
king whose rise and of the destruction of whose house he prophesied [Kg1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md), [Kg1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004.md).

Jehu, son of Hanani, was the prophet of both kingdoms [Kg1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md), [Kg1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md), [Kg1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#012.md); [Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md); [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md); Micaiah, son of Imlah, was well
known to Ahab, as "prophesying evil concerning him" [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md), [Kg1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018.md) continually; unknown to
Jehoshaphat [Kg1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#007.md). That wondrous
pair, marvelous for superhuman sanctity and power among the marvelous
miracles of God, Elijalh and Elisha, were both "sons" of Israel, whom
God "raised up; Elijjah the Tishbite" [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md), born doubtless at Thisbe, a
village of Naphthali , and one of the sojourners in Gilead; Elisha of
Abelmeholah [Kg1 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016.md), on the west
side of the valley of the Jordan . And even now He had raised up to them
of their own "sons," Hosea and Jonah. Their presence was the presence of
God among them, who, out of the ordinary way of His Providence, "raised"
them "up" and filled them with His Spirit; and where the presence of God
is, if there is fear, yet there is also hope.

And of your young men for Nazarites - The Nazarite was a fruit of the
grace of God in its moral and religions workings, superhuman in holiness
and self-denial, as the prophets were of that same grace, conferring
superhuman wisdom and knowledge also. Of both, God says, "I raised up,"
teaching that both alike, holiness of life and superhman wisdom, were
His own special gift to each individual, His own creation. God survived
His people, called, and "raised up," by His grace, out of the crowd,
those souls which responded to His call. The life of the Nazarites was a
continual protest against the self-indulgence and worldliness of the
people. It was a life above nature. Unless any prophet like Samuel [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md), was also a Nazarite, they had no
special office except to live that life. Their life taught. Nay, it
taught in one way the more, because they had no special gifts of wisdom
or knowledge, nothing to distinguish them from ordinary people, except
extraordinary grace.

They were an evidence, what all might do and be, if they used the grace
of God. The power of the grace of God shows itself the more wondrously
in these who have nought beside. The essence of the Nazarite life, as
expressed by its name, was "separation," separation from things of the
world, with a view to God. The separation was not, necessarily, for more
than a limited time. In such case, it answered to the strictness of the
Christian Lent. It was a considerable discipline for a time. In those
simpler days, when luxury had not been so busy , the absolute
prohibition of anything fermented [Num
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md), whether from the grape or any
other substance or vinegar made of either, or any liquor or refreshing
food or drink, made in any way from the grape, fresh or dry, its husks
or its kernels, while it cut off every evasion, involved the giving up
not only every drink, in any way exciting or stimulating, but very much
also, which was refreshing. Water, which in the east has seldom the
freshness of ours, was their only drink. This, which to individuals may
be an easy rule, would not be so in the main.

Those only think an undeviating rule slight, who have never tried one,
nor set themselves on system to conquer self-will. Such a rule would not
be acted upon, except for God. The long never-shorn hair was probably
intended to involve the neglect of personal appearance. Yet this was the
body only of the vow; its soul was the dedication to God. The Nazarite
not only "separated himself from" [Num
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md) those earthly things; he
"separated himself to" the Lord [Num
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002.md), [Num
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005.md) : he "consecrated to the Lord
the days of his separation [Num 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012.md) :
all the days of his separation he was holy to the Lord [Num
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#008.md) : the separation of his God was
upon his head." [Num 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007.md). The vow was
a great and singular thing. "When man or woman shall vow a special vow
of a Nazarite" [Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002.md). The ritual of
the Nazarite likened him to the priest. Giving him no priestly office,
it yet even intensified some of the rules of the priesthood.

The priest was to abstain from wine and strong drink, only "when" he
"went into the tabernacle of the congregations," that he might "put
difference between holy and unholy, and teach Israel the statutes" of
the Lord [Lev 10:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md) : the Nazarite,
so long as he remained such. The priest might defile himself for certain
very near dead [Lev 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md); the high
priest alone and the Nazarite, "neither for father nor mother" [Lev
21:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011.md); [Num
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007.md) : and that for the kindred reason;
the high priest, "because the crown of the anointing oil of his God" was
"upon him;" the Nazarite, "because the consecration of his God was upon
his head!" His consecrated hair was called by the self-same name [Num
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#019.md) as the mitre of the priest. It
appears to have been woven into "seven locks" [Jdg
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013.md), itself a number of
consecration. If his consecration came to an end, that hair was mingled
with the sacrifice [Num 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018.md), and on
"his" hands alone, besides the priest's at his consecration, was part of
the offering laid [Num 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#019.md).

All Israel was, in God's purpose, "a kingdom of priests" [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md); and, among them, the Nazarite
was brought yet nearer, not to the priest's office, but to his
character. This must have diffused itself indefinitely through the
outward and inward life. Further strictness probably lay in the spirit
of the vow. The outward appearance of the Nazarites appears to have been
changed by their abstemiousness. "Her Nazarites were purer than snow;
they were whiter than milk" [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md).
Their countenance had that transparent purity, which sometimes results
from a pure abstemious life; as Athanasius is said to have been
"bloodless." John the Immerser, the counterpart of Elijah, ate only of
the food of the wilderness, "locusts and wild honey;" his clothing was
the hair cloth [Luk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md); [Luk
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#033.md); [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md).

Of James the Just it is related with reference to the Nazarite vow ; "He
was holy from his mother's womb; wine and strong drink he drank not, nor
ate any living thing; the razor came not up upon his head; he anointed
him not with oil, and he used not a bath." Nazarites there had been in
the most disorganized times of Israel. The histories of Samson and
Samuel stand over against one another, as Nazarites who, the one
forfeited, the other persevered in, his vocation. Elijah's ascetic
character is as if he had been one of them, or deepened the lines of
their rule. Ahaziah's ungodly messengers described him contemptously as
"a man, lord of hair," as though he had nothing but his prophet's broad
mantle of hair, and "the leather girdle about his loins" .

The Rechabites, although Kenites by origin [Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md), had been enrolled in the people
of God, and had received a rule from their father, uniting with the
abstinence of the Nazarites, a mode of life which kept them aloof from
the corruptions of cities [Jer 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007.md),
[Jer 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#009.md). The rules of their Nomadic
life were consecrated to God, for He says, "There shall not be cut off
from Jonadub, the son of Rechab, a man standing before Me for ever" [Jer
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md), that is, as the servant of God.
God uses as to them the term which marks the service of the Levites [Deu
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008.md), priests [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md), and prophets [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md). Jonadab, the author of their
rule, was plainly an ascetic, through whose presence Jehu hoped to cast
a religious character over his ambitious execution of God's command .

But the value which the artful, though impetuous [Kg2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020.md), bloodstained, captain attached
to the presence of the ascetic shows the weight which they had with the
people. Strange sight it must have been, the energetic warrior in his
coat of mail, and the ascetic, as energetic, in his hair-cloth. Deeper
far the cotrast within. But the more marvelous the contrast, the more it
attests the influence which the unworldly ascetic had over the world.
Like the garb of the prophets, their appearance was a standing rebuke to
a life of sense. Like the patriarchs, it professed that they were
"strangers and pilgrims upon the earth." They who sought nothing of the
world or of time, were a witness to the belief in their eternal home.
The Nazarites must now have been a numerous body, since Amos speaks of
them, as a known class, like the prophets, of whose numbers we hear
incidentally .

Yet the memory of these, who, amid the general corruption, were, each in
his own sphere, centers of pure faith and life, is embalmed in these few
words only. So little reason is there to think that God's commands were
neglected by all, because their observance is not related. Amos appeals
publicly to the people that the fact was so, that God had raised up
Nazarites as well as prophets among them. He had His "little flock" [Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md), His "seven thousand" [Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md), who escaped the eye even of
Elijah. The gift of the Nazarites was a special favor to Israel, as a
memorial what the grace of God could do for man, what man could do, with
the grace of God. His "raising up Nazarites, out of their young men,"
men in their first bloom of unmarried , virgin ([Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025.md); [Ch2
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md); [Jer
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#022.md); and in the plur. [Psa
78:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#063.md); [Psa
148:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#012.md); [Isa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md);. [Jer
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#013.md); [Lam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018.md); [Lam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#021.md); [Zac
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017.md); and by Amos himself, [Amo
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#013).md), life their picked "very chosen
men," such as furnished the prime of their warriors , stengthened that
teaching.

Even now, one devoted to God in his youth is a witness for God, leaven
of the world around him. But the Nazarite had also to bear an outward
mark for good, to be singular. His appearance bespoke that he had chosen
God. His vow was not only a living up to the law; it lay beyond the law,
the free-will offering of those whom God called. At an age, when so many
do things unlawful, to gratitfy passion, these abstained even from
things lawful. "Canst thou not do what these youths and these maidens
can? or can they either in themselves, and not rather in the Lord their
God?" was Augustine's upbraiding of himself , on the eve of his
conversion, in thought of those who were living a devoted virgin life.

Is it not even thus? - It were enough that God, the Truth, said it. But
He condemns not, without giving space for excuse or defense. So he
describes the Day of Judgment [Mat
25:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md), [Mat
25:41-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md); [Mat
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md). "The books were opened - and
the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the
books, according to their works" [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md). Now, in the time of grace, the
question asks, what, written under the picture of Christ crucified, once
converted a sinner; "This have I done for thee: What doest thou for Me?"
What did they? What had they done? What would they do?

[Amos 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 2:12</span></span>

But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink - Literally, "and," (this, on
their part, was the consequence of what God did for them) "ye caused the
Nazarites to drink wine." God appointed; Israel strove to undo His
appointment. God "raised up Nazarites," as a testimony to them; they
sought to make His servants break their vow, in order to rid themselves
of that testimony. Their pains to destroy it, is a strong proof of its
power. The world is mad against true religion, because it feels itself
condemned by it. People set themselves against religion and the
religious, the Church or the priesthood, only when and because they feel
their power on God's side against them. What people despise, they do not
oppose. "They kill us, they do not despise us," were true words of a
French priest, as to the "reign of reason" in the first French
revolution. If the people in power had not respected the Nazarites, or
felt that the people respected them, they would not have attempted to
corrupt or to force them to break their vow. The word, "cause" them "to
drink," does not express whether they used constraint or seduction.
Israel's consciences supplied it. Yet since they "persecuted the
prophets" and put them to death, it seems likely that Amos means that
they used violence, either by forcing the wine into their mouths, as the
swine-flesh was forced into the mouth of Eleazar (2 Macc. 6:18), and, in
the Decian persecution an infant was made to eat of the idol oblation ,
or by threat of death.

And commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not - God had commanded the
prophets to prophesy. Israel issued and laid upon them his commands
against the commands of God. The more God reveals His Will, the directer
and more determinate the opposition of those who will not yield. God's
perseverance in trying to win them irritates them; they oppose grace,
and are angered at not being let alone. This large statement of Amos
means much more than the prohibition of Amaziah to himself [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013.md). Jeroboam I was prevented only by
miracle [Kg1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md) from seizing the
prophet who denounced the altar at Bethel. Ahab, during the famine
foretold by Elijah, sought him everywhere to destroy him [Kg1
18:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#010.md), and Jezebel, after the
miracle at Carmel and the death of her prophets, swore by her gods to do
so [Kg1 19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002.md). Ahab's last act was to
imprison Micaiah [Kg1 22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md), the
son of Imlath, for prophesying his death, when adjured by himself to
speak truly.

Ahaziah, his son, undeterred by the fire from heaven which destroyed two
captains, each with his fifty, sent yet a 3d to take Elijah, when he
prophesied that the king would not recover from his sickness [Kg2
1:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009.md). Jehoram, his second son, swore
by God to destroy Elisha, [Kg2 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031.md),
laying the evils of the siege to the prophet, as the Romans did the
evils of their decaying empire to the Christian. Micah and Isaiah, a
little later, speak of such opposition, in Judah, as habitual [Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md); much more in Israel, where
the opposition to God's law was more fundamental, and where God's
prophet's had been all but exterminated. Even Asa, in his degenerate
days, imprisoned Hanani for prophesying that he would "have wars" [Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007.md), [Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010.md); Joash killed Zechariah son of
Jehoiada [Ch2 24:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md); Amaziah
silenced the prophet who rebuked him, "Art thou made of the king's
council? forbear. Why shouldest thou be smitten?" [Ch2
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#015.md).

Jehoiakim sent even into Egypt to fetch Uriah and killed him [Jer
26:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020.md). Jeremiah's life was one
continuous encounter with false accusations [Jer
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md); [Jer
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md); [Jer
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004.md), contradictions by false prophets
([Jer 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md) ff; [Jer
27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md), [Jer
27:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#014); Jer. 28; Jer. 29.md), hatred
[Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md), mockery [Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md); [Jer
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md); [Jer
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md), persecution [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018.md), imprisonment [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md); [Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md); [Jer
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md); [Jer
37:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md); [Jer
38:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md), attempts to destroy him ([Jer
11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018.md); [Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md), [Jer
18:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md); [Jer
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#008.md) ff; [Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026).md). The complaint was, as here,
"wherefore dost thou prophesy?" [Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md). What, when our Lord gives it as
the characteristic of Jerusalem , that she was "the slayer of the
prophets, the stoner of those sent unto her?" They would not have slain
the prophets, if they could have silenced them.

People are loath to go to extremities with God; they will make an
armistice with Him; their awe of holiness makes them inwardly shrink
from laying hands on it. Like the wolf in the fable, they must have a
plea against it; and that plea against those who have the truth is
obstinacy . If the Christians would have abstained from converting the
world, they would not have been persecuted. The Chief-priests at first
sought simply to silence the Apostles [Act
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md), [Act
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021.md); then they enforced their command
with scourges [Act 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md); then
persecuted them and the Christians to death [Act
7:57-59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md); [Act
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md); [Act
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md); [Act
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md); [Act
22:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md). Direct contumacy to God's
known voice and silencing His messenger, is a last stage of obduracy and
malice, which leaves God no further avenue to the soul or the people.
His means of grace are exhausted when the soul or people not only deaden
His voice within, but obstruct it without. One who, through vehemence of
his passions, refuses to hear, is within the reach of the grace of God,
afterward. He who stifles God's word to others has mostly hardened his
heart deliberately and maliciously in unlove to man, as well as contempt
of God. Hence, God speaks, as though this brought the day of grace to a
close.

[Amos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 2:13</span></span>

Behold, I am pressed under you - God bore His people, as the wain bears
the sheaves. "Ye yourselves have seen," He said to them by Moses, "how I
bare you on eagle's wings, and brought you unto Myself" [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md). "Thou hast seen how the Lord thy
God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
until ye came into this place" [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031.md). And by Isaiah, "He bare them and
carried them all the days of old" [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md); and, "which are born" by Me
"from the belly, which are carried from the womb" [Isa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md). Now, He speaks of Himself as
wearied by them, as by Isaiah, "thou hast wearied Me with thine
iniquities" [Isa 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md); and by
Malachi, "ye have wearied the Lord: yet ye say, where with have we
wearied Him?" [Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md). His
long-suffering was, as it were, worn out by them. He was straitened
under them, as the wain groans under the sheaves with which it is
over-full. The words are literally, "Behold I, I" (emphatic I, your God,
of whom it would seem impossible) "straiten myself" (that is, of My own
Will allow Myself to be straitened"under you" ,

"As the wain full for itself," that is, as full as ever it can contain,
is "straitened, groans," as we say. God says, (the word in Hebrew is
half active) that He allows Himself to be straitened, as in Isaiah, He
says, "I am weary to bear," literally, "I let Myself be wearied." We are
simply passive under weariness or oppressiveness: God endures us, out of
His own free condescension in enduring us. But it follows, that when He
shall cease to endure our many and grievous sins, He will cast them and
the sinner forth from Him.

[Amos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 2:14</span></span>

Israel relied, against God, on his own strength. "Have we not," they
said, "taken to us horns by our own strength?" [Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013.md). Amos tells them then, that every
means of strength, resistance, flight, swiftness of foot, of horse,
place of refuge, should fail them. Three times he repeats, as a sort of
dirge, "he shall not deliver himself."

Therefore the flight shall perish - (Probably place of flight [Job
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020.md); [Psa
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md); [Jer
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035).md). They had despised God, as
their "place of refuge" , so "the place of refuge, should perish from
the swift," as though it were not. He should flee amain, but there would
be no "place to flee unto." God alone "renews strength;" therefore "the
strong" man should not "strengthen his force or might," should not be
able to gather or "collect his strength" as we say. Fear should disable
him. "The handler of the bow" (as in [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009).md), and who by habit is a skilled
archer, although himself out of the immediate reach of the enemy, and
able, unharmed, to annoy him and protect the fugitives, "shall not
stand" (as in [Jer 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021.md); [Nah
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008).md). Panic should overtake him. The
"mighty" man, the "fleet of foot" should "not deliver," yea, "the
horseman" should not "deliver himself;" yea, he who, "among the mighty,"
was "strongest of his heart," firm-souled among those of mightiest
prowess, "shall flee away naked," that is, bared of all, armor or dress,
which might encumber his flight "in that day" which the Lord made a day
of terror His own day.

Saith the Lord - Probably literally, "the secret utterance of the Lord."
Amos, more than Hosea, uses this special authentication of his words ,
which is so common in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah. He
claims a knowledge, which those around him had not, and ratifies it by
the express appeal to the direct, though secret, revelation of God; what
those who were not of God, would deny; what they who were of God, would
believe.
