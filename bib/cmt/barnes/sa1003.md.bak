### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 3:1</span></span>

See the margin reference note. Josephus says that Samuel's call to the
prophetic office happened when he had just completed his twelfth year
(compare [Luk 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042).md).

Was precious - (or rare) The song of Hannah, and the prophecy of the
"man of God" ([Sa1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027) note.md), are the
only instances of prophecy since Deborah. Samuel is mentioned as the
first of the series of prophets [Act
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md).

No open vision - Better rendered, "There was no vision promulgated or
published." (Compare [Ch2 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 3:2</span></span>

The passage should be rendered thus: "And it came to pass at that time
that Eli was sleeping in his place; and his eyes had begun to grow dim;
he could not see. And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel
was sleeping in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was; and the
Lord called Samuel, etc." Eli's old age and dimness of sight is probably
mentioned as the reason why Samuel thought Eli had called him. Being a
blind and feeble old man, he was likely to do so if he wanted anything,
either for himself, or for the service of the temple.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 3:7</span></span>

Did not yet know the Lord - i. e. in His supernatural communication, as
follows at the end of the verse. The text rendering of this verse is
better than that of the margin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 3:10</span></span>

A personal presence, not a mere voice, or impression upon Samuel's mind,
is here distinctly indicated. (Compare [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md) note; [Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md); [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 3:11</span></span>

More accurately, "the which whosoever heareth both his ears shall
tingle." This expressive phrase occurs again twice (marginal references)
with reference to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. It is
remarkable that Jeremiah repeatedly compares the destruction of
Jerusalem with the destruction of Shiloh ([Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md), [Jer
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#014.md); [Jer
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006.md), [Jer
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#009.md); Compare [Psa
78:60-64](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 3:12</span></span>

When I begin ... - literally, as in the margin: meaning, I will go
through with the performance from first to last.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 3:13</span></span>

Made themselves vile - Rather, "have cursed themselves," i. e. brought
curses upon themselves.

He restrained them not - In the sense of punishing. He did not remove
them from their office, which he ought to have done.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 3:14</span></span>

See the marginal references. The sin of the sons of Eli could not be
purged by the appointed sacrifices of the Law. In blessed contrast with
this declaration is the assurance of the New Testament [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md); [Act
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 3:15</span></span>

Opened the doors - We learn thus incidentally the nature of some of
Samuel's duties. This duty was quite Levitical in its character. In the
interval between Josh and David, when the tabernacle was stationary for
the most part, it may have lost something of its "tent" character, and
among other changes have had doors instead of the hanging.

Samuel feared to show Eli the vision - Here was Samuel's first
experience of the prophet's cross: the having unwelcome truth to divulge
to those he loved, honored, and feared. Compare the case of Jeremiah
[Jer 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md); [Jer
17:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md); [Jer
20:7-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 3:18</span></span>

It is the Lord ... - Compare the devout submission of Aaron [Lev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md), and of Hezekiah [Kg2
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019.md). And, for the highest
conceivable submission to the will of God, compare [Luk
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 3:20</span></span>

From Dan ... - See [Jdg 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001.md) note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 3:21</span></span>

The state described in [Sa1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007.md) was
henceforth reversed. Samuel now knew the Lord, and the Word of the Lord
was revealed unto him.
