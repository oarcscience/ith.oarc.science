### [Esther Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001.md)

[Esther 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 2:1</span></span>

These events must belong to the time between the great assembly held at
Susa in Xerxes' third year (483 B.C.), and the departure of the monarch
on his expedition against Greece in his fifth year, 481 B.C.

[Esther 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 2:3</span></span>

The house of the women - i. e. the "gynaeceon," or "haram" - always an
essential part of an Oriental palace (Compare [Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008).md). In the Persian palaces it was
very extensive, since the monarchs maintained, besides their legitimate
wives, as many as 300 or 400 concubines (compare [Est
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014).md).

[Esther 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 2:5</span></span>

Mordecai, the eunuch [Est 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007.md), [Est
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011.md), has been conjectured to be the
same as Matacas, who, according to Ctesias, was the most powerful of the
eunuchs during the latter portion of the reign of Xerxes. Mordecai's
line of descent is traced from a certain Kish, carried off by
Nebuchadnezzar in 598 B.C. - the year of Jeconiah's captivity - who was
his great-grandfather. The four generations, Kish, Shimei, Jair,
Mordecai, correspond to the known generations in other cases, for
example:

High priests kings of Persia Royal stock of Judah Seraiah Cambyses
Jeconiah Jozadak Cyrus Salathiel Jeshua Darius Zerubbabel Joiakim Xerxes
Hananiah

The age of Mordecai at the accession of Xerxes may probably have been
about 30 or 40; that of Esther, his first cousin, about 20.

[Esther 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 2:7</span></span>

Hadassah, הדסה hădassâh from הדס hădas ("myrtle") would seem to have
been the Hebrew, and Esther the Persian, name of the damsel. Esther is
thought to be connected through the Zend with ἀστήρ astēr, "star." But
there is not at present any positive evidence of the existence in Old
Persian of a kindred word.

[Esther 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 2:10</span></span>

The Persians had no special contempt for the Jews; but, of course, they
despised more or less all the subject races. Esther, with her Aryan
name, may have passed for a native Persian.

[Esther 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 2:11</span></span>

Mordecai occupied, apparently, a humble place in the royal household. He
was probably one of the porters or doorkeepers at the main entrance to
the palace [Est 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md).

[Esther 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 2:14</span></span>

The second house of the women - i. e. Esther returned to the "house of
the women," but not to the same part of it. She became an inmate of the
"second house," or "house of the concubines," under the superintendence
of a distinct officer, Shaashgaz.

[Esther 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 2:15</span></span>

She required nothing - The other virgins perhaps loaded themselves with
precious ornaments of various kinds, necklaces, bracelets, earrings,
anklets, and the like. Esther let Hegai dress her as he would.

[Esther 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 2:16</span></span>

Tebeth (compare the corresponding Egyptian month, "Tobi" or "Tubi"),
corresponded nearly to our January.

In the seventh year of his reign - In December, 479 B.C., or January,
478 B.C. Xerxes quitted Sardis for Susa in, or soon after, September,
479 B.C. It has been regarded as a "difficulty" that Vashti's place,
declared vacant in 483 B.C., was not supplied until the end of 479 B.C.,
four years afterward. But since two years out of the four had been
occupied by the Grecian expedition, the objection cannot be considered
very weighty.

[Esther 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">est 2:18</span></span>

A release - Either remission of taxation, or of military service, or of
both.

[Esther 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 2:19</span></span>

When the virgins ... - Rather, "when virgins" etc. The words begin a new
paragraph. There was a second collection of virgins (after that of [Est
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#008).md), and it was at the time of this
second collection that Mordecai had the good fortune to save the king's
life.

[Esther 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">est 2:21</span></span>

Conspiracies inside the palace were ordinary occurrences in Persia.
Xerxes was ultimately murdered by Artabanus, the captain of the guard,
and Aspamitras, a chamberlain and eunuch.

[Esther 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">est 2:23</span></span>

Both hanged on a tree - i. e. "crucified" or "impaled" the ordinary
punishment of rebels and traitors in Persia.

The book of the chronicles - Ctesias drew his Persian history from them,
and they are often glanced at by Herodotus.
