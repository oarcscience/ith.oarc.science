### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 9:0</span></span>

In [Ecc 9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md) reasons are adduced for
the universal conclusion [Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md)
that no person can understand the works of God. This does not, however,
prevent the assertion of the practical advantage in this life of that
wisdom which includes the fear of God ([Ecc
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013) ff.md). Compare [Ecc
9:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md) with Wisd. 2:1-9.

[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

A good man's trust in God is set forth as a counterpoise to our
Ignorance of the ways of Providence.

In the hand of God - Under His special protection ([Deu
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003) ff.md) as righteous, and under His
direction [Pro 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md) as people.

No man ... - literally, both love and also hatred man knoweth not: all
are before them. Love and hatred here mean the ordinary outward tokens
of God's favor or displeasure, i. e., prosperity and adversity. "Man
knoweth not" probably means: "man knows not whether to expect prosperity
or adversity from God; all his earthly future is in obscurity."

[Ecclesiastes 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 9:2</span></span>

Event - See [Ecc 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md) note.

Sweareth - i. e., Swears lightly or profanely.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 9:3</span></span>

Compare [Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md). The seeming
indiscriminateness of the course of events tends to encourage
evil-disposed men in their folly.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

For to him - Rather: "Yet to him." Notwithstanding evils, life has its
advantage, and especially when compared with death.

Dog - To the Hebrews a type of all that was contemptible [Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md).

[Ecclesiastes 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 9:5</span></span>

See [Ecc 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md), note; [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), note. The living are conscious
that there is a future before them: but the dead are unconscious; they
earn nothing, receive nothing, even the memory of them soon disappears;
they are no longer excited by the passions which belong to people in
this life; their share in its activity has ceased. Solomon here
describes what he sees, not what he believes; there is no reference here
to the fact or the mode of the existence of the soul in another world,
which are matters of faith.

The last clause of [Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006.md) indicates
that the writer confines his observations on the dead to their portion
in, or relation to, this world.

[Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006.md)

Now - Rather: "long ago."

[Ecclesiastes 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 9:7</span></span>

Read these six verses connectedly, in order to arrive at the meaning of
the writer; and compare [Ecc 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md).

After the description [Ecc 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md) of
the portionless condition of the dead, the next thought which occurs is
that the man who is prosperous and active should simply enjoy his
portion all through this life [Ecc
9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md); and then [Ecc
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md) follows the correcting thought
(see [Ecc 3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001) note.md), introduced as
usual [Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md), [Ecc
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#007.md) by "I returned," namely, that the
course of events is disposed and regulated by another will than that of
man.

The person addressed is one whose life of labor is already pleasing to
God, and who bears visible tokens of God's favor.

[Ecc 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md)

Now accepteth - Rather: "already has pleasure in." Joy (the marginal
reference note) is regarded as a sign of the approbation and favor of
God.

[Ecc 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008.md)

White garments and perfume are simply an expressive sign of joy.

[Ecc 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md)

The works which we carry on here with the combined energies of body and
soul come to an end in the hour of death, when the soul enters a new
sphere of existence, and body and soul cease to act together. Compare
[Joh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md).

Device - See [Ecc 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md) note.

[Ecc 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md)

Chance - Or, "incident," that which comes to us from without, one of the
external events described in Eccl. 3. Compare [Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md) note.

[Ecc 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md)

Time - See [Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md) ff.

[Ecclesiastes 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 9:13</span></span>

Or, Also this have I seen - wisdom under the sun, and great it seemed to
me.

From this verse to the end of Eccl. 10, the writer inculcates, in a
series of proverbs, wisdom in contrast to folly, as the best remedy in
the present life to the evil of vanity.

[Ecclesiastes 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 9:14</span></span>

A parable probably without foundation in fact. Critics who ascribe this
book to a late age offer no better suggestion than that the "little
city" may be Athens delivered 480 b.c. from the host of Xerxes through
the wisdom of Themistocles, or Dora besieged 218 b.c. by Antiochus the
Great.

[Ecc 9:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016.md) are comments on the two
facts - the deliverance of the city and its forgetfulness of him who
delivered it - stated in [Ecc 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015.md).

[Ecclesiastes 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 9:18</span></span>

Sinner - The word in the original indicates intellectual as well as
moral error.
