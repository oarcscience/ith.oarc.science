Heritage

### [Ezra Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 9:1</span></span>

Abominations - The mixed marriages had prevented that complete
separation of the people of God from the idolatrous rites, or
"abominations," which the Law required, and which was necessary for
purity of religion. See [Kg1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#002.md)
note.

[Ezra 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 9:3</span></span>

Plucking out the hair with the hands, so common among the Classical
nations, is, comparatively speaking, rarely mentioned as practiced by
Asiatics.

[Ezra 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 9:7</span></span>

Very similar in tone to this are the confessions of Nehemiah [Neh
9:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029.md) and of Daniel (see the
marginal references). The captivity had done its work by deeply
convincing of sin the Jewish nation that had previously been so proud
and self-righteous.

[Ezra 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 9:8</span></span>

The "little space" was above 60 years, counting from the second year of
Darius [Ezr 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024.md), or about 80 years,
counting from the first year of Cyrus [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md). This does not seem to Ezra much
in the "lifetime" of a nation.

A remnant to escape - Rather, "a remnant that has escaped." The
"remnant" is the new community that has returned from the captivity.

A nail - Compare the marginal note and reference. The metaphor is
probably drawn from a tent-pin, which is driven into the earth to make
the tent firm and secure.

[Ezra 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 9:9</span></span>

We were bondmen - Rather, "we are bondmen" (compare the marginal
reference). The Israelites, though returned from the captivity, were
still "bondmen." The Persian monarch was their absolute lord and master.

[Ezra 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 9:11</span></span>

Saying - The words which follow in this verse are not quoted from any
previous book of Scripture, but merely give the general sense of
numerous passages. Compare the marginal references.

[Ezra 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 9:13</span></span>

Deliverance - Or, "remnant," as in [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md).

[Ezra 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 9:15</span></span>

Some take "righteous" to mean here "kind" or "merciful." Others give it
the more usual sense of "just," and understand the full meaning of the
passage to be, "Thou art righteous, and hast punished us, because of our
sin, the contraction of forbidden marriages, so that we are a mere
remnant of what was once a great people."
