### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 3:3</span></span>

Chileab - In the duplicate passage (see the margin.) David's second son
is called Daniel (God is my judge), a name given to him in commemoration
of the death of Nabal [Sa1 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039.md).
Chileab seems to be made up of the three first letters of the following
Hebrew word, through an error of the transcriber, and intended to be
erased.

Talmai king of Geshur - Talmai was the name of one of the sons of Anak
at Hebron [Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md); this Talmai was
perhaps of the same race.

Geshur - Where he reigned was in Bashan, and we know from [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md), that Og, king of Bashan, was of
the "remnant of the giants." See [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md) note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 3:4</span></span>

Adonijah - The same who, when David was dying, aspired to the crown, and
was put to death by Solomon.

Shephatiah - "God is judge." This is the same name as Jehoshaphat, only
with the two elements composing it placed in inverted order. Nothing
more is known of him or of his brother Ithream.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 3:6</span></span>

Render, "And it came to pass, while the war between the house of Saul
and the house of David lasted, that Abner assisted the house of Saul."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 3:7</span></span>

Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah - For the sequel of her history, see the
marginal reference. Aiah, was an Edomite, or rather Horite name [Gen
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 3:8</span></span>

The words against Judah are very obscure. If the text be correct, the
words would seem to be Ish-bosheth's, who in his anger had charged Abner
with being a vile partisan of Judah: Abner retorts, "Am I (as you say) a
dog's head which belongeth to Judah, or on Judah's side! This day I show
you kindness, etc., and this day thou chargest me with a fault, etc."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 3:12</span></span>

Whose is the land? - Meaning, Is not the land thine by God's promise?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 3:13</span></span>

David's motive in requiring the restitution of Michal was partly his
affection for her, and his memory of her love for him; partly the wish
to wipe out the affront put upon him in taking away his wife, by
obtaining her return; and partly, also, a politic consideration of the
effect on Saul's partisans of a daughter of Saul being David's queen.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 3:14</span></span>

Sent messengers to Ish-bosheth - Not to Abner, for the league between
David and Abner was a profound secret, but to Ish-bosheth who, David
knew, must act, feeble as he was, at Abner's dictation. Abner's first
act of overt allegiance to David was thus done at Ish-bosheth's bidding;
and the effect of the humiliation laid upon Ish-bosheth in exposing his
weakness to his own subjects, and so shaking their allegiance to him,
was such that Abner needed to use no more disguise.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 3:16</span></span>

Bahurim - Best known as the residence of Shimei, and as the place where
Jonathan and Ahimaaz were concealed in a well on the occasion of David's
flight from Absalom [Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005.md); [Sa2
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#018.md). It seems to have been situated
in the southern border of the tribe of Benjamin, and on the route from
Jerusalem to the Jordan fords, since Phaltiel came from Mahanaim [Sa2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 3:17</span></span>

Ye sought for David ... - Compare [Sa1
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#005.md). It was only by Abner's great
influence that the elders of Israel had been restrained hitherto from
declaring for David, and this accounts for Ish-bosheth's helpless
submission to his uncle's dictation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 3:20</span></span>

Twenty men - These were doubtless his official suite as Ish-bosheth's
envoy to conduct Michal to David, but privy and consenting to his
intrigue with David. It is remarkable that not a word should be said
about the meeting of David and Michal.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 3:21</span></span>

Abner repeats the offer [Sa2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#012.md); and
the condition of Michal's return [Sa2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#013.md) being now fulfilled, David
accepts it, and the league between them was solemnly ratified at David's
board, amidst the rites of hospitality.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 3:24</span></span>

Joab saw that if Abner was reconciled to David, his own post as second
in the state would be forfeited; and then with characteristic
unscrupulosity he proceeded to take Abner's life.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 3:26</span></span>

The well Sirah - Nowhere else mentioned; according to Josephus, about
two and a half miles from Hebron.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 3:29</span></span>

The curse of David proves that Joab was not justified as blood-revenger
or Goel [Sa2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027.md) in taking away
Abner's life.

That leaneth on a staff - Rather, a crutch. The phrase denotes one lame
or infirm. For similar instances of hereditary disease and poverty as a
punishment of great sin, see [Sa1
2:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031.md), [Sa1
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036.md); [Kg2
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md); [Joh
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 3:33</span></span>

Lamented - i. e. composed and sang the funeral dirge which follows
(compare [Sa2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#017).md).

Died Abner ... - i. e. The great and noble and valiant Abner had died as
ignobly and as helplessly as the meanest churl!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa2 3:34</span></span>

Thy hands were not bound ... - This thought prepares the way for the
solution; Abner had been treacherously murdered by wicked men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa2 3:35</span></span>

To eat meat ... - Fasting was a sign of the deepest mourning [Sa2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#012.md). The fast lasted until the sun
was set.
