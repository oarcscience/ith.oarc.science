Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Judges Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#001.md)

[Judges 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 4:2</span></span>

See [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md) note. Since the events
there narrated, Hazor must have been rebuilt, and have resumed its
position as the metropolis of the northern Canaanites; the other cities
must also have resumed their independence, and restored the fallen
dynasties.

Harosheth (identified by Conder with El Harathlyeh, see [Jdg
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006).md) is marked by the addition of the
Gentiles, as in Galilee of the nations [Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md); [Isa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md). The name Harosheth signifies
workmanship, cutting and carving, whether in stone or wood [Exo
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#005.md), and hence, might be applied to
the place where such works are carried on. It has been conjectured that
this being a great timber district, rich in cedars and fir-trees, and
near Great Zidon [Jos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md), Jabin kept
a large number of oppressed Israelites at work in hewing wood, and
preparing it at Harosheth for transport to Zidon; and that these
woodcutters, armed with axes and hatchets, formed the soldiers of
Barak's army.

[Judges 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 4:3</span></span>

Oppressed - The same word is used [Exo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#009.md) of the oppression of Israel by the
Egyptians. If they were put to task-work in hewing timber, their
condition was very like that of their ancestors making bricks.

[Judges 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 4:4</span></span>

Deborah, a prophetess - Her name, meaning a bee, is the same as that of
Rebekah's nurse (marginal reference). The reason of her preeminence is
added. She was "a woman, a prophetess," like Miriam [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); Huldah [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md), etc. In [Jdg
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md), [Jdg
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md),[Jdg
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014.md), we have examples of her
prophetic powers, and in Judg. 5 a noble specimen of prophetic song.
Though the other Judges are not called prophets, yet they all seem to
have had direct communications from God, either of knowledge or power,
or both (compare [Jdg 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010) note.md).

[Judges 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 4:5</span></span>

She dwelt - Rather, "she sat," namely, to judge the people [Jdg
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md), but not in the usual place, "the
gate" [Rut 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md); [Pro
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022.md). It suited her character, and
the wild unsafe times better, that she should sit under a palm-tree in
the secure heights of Mount Ephraim, between Ramah and Bethel ([Jdg
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033) note.md). This verse shows that the
Judges exercised the civil as well as military functions of rulers [Sa1
7:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015.md).

[Judges 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 4:6</span></span>

The name Barak signifies lightning, an appropriate name for a warrior.
It is found also as Barca or Barcas, among Punic proper names. Compare
[Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md). On Kedesh-Naphtali see the
marginal reference.

Deborah speaks of God as Yahweh the God of Israel, because she speaks,
as it were, in the presence of the pagan enemies of Israel, and to
remind the Israelites, in the day of their distress, that He was ready
to perform the mercy promised to their fathers, and to remember His holy
covenant. This title, too, would recall to their memories in an instant
all His past acts in Egypt, at the Red Sea, in the wilderness, and in
the conquest of Canaan.

The object of "drawing (toward Mount Tabor" rather, spreading out,
compare [Jdg 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#037).md) was to effect a
junction of the northern tribes with the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin,
who were separated from them by the plain of Esdraelon, where Sisera's
chariots would naturally congregate and be most effective. Mount Tabor
rises from the plain of Esdraelon, about 1,865 ft. above the sea, and
its broad top of nearly a mile in circumference afforded a strong
position, out of reach of Sisera's chariots. If El Harathiyeh be
Harosheth, Sisera must have marched from the west. Harathiyeh is a
height in the range which separates Esdraelon from the plains of Acre,
under which the Kishon breaks through in its course to the sea.

[Judges 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 4:7</span></span>

The brook or stream Kishon (Nahr Mukutta), so called from its winding
course, caused by the dead level of the plain of Esdraelon through which
it flows, rises, in respect to one of its sources or feeders, in Mount
Tabor, and flows nearly due west through the plain, under Mount Carmel,
and into the Bay of Acre. In the early or eastern part of its course,
before it is recruited by the springs on Carmel, it is nothing but a
torrent, often dry, but liable to swell very suddenly and dangerously,
and to overflow its banks in early spring, after rain or the melting of
snow. The ground on the banks of the Kishon near Megiddo (Mujedd'a, see
[Jos 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021) note.md) becomes an impassable
morass under the same circumstances, and would be particularly dangerous
to a large number of chariots.

[Judges 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 4:8</span></span>

Barak, like Gideon [Jdg 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015.md), [Jdg
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036.md), [Jdg
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#040.md), and Abraham [Gen
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); [Gen
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md), and Moses [Exo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md), [Exo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013.md), and Peter [Mat
14:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#030.md), exhibited some weakness of
faith at first. But this only makes his example more profitable for our
encouragement, though he himself suffered some lost by his weakness [Jdg
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md).

[Judges 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 4:9</span></span>

Mark the unhesitating faith and courage of Deborah, and the rebuke to
Barak's timidity, "the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman"
(Jael, [Jdg 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#022).md). For a similar use
of a weak instrument, that the excellency of the power might be of God,
compare the history of Gideon and his 300, David and his sling, Shamgar
and his ox-goad, Samson and the jawbone of the ass. (See [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md), [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)..md) Barak would probably think the
woman must be Deborah. The prophecy was only explained by its
fulfillment. Her presence as a prophetess would give a divine sanction
to Barak's attempt to raise the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali. To Barak
himself it would be a pledge of her truth and sincerity. She probably
commissioned some chief to raise the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and
Manasseh ([Jdg 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md), compare [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002).md), while she went with Barak and
mustered Zebulun, Naphtali, and Issachar.

[Judges 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 4:10</span></span>

Rather, "and ten thousand men went up (to Tabor) at his feet;" i. e. as
his followers ("after him," [Jdg
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014).md).

[Judges 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 4:11</span></span>

Read, "Heber the Kenitc had severed himself from the Kenites which were
of the children of Hobab," etc., "unto the oak (or terebinth tree) in
Zaanaim" (or Bitzaanaim, which Conder identifies with Bessum, twelve
miles southeast of Tabor, and near Kedesh on the Sea of Galilee). This
migration of Heber the Kenite, with a portion of his tribe, from the
south of Judah to the north of Naphtali, perhaps caused by Philistine
oppression, had clearly taken place recently. It is mentioned here to
account for the subsequent narrative, but possibly also because the news
of the great muster of the Israelites at Kedesh had been carried to
Sisera by some of the tribe [Jdg 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#012.md),
whose tents we are here informed were in the immediate neighborhood of
Kedesh.

[Judges 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 4:15</span></span>

Lighted down off his chariot - Probably his chariot stuck in the morass
(see the note at [Jdg 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#007).md); or he
might leave his chariot in order to mislead his pursuers, and in hope of
gaining a place of safety while they were following the track of the
chariot-wheels and the bulk of the host.

[Judges 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 4:16</span></span>

What with the overflowing of the Kishon [Jdg
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md), by which numbers were drowned,
and the panic which had seized the defeated army, and made them an easy
prey to the sword of the pursuing Israelites, Sisera's whole force was
cut to pieces and broken up.

[Judges 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 4:17</span></span>

Sisera went, not to Heber's tent, but to Joel's, as more secure from
pursuit. Women occupied a separate tent. [Gen
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006.md), [Gen
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md); [Gen
24:67](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#067.md).

[Judges 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 4:20</span></span>

Stand in the door ... - The characteristic duplicity of the Oriental
character, both in Sisera and Joel, is very forcibly depicted in this
narrative. It is only by the light of the Gospel that the law of truth
is fully revealed.

[Judges 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 4:21</span></span>

If we can overlook the treachery and violence which belonged to the
morals of the age and country, and bear in mind Jael's ardent sympathies
with the oppressed people of God, her faith in the right of Israel to
possess the land in which they were now slaves, her zeal for the glory
of Yahweh as against the gods of Canaan, and the heroic courage and
firmness with which she executed her deadly purpose, we shall be ready
to yield to her the praise which is her due. See [Jdg
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030.md) note.

[Judges 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 4:24</span></span>

See the margin. The meaning is, that Barak's great victory was the
beginning of a successful resistance to Jabin, by which the Israelites
recovered their independence, and finally broke the Canaanite power.
Accordingly, we hear no more of Canaanite domination in the Book of
Judges.
