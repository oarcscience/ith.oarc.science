### [Ezekiel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 8:0</span></span>

The prophecies contained in these chapters Ezek. 8-19 fall within eleven
months (compare [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md) with [Eze
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001).md). Although they were not all
delivered on the same day, they may be regarded as a whole. They contain
in fact a review of the condition of the people of Judah, including
those who were still in the holy land, and those who were with the
prophet exiles in Chaldaea. This is first represented by a vision Ezek.
8-11 in which the seer is transported in spirit to the Temple of
Jerusalem; and next - the prophet having again taken his stand as a man
among men - by symbolic act, parables, figures, etc., addresses his
fellow-exiles.

[Ezekiel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 8:1</span></span>

The elders of Judah - The prophet's fellow-exiles are no longer
unwilling to hear him [Eze 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md).
They sat as mourners. The message here is not as in [Eze
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002.md), but distinctly to Judah, that
portion of the people whose exile Ezekiel shared.

[Ezekiel 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 8:2</span></span>

The appearance of fire - In margin reference, seen as the appearance of
a man enthroned upon the cherubim. Here He stands apart from the throne
revealing Himself to His servant. Compare [Dan
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025.md) note.

Amber - See the margin reference note.

[Ezekiel 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 8:3</span></span>

In the visions of God - Ezekiel was not transported "in the body," but
rapt "in spirit," while he still sat amidst the elders of Judah.

The inner gate - Or, the gate of the inner court. This gate, leading
from the outer to the inner court (the court of the priests), is called
[Eze 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md) "the gate of the altar,"
because it was from this side that the priests approached the brass
altar. The prophet is on the "outside" of this gate, so that the "image
of jealousy" was set up in the outer or people's court over against the
northern entrance to the priest's court. This image was the image of a
false god provoking Yahweh to "jealousy" [Deu
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016.md), [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md); [Kg1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#022.md). It may be doubted whether the
scenes described in this chapter are intended to represent what actually
occurred. They may be ideal pictures to indicate the idolatrous
corruption of priests and people. And this is in accordance with the
symbolic character of the number "four;" the four idolatries
representing the idolatries in all the four quarters of the world. The
false gods of pagandom are brought into the temple in order that they
may be detected and exposed by being brought face to face with the God
of revelation. Still history proves that the ideal picture was supported
by actual facts which had occurred and were occurring.

[Ezekiel 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 8:4</span></span>

The glory of the Lord having departed from His seat between the
cherubims in the holy of holies (see [Eze
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003).md) rests in the threshold of the
temple, to execute vengeance before it quits the house altogether [Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md). The "there" in the inner court,
which was "full of the brightness of the Lord'S glory" [Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md), and at the gate of which Ezekiel
stands.

[Ezekiel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 8:7</span></span>

The door of the court - The seer is brought to another spot. In
Ezekiel's time there were various buildings on the space around the
inner court which formed a court or courts, not improbably enclosed by a
wall. The idolatries here were viewed as taking place in secret, and it
is more in accordance with the temple arrangements to suppose that such
chambers as would give room for those rites should belong to the outer
than to the inner court. The seer is now outside the wall of the outer
court, by the door which leads from it out of the temple-boundary. By
breaking through the wall he enters into a chamber which stands in the
outer court against the wall near the gate.

[Ezekiel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 8:10</span></span>

There is clearly a reference to the idolatry of Egypt. Many subterranean
chambers in rocks upon the shores of the Nile exhibit ornamentation and
hieroglyphical characters, some of which are representative of the
objects of idolatrous worship. Such chambers fitted them for the scene
of the ideal picture by which Ezekiel represented Egyptian idolatry. The
Egyptian worship of animals is well known.

[Ezekiel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 8:11</span></span>

Seventy men - Compare [Exo 24:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md).
The vision may have pointed to the contrast between the times. The
number "seven" is symbolic of the covenant between Yahweh and His
people, and so the "seventy" men exhibit forcibly the breach of the
covenant. It is a figure of the covert idolatry of the whole people.

[Ezekiel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 8:12</span></span>

In the dark - Hidden in the secret places which the seer dug through the
wall to discover.

Chambers of his imagery - i. e., chambers painted with images.

[Ezekiel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 8:14</span></span>

The seer is now brought back to the same gate as in [Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md).

It is not certain that this verse refers to any special act of
Tammuz-worship. The month in which the vision was seen, the sixth month
(September), was not the month of the Tammuz-rites. But that such rites
had been performed in Jerusalem there can be little doubt. Women are
mentioned as employed in the service of idols in [Jer
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018.md). There is some reason for
believing that the weeping of women for Tammuz passed into Syria and
Palestine from Babylonia, Tammuz being identified with Duv-zi, whose
loss was lamented by the goddess Istar. The festival was identical with
the Greek "Adoniacs." The worship of Adonis had its headquarters at
Byblos, where at certain periods of the year the stream, becoming
stained by mountain floods, was popularly said to be red with the blood
of Adonis. From Byblos it spread widely over the east and was thence
carried to Greece. The contact of Zedekiah with pagan nations [Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md) may very well have led to the
introduction of an idolatry which at this time was especially popular
among the eastern nations.

This solemnity was of a twofold character, first, that of mourning, in
which the death of Adonis was bewailed with extravagant sorrow; and
then, after a few days, the mourning gave place to wild rejoicings for
his restoration to life. This was a revival of nature-worship under
another form - the death of Adonis symbolized the suspension of the
productive powers of nature, which were in due time revived.
Accordingly, the time of this festival was the summer solstice, when in
the east nature seems to wither and die under the scorching heat of the
sun, to burst forth again into life at the due season. At the same time
there was a connection between this and the sun-worship, in that the
decline of the sun and the decline of nature might be alike represented
by the death of Adonis. The excitement attendant upon these
extravagances of alternate wailing and exultation were in complete
accordance with the character of nature-worship, which for this reason
was so popular in the east, especially with women, and led by inevitable
consequence to unbridled license and excess. Such was in Ezekiel's day
one of the most detestable forms of idolatry.

[Ezekiel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 8:16</span></span>

The inner court - The court of the priests.

About five and twenty men - Rather, as it were five etc. This was the
number of the heads of the 24 courses (shifts) with the high priest
presiding over them. These then were the representatives of the priests,
as the seventy were of the people. In the temple the seat of the Divine
Majesty was at the west, perhaps appointed for this very purpose, to
guard against the idolatrous adoration of the rising sun. Therefore the
idolatrous priests must in worshipping the false sun-god turn their
backs upon the True. The worship of the heavenly bodies was one of the
earliest forms of idolatry [Job
31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md) and was expressly forbidden
in the Law [Deu 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md). In its earliest
form, it was conducted without the intervention of images, the adoration
being addressed to the heavenly bodies themselves: this form, continued
among the Persians, seems to have been introduced afresh into Jerusalem
at the time of Ezekiel. Compare, also, [Kg2
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md). The images (compare [Eze
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md), [Eze
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006).md) were probably columns set up in
honor of the sun, not images in human form. This simpler mode of
sunworship was soon changed. The sun, or the god supposed to preside
over it, was represented as a person, whose image was set up and adored.

[Ezekiel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 8:17</span></span>

"Violence" represents sin against man, "abominations" sins against God.
These went hand in hand in Jerusalem.

And have returned - After the reformation effected for a time by
Josiah's zeal, they have gone back to their old state.

They put the branch to their nose - An allusion to a then familiar
practice, of which we find no clear traces elsewhere. Ezekiel is
describing the attitude usual in such devotions, the branch held before
the mouth, but wishing to represent it in contemptuous and derogatory
terms, he substitutes the word "nose" for "mouth."
