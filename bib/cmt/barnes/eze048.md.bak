### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 48:1</span></span>

The distribution of the holy land is seen in detail throughout Ezek. 48.
The order of the original occupation by the tribes under Joshua is
partly, but only partly, followed. It is a new order of things - and its
ideal character is evinced as elsewhere, by exact and equal
measurements. From north to south seven tribes succeed each other. Then
comes a portion, separated as an offering to the Lord, subdivided into:

\(1\) a northern portion for the Levites,

\(2\) a central portion for the priests and the temple,

\(3\) a southern portion for the city and those who serve it.

These three form a square, which does not occupy the whole breadth of
the land, but is flanked on either side, east and west, by portions
assigned to the prince. Then follow, south of the city, five portions
for the five remaining tribes - similar to those assigned to the seven.
Thus the Levites, the temple, and city, are guarded by Judah and
Benjamin, the two tribes who had throughout preserved their allegiance
to the true sovereignty of Yahweh, and thus the plan expresses the
presence of Yahweh among His people, summed up in the name of the city,
with which Ezekiel's prophecy closes, the Lord is there.

The breadth of the portions is not given, but since the exact breadth of
the oblation was about 30 geog. miles ([Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001) note.md), and seven tribes were
between the entrance of Hamath and the oblation, the "breadth of one
portion" was about 17 geog. miles. The breadth of the Levites' portion
and of the priests' portion was in each case about 15 geog. miles.
Ain-el-Weibeh, if Kadesh, ( (?),see [Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026).md) would be very nearly the
southern border.

The general lines of existing features are followed with considerable
fidelity, but accommodation is made to give the required symbolic
expression. "Dan" had originally an allotment west of Benjamin, but
having colonized and given its name to Laish in the north, was regarded
as the most northern occupant of Canaan [Jdg
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029.md). "Zebulun and Issachar" are
removed to the south to make room for the second half of "Manasseh"
brought over from the east of Jordan. "Reuben," brought over from the
east, is placed between "Ephraim and Judah." "Benjamin" comes
immediately south of the city, and "Gad" is brought over from the east
to the extreme south.

See map, The Land of Israel

[Ezekiel 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 48:8</span></span>

"Length" is throughout measured from west to east, as breadth is from
north to south.

The offering [Eze 48:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009.md), or,
"oblation," here includes all the land given to priests, Levites, city,
and prince; the different parts being distinguished. All these together
are to extend from west to east in the same way as the portions of the
other tribes, the imaginary Jordan being the eastern boundary of all.

[Ezekiel 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 48:10</span></span>

Toward the north ... toward the east ... - i. e., the measurements are
"along the north and east sides," etc.

[Ezekiel 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 48:15</span></span>

The five thousand ... - The remainder of the square of 25,000 reeds from
north to south.

Profane - For common use, as distinguished from that which is holy unto
the Lord.

[Ezekiel 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 48:17</span></span>

The city being 4500 reeds square, 250 reeds are marked off north, south,
east, west from the city land.

[Ezekiel 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 48:18</span></span>

[Eze 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018.md)

Then, that serve - i. e., the cultivators or farmers.

[Eze 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#019.md)

Of old the city belonged to Benjamin and Judah, and its inhabitants were
mainly from these tribes. Now all the tribes are to have equal part in
it, and avoid jealousies (compare [Sa2
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#043).md).

[Ezekiel 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 48:20</span></span>

The holy ... with ... - Or, "a fourth part as the holy oblation, for"
etc.

[Ezekiel 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 48:21</span></span>

Or, "And the residue shall be for the prince - on the one side and on
the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city
over against the 25,000 of the oblation toward the east border, and
westward over against the 25,000 toward the west border, over against
the portions (of Judah and Benjamin, between which the oblation was
included), shall be "for the prince; and it shall be that the holy
oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof."
This exactly describes the position of the prince's allotments on the
borders of the "oblations."

[Ezekiel 48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 48:30</span></span>

The goings out of the city - The gates described in [Eze
48:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031). "Measures" (reeds.md) concern the
sides. Divide the verses thus: [Eze
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030.md). "And these are the goings out
of the city. [Eze 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031.md). On the north
side 4500 measures: and the gates of the city after the names of the
tribes of Israel: three gates northward etc."

[Ezekiel 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 48:35</span></span>

The circuit of the city walls, a square of 4500 reeds, was 18,000 reeds,
not quite 37 English miles. The circuit of Jerusalem in the time of
Josephus was reckoned by him to be about four miles.

The name ... - The manner of expressing a spiritual meaning by giving a
name to a city, a people, or the like, is familiar to the prophets (see
[Eze 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015) note.md). Jerome explains it:
"The name of the city shall be no longer Jerusalem ("the vision of
peace"), but Adonai-shama ("the Lord is there") (rather,
Jehovah-shammah, "Jehovah is there"), because Yahweh will never again
withdraw from it, as He once withdrew, but will hold it as His
everlasting possession." The visible presence of God's glory, once
represented in the tabernacle and in the temple, had departed, and
should not return in the same form. Yet Ezekiel in "visions of God" sees
a temple reconstructed to receive the glory of the divine presence, a
prophetic vision fulfilled in Emmanuel ("God with us"), who tabernacled
among men [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). Compare [Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md); [Rev
21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md).
