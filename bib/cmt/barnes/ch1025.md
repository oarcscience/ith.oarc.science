### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

The captains of the host - Rather, "the princes" of [Ch1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002); [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006).

[1 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 25:2</span></span>

Under the hands of Asaph ... - That is to say, "under the direction of
Asaph" - who himself "prophesied," or performed the sacred services,
"under the direction of the king."

[1 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 25:5</span></span>

To lift up the horn - Some take this literally, and consider that Heman
and his sons played on the born in the musical services; but there is no
other evidence that the horn was so employed. Perhaps the most probable
explanation is that it has been transferred from the next clause, where
(as here) it followed the word "God," with the sense that "God, to exalt
Heman's horn (or, increase his dignity), gave him fourteen sons and
three daughters."

[1 Chronicles 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 25:7</span></span>

With their brethren - i. e., "with others of the tribe of Levi." Each
son of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, was at the head of a band of twelve
skilled musicians, consisting partly of his own sons, partly of Levites
belonging to other families 1 Chr. 25:9-31. The 24 band-leaders,
together with their bands, formed a body of 288 persons (24 x 12 =288)
Besides these, we hear of there being above 3,700 singers, who were
probably divided, like the trained musicians, into 24 courses, which
must have contained about 155 each [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005).

[1 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 25:8</span></span>

As well the small as the great - Compare [Ch1
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031). The lot was not applied
indiscriminately to all the 24 courses, but was only used to settle
which course of Asaph, which of Jeduthun, and which of Heman, should on
each occasion be taken. Asaph was given the precedence over his
brethren, and his four courses were assigned the first, and then each
alternate place. Jeduthun took rank next, and received alternate places,
first with Asaph, and then with Heman, until his courses were exhausted.
After this, all the later places fell necessarily to Heman, whose
courses continue without interruption from the 15th.
