### [Deuteronomy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 2:1</span></span>

[Deu 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001.md) seems to refer in general
terms to the long years of wandering, the details of which were not for
Moses' present purpose. The command of [Deu
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#002.md) relates to their journey from
Kadesh to Mount Hor [Num 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md); [Num
33:37](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#037.md), and directs their march around
to the southern extremity of Mount Seir, so as to "compass the land of
Edom" [Jdg 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#018.md); [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md), and so northward toward the
Arnon, i. e., "by the way of the wilderness of Moab," [Deu
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008.md). This circuitous path was followed
because of the refusal of the Edomites to allow the people to pass
through their territory.

[Deuteronomy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 2:4</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Though the Edomites resisted the passage
through the midst of their land, they did not, and probably could not,
oppose the "passing through the coast" or along their eastern frontier.

[Deuteronomy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 2:5</span></span>

I have given mount Seir to Esau - Though the descendants of Esau were
conquered by David [Sa2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md), yet they
were not dispossessed of their land, and in the reign of Jehoshaphat
they regained their independence [Kg2
8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 2:8</span></span>

Elath (Akaba) is at the northern extremity of the eastern arm of the Red
Sea, and gives to that arm the name of the Elanitic Gulf. The name means
"trees;" and is still justified by the grove of palm-trees at Akaba.

[Deuteronomy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 2:9</span></span>

The Moabites and the Ammonites [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md) being descended from Lot, the
nephew of Abraham [Gen 19:30-38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030.md), were,
like the Edomites, kinsmen of the Israelites.

[Deuteronomy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 2:10</span></span>

For the Emims, Horims, and Anakims, see the marginal references. These
verses are either parenthetical or the insertion of a later hand.

[Deuteronomy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 2:13</span></span>

The words, "said I," are not in the Hebrew. The words "rise up, and get
you over the brook Zered" ([Num 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#012.md)
note) connect themselves with [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), and form the conclusion of what
God said to Moses.

[Deuteronomy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 2:20</span></span>

These verses, like [Deu 2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md), are
in all likelihood an addition made by a later reviser.

[Deu 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md)

Zamzummims - A giant race usually identified with the Zuzims of [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md).

[Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md)

The Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah - Read (Gaza, of which
Azzah is the Hebrew form. "Hazerim" is not strictly a proper name, but
means "villages," or "enclosures," probably such as are still common in
the East. The Avims are no doubt identical with the Avites of [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md), and were doubtless a scattered
remnant of a people conquered by the Caphtorim ([Gen
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014) note.md) and living in their
"enclosures" in the neighborhood of Gerar. The word, which means
"ruins," seems itself expressive of their fallen state.

[Deuteronomy 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 2:26</span></span>

Kedemoth - literally, "Easternmost parts;" the name of a town afterward
assigned to the Reubenites, and given out of that tribe to the Levites.
Compare [Jos 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018.md); [Ch1
6:79](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#079.md).

[Deuteronomy 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 2:34</span></span>

Utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every
city - Render, laid under ban (compare [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028) note.md) every inhabited city, both
women and children: these last words being added by way of fuller
explanation.

[Deuteronomy 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 2:36</span></span>

Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon - Aroer stood on the
north bank of the river, and was assigned [Jos
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016.md) to the tribe of Reuben, of which
it formed the most southerly city. The valley of the Arnon is here deep,
and the descent to it abrupt. In Roman times it was spanned by a
viaduct, the ruins of which still remain, and which was probably built
on the lines of the original structure of Mesha [Kg2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md). Aroer here must not be confounded
with "Aroer, which is before Rabbah" [Jos
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md). This latter place was "built,"
"i. e." rebuilt, by the Gadites [Num
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md); it belonged to that tribe, and
was consequently far to the north of the Arnon. A third Aroer in the
tribe of Judah is mentioned in [Sa1
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028.md).

"The city that is by the river," literally, "in the midst of the river"
(compare [Jos 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md), [Jos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016).md) is Ar Moab (compare [Num
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#015) note.md).
