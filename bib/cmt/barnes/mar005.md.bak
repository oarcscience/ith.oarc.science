### [Mark Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

[Mark 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 5:1</span></span>

See this account of the demoniacs fully explained in the notes at [Mat
8:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md).

[Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md)

He had been often bound with fetters and chains - Efforts had been made
to confine him, but his great strength - his strength increased by his
malady - had prevented it. There often appears to be a great increase of
strength produced by insanity, and what is here stated in regard to this
maniac often occurs in Palestine and elsewhere now. Dr. Thomson ("The
Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 213) says respecting this case: "There
are some very similar at the present day - furious and dangerous
maniacs, who wander about the mountains, and sleep in tombs and caves.
In their worst paroxysms they are quite unmanageable and prodigiously
strong." [Luk 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md) says of him that
"he were no clothes," or that he was naked, which is also implied in the
account in Mark, who tells us that after he was healed he was found
"clothed and in his right mind," [Mar
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015.md). This is often a striking
characteristic of insanity. Dr. Pritchard (on "Insanity," p. 26) quotes
from an Italian physician's description of raving madness or mania: "A
striking and characteristic circumstance is the propensity to go quite
naked. The patient tears his clothes to tatters." So Dr. Thomson ("The
Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 213) says: "It is one of the most common
traits in this madness that the victims refuse to wear clothes. I have
often seen them absolutely naked in the crowded streets of Beirut and
Sidon. There are also cases in which they run wildly about the country
and frighten the whole neighborhood. These poor wretches are held in the
greatest reverence by Muslims, who, through some monstrous perversion of
ideas, believe them to be inspired and peculiarly holy."

[Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005.md)

Cutting himself with stones - These are all marks of a madman - a man
bereft of reason, a wretched outcast, strong and dangerous. The inspired
penman says that this madness was caused by an unclean spirit, or by his
being under the influence of a devil. That this account is not
irrational, see the notes at [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

[Mar 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#006.md)

Worshipped him - Bowed down before him; rendered him homage. This was an
acknowledgment of his power, and of his control over fallen spirits.

[Mar 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009.md)

My name is Legion - See the notes at [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md).

[Mar 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015.md)

Sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind - There could be no doubt of
the reality of this miracle. The man had been well known. He had long
dwelt among the tombs, an object of terror and alarm. To see him all at
once peaceful, calm, and rational, was proof that it was the power of
God only that had done it.

They were afraid - They were awed, as in the presence of God. The word
does not mean here that they feared that any evil would happen to them,
but that they were affected with awe; they felt that God was there; they
were struck with astonishment at what Jesus had done.

[Mar 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019.md)

Jesus suffered him not - Various reasons have been conjectured why Jesus
did not suffer this man to go with him. It might have been that he
wished to leave him among the people as a conclusive evidence of his
power to work miracles. Or it might have been that the man feared that
if Jesus left him the devils would return, and that Jesus told him to
remain to show to him that the cure was complete, and that he had power
over the devils when absent as well as when present. But the probable
reason is, that he desired to restore him to his family and friends.
Jesus was unwilling to delay the joy of his friends, and to prolong
their anxiety by suffering him to remain away from them.

[Mar 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#020.md)

In Decapolis - See the notes at [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md).

How great things ... - This was the natural expression of right feeling
at being cured of such a calamity. So the desire of sinners freed from
sin is to honor Jesus, and to invite the world to participate in the
same salvation, and to join them in doing honor to the Son of God.
Compare [Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md).

[Mark 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 5:22</span></span>

See the account of the raising of Jairus' daughter, and the healing of
the woman with an issue of blood, fully explained in the notes at [Mat
9:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md).

[Mar 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#023.md)

Lieth at the point of death - Is dying; in the last agonies.

[Mar 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#026.md)

Had suffered many things - Had resorted to many things painful, by the
direction of the physicians, in order to be healed.

[Mar 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#027.md)

Came in the press behind - In the crowd that pressed upon him. This was
done to avoid being noticed. It was an act of faith. She was full of
confidence that Jesus was able to heal, but she trembled on account of
her conscious unworthiness, thus illustrating the humility and
confidence of a sinner coming to God for pardon and life.

[Mar 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#030.md)

Virtue had gone out of him - Power to heal. The word in the original
means power.

Who touched my clothes? - This be said, not to obtain information, for
he had healed her, and must have known on whom the blessing was
conferred; but he did it that the woman might herself make a confession
of the whole matter, so that the power of her faith and the greatness of
the miracle might be manifested to the praise of God.

[Mar 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034.md)

Daughter - A word of kindness, tending to inspire confidence and to
dissipate her fears.

Be whole - That is, continue to be whole, for she was already cured.

Of thy plague - Thy disease; literally, thy "scourge." So a word from
Jesus heals the moral malady of the sinner.

[Mar 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035.md), [Mar
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036.md)

Why troublest thou ... - It seems that the people had not yet confidence
that Jesus could raise the dead. He had not yet done it; and as the
child was now dead, and as they supposed that his power over her was at
an end, they wished no farther to trouble him. Jesus kindly set the
fears of the ruler at rest, and assured him that he had equal power over
the dead and the living, and could as easily raise those who had expired
as those who were expiring.

[Mar 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038.md)

The tumult - The confusion and weeping of the assembled people.

Wailed - Making inarticulate, mournful sounds; howling for the dead.

[Mar 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#039.md)

This ado - This tumult, this bustle or confusion.

And weep - Weep in this inordinate and improper manner. See the notes at
[Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md).

But sleepeth - See the notes at [Mat
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024.md).

[Mar 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041.md)

Talitha cumi - This is the language which our Saviour commonly spoke. It
is a mixture of Syriac and Chaldee, called Syro-Chaldaic. The proper
translation is given by the evangelist - "Damsel, arise."

[Mar 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#043.md)

Something should be given her to eat - "He had raised her by
extraordinary power, but he willed that she should be sustained by
ordinary means." He also in this gave full evidence that she was really
restored to life and health. The changes were great, sudden, and
certain. There could be no illusion. So, when the Saviour had risen, he
gave evidence of his own resurrection by eating with his disciples, [Joh
21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md).
