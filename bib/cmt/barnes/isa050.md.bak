### [Isaiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 50:0</span></span>

This chapter properly consists of two parts.

The first comprises the first three verses, and contains a statement of
the reasons why the Jews had been rejected and punished. They are to be
regarded as in exile in Babylon. It might be alleged by some of the
unbelieving among them, that the calamities which came upon them were
proof of caprice in God, or of want of faithfulness, or of power, and
not any proof that they were suffering under his righteous displeasure.
To meet these implied charges, and to show them the true cause of their
suffering, is the design of this portion of the chapter. In this, God
says:

1\. That their sufferings were not the result of mere will, or of
caprice, on his part, as a husband often puts away his wife without any
good reason [Isa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md).

2\. There was a reason for their rejection, and that reason was, their
sins. They had brought all these calamities Upon themselves and had, in
fact sold themselves.

3\. It was not for want of power on the part of God to save them. His
hand was not shortened, and he had abundantly shown that he had power to
defend his people [Isa 50:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md). He was
able to dry up the sea, and to make the rivers a desert, and he clothed
the heavens with blackness, and he was abundantly able, therefore, to
save his people.

II\. The second part of the chapter comprises the portion from [Isa
50:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md). This relates to a different
subject; and, in regard to it, there has been considerable variety of
interpretation. A speaker is introduced who claims to be eminently
qualified for file office to which he was called [Isa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); who has been amply endowed by
God for the embassage on which he is sent [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md); who meets with opposition, and
who yet receives it all with meekness [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); who puts his trust in God, and
confides in him alone [Isa 50:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md); and
who calls on all who fear the Lord to hear him [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md); and who threatens to inflict
punishment on all who do not listen to him [Isa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011.md). This portion of the chapter has
been referred, by different interpreters, to different individuals.
Grotius, Rosenmuller, and Gesenius, suppose that it refers to the
prophet himself. Doderlein, Dathe, Koppe, Augusti, and some others,
suppose that it refers either to the prophet himself, or to some other
one living in exile at the time of the captivity. Jerome says that this,
also, was the prevailing interpretation among the Jews in his time.
Paulus supposes that it is not the prophet who speaks, but the better
and more pious portion of the Jewish people. But the more common
interpretation is that which refers it to the Messiah. In favor of this
interpretation, the following considerations may be suggested:

1\. The prophet himself is not known to have been in the circumstances
here described [Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); nor is there
any evidence that this can be applied to him. Of any other prophet to
whom it would apply we have no knowledge, nor would there be any
propriety in so applying the language of Isaiah, if we did know of any
such one.

2\. The Messianic interpretation has almost universally prevailed in the
Christian church - an argument of value only as showing that when so
many agree in interpreting any writing, there is presumptive proof that
they have not mistaken its meaning.

3\. All the characteristics of the servant of God here referred to,
apply to the Redeemer, and are descriptive of him and of his work. All
that is said of his humiliation and meekness; of the opposition which he
encountered, and of his confidence in God, applies eminently to the Lord
Jesus, and to no other one.

4\. The closing part [Isa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011.md), where
the speaker threatens to inflict punishment on his foes, cannot be used
with reference to Isaiah or any other prophet, but has a striking
applicability to the Messiah.

5\. In [Luk 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032.md), the passage [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md) is applied by the Lord Jesus to
himself. He says that the prophecies in regard to him must be fulfilled,
and, among other things, says that the fact that he should be 'spitted
on,' should be a fulfillment of a prophecy - statement which has an
obvious and manifest reference to this passage in Isaiah.

The passage, if it refers to the Messiah, relates particularly to his
humiliation and sufferings, and accords with that in [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). It embraces the following
points:

1\. He was endowed for his work, and especially suited to comfort the
afflicted and weary [Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md).

2\. He was entirely obedient to God, and submitted to all his
arrangements with cheerfulness [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md).

3\. He submitted with meekness to all the injuries inflicted on him by
others - even to their deepest expressions of contempt [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md).

4\. He was sustained in these trials because he put his trust in God,
and believed that he could deliver him [Isa
50:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md).

5\. He calls upon all who feared God to put their trust in him, and stay
themselves upon their God - an address to the pious portion of the
nation [Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md).

6\. He warns those who were trusting to themselves, and who were seeking
their own welfare only, that he would himself inflict exemplary
punishment upon them, and that they should lie down in sorrow [Isa
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 50:1</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - To the Jews in Babylon, who were suffering under
his hand, and who might be disposed to complain that God had dealt with
them with as much caprice and cruelty as a man did with his wife, when
he gave her a writing of divorce, and put her away without any just
cause.

Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? - God here speaks of
himself as the husband of his people, as having married the church to
himself, denoting the tender affection which he had for his people. This
figure is frequently used in the Bible. Thus in [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md) : 'As the bridegroom rejoiceth
over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee;' 'For thy Maker is
thy husband' [Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); 'Turn, O
backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am married unto you' [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md). Thus in [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md), the church is called 'the bride,
the Lamb's wife.' Compare Ezek. 16: See Lowth on Hebrew poetry, Lec.
xxxi. The phrase, 'bill of divorcement.' refers to the writing or
instrument which a husband was by law obliged to give a wife when he
chose to put her away. This custom of divorce Moses found probably in
existence among the Jews, and also in surrounding nations, and as it was
difficult if not impossible at once to remove it, he permitted it on
account of the hardness of the hearts of the Jews ([Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md); compare [Mat
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008).md).

It originated probably from the erroneous views which then prevailed of
the nature of the marriage compact. It was extensively regarded as
substantially like any other compact, in which the wife became a
purchase from her father, and of course as she had been purchased, the
husband claimed the right of dismissing her when he pleased. Moses
nowhere defines the causes for which a man might put away his wife, but
left these to be judged of by the people themselves. But he regulated
the way in which it might be done. He ordained a law which was designed
to operate as a material check on the hasty feelings, the caprice, and
the passions of the husband. He designed that it should be with him, if
exercised, not a matter of mere excited feeling, but that he should take
time to deliberate upon it; and hence, he ordained that in all cases a
formal instrument of writing should be executed releasing the wife from
the marriage tie, and leaving her at liberty to pursue her own
inclinations in regard to future marriages [Deu
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#002.md).

It is evident that this would operate very materially in favor of the
wife, and in checking and restraining the excited passions of the
husband (see Jahn's Bib. Antiq. Section 160; Michaelis' Commentary on
the Laws of Moses, vol. i. pp. 450-478; ii. 127-40. Ed. Lond. 1814,
8vo.) In the passage before us, God says that he had not rejected his
people. He had not been governed by the caprice, sudden passion, or
cruelty which husbands often evinced. There was a just cause why he had
treated them as he had, and he did not regard them as the children of a
divorced wife. The phrase, 'your mother,' Here is used to denote the
ancestry from whom they were descended. They were not regarded as the
children of a disgraced mother.

Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you - Among the
Hebrews, a father had the right, by the law of Moses, if he was
oppressed with debt, to sell his children [Exo
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007.md); [Neh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005.md). In like manner, if a man had
stolen anything, and had nothing to make restitution, he might be sold
for the theft [Exo 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#003.md). If a man also
was poor and unable to pay his debts, he might be sold [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md); [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md); [Mat
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025.md). On the subject of slavery among
the Hebrews, and the Mosaic laws in regard to it, see Michaelis'
Commentary on the Laws of Moses, vol. ii. pp. 155, following In this
passage, God says that he had not been governed by any such motives in
his dealings with his people. He had not dealt with them as a poor
parent sometimes felt himself under a necessity of doing, when he sold
his children, or as a creditor did when a man was not able to pay him.
He had been governed by different motives, and he had punished them only
on account of their transgressions.

Ye have sold yourselves - That is, you have gone into captivity only on
account of your sins. It has been your own act, and you have thus become
bondmen to a foreign power only by your own choice.

Is your mother put away - Retaining the figure respecting divorce. The
nation has been rejected, and suffered to go into exile, only on account
of its transgressions.

[Isaiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 50:2</span></span>

Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? - That is, when I came to call
you to repentance, why was there no man of the nation to yield
obedience? The sense is, that they had not been punished without
warning. He had called them to repentance, but no one heard his voice.
The Chaldee renders this, 'Wherefore did I send my prophets, and they
did not turn? They prophesied, but they did not attend.'

When I called, was there none to answer? - None obeyed, or regarded my
voice. It was not, therefore, by his fault that they had been punished,
but it was because they did not listen to the messengers which he had
sent unto them.

Is my hand shortened at all? - The meaning of this is, that it was not
because God was unable to save, that they had been thus punished. The
hand, in the Scriptures, is an emblem of strength, as it is the
instrument by which we accomplish our purposes. To shorten the hand,
that is, to cut it off, is an emblem of diminishing, or destroying our
ability to execute any purpose (see [Isa
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001).md). So in [Num
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#023.md) : 'Is the Lord's hand waxed
short?'

That it cannot redeem? - That it cannot rescue or deliver you. The idea
is, that it was not because he was less able to save them than he had
been in former times, that they were sold into captivity, and sighed in
bondage.

Behold, at my rebuke - At my chiding - as a father rebukes a disobedient
child, or as a man would rebuke an excited multitude. Similar language
is used of the Saviour when he stilled the tempest on the sea of
Gennesareth: 'Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there
was a great calm' [Mat 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md). The
reference here is, undoubtedly, to the fact that God dried up the Red
Sea, or made a way for the children of Israel to pass through it. The
idea is, that he who had power to perform such a stupendous miracle as
that, had power also to deliver his people at any time, and that,
therefore, it was for no want of power in him that the Jews were
suffering in exile.

I make the rivers a wilderness - I dry up streams at pleasure, and have
power even to make the bed of rivers, and all the country watered by
them, a pathless, and an unfruitful desert.

Their fish stinketh - The waters leave them, and the fish die, and
putrify. It is not uncommon in the East for large streams and even
rivers thus to be dried up by the intense heat of the sun, and by being
lost in the sand. Thus the river Barrady which flows through the fertile
plain on which Damascus is situated, and which is divided into
innumerable streams and canals to water the city and the gardens
adjacent to it, after flowing to a short distance from the city is
wholly lost - partly absorbed in the sands, and partly dried up by the
intense rays of the sun (see Jones' 'Excursions to Jerusalem, Egypt,
etc. ') The idea here is, that it was God who had power to dry up those
streams, and that he who could do that, could save and vindicate his
people.

[Isaiah 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 50:3</span></span>

I clothe the heavens with blackness - With the dark clouds of a tempest
- perhaps with an allusion to the remarkable clouds and tempests that
encircled the brow of Sinai when he gave the law. Or possibly alluding
to the thick darkness which he brought over the land of Egypt ([Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021); Grotius.md). In the previous
verse, he had stated what he did on the earth, and referred to the
exhibitions of his great power there. He here refers to the exhibition
of his power in the sky; and the argument is, that he who had thus the
power to spread darkness over the face of the sky, had power also to
deliver his people.

I make sackcloth their covering - Alluding to the clouds. Sackcloth was
a coarse and dark cloth which was usually worn as an emblem of mourning
(see the note at [Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024).md). The same
image is used in [Rev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md) : 'And I
beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great
earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair.' To say,
therefore, that the heavens were clothed with sackcloth, is one of the
most striking and impressive figures which can be conceived.

[Isaiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 50:4</span></span>

The Lord God hath given me - This verse commences a new subject, and the
deliverer is directly introduced as himself speaking. The reasons why
this is supposed to refer to the Messiah, have been given in the
analysis to the chapter. Those reasons will be strengthened by the
examination of the particular expressions in the passage, and by
showing, as we proceed in the exposition, in what way they are
applicable to him. It will be assumed that the reference is to the
Messiah; and we shall find that it is a most beautiful description of
his character, and of some of the principal events of his life. This
verse is designed to state how he was suited for the special work to
which he was called. The whole endowment is traced to Yahweh. It was he
who had called him; he who had given him the tongue of the learned, and
he who had carefully and attentively qualified him for his work.

The tongue of the learned - Hebrew, 'The tongue of those who are
instructed;' that is, of the eloquent; or the tongue of instruction
(παιδείας paideias, Septuagint); that is, he has qualified me to
instruct others. It does not mean human science or learning; nor does it
mean that any other had been qualified as he was, or that there were any
others who were learned like him. But it means that on the subject of
religion he was eminently endowed with intelligence, and with eloquence.
In regard to the Redeemer's power of instruction, the discourses which
he delivered, as recorded in the New Testament, and especially his
sermon on the mount, may be referred to. None on the subject of religion
ever spake like him; none was ever so well qualified to instruct mankind
(compare [Mat 13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054).md).

That I should know how to speak a word in season - The Hebrew here is,
'That I might know how to strengthen with a word the weary;' that is,
that he might sustain, comfort, and refresh them by his promises and his
counsels. How eminently he was suited to alleviate those who were heavy
laden with sin and to comfort those who were burdened with calamities
and trials, may be seen by the slightest reference to the New Testament,
and the most partial acquaintance with his instructions and his life.
The weary here are those who are burdened with a sense of guilt; who
feel that they have no strength to bear up under the mighty load, and
who therefore seek relief (see [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028).md).

He wakeneth morning by morning - That is, he wakens me every morning
early. The language is taken from an instructor who awakens his pupils
early, in order that they may receive instruction. The idea is, that the
Redeemer would be eminently endowed, under the divine instruction and
guidance, for his work. He would be one who was, so to speak, in the
school of God; and who would be qualified to impart instruction to
others.

He wakeneth mine ear - To awaken the ear is to prepare one to receive
instruction. The expressions, to open the ear, to uncover the ear, to
awaken the ear, often occur in the Scriptures, in the sense of preparing
to receive instruction, or of disposing to receive divine
communications. The sense here is plain. The Messiah would be taught of
God, and would be inclined to receive all that he imparted.

To hear as the learned - Many translate the phrase here 'as disciples,'
that is, as those who are learning. So Lowth; 'With the attention of a
learner.' So Noyes; 'In the manner of a disciple.' The Septuagint
renders it, 'He has given me an ear to hear.' The idea is, probably,
that he was attentive as they are who wish to learn; that is, as docile
disciples. The figure is taken from a master who in the morning summons
his pupils around him, and imparts instruction to them. And the doctrine
which is taught is, that the Messiah would be eminently qualified, by
divine teaching, to be the instructor of mankind. The Chaldee
paraphrases this, 'Morning by morning, he anticipates (the dawn), that
he may send his prophets, if perhaps they my open the ears of sinners,
and receive instruction.'

[Isaiah 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 50:5</span></span>

The Lord God hath opened mine ear - This is another expression denoting
that he was attentive to the import of the divine commission (see [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006).md).

And I was not rebellious - I willingly undertook the task of
communicating the divine will to mankind. The statement here is in
accordance with all that is said of the Messiah, that he was willing to
come and do the will of God, and that whatever trials the work involved
he was prepared to meet them (see [Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); compare [Heb
10:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 50:6</span></span>

I gave my back to the smiters - I submitted willingly to be scourged, or
whipped. This is one of the parts of this chapter which can be applied
to no other one but the Messiah. There is not the slightest evidence,
whatever may be supposed to have been the probability, that Isaiah was
subjected to any such trial as this, or that he was scourged in a public
manner. Yet it was literally fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ ([Mat
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026.md); compare [Luk
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#033).md).

And my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair - literally, 'My cheeks
to hose who pluck, or pull.' The word used here (מרט māraṭ) means
properly to polish, to sharpen, to make smooth; then to make smooth the
head, to make bald; that is, to pluck out the hair, or the beard. To do
this was to offer the highest insult that could be imagined among the
Orientals. The beard is suffered to grow long, and is regarded as a mark
of honor. Nothing is regarded as more infamous than to cut it off (see
[Sa2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004).md), or to pluck it out; and
there is nothing which an Oriental will sooner resent than an insult
offered to his beard. 'It is a custom among the Orientals, as well among
the Greeks as among other nations, to cultivate the beard with the
utmost care and solicitude, so that they regard it as the highest
possible insult if a single hair of the beard is taken away by
violence.' (William of Tyre, an eastern archbishop, Gesta Dei, p. 802,
quoted in Harmer, vol. ii. p. 359.) It is customary to beg by the beard,
and to swear by the beard. 'By your beard; by the life of your beard;
God preserve your beard; God pour his blessings on your beard,' - are
common expressions there. The Mahometans have such a respect for the
board that they think it criminal to shave (Harmer, vol. ii. p. 360).
The Septuagint renders this, 'I gave my cheeks to buffering' (εἰς
ῥαπίσμα eis rapisma); that is, to being smitten with the open hand,
which was literally fulfilled in the case of the Redeemer [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067.md); [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065.md). The general sense of this
expression is, that he would be treated with the highest insult.

I hid not my face from shame and spitting - To spit on anyone was
regarded among the Orientals, as it is everywhere else, as an expression
of the highest insult and indignity [Deu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md); [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014.md); [Job
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010.md). Among the Orientals also it was
regarded as an insult - as it should be everywhere - to spit in the
presence of any person. Thus among the Medes, Herodotus (i. 99) says
that Deioces ordained that, 'to spit in the king's presence, or in the
presence of each other, was an act of indecency.' So also among the
Arabians, it is regarded as an offence (Niebuhr's Travels, i. 57). Thus
Monsieur d'Arvieux tells us (Voydans la Pal. p. 140) 'the Arabs are
sometimes disposed to think, that when a person spits, it is done out of
contempt; and that they never do it before their superiors' (Harmer, iv.
439). This act of the highest indignity was performed in reference to
the Redeemer [Mat 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067.md); [Mat
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030.md); and this expression of their
contempt he bore with the utmost meekness. This expression is one of the
proofs that this entire passage refers to the Messiah. It is said [Luk
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032.md) that the prophecies should be
fulfilled by his being spit upon, and yet there is no other prophecy of
the Old Testament but this which contains such a prediction.

[Isaiah 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 50:7</span></span>

For the Lord God will help me - That is, he will sustain me amidst all
these expressions of contempt and scorn.

Shall I not be confounded - Hebrew, 'I shall not be ashamed;' that is, I
will bear all this with the assurance of his favor and protection, and I
will not blush to be thus treated in a cause so glorious, and which must
finally triumph and prevail.

Therefore have I set my face like a flint - To harden the face, the
brow, the forehead, might be used either in a bad or a good sense - in
the former as denoting shamelessness or haughtiness (see the note at
[Isa 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004).md); in the latter denoting
courage, firmness, resolution. It is used in this sense here; and it
means that the Messiah would be firm and resolute amidst all the
contempt and scorn which he would meet, and would not shrink from any
kind or degree of suffering which should be necessary to accomplish the
great work in which he was engaged. A similar expression occurs in [Eze
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008.md) : 'Behold, I have made thy face
strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their
foreheads. As an adamant, harder than a flint, have I made thy forehead;
fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks.'

[Isaiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 50:8</span></span>

He is near that justifieth me - That is, God, who will vindicate my
character, and who approves what I do, does not leave nor forsake me,
and I can with confidence commit myself and my cause to him (see the
note at [Isa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004).md). The word justify
here is not used in the sense in which it is often in the Scriptures, to
denote the act by which a sinner is justified before God, but in the
proper, judicial sense, that he would declare him to be righteous; he
would vindicate his character, and show him to be innocent. This was
done by all the testimonies of God in his favor - by the voice which
spake from heaven at his baptism - by the miracles which he performed,
showing that he was commissioned and approved by God - by the fact that
even Pilate was constrained to declare him innocent - by the wonders
that attended his crucifixion, showing that 'he was a righteous man,'
even in the view of the Roman centurion [Luk
23:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#047.md), and by the fact that he was
raised from the dead, and was taken to heaven, and placed at the right
hand of the Father - thus showing that his whole work was approved by
God, and furnishing the most ample vindication of his character from all
the accusations of his foes.

Who will contend with me? - This question indicates confidence in God,
and in the integrity of his own character. The language is taken from
transactions in the courts of justice; and it is a solemn call, on any
who would dare to oppose him, to enter into a trial, and allege the
accusations against him before the tribunal of a holy God.

Let us stand together - Before the seat of judgment as in a court
(compare the note at [Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001).md).

Who is mine adversary? - Margin, 'Who is the master of my cause?' The
Hebrew is 'Lord (בעל ba‛al) of judgment.' The expression means not
merely one who has a lawsuit, or a cause, but one who is 'lord of the
judgment,' i. e, possessor of the cause, or one who has a claim, and can
demand that the judgment should be in his favor. And the call here is on
any who should have such a claim to prefer against the Messiah; who
should have any real ground of accusation against him; that is, it is an
assertion of innocence.

Let him come near to me - Let him come and make his charges, and enter
on the trial.

[Isaiah 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 50:9</span></span>

The Lord God will help me - (See [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007).md). In the Hebrew this is, 'The
Lord Jehovah,' as it is in [Isa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md)
also, and these are among the places where our translators have
improperly rendered the word יהוה yehovâh (Jehovah) by the word 'God.'

Who is he that shall condemn me? - If Yahweh is my advocate and friend,
my cause must be right. Similar language is used by the apostle Paul:
'If God be for us, who can be against us?' [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md); and in [Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md) :

Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear:

What can man do unto me?

They all shall wax old - All my enemies shall pass away, as a garment is
worn out and cast aside. The idea is, that the Messiah would survive all
their attacks; his cause, his truth and his reputation would live, while
all the power, the influence, the reputation of his adversaries, would
vanish as a garment that is worn out and then thrown away. The same
image respecting his enemies is used again in [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008.md).

The moth shall eat them up - The moth is a well known insect attached
particularly to woolen clothes, and which soon consumes them (see the
note at [Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019).md). In eastern
countries, where wealth consisted much in changes of raiment, the
depredations of the moth would be particularly to be feared, and hence,
it is frequently referred to in the Bible. The sense here is, that the
adversaries of the Messiah would be wholly destroyed.

[Isaiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 50:10</span></span>

Who is among you that feareth the Lord? - This whole prophecy is
concluded with an address made in this verse to the friends of God, and
in the next to his enemies. It is the language of the Messiah, calling
on the one class to put their trust in Yahweh, and threatening the other
with displeasure and wrath. The exhortation in this verse is made in
view of what is said in the previous verses. It is the entreaty of the
Redeemer to all who love and fear God, and who may be placed in
circumstances of trial and darkness as he was. to imitate his example,
and not to rely on their own power, but to put their trust in the arm of
Yahweh. he had done this [Isa 50:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md).
He had been afflicted, persecuted, forsaken, by people [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md), and he had at that time confided
in God and committed his cause to him; and he had never left or forsaken
him. Encouraged by his example, he exhorts all others to cast themselves
on the care of him who would defend a righteous cause.

That feareth the Lord - Who are worshippers of Yahweh.

That obeyeth the voice of his servant - The Messiah (see the note at
[Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md). This is another
characteristic of piety. They who fear the Lord will also obey the voice
of the Redeemer [Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md).

That walketh in darkness - In a manner similar to the Messiah [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md). God's true people experience
afflictions like others, and have often trials especially their own.
They are sometimes in deep darkness of mind, and see no light. Comfort
has forsaken them, and their days and nights are passed in gloom.

Let him trust in the name of the Lord - The Messiah had done this [Isa
50:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008.md), and he exhorts all others to
do it. Doing this they would obtain divine assistance, and would find
that he would never leave nor forsake them.

And stay upon his God - Lean upon him, as one does on a staff or other
support. This may be regarded still as the language of the merciful
Redeemer, appealing to his own example, and entreating all who are in
like circumstances, to put their trust in God.

[Isaiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 50:11</span></span>

Behold, all ye that kindle a fire - This verse refers to the wicked. In
the previous verse, the Messiah had called upon all the pious to put
their trust in God, and it is there implied that they would do so. But
it would not be so with the wicked. In times of darkness and calamity,
instead of trusting in God they would confide in their own resources,
and endeavor to kindle a light for themselves in which they might walk.
But the result would be, that they would find no comfort, and would
ultimately under his hand lie down in sorrow. The figure is continued
from the previous verse. The pious who are in darkness wait patiently
for the light which Yahweh shall kindle for them But not so with the
wicked. They attempt to kindle a light for themselves, and to walk in
that. The phrase, 'that kindle a fire,' refers to all the plans which
people form with reference to their own salvation; all which they rely
upon to guide them through the darkness of this world. It may include,
therefore, all the schemes of human philosophy, of false religion, of
paganism, of infidelity, deism, and self-righteousness; all dependence
on our good works, our charities ties, and our prayers. All these are
false lights which people enkindle, in order to guide themselves when
they resolve to cast off God, to renounce his revelation, and to resist
his spirit. It may have had a primary reference to the Jews, who so
often rejected the divine guidance, and who relied so much on
themselves; but it also includes all the plans which people devise to
conduct themselves to heaven. The confidence of the pious [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md) is in the light of God; that of
the wicked is in the light of people.

That compass yourselves about with sparks - There has been considerable
variety in the interpretation of the word rendered here sparks (זיקות
ziyqôth). It occurs nowhere else in the Bible, though the word זקים
ziqqiym occurs in [Pro 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#018.md), where it
is rendered in the text 'firebrands,' and in the margin 'flames,' or
'sparks.' Gesenius supposes that these are different forms at the same
word, and renders the word here, 'burning arrows, fiery darts.' The
Vulgate renders it 'flames.' The Septuagint, φλογὶ phlogi - 'flame.' In
the Syriac the word has the sense of lightning. Vitringa supposes it
means 'faggots,' and that the sense is, that they encompass themselves
with faggots, in order to make a great conflagration. Lowth renders it,
very loosely, 'Who heap the fuel round about.' But it is probable that
the common version has given the true sense, and that the reference is
to human devices, which give no steady and clear light, but which may be
compared with a spark struck from a flint. The idea probably is, that
all human devices for salvation bear the same resemblance to the true
plan proposed by God, which a momentary spark in the dark does to the
clear shining of a bright light like that of the sun. If this is the
sense, it is a most graphic and striking description of the nature of
all the schemes by which the sinner hopes to save himself.

Walk in the light of your fire - That is, you will walk in that light.
It is not a command as if he wished them to do it, but it is a
declaration which is intended to direct their attention to the fact that
if they did this they would lie down in sorrow. It is language such as
we often use, as when we say to a young man, 'go on a little further in
a career of dissipation, and you will bring yourself to poverty and
shame and death.' Or as if we should say to a man near a precipice, 'go
on a little further, and you wilt fall down and be dashed in pieces.'
The essential idea is, that this course would lead to ruin. It is
implied that they would walk on in this way, and be destroyed.

This shall ye have - As the result of this, you shall lie down in
sorrow. Herder renders this:

One movement of my hand upon you,

And ye shall lie down in sorrow.

How simple and yet how sublime an expression is this! The Messiah but
lifts his hand and the lights are quenched. His foes lie down sad and
dejected, in darkness and sorrow. The idea is, that they would receive
their doom from his hand, and that it would he as easy for him as is the
uplifting or waving of the hand, to quench all their lights, and consign
them to grief (compare Matt. 25)
