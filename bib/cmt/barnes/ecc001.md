### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

The introductory verses [Ecc 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)
serve to describe the writer, and to state the subject of his book.

[Ecclesiastes 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 1:1</span></span>

Preacher - literally, Convener. No one English word represents the
Hebrew קהלת qôheleth adequately. Though capable, according to Hebrew
usage, of being applied to men in office, it is strictly a feminine
participle, and describes a person in the act of calling together an
assembly of people as if with the intention of addressing them. The word
thus understood refers us to the action of Wisdom personified [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020); [Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008). In Proverbs and here, Solomon
seems to support two characters, speaking sometimes in the third person
as Wisdom instructing the assembled people, at other times in the first
person. So our Lord speaks of Himself (compare [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049) with [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034)) as Wisdom, and as desiring [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034) to gather the people together
for instruction; It is unfortunate that the word "Preacher" does not
bring this personification before English minds, but a different idea.

[Ecclesiastes 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 1:2</span></span>

Vanity - This word הבל hebel, or, when used as a proper name, in [Gen
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002), "Abel", occurs no less than 37
times in Ecclesiastes, and has been called the key of the book.
Primarily it means "breath," "light wind;" and denotes what:

\(1\) passes away more or less quickly and completely;

\(2\) leaves either no result or no adequate result behind, and
therefore

\(3\) fails to satisfy the mind of man, which naturally craves for
something permanent and progressive: it is also applied to:

\(4\) idols, as contrasted with the Living, Eternal, and Almighty God,
and, thus, in the Hebrew mind, it is connected with sin.

In this book it is applied to all works on earth, to pleasure, grandeur,
wisdom, the life of man, childhood, youth, and length of days, the
oblivion of the grave, wandering and unsatisfied desires, unenjoyed
possessions, and anomalies in the moral government of the world.

Solomon speaks of the world-wide existence of "vanity," not with
bitterness or scorn, but as a fact, which forced itself on him as he
advanced in knowledge of men and things, and which he regards with
sorrow and perplexity. From such feelings he finds refuge by contrasting
this with another fact, which he holds with equal firmness, namely, that
the whole universe is made and is governed by a God of justice,
goodness, and power. The place of vanity in the order of Divine
Providence - unknown to Solomon, unless the answer be indicated in [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029) - is explained to us by Paul,
Rom. 8, where its origin is traced to the subjugation and corruption of
creation by sin as a consequence of the fall of man; and its extinction
is declared to be reserved until after the Resurrection in the glory and
liberty of the children of God.

Vanity of vanities - A well-known Hebrew idiom signifying vanity in the
highest degree. Compare the phrase, "holy of holies."

All - Solomon includes both the courses of nature and the works of man
[Ecc 1:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004). Compare [Rom
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022).

[Ecclesiastes 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 1:3</span></span>

What profit ... - The question often repeated is the great practical
inquiry of the book; it receives its final answer in [Ecc
12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013). When this question was
asked, the Lord had not yet spoken [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028). The word "profit" (or
pre-eminence) is opposed to "vanity."

Hath a man - Rather, hath man.

[Ecclesiastes 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 1:4</span></span>

Vanity is shown in mankind, the elements, and all that moves on earth;
the same course is repeated again and again without any permanent result
or real progress; and events and people alike are forgotten.

Abideth - The apparent permanence of the earth increases by contrast the
transitory condition of its inhabitants.

Ever - The word does not here absolutely signify "eternity" (compare
[Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011) note), but a certainly short
period (compare [Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)): here it
might be paraphrased "as long as this world, this present order of
things, lasts."

[Ecclesiastes 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 1:5</span></span>

Hasteth ... - literally, at his place panting (in his eagerness) riseth
he there.

[Ecclesiastes 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 1:6</span></span>

More literally, Going toward the south and veering toward the north,
veering, veering goes the wind; and to its veerings the wind returns.

[Ecclesiastes 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 1:7</span></span>

The place - i. e., The spring or river-head. It would seem that the
ancient Hebrews regarded the clouds as the immediate feeders of the
springs ([Pro 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#028), and [Psa
104:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#010), [Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013)). [Gen
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006) indicates some acquaintance with
the process and result of evaporation.

[Ecclesiastes 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 1:8</span></span>

All things ... utter it - This clause, as here translated, refers to the
immensity of labor. Others translate it, "all words are full of labor;
they make weary the hearers," or "are feeble or insufficient" to tell
the whole; and are referred to the impossibility of adequately
describing labor.

[Ecclesiastes 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 1:9</span></span>

Hath been ... is done - i. e., Hath happened in the course of nature ...
is done by man.

[Ecclesiastes 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 1:11</span></span>

Things - Rather, men.

[Ecclesiastes 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 1:12</span></span>

Solomon relates his personal experience Eccl. 2; the result of which was
"no profit," and a conviction that all, even God's gifts of earthly good
to good men, in this life are subject to vanity. His trial of God's
first gift, wisdom, is recounted in [Ecc
1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012).

Was - This tense does not imply that Solomon had ceased to be king when
the word was written. See the introduction to Ecclesiastes. He begins
with the time of his accession to the throne, when the gifts of wisdom
and riches were especially promised to him [Kg1
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012).

[Ecclesiastes 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 1:13</span></span>

Wisdom - As including both the powers of observation and judgment, and
the knowledge acquired thereby ([Kg1
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028); [Kg1
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029); [Kg1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008), ...). It increases by exercise.
Here is noted its application to people and their actions.

Travail - In the sense of toil; the word is here applied to all human
occupations.

God - God is named as אלהים 'elohı̂ym thirty-nine times in this book; a
name common to the true God and to false gods, and used by believers and
by idolators: but the name Yahweh, by which He is known especially to
the people who are in covenant with Him, is never once used.

Perhaps the chief reason for this is that the evil which is the object
of inquiry in this book is not at all unique to the chosen people. All
creation Rom. 8 groans under it. The Preacher does not write of (or, to)
the Hebrew race exclusively. There is no express and obvious reference
to their national expectations, the events of their national history, or
even to the divine oracles which were deposited with them. Hence, it was
natural for the wisest and largest-hearted man of his race to take a
wider range of observation than any other Hebrew writer before or after
him. It became the sovereign of many peoples whose religions diverged
more or less remotely from the true religion, to address himself to a
more extensive sphere than that which was occupied by the twelve tribes,
and to adapt his language accordingly. See the [Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001) note.

[Ecclesiastes 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 1:14</span></span>

Vexation of spirit - A phrase which occurs 7 times, and may be otherwise
translated, "feeding on wind." Modern Hebrew grammarians assert that the
word rendered "vexation" must be derived from a root signifying "to
feed," "follow," "strive after." This being admitted, it remains to
choose between two translations:

\(1\) "striving after wind," or "windy effort;" adopted by the
Septuagint and the majority of modern interpreters; or

\(2\) feeding on wind. Compare [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001) : and similar phrases in [Pro
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014); [Isa
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020); [Psa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003).

[Ecclesiastes 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 1:15</span></span>

He saw clearly both the disorder and incompleteness of human actions
(compare the marginal reference), and also man's impotence to rectify
them.

[Ecclesiastes 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 1:16</span></span>

I am come ... - Rather, I have accumulated (literally "enlarged and
added") wisdom more than etc.

They that have been ... - The reference is probably to the line of
Canaanite kings who lived in Jerusalem before David took it, such as
Melchizedek [Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018), Adonizedek
[Jos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001), and Araunah [Sa2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#023); or, it may be, to Solomon's
contemporaries of his own country [Kg1
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031) and of other countries who
visited him [Kg1 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#034); [Kg1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024). for "in" Jerusalem render over.

[Ecclesiastes 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 1:17</span></span>

To know madness and folly - A knowledge of folly would help him to
discern wisdom, and to exercise that chief function of practical wisdom
- to avoid folly.

[Ecclesiastes 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 1:18</span></span>

We become more sensible of our ignorance and impotence, and therefore
sorrowful, in proportion as we discover more of the constitution of
nature and the scheme of Providence in the government of the world;
every discovery serving to convince us that more remains concealed of
which we had no suspicion before.
