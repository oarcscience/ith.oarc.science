### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 12:1</span></span>

Remember now - Rather, And remember. The connection between this verse
and the preceding one is unfortunately interrupted by our division of
chapters.

Creator - Gratitude to God as Creator is here inculcated, as just
previously [Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md) fear of God as
Judge. Godliness, acquired as a habit in youth, is recommended as the
proper compensation for that natural cessation of youthful happiness
which makes the days of old age more or less evil; more evil in
proportion since there is less of godliness in the heart, and less evil
where there is more godliness.

While the evil days come not - Rather, before the evil days come.

[Ecclesiastes 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 12:2</span></span>

While ... not - Or, Before. The darkening of the lights of heaven
denotes a time of affliction and sadness. Compare [Eze
32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md); [Job
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009.md); [Isa
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md). Contrast this representation of
old age with [Sa2 23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md).

[Ecclesiastes 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 12:3</span></span>

The body in old age and death is here described under the figure of a
decaying house with its inmates and furniture.

This verse is best understood as referring to the change which old age
brings to four parts of the body, the arms ("the keepers"), the legs
("the strong men"), the teeth ("the grinders"), and the eyes.

[Ecclesiastes 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 12:4</span></span>

And the doors ... is low - The house is viewed from without. The way of
entry and exit is stopped: little or no sound issues forth to tell of
life stirring within. The old man, as he grows older, has less in common
with the rising generation; mutual interest and social contact decline.
Some take the doors and the sound of the mill as figures of the lips and
ears and of the speech.

He shall rise ... - Here the metaphor of the house passes out of sight.
The verb may either be taken impersonally ( "they shall rise," compare
the next verse): or as definitely referring to an old man, who as the
master of the house rises out of sleep at the first sound in the
morning.

All the daughters of musick - i. e., Singing women [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md).

Be brought low - i. e., Sound faintly in the ears of old age.

[Ecclesiastes 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 12:5</span></span>

High - The powerful and the proud, such persons as an old man in his
timidity might shrink from opposing or meeting: or, high ground which
old men would avoid ascending.

Fears ... in the way - Compare [Pro
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#013.md).

The almond tree - The type of old age. Many modern critics translate
"The almond shall be despised," i. e., pleasant food shall no longer be
relished.

The grasshopper - Rather: "the locust." The clause means, heaviness and
stiffness shall take the place of that active motion for which the
locust is conspicuous.

Desire - literally, the caper-berry; which, eaten as a provocative to
appetite, shall fail to take effect on a man whose powers are exhausted.

Long home - literally, "eternal (see [Ecc
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004) note.md) house;" man's place in the
next world. Without attributing to the author of Ecclesiastes that deep
insight into the future life which is shown by the writer of the
Epistles to the Corinthians, we may observe that He by whom both writers
were inspired sanctions in both books (see [Co2
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).md) the use of the same expression
"eternal house." In 2 Corinthians it means that spiritual body which
shall be hereafter; and it is placed, as it is here (see [Ecc
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003).md), in contrast with that earthly
dissolving house which clothes the spirit of man in this world.

Mourners - The singing women who attend funerals for hire (see [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023).md).

[Ecclesiastes 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 12:6</span></span>

Be loosed - The termination of life is signified generally by the
snapping of the silver cord by which the lamp hangs from the ceiling; by
the dashing in pieces of the cup or reservoir of oil; by the shattering
of the pitcher used to bring water from the spring; and by the breaking
of the wheel by which a bucket is let down into the well. Others discern
in the silver cord, the soul which holds the body in life; in the bowl,
the body; and in the golden oil (compare [Zac
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012).md) within it, the spirit.

[Ecclesiastes 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 12:7</span></span>

The spirit - i. e., The spirit separated unto God from the body at
death. No more is said here of its future destiny. To return to God, who
is the fountain [Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md) of Life,
certainly means to continue to live. The doctrine of life after death is
implied here as in [Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md) (compare
[Mar 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026).md), [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015) (see the note.md), and in many
other passages of Scripture earlier than the age of Solomon. The
inference that the soul loses its personality and is absorbed into
something else has no warrant in this or any other statement in this
book, and would be inconsistent with the announcement of a judgment
after death [Ecc 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md).

[Ecclesiastes 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 12:8</span></span>

This passage is properly regarded as the Epilogue of the whole book; a
kind of apology for the obscurity of many of its sayings. The passage
serves therefore to make the book more intelligible and more acceptable.

Here, as in the beginning of the book [Ecc
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md), the Preacher speaks of himself
[Ecc 12:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md) in the third person. He
first repeats [Ecc 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md) the mournful,
perplexing theme with which his musings began [Ecc
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002.md); and then states the encouraging
practical conclusion [Ecc 12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md) to
which they have led him. It has been pointed out that the Epilogue
assumes the identity of the Preacher with the writer of the Book of
Proverbs.

[Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md)

literally, Words of wise men are as goads, and as nails driven in (by)
masters of assemblies; they are given from one shepherd: "goads,"
because they rouse the hearer and impel him to right actions; "nails"
(perhaps tent-spikes), because they remain fixed in the memory: "masters
of assemblies" are simply "teachers" or "preachers" (see [Ecc
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001) note.md), instructors of such
assemblies as Wisdom addresses [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md).

One shepherd - i. e., God, who is the supreme Giver of wisdom [Pro
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#006.md), and the chief Shepherd [Jer
23:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md). Compare [Co1
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md).

[Ecc 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#012.md)

By these - i. e., "By the words of wise men."

Books - Rather, "Writings." Probably the proverbs current in the
Preacher's age, including, though not especially indicating, his own.

The Preacher protests against the folly of protracted, unprofitable,
meditation.

[Ecc 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013.md)

literally, "The conclusion of the discourse" (or "word," = words, [Ecc
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001).md), "the whole, let us hear."

The whole duty of man - Rather, the whole man. To revere God and to obey
Him is the whole man, constitutes man's whole being; that only is
conceded to Man; all other things, as this book teaches again and again,
are dependent on a Higher Incomprehensible Being.

[Ecc 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md)

Judgment with - Rather, judgment (which shall be held) upon etc.: i. e.,
an appointed judgment which shall take place in another world, as
distinct from that retribution which frequently follows man's actions in
the course of this world, and which is too imperfect (compare [Ecc
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md); [Ecc
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md); [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md); [Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002), ....md) to be described by these
expressions. He that is fully convinced that there is no solid happiness
to be found in this world, and that there is a world to come wherein God
will adjudge people to happiness or misery respectively, as they have
made their choice and acted here, must necessarily subscribe to the
truth of Solomon's conclusion, that true religion is the only way to
true happiness.
