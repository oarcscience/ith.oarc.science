### [Deuteronomy Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 16:1</span></span>

The cardinal point on which the whole of the prescriptions in this
chapter turn, is evidently the same as has been so often insisted on in
the previous chapters, namely, the concentration of the religious
services of the people round one common sanctuary. The prohibition
against observing the great Feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and
tabernacle, the three annual epochs in the sacred year of the Jew, at
home and in private, is reiterated in a variety of words no less than
six times in the first sixteen verses of this chapter [Deu
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002), [Deu
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#006), [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011), [Deu
16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#015). Hence, it is easy to see why
nothing is here said of the other holy days.

The Feast of Passover Exo. 12:1-27; [Num
9:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001); [Lev
23:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001). A re-enforcement of this
ordinance was the more necessary because its observance had clearly been
intermitted for thirty-nine years (see [Jos
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#010)). One Passover only had been kept
in the wilderness, that recorded in Num. 9, where see the notes.

[Deu 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#002)

Sacrifice the passover - "i. e." offer the sacrifices proper to the
feast of the Passover, which lasted seven days. Compare a similar use of
the word in a general sense in [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028). In the latter part of [Deu
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#004) and in the following verses Moses
passes, as the context again shows, into the narrower sense of the word
Passover.

[Deu 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#007)

After the Paschal Supper in the courts or neighborhood of the sanctuary
was over, they might disperse to their several "tents" or "dwellings"
[Kg1 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066). These would of course be
within a short distance of the sanctuary, because the other Paschal
offerings were yet to be offered day by day for seven days and the
people would remain to share them; and especially to take part in the
holy convocation on the first and seventh of the days.

[Deuteronomy 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 16:9</span></span>

Feast of Weeks; and [Deu 16:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013),
Feast of Tabernacles. Nothing is here added to the rules given in
Leviticus and Numbers except the clauses so often recurring in
Deuteronomy and so characteristic of it, which restrict the public
celebration of the festivals to the sanctuary, and enjoin that the
enjoyments of them should be extended to the Levites, widows, orphans,
etc.

[Deuteronomy 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 16:18</span></span>

These verses are closely connected in subject with the following
chapter, and introduce certain directions for the administration of
justice and the carrying on of the civil government of the people in
Canaan. During the lifetime of Moses, he himself, especially inspired
and guided by God, was sufficient, with the aid of the subordinate
judges (compare [Exo 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013) ff), for
the duties in question. But now that Moses was to be withdrawn, and the
people would soon be scattered up and down the land of Canaan, regular
and permanent provision must be made for civil and social order and good
government.

[Deu 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021)

A grove ... - Render, Thou shalt not plant for thee any tree as an idol:
literally as an Asherah," "i. e." an image of Astarte or Ashtaroth, the
Phoenician goddess (compare [Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005)
note, [Deu 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013) note). The word is
rendered "grove" by the King James Version also in [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005); [Deu
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003); [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013); [Jdg
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025), but cannot be maintained, for
the word is connected with various verbs which are quite inapplicable to
a grove. The wooden idol in question was the stem of a tree, stripped of
its boughs, set upright in the ground, and rudely carved with emblems.
