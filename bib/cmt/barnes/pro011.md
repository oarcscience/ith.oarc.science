### [Proverbs Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 11:9</span></span>

Through knowledge - Better, By the knowledge of the just, shall they (i.
e., the neighbors) be delivered.

[Proverbs 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 11:11</span></span>

The blessing of the upright - Probably the prayers which he offers for
the good of the city in which he dwells, and which avail to preserve it
from destruction (compare [Gen
18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023).md); or "the blessing which God
gives the upright."

[Proverbs 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 11:12</span></span>

None but the man "void of wisdom" will show contempt for those about
him. The wise man, if he cannot admire or praise, will at least know how
to be silent.

[Proverbs 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 11:13</span></span>

The man who comes to us with tales about others will reveal our secrets
also. Faithfulness is shown, not only in doing what a man has been
commissioned to do, but in doing it quietly and without garrulity.

[Proverbs 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 11:14</span></span>

Counsel - See [Pro 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005.md) note. This
precept may well be thought of as coming with special force at the time
of the organization of the monarchy of Israel. Compare [Kg1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#006.md).

[Proverbs 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 11:15</span></span>

See the marginal reference. The play upon "sure" and "suretiship" in the
the King James Version (though each word is rightly rendered) has
nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew, and seems to have originated
in a desire to give point to the proverb.

[Proverbs 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 11:16</span></span>

Or, "The gracious woman wins and keeps honor, as (the conjunction may be
so rendered) strong men win riches."

[Proverbs 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 11:18</span></span>

Deceitful work - Work which deceives and disappoints the worker; in
contrast with the "sure reward" of the second clause.

Omit "shall be" and render, "but he that soweth righteousness worketh a
sure reward."

[Proverbs 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 11:21</span></span>

literally, "hand to hand." The meaning of which is, "Hand may plight
faith to hand, men may confederate for evil, yet punishment shall come
at last;" or "From hand to hand, from one generation to another,
punishment shall descend on the evil doers."

[Proverbs 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 11:22</span></span>

The most direct proverb, in the sense of "similitude," which has as yet
met us.

Jewel of gold - Better, ring; i. e., the nose-ring [Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md), [Gen
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#047.md); [Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md).

Without discretion - literally, "without taste," void of the subtle tact
and grace, without which mere outward beauty is as ill-bestowed as the
nose-ring in the snout of the unclean beast. If we may assume that in
ancient Syria, as in modern Europe, swine commonly wore such a ring to
hinder them doing mischief, the similitude receives a fresh vividness.

[Proverbs 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 11:24</span></span>

Withholdeth more than is meet - i. e., Is sparing and niggardly where he
ought to give. The contrast is stated in the form of a paradox, to which
the two following verses supply the answer. Some render, "There is that
withholdeth from what is due," i. e., from a just debt, or from the
generosity of a just man.

[Proverbs 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 11:25</span></span>

Liberal soul - literally, "the soul that blesses," i. e., gives freely
and fully. The similitudes are both of them essentially Eastern.
Fatness, the sleek, well filled look of health, becomes the figure of
prosperity, as leanness of misfortune [Pro
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004.md); [Pro
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025.md); [Psa
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md); [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md). Kindly acts come as the
refreshing dew and soft rain from heaven upon a thirsty land.

[Proverbs 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 11:26</span></span>

In the early stages of commerce there seems no way of making money
rapidly so sure as that of buying up grain in time of famine, waiting
until the dearth presses heavily, and then selling at famine prices. Men
hate this selfishness, and pour blessings upon him who sells at a
moderate profit.

[Proverbs 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 11:27</span></span>

Procureth - Better, striveth after. He who desires good, absolutely, for
its own sake, is also unconsciously striving after the favor which
attends goodness.

[Proverbs 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 11:28</span></span>

Branch - Better, leaf, as in [Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md);
[Isa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md).

[Proverbs 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 11:29</span></span>

He that troubleth ... - The temper, nigardly and worrying, which leads a
man to make those about him miserable, and proves but bad economy in the
end.

[Proverbs 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 11:30</span></span>

Winneth souls - Better, a wise man winneth souls. He that is wise draws
the souls of people to himself, just as the fruit of the righteous is to
all around him a tree of life, bearing new fruits of healing evermore.
The phrase is elsewhere translated by "taketh the life" [Kg1
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md); [Psa
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#013.md). The wise man is the true
conqueror. For the Christian meaning given to these words, see the New
Testament reference in the margin.

[Proverbs 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 11:31</span></span>

The sense would appear to be, "The righteous is requited, i. e., is
punished for his lesser sins, or as a discipline; much more the wicked,
etc." Compare [Pe1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md).

[Proverbs 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 11:1</span></span>

This emphatic reproduction of the old rule of [Deu
25:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md) is perhaps a trace of the
danger of dishonesty incidental to the growing commerce of the
Israelites. The stress laid upon the same sin in [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md); bears witness to the desire of
the teacher to educate the youth of Israel to a high standard of
integrity, just as the protest of Hosea against it [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md) shows the zeal of the prophet in
rebuking what was becoming more and more a besetting sin.

A just weight - literally, as in the margin, indicating a time when
stones rather than metal were used as a standard of weight. Compare [Deu
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md).

[Proverbs 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 11:2</span></span>

A rabbinic paraphrase of the second clause is: "Lowly souls become full
of wisdom as the low place becomes full of water."

[Proverbs 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 11:4</span></span>

The day of wrath - Words true in their highest sense of the great
"diesirae" of the future, but spoken in the first instance (compare [Zep
1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015).md) of any "day of the Lord," any
time of judgment, when men or nations receive the chastisement of their
sins. At such a time "riches profit not."

[Proverbs 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 11:7</span></span>

Significant words, as showing the belief that when the righteous died,
his "expectation" (i. e., his hope for the future) did not perish. The
second clause is rendered by some, "the expectation that brings sorrow."
