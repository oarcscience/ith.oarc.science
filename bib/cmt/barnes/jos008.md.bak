### [Joshua Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 8:1</span></span>

God rouses Joshua from his dejection [Jos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006.md), and bids him lmarch against Ai
with the main body. Though Ai was but a small city (compare [Jos
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025.md) and [Jos
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#003).md), yet the discouragement of the
people rendered it inexpedient to send a second time a mere detachment
against it; and the people of Ai had, as appears from [Jos
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017.md), help from Bethel, and possibly
from other places also. It was fitting too that all the people should
witness with their own eyes the happy consequences of having faithfully
put away the sin which had separated them from God.

[Joshua 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 8:3</span></span>

Thirty thousand men - comparing [Jos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md) and [Jos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012) ("five thousand men".md), there is
probably a mistake in the numbers of this verse, where an early copyist
may have written the sign for 30,000 instead of that for 5,000.

Sent them away by night - The selected 5,000 would accordingly post
themselves in the main ravine between Ai and Bethel in the night and
early morning. The neighhorhood in which Ai was situated is described as
"a wild entanglement of hill and valley;" and amidst its recesses the
detachment could easily shelter itself from observation until Joshua's
other measures were taken.

[Joshua 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 8:10</span></span>

Numbered the people - Rather, perhaps, "mustered" or "arrayed" them for
their march. The distance from the camp at Gilgal to Ai is about fifteen
miles. In the evening of the day after the despatch of the 5,000 liers
in wait, Joshua and the host might make their appearance in the
neighborhood of the city.

[Joshua 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 8:12</span></span>

He took - Rather "had taken;" the words refer to the ambuscade which
Joshua had detached during the previous night.

[Joshua 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 8:13</span></span>

Joshua went down by night into the valley where He would be seen at
daylight by the men of Ai, and was accompanied no doubt by a picked body
of troops. The king of Ai, in the morning, would see neither the ambush
in his rear, nor the whole of the great host of Israel among the hills
away to the north on his left; but supposing, as it appears, that the
Israelites before him were a body detached as on the former occasion to
assail his city, he sallied out promptly to attack them.

[Joshua 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 8:14</span></span>

At a time appointed - Rather, "at the place appointed," i. e. some spot
suitable for the drawing up of his men, which had been assigned
beforehand. This was "before the plain," i. e. it was at the entrance of
the depressed tract of land which runs down to the Jordan valley, up
which lay the route of the Israelites from Gilgal to Ai.

[Joshua 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 8:17</span></span>

Or Bethel - See the [Jos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md) note.

[Joshua 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 8:18</span></span>

No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north
of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on
the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the
city. He now, at the command of God, gives the appointed signal to the
ambush.

[Joshua 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 8:29</span></span>

Compare [Deu 21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022.md) notes.

[Joshua 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 8:30</span></span>

The account of this solemnity is very brief. An acquaintance with Deut.
27 is evidently presupposed; and the three several acts of which the
solemnity consisted are only so far distinctly named as is necessary to
show that the commands of Moses there given were fully carried out by
Joshua.

It is difficult to escape the conviction that these verses are here out
of their proper and original place. The connection between [Jos
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md), and [Jos
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md), is natural and obvious; and in
[Jos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md), the fraud of the Gibeonites
is represented as growing out of the alarm caused by the fall of Jericho
and Ai. It is, moreover, extremely unlikely that a solemnity of this
nature in the very center of the country should be undertaken by Joshua
while the whole surrounding district was in the hands of the enemy; or
that, if undertaken, it would have been carried out unmolested. "And the
strangers that were conversant among them" [Jos
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035.md), were present at it. The distance
fromm Gilgal in the Jordan valley to Mount Ebal is fully 30 miles,
unless - as is unlikely - another Gilgal ([Deu
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029) note.md) be meant; and so vast a
host, with its non-effective followers [Jos
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035.md), could certainly not have
accomplished a march like this through a difficult country and a hostile
population in less than three days. Moreover in [Jos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md); [Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md), [Jos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md), [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md), the Israelites are spoken of as
still encamping at Gilgal.

It is on the whole likely that, for these and other reasons, this
passage does not, in our present Bible, stand in its proper context; and
it has been conjectured that the place from which these six verses have
been transferred is the end of Josh. 11: The "then" with which [Jos
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md) opens in our present text may
well have served to introduce the account of the solemnity on Gerizim
and Ebal at the end of the record of Joshua's victories, to which indeed
it forms a suitable climax.

[Jos 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032.md)

See the note marginal reference.

[Jos 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#034.md)

All the words of the law - See [Deu
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011.md) ff It would seem that Joshua, on
the present occasion, must have read at least all the legislative
portion of the Pentateuch before the people (compare on [Deu
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#003).md). The terms of this verse cannot
be satisfactorily explained as importing only the blessings and curses
of Deut. 27-28.
