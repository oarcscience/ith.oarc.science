### [Ezekiel Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 47:1</span></span>

The vision of the waters; or, the blessings which flow from this source
to animate and refresh all the inhabitants of the earth. Compare [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md)...; [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md). Ezekiel's description is adopted
and modifled by Zechariah and in Rev. (compare the marginal references)
Hebrew tradition speaks of a spring of water, named Etham, said to be
identical with the well-waters of Nephtoah [Jos
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#015.md), on the west of the temple,
whose waters were conducted by pipes into the temple-courts for the uses
needed in the ministration of the priests. The waters of Shiloah [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md); [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md) flowed from the rocks beneath the
temple-hill. It is quite in the manner of Ezekiel's vision to start from
an existing feature and thence proceed to an ideal picture from where to
draw a spiritual lesson. The deepening of the waters in their course
shows the continual deepening of spiritual life and multiplication of
spiritual blessings in the growth of the kingdom of God. So long as the
stream is confined to the temple-courts, it is merely a small rill, for
the most part unseen, but when it issues from the courts it begins at
once to deepen and to widen. So on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit
descended upon the company of believers, little then but presently to
develop into the infant Church in Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 47:2</span></span>

Out of the way of the gate northward - Rather, by the way of the
northward gate.

[Ezekiel 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 47:3</span></span>

The ancles - This may coincide with the step gained in the baptism of
Cornelius Acts 10, and the opening of the Church to the Gentiles. The
dispersion which had followed the martyrdom of Stephen [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md), had carried believers into
various countries, and so paved the way for the foundation of Gentile
Churches.

[Ezekiel 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 47:4</span></span>

The knees - The mission of Paul and Barnabas [Act
13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md) is another marked epoch in the
Church's history; and the time of Paul's martyrdom denotes an increase
in the Gentile Church, which corresponds with the waters reaching the
loins.

[Ezekiel 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 47:5</span></span>

The rivers in Palestine were for the most part mere watercourses, dry in
summer, in winter carrying the water along the wadys to the sea. The
river of the vision is to have a continuous flow.

Waters to swim in - When under Constantine the Roman empire had become
Christian, the Church may be contemplated as the full river, to flow on
through time until the final completion of Isaiah's prophecy [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md).

[Ezekiel 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 47:7</span></span>

Trees naturally flourish where there is abundance of water [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 47:8</span></span>

"The sea" is a term commonly applied to the Dead Sea. Compare [Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017), "the sea of the plain (Arabah.md),
even the salt sea." The more literal rendering of the verse in this
sense would be, "and go into the sea; into the sea go the waters that
issue forth, and the waters shall be healed."

Healed - Every living thing (of which there were none before) shall
abound in the "healed" waters. The absence of living creatures in the
Dead Sea has been remarked by ancient and modern writers. So the water
which Jesus should give should bring life to the dead in trespasses and
sins. Compare [Joh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md); [Rev
22:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md).

[Ezekiel 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 47:9</span></span>

The rivers - literally, as in the margin. Perhaps with reference to the
circumstance that this "brook or river" is to come into the Dead Sea
through the same plain as the Jordan. The one river (Jordan) always
flowed, but now, when another river comes in, and "two rivers" flow into
the sea, the waters shall be healed.

[Ezekiel 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 47:10</span></span>

"En-gedi" (see [Sa1 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029).md) was about
the middle of the western shore of the Dead Sea.

En-eglaim does not occur elsewhere. Its form indicates that it was one
of the double cities of Moab (see [Eze
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009) note.md). It has been identified
with "Ain-el-Feshkah" to the north on the western bank of the Dead Sea.
On this supposition, "from En-eglaim to En-gedi" would be the line of
coast from the most northern fountain to the principal fountain
southward.

[Ezekiel 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 47:11</span></span>

The exception, which reserves for sterility places to which the living
water does not reach, probably indicates that the life and health are
solely due to the stream which proceeds from beneath the throne of God.
Compare [Isa 57:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 47:13</span></span>

The ideal reallotment of the land to the twelve tribes of Israel is
found in Ezek. 47:13-48:14.

The special mention of Joseph's portions was in order to express that
the twelve portions were to be exclusive of Levi's land, which was to be
provided out of the "oblation."

[Ezekiel 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 47:14</span></span>

As well as - Or, as. Ezekiel is speaking of "tribes," not "individuals."
Each tribe is to have an equal "breadth" of land assigned to it.

[Ezekiel 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 47:15</span></span>

The borders of the land follow closely Num. 34, where they begin from
the south, as the people came up from Egypt; in Ezekiel, they begin from
the north, as they might return from Babylon. The occupation is ideal,
but is grounded, as usual, on an actual state of things.

The border of the land toward the north - Names of places in the actual
northern border are given (marginal references) not to mark exact
geographical position, but to show that the original promise will be
fulfilled.

The way of Hethlon, was probably the defile between the ranges of
Libanus and Anti-libanus, from the sea to Hamath. "Hamath" [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002.md), at the foot of Mount Hermon, on
the Orontes. was the ancient capital of the Hittites. Its Scripture
history may be traced in [Gen 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018.md);
[Sa2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009.md); [Kg2
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md). It was never included in the
possessions of Israel. The border ran considerably south of the town at
the "entrance of Hamath," the northern opening of Coele-Syria.

[Ezekiel 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 47:16</span></span>

"Berothah," probably the same as "Berothai" (marginal reference), lay
between Hamath and Damascus, as did "Sibraim."

"Hazar-hatticon" is probably, as in the margin, "the middle Hazar," to
distinguish it from Hazar-enan [Eze
47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md).

[Ezekiel 47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 47:17</span></span>

And the north ... - Or, "and on the north, the border on the north shall
be" etc.

[Ezekiel 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 47:18</span></span>

The eastern boundary is to commence by separating off the territory of
Damascus and Hauran, and then to follow the line of the Jordan to the
Dead Sea. Further, the land occupied by the trans-Jordanic tribes was
also to be separated off from the land of Israel. The trans-Jordanic
tribes in fact occupied their ground (in Joshua's allotment) by
sufferance. This did not belong to Canaan proper, the land of promise.
Hence, the tribes, formerly on the east of the Jordan, have here
allotments in Canaan, though "the oblation" [Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md) extends to a considerable
distance beyond the Jordan (see Plan, Ezek. 48). The whole arrangement
being ideal and symbolic, the vision here, as in the case of "the
waters" ([Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001) note.md), departs from
the physical features of the land for the purpose of maintaining
symbolic numbers.

[Ezekiel 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 47:19</span></span>

The south border (compare [Num 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004).md)
commences with "Tamar," probably a village near the southern end of the
Dead Sea. The word means "palm-tree;" and is given to more than one city
in the holy land.

The river to the great sea - literally, "riverward to the great sea." By
the "river" is meant the torrent-stream entering the Mediterranean near
"Rhinocolura" (El Arish).

[Ezekiel 47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 47:22</span></span>

And to the strangers - Here is quite a new feature in the distribution
of the land. Not only the Israelites by descent, but those who join
themselves to Israel by allegiance to the true God, shall have a right
of inheritance. Here are opened out the blessings which were to accrue
to the Gentiles through the seed of Abraham. Compare [Rom
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024.md), following. The difference which
existed under the old covenant between Jew and Gentile is now at last
done away. But while pagandom thus unites itself with God's people,
Israel is still as ever the chosen people, the center of this union. No
new Church is founded side by side with the old. Pagandom is absorbed in
Israel - the standard which God has set up for the nations - i. e., in
the One True Church, which has subsisted from the beginning, and will
subsist in eternity.
