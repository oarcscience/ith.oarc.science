### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 19:10</span></span>

David fled - This was the beginning of David's life as a fugitive and
outcast, though for no "offence or fauIt" of his ([Psa
59:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#003), Prayer Book Version.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 19:11</span></span>

Saul's plan was to surround the house at night, and to have David killed
as soon as he came abroad unsuspectingly in the morning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 19:13</span></span>

An image - "Teraphim" (see the margin), an image, or bust in human form,
and as large as life, of a kind of household god, to the worship of
which the Israelites, and especially women, were much addicted.

A pillow - It was probably a quilt or blanket of goats' hair and of
common use as a bed-covering. Whether Michal drew it over the head of
the teraphim, as if for warmth, and so covered it, or whether she
disposed it about the head so as to look like hair, is not clear.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 19:17</span></span>

Why should I kill thee? - To avert Saul's anger from herself, she
pretended that David had threatened her life unless she facilitated his
escape.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 19:18</span></span>

No such place as Naioth (or Nevaioth) is known, but the word means
"dwellings." Hence, it is considered that Naioth was the name of the
collegiate residence of the prophets, in, or just outside, Ramah, to
which Samuel removed with David from his own house, for greater safety,
owing to the sanctity of the place and company.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 19:20</span></span>

Samuel standing as appointed - Rather, "as Overseer, or leader."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 19:22</span></span>

To a great well - Some large well-known cistern at Sechu, the site of
which is uncertain, which Saul passed on his way from Gibeah to Ramah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 19:24</span></span>

Naked - i. e., without his robe and other outer garments, but only the
shirt. Compare the marginal references.

The whole history affords another instance of the protection of God
vouchsafed to His servants, which forms so frequent a topic of the
Psalms of David.
