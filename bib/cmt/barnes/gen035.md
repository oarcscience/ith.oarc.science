This chapter contains the return of Jacob to his father's house, and
then appends the death of Isaac.

[Gen 35:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

Jacob returns to Bethel. "And God said unto Jacob." He receives the
direction from God. He had now been six years lingering in Sukkoth and
Sleekem. There may have been some contact between him and his father's
house during this interval. The presence of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, in
his family, is a plain intimation of this. But Jacob seems to have
turned aside to Shekem, either to visit the spot where Abraham first
erected an altar to the Lord, or to seek pasture for his numerous
flocks. "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there." In his perplexity and
terror the Lord comes to his aid. He reminds him of his former
appearance to him at that place, and directs him to erect an altar
there. This was Abraham's second resting-place in the land. He who had
there appeared to Jacob as the Yahweh, the God of Abraham and Isaac, is
now described as (house of El), the Mighty One, probably in allusion to
Bethel (house of El), which contains this name, and was at that time
applied by Jacob himself to the place. "His house;" his wives and
children. "All that were with him;" his men-servants and maid-servants.

The strange gods, belonging to the stranger or the strange land. These
include the teraphim, which Rachel had secreted, and the rings which
were worn as amulets or charms. Be clean; cleanse the body, in token of
the cleaning of your souls. Change your garments; put on your best
attire, befitting the holy occasion. The God, in contradistinction to
the strange gods already mentioned. Hid them; buried them. "The oak
which was by Shekem." This may have been the oak of Moreh, under which
Abraham pitched his tent [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md).
The terror of God; a dread awakened in their breast by some indication
of the divine presence being with Jacob. The patriarch seems to have
retained possession of the land he had purchased and gained by conquest,
in this place. His flocks are found there very shortly after this time
[Gen 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#012.md), he alludes to it, and
disposes of it in his interview with Joseph and his sons [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md), and his well is there to this
day.

"Luz, which is in the land of Kenaan." This seems at first sight to
intimate that there was a Luz elsewhere, and to have been added by the
revising prophet to determine the place here intended. Luz means an
almond tree, and may have designated many a place. But the reader of
Genesis could have needed no such intimation, as Jacob is clearly in the
land of Kenaan, going from Shekem to Hebron. It seems rather to call
attention again [Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md) to the fact
that Jacob has returned from Padan-aram to the land of promise. The name
Luz still recurs, as the almond tree may still be flourishing. "And he
built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el." Thus has Jacob
obeyed the command of God, and begun the payment of the vow he made
twenty-six years before at this place [Gen
38:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#020.md). "There God revealed himself
unto him." The verb here נגלוּ nı̂glû is plural in the Masoretic Hebrew,
and so it was in the copy of Onkelos. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the
Septuagint have the singular. The reading is therefore, various. The
original was probably singular, and may have been so even with its
present letters. If not, this is one of the few instances in which
Elohim is construed grammatically with a plural verb. Deborah dies in
the family in which she began life. She is buried under "the well-known
oak" at Bethel. Jacob drops a natural tear of sorrow over the grave of
this faithful servant, and hence, the oak is called the oak of weeping.
It is probable that Rebekah was already dead, since otherwise we should
not expect to find Deborah transferred to Jacob's household. She may not
have lived to see her favorite son on his return.

[Gen 35:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#009.md)

God appears to Jacob again at Bethel, and renews the promise made to him
there [Gen 28:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md). Again. The writer
here refers to the former meeting of God with Jacob at Bethel, and
thereby proves himself cognizant of the fact, and of the record already
made of it. "When he went out of Padan-aram." This corroborates the
explanation of the clause, [Gen 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#006.md),
"which is in the land of Kenaan." Bethel was the last point in this land
that was noticed in his flight from Esau. His arrival at the same point
indicates that he has now returned from Padan-aram to the land of
Kenaan. "He called his name Israel." At Bethel he renews the change of
name, to indicate that the meetings here were of equal moment in Jacob's
spiritual life with that at Penuel. It implies also that this life had
been declining in the interval between Penuel and Bethel, and had now
been revived by the call of God to go to Bethel, and by the interview.

The renewal of the naming aptly expresses this renewal of spiritual
life. "I am God Almighty." So he proclaimed himself before to Abraham
[Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md). "Be fruitful, and
multiply." Abraham and Isaac had each only one son of promise. But now
the time of increase is come. Jacob has been blessed with eleven sons,
and at least one daughter. And now he receives the long-promised
blessing, "be fruitful and multiply." From this time forth the
multiplication of Israel is rapid. In twenty-six years after this time
he goes down into Egypt with seventy souls, besides the wives of his
married descendants, and two hundred and ten years after that Israel
goes out of Egypt numbering about one million eight hundred thousand. "A
nation and a congregation of nations," such as were then known in the
world, had at the last date come of him, and "kings" were to follow in
due time. The land, as well as the seed, is again promised.

Jacob now, according to his wont, perpetuates the scene of divine
manifestation with a monumental stone. "God went up;" as he went up from
Abraham [Gen 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#022.md) after a similar
conferencc with him. He had now spoken to Jacob face to face, as he
communed with Abraham. "A pillar" in the place where he talked with him,
a consecrated monument of this second interview, not in a dream as
before, but in a waking vision. On this he pours a drink-offering of
wine, and then anoints it with oil. Here, for the first time, we meet
with the libation. It is possible there was such an offering when
Melkizedec brought forth bread and wine, though it is not recorded. The
drink-offering is the complement of the meat-offering, and both are
accompaniments of the sacrifice which is offered on the altar. They are
in themselves expressive of gratitude and devotion. Wine and oil are
used to denote the quickening and sanctifying power of the Spirit of
God. "Bethel." We are now familiar with the repetition of the naming of
persons and places. This place was already called Bethel by Jacob
himself; it is most likely that Abraham applied this name to it: and for
aught we know, some servant of the true God, under the Noachic covenant,
may have originated the name.

[Gen 17:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016.md).

On the journey, Rachel dies at the birth of her second son. "A stretch."
It was probably a few furlongs. "Fear not." The cause for encouragement
was that the child was born, and that it was a son. Rachel's desire and
hope expressed at the birth of Joseph were therefore, fulfilled [Gen
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#024.md). "When her soul was departing."
This phrase expresses not annihilation, but merely change of place. It
presupposes the perpetual existence of the soul. "Ben-oni," son of my
pain, is the natural expression of the departing Rachel. "Benjamin." The
right hand is the seat of power. The son of the right hand is therefore,
the child of power. He gave power to his father, as he was his twelfth
son, and so completed the number of the holy family. "Ephrath and
Beth-lehem" are names the origin of which is not recorded. "The pillar
of Rachel's grave." Jacob loves the monumental stone. "Unto this day."
This might have been written ten or twenty years after the event, and
therefore, before Jacob left Kenaan (see on [Gen
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037).md). The grave of Rachel was well
known in the time of Samuel [Sa1 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002.md),
and the Kubbet Rahil, dome or tomb of Rachel, stands perhaps on the
identical spot, about an English mile north of Bethlehem.

[Gen 35:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md)

Eder - The tower of the flock was probably a watch-tower where shepherds
guarded their flocks by night. It was a mile (Jerome) or more south of
Bethlehem. Here Reuben was guilty of the shameful deed which came to the
knowledge of his father, and occasions the allusion in [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md). He was by this act degraded from
his position in the holy family. The division of the open parashah in
the text here is more in accordance with the sense than that of the
verse.

[Gen 35:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md)

Jacob's return and his father's death. The family of Jacob is now
enumerated, because it has been completed by the birth of Benjamin. "In
Padan-aram." This applies to all of them but Benjamin; an exception
which the reader of the context can make for himself. Jacob at length
arrives with his whole establishment at Hebron, the third notable
station occupied by Abraham in the land [Gen
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md). Here also his father sojourns.
The life of Isaac is now closed. Joseph must have been, at the time of
Jacob's return, in his thirteenth year, and therefore, his father in his
hundred and fourth. Isaac was consequently in his hundred and
sixty-third year. He survived the return of Jacob to Hebron about
seventeen years, and the sale of Joseph his grandson about thirteen.
"Esau and Jacob his sons buried him." Hence, we learn that Esau and
Jacob continued to be on brotherly terms from the day of their meeting
at the ford of Jabbok.

This chapter closes the ninth of the pieces or documents marked off by
the phrase "these are the generations." Its opening event was the birth
of Isaac [Gen 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#019.md), which took place
in the hundreth year of Abraham, and therefore, seventy-five years
before his death recorded in the seventh document. As the seventh
purports to be the generations of Terah [Gen
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027.md) and relates to Abraham who was
his offspring, so the present document, containing the generations of
Isaac, refers chiefly to the sons of Isaac, and especially to Jacob, as
the heir of promise. Isaac as a son learned obedience to his father in
that great typical event of his life, in which he was laid on the altar,
and figuratively sacrificed in the ram which was his substitute. This
was the great significant passage in his life, after which he retires
into comparative tranquillity.
