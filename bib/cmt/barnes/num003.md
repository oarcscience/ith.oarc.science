### [Numbers Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

The "generations" (see [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004).md) now
given, though entitled those of Aaron and Moses (Aaron standing first as
the older brother), are those of Aaron only. The personal dignity of
Moses, though it gave him rank as at the head of his tribe, was not
hereditary. He had, and desired to have [Num
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md); [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md), no successor in his office but
the distant prophet like unto himself [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md). Aaron was the ancestor of a
regular succession of priests.

[Numbers 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 3:3</span></span>

whom he consecrated - i. e. whom Moses consecrated, or literally as in
the margin, whose "hand he filled," by conferring their office upon them
([Lev 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001) ff.md).

[Numbers 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 3:7</span></span>

keep his charge - i. e. so assist him that the obligations incumbent on
him and on the congregation may be fulfilled.

[Numbers 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 3:13</span></span>

The concluding words are better expressed thus: "Mine shall they be,
Mine, the Lord's." On the subject of the firstborn see the notes at [Num
3:43-51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043.md).

[Numbers 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 3:26</span></span>

the cords ... the service thereof - i. e. of the tabernacle, not of the
hangings of the court, for these, with their cords and other fittings,
belonged to the charge of the Merarites [Num
3:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md). The tabernacle was under the
care of the Gershonites.

[Numbers 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 3:27</span></span>

Of the Levites, the Kohathites, the kinsmen of Moses and Aaron, and the
most numerous, have the most important charge confided to them, namely,
that of the ark, the altars, and the more especially sacred furniture
generally.

[Numbers 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 3:39</span></span>

twenty and two thousand - A number on which the commutation with the
firstborn of the twelve tribes depends [Num
3:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043.md). The actual total of the male
Levites is 22,300 (compare [Num 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022.md),
[Num 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028.md), [Num
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#034).md): and the extra 300 are
considered by some to represent those who, being first-born themselves
in the tribe of Levi, could not be available to redeem the first-born in
other tribes. Others consider the difference due to an error in the
Hebrew text.

The tribe of Levi is shown by this census to have been by far the
smallest of the tribes.

[Numbers 3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">num 3:43</span></span>

This result, when compared with the number of male adults (603,550,
compare [Num 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#032).md), is small, the
usual proportion of first-born sons to a total male population being
about one in four: and the explanation offered is that the law of [Exo
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md), prescribed a dedication of
those only who should be firstborn "thenceforward".

On the other hand, the number is very large to be born among two
millions of persons in a single year; and it must be admitted, that some
unusual causes must have been concerned. Such, not to mention the divine
blessing, may be found in the sudden development of national energies
which would immediately ensue on the Exodus. Before that event, the
miserable estate of the people, and especially the inhuman order for the
destruction of their first-born, would check very seriously the ratio of
marriages and births; and this ratio would naturally, when the check was
removed, exhibit a sudden and striking increase.

[Numbers 3:44](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">num 3:44</span></span>

This redemption money (see the marginal references) would perhaps be
exacted from the parents of the "youngest" children of the 22,273 [Num
3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043.md). The cattle of the Levites was
doubtless taken in the gross as an equivalent for the first-born cattle
of the other tribes, which of course, no less than the first-born of
men, belonged to the Lord; and in future would have to be redeemed [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015.md); [Deu
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md).
