### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

And it came to pass ... - The working out of Nathan's prophecy (marginal
reference) is the clue to the course of the narrative. How long after
Absalom's return these events occurred we are not told.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 15:2</span></span>

Beside the way of the gate - See [Rut
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md) note.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 15:3</span></span>

To flatter each man by pronouncing a favorable verdict in his case, to
excite a sense of grievance and discontent by censuring the king for
remissness in trying the causes brought before him by his subjects, and
to suggest a sure and easy remedy for all such grievances, namely, to
make Absalom king; all this, coupled with great affability and courtesy,
which his personal beauty and high rank made all the more effective,
were the arts by which Absalom worked his way into favor with the
people, who were light and fickle as himself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 15:6</span></span>

Stole the hearts - i. e., deceived them, for so the same phrase means
[Gen 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#020.md), [Gen
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#026.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

Forty years - An obvious clerical error, though a very ancient one for
four years, which may date from Absalom's return from Geshur, or from
his reconciliation with David, or from the commencement of the criminal
schemes to which [Sa2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md) refers.

Hebron - This, as having been the old capital of David's kingdom and
Absalom's birthplace, was well chosen. It was a natural center, had
probably many inhabitants discontented at the transfer of the government
to Jerusalem, and contained many of the friends of Absalom's youth. As
the place of his birth (compare [Sa1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006).md), it afforded a plausible pretext
for holding there the great sacrificial feast ("the serving the Lord,"
[Sa2 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008).md), which Absalom pretended to
have vowed to hold to the glory of God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 15:12</span></span>

Ahithophel - It has been with great probability supposed that Ahithophel
was estranged from David by personal resentment for his conduct in the
matter of Bath-sheba and Uriah (see [Sa2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003).md).

While he offered sacrifices - Rather, that Absalom sent for Ahithophel
to be present when he offered the sacrifices; the intention being that
all who partook of the sacrifice should be bound together to prosecute
the enterprise. Absalom, too, would take advantage of the excitement of
the great feast to inflame the ardour of the guests, and pledge them
irrevocably to his cause.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 15:14</span></span>

And smite the city - David's kind nature induced him to spare Jerusalem
the horrors of a siege, and the risk of being taken by assault. He had
no standing army with which to resist this sudden attack from so
unexpected a quarter. Possibly too he remembered Nathan's prophecy [Sa2
12:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#010.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 15:18</span></span>

Passed on - Rather, "crossed" the Brook Kidron, as in [Sa2
15:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#022.md).

Gittites - During David's residence in the country of the Philistines he
attached such a band to himself; and after the settlement of his
kingdom, and the subjugation of the Philistines, the band received
recruits from Gath, perhaps with the king of Gath's consent. They were
now under the command of Ittai the Gittite, a foreigner [Sa2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md), and "his brethren" [Sa2
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020.md). The number 600 probably
indicates that this band or regiment of Gittites had its origin in
David's band of 600 [Sa1 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#013.md); [Sa1
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002.md). They were at first, it is
likely, all Israelites, then Gittites mixed with Israelites, and at last
all Gittites.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 15:20</span></span>

Thou camest but yesterday - Meaning, "Thou art not a native Israelite,
but only a sojourner for a few years, it is not reason therefore that
thou shouldst share my calamities. Return to thy place, thy adopted home
Jerusalem, and to the king, Absalom" [Sa2
15:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

Abiathar went up - i. e., continued to ascend the Mount of Olives.
Abiathar was high priest [Kg1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035.md).
Perhaps Zadok is addressed by David [Sa2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025.md) as the chief of those who were
actually bearing the ark.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 15:27</span></span>

Art not those a seer? - If the text be correct, the sense would be, "Art
thou not a seer? therefore go back to the city, and observe, and certify
me of what thou seest" [Sa2 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#028.md).
Others, by a slight alteration of the original text, read "Art not thou
a chief" (priest), etc.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 15:30</span></span>

His head covered - See the marginal references and [Jer
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003.md); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md); the sign of deep mourning.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 15:32</span></span>

Render ... "when David was come to the top of the mount where people
worship God." The top here, and in [Sa2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md), is used almost as a proper name.
No doubt there was a high-place upon the top of the Mount of Olives.
