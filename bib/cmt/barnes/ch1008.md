### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

The reason of this return to the genealogy of the Benjamites seems to be
the desire to connect the genealogical introduction with the historical
body of the work. As the history is to begin with Saul, the genealogical
portion is made to end with an account of the family of this Benjamite
monarch.

[1 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 8:6</span></span>

And they removed them to Manahath - "They" has no antecedent; and it is
difficult to supply one. Almost all commentators suppose that there has
been some corruption here, from which, however, we may gather that the
"sons of Ehud" (or, perhaps, of Ahoah, [Ch1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#004).md) were originally settled at Geba
([Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024) note.md), but afterward
removed to a place called Manahath, probably a town in the vicinity.
Gera [Ch1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007.md) directed the movement.

[1 Chronicles 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 8:8</span></span>

After he had sent them away - Translate it: "after he had divorced his
wives, Hushim and Baara."

[1 Chronicles 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md)

These dwelt in Jerusalem - Jerusalem was partly within the limits of the
tribe of Benjamin [Jos 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028.md); but we
do not hear of Benjamites inhabiting it until after the return from the
captivity [Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md); [Neh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004.md).

[1 Chronicles 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 8:33</span></span>

This verse combined with [Ch1 9:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md),
seems to show that the genealogy of Saul was:

Abiel (= Jehiel?) Ner Kish Abner Saul

Rather than that to be inferred from [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md); [Sa1
14:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050.md).

In [Sa1 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md) note, it is concluded
that Saul's second son bore the two names of "Ishui" and "Abinadab." But
the order of the names here:

\(1\) Jonathan;

\(2\) Malchi-shua; and

\(3\) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the
second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.

Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship
into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" בעל ba‛al had no bad sense in
Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary אל 'êl, "God"
([Ch1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001) note.md). Hence, there is
nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man
of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names
became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for
the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal,"
"Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the
like.

[1 Chronicles 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md)

Sons, and sons' sons - This genealogy of the house of Saul appears by
the number of the generations to belong probably to the time of Hezekiah
(compare [Ch1 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041).md). Ulam's "sons'
sons" are in the 13th generation from Jonathan, as Hezekiah is in the
13th generation from David.
