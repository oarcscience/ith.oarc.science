### [Isaiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 24:0</span></span>

The previous chapters, from the thirteenth to the twenty-third
inclusive, have been occupied mainly in describing the destruction of
nations that were hostile to the Jews, or great and distressing
calamities that would come ripen them. The prophet had thus successively
depicted the calamities that would come upon Babylon, Damascus, Moab,
Nubia, Egypt, Dumah, and Tyre. In Isa. 22, he had, however, described
the calamities which would come upon Judea and Jerusalem by the invasion
of Sennacherib.

In this chapter, the prophet returns to the calamities which would come
upon the people of God themselves. This chapter, and the three
following, to the end of the twenty-seventh, seem to have been uttered
about the same time, and perhaps may be regarded as constituting one
vision, or prophecy. So Noyes, Lowth, and Rosenmuller, regard it. If
these chapters be included in the prophecy, then it consists

\(1\) of a description of calamities in Isa. 24.

\(2\) of a song of praise expressive of deliverance from those
calamities, and of the consequent spread of the true religion, in [Isa
25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md);

\(3\) of a song of praise suitable to celebrate the triumphs of the true
religion in Isa. 26; and

\(4\) of the effect of tiffs deliverance in purifying the Jews in [Isa
27:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md).

When the prophecy was uttered is wholly unknown. In regard to the events
to which it relates, there has been a great diversity of opinion, and
scarcely are any two interpreters agreed. Grotius regards it as relating
to the carrying away of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser. Hensler supposes
that it refers to the invasion of Sennacherib. Vitringa supposes that it
relates to the times of the Maccabees, and to the trials and I
persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes. Noyes regards it as descriptive of
the destruction of the land by Nebuchadnezzar, and of the return of the
Jews from exile. Calvin considers the account in these four chapters as
a summing up, or recapitulation of what the prophet had said in the
previous prophecies respecting Babylon, Moab, Egypt, etc.; and then of
the prosperity, and of the spread of the true religion which would
succeed these general and far-spread devastations.

Subsequently to each of these predictions respecting calamity, the
prophet had foretold prosperity and the advance of truth; and he
supposes that this is a mere condensing or summing up of what he had
said more at length in the preceding chapters. Lowth supposes that it
may have a reference to all the great desolations of the country by
Shalmaneser, by Nebuchadnezzar, and by the Romans, especially to that of
the Romans, to which some parts of it, he says, seem to be especially
applicable. It is certain that the prophet employs general terms; and as
he gives no certain indications of the time, or the circumstances under
which it was delivered, it is exceedingly difficult to determine either.
The general drift of the prophecy is, however, plain. It is a prediction
of prosperity, and of the prevalence of true religion after a series of
oppressive judgments should have come upon the land. It is designed,
therefore, to be consolatory to the Jews under impending calamities, and
to convey the assurance that though they would be oppressed, yet their
sufferings would be succeeded by occasions of gratitude and joy. In this
respect, it accords with the general strain of the prophecies of Isaiah,
that the people of God would. be protected; that their name and nation
should not be wholly obliterated; and that the darkest seasons of trial
would be succeeded by deliverance and joy.

On the whole, it seems to me, that the prophecy relates to the
calamities that would come upon the nation by the invasion of
Nebuchadnezzar, and the carrying away to Babylon, and the subsequent
deliverance from the oppressive bondage, and the joy consequent on that.
According to this interpretation, the twenty-fourth chapter is occupied
mainly with the description of the calamities that would come upon the
land by the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar; the twenty-fifth describes the
deliverance from that oppressive bondage, and the re-establishment of
the true religion on Mount Zion, with a rapid glance at the ultimate
prevalence of religion trader the Messiah, suggested by the deliverance
from the Babylonian bondage; the twentysixth chapter is a song
expressive of joy at this signal deliverance - in language, in the main,
so general that it is as applicable to the redemption under the Messiah
as to the deliverance from Babylon; and the twenty-seventh chapter is
descriptive of the effect of this captivity and subsequent deliverance
in purifying Jacob [Isa 27:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md), and
recovering the nation to righteousness.

The twenty-fourth chapter is composed of three parts.

1\. [Isa 24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md) contains a
description of the calamities that would come upon the whole land,
amounting to far-spread and wide desolation - with a graphic description
of the effects of it on the inhabitants [Isa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md), on the land [Isa
24:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003.md), on the wine, the amusements,
the song, etc. [Isa 24:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007.md), causing
all gaiety and prosperity to come to an end.

2\. [Isa 24:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md) contains a statement
by the prophet that a few would be left in the land amidst the general
desolation, and that they would be filled with joy that they had
escaped. From their retreats and refuges, their fastnesses and places of
security, they would lift up the song of praise that they had been
preserved.

3\. [Isa 24:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md) contains a further
description of augmented judgment that would come upon the land - a more
severe and lengthened calamity stretching over the country, agitating it
like an earthquake. Yet there is even here [Isa
24:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022.md), an indication that there
would be deliverance, and that the Lord of hosts would reign on Mount
Zion - a description which is extended through the next chapter, and
which constitutes the scope and substance of that chapter.

In the division of the prophecy into chapters, that chapter should have
been connected with this as a part of the same prophecy, and a
continuance of the same subject. Indeed, but for the length of the
prophecy, these four chapters should have been thrown into one, or if
the prophecy had been broken up into chapters, important aids would have
been rendered to a correct understanding of it had there been some
indication in the margin that they constituted one prophecy or vision.

[Isaiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 24:1</span></span>

Maketh the earth empty - That is, will depopulate it, or take away its
inhabitants, and its wealth. The word 'earth' here (ארץ 'ārets) is used
evidently not to denote the whole world, but the land to which the
prophet particularly refers - the land of Judea. It should have been
translated the land (see [Joe 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002).md). It
is possible, however, that the word here may be intended to include so
much of the nations that surrounded Palestine as were allied with it, or
as were connected with it in the desolations under Nebuchadnezzar.

And turneth it upside down - Margin, 'Perverteth the face thereof.' That
is, everything is thrown into confusion; the civil and religious
institutions are disorganized, and derangement everywhere prevails.

And scattereth abroad ... - This was done in the invasion by the
Chaldeans by the carrying away of the inhabitants into their long and
painful captivity.

[Isaiah 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 24:2</span></span>

As with the people, so with the priest - This does not mean in moral
character, but in destiny. It does not mean that the character of the
priest would have any influence on that of the people, or that because
the one was corrupt the other would be; but it means that all would be
involved in the same calamity, and there would be no favored class that
would escape. The prophet, therefore, enumerate the various ranks of the
people, and shows that all classes would be involved in the impending
calamity.

As with the taker of usury - He who lends his money at interest. It was
contrary to the Mosaic law for one Israelite to take interest of another
[Lev 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md); [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md); [Neh
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#007.md), [Neh
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#010.md); but it is not probable that this
law was very carefully observed, and especially in the corrupt times
that preceded the Babylonian captivity.

[Isaiah 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 24:3</span></span>

The land - Hebrew, 'The earth,' as in [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md). It is here rendered correctly
'the land,' as it should have been there - meaning the land of Canaan.

And spoiled - Its valuable possessions shall become the prey of the
invading foe. This is an emphatic repetition of the declaration in [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md), to show the absolute certainty
of that which was threatened.

[Isaiah 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 24:4</span></span>

The earth mourneth - The word 'earth' here, as in [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md), means the land of Judea, or that
and so much of the adjacent countries as would be subject to the
desolation described. The figure here is taken from flowers when they
lose their beauty and languish; or when the plant that lacks moisture,
or is cut down, loses its vigor and its vitality, and soon withers
(compare the note at [Isa 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md); [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md); [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md).

The world - (תבל têbêl). Literally, the inhabitable world, but used here
as synonymous with the 'land,' and denoting the kingdoms of Judah and
Israel (compare the note at [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011).md)

The haughty people - Margin, as in the Hebrew, 'Height of the people.'
It denotes the great, the nobles, the princes of the land. The phrase is
expressive of rank, not of their moral character.

[Isaiah 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 24:5</span></span>

The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof - The statements
in this verse are given as a reason why the curse had been pronounced
against them, and why these calamities had come upon them, [Isa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md). The first reason is, that the
very earth become polluted by their crimes. This phrase may denote that
injustice and cruelty prevailed to such an extent that the very earth
was stained with gore, and covered with blood under the guilty
population. So the phrase is used in [Num
33:33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#033.md); [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md). Or it may mean in general that
the wickedness of the people was great, and was accumulating, and the
very earth under them was polluted by sustaining such a population. But
the former is probably the correct interpretation.

Changed the ordinance - Or, the statute (חק chôq). This word, from חקק
châqaq, to engrave, and then to make or institute a law or an ordinance,
is usually applied to the positive statutes appointed by Moses. The word
statute accurately expresses the idea. These they had changed by
introducing new statutes, and had in fact, if not in form, repealed the
laws of Moses, and introduced others.

Broken the everlasting covenant - The word 'covenant' here is evidently
used, as it is often, in the sense of law. By the term 'everlasting
covenant,' Vitringa correctly supposes is denoted the laws of nature,
the immutable laws of justice and right, which are engraven on the
conscience, and which are inflexible and perpetual.

[Isaiah 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 24:6</span></span>

Therefore hath the curse devoured - Eaten it up; a figurative expression
that is common in the Scriptures, denoting that the desolation is
widespread and ruinous.

Are burned - (חרוּ chârû). Instead of this reading, Lowth proposes to
read: חרבוּ chârebû 'Are destroyed.' The Septuagint reads it, 'Therefore
the inhabitants of the land shall be poor.' The Syriac, 'The inhabitants
of the land shall be slain.' But there is no authority from the
manuscripts to change the text as proposed by Lowth, Nor is it
necessary. The prophet does not mean that the inhabitants of the land
were consumed by fire. The expression is evidently figurative. He is
speaking of the effect of wrath or the curse, and that effect is often
described in the Scriptures as burning, or consuming, as a fire does.
The sense is, that the inhabitants of the land are brought under the
withering, burning, consuming effect of that wrath; and the same effects
are produced by it as are seen when a fire runs over a field or a
forest. Hence, the word here used (חרה chârâh, "to burn, to be kindled")
is often used in connection with wrath, to denote burning or raging
anger. [Exo 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md) : 'His anger burns.'
[Gen 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002.md) : 'And the anger of Jacob
was kindled against Rachel; [Gen
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md); [Job
27:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002.md); [Job
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007.md); [Gen
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#006.md) : 'His anger was kindled.' [Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md), [Psa
37:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md); [Pro
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#019.md) Compare [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md) :

My skin is black upon me,

And my bones are burnt with heat.

The sense is, that the inhabitants of the land were wasted away under
the wrath of God, so that few were left; as the trees of the forest are
destroyed before a raging fire.

And few men are left - This was literally true after the invasion of the
land by the Chaldeans [Kg2 24:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md).

[Isaiah 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 24:7</span></span>

The new wine languisheth - The new wine (תירושׁ tı̂yrôsh), denotes
properly must, or wine that was newly expressed from the grape, and that
was not fermented, usually translated 'new wine,' or 'sweet wine.' The
expression here is poetic. The wine languishes or mourns because there
are none to drink it; it is represented as grieved because it does not
perform its usual office of exhilarating the heart, and the figure is
thus an image of the desolation of the land.

The vine languisheth - It is sickly and unfruitful, because there are
none to cultivate it as formerly. The idea is, that all nature
sympathizes in the general calamity.

All the merry-hearted - Probably the reference is mainly to those who
were once made happy at the plenteous feast, and at the splendid
entertainments where wine abounded. They look now upon the widespread
desolation of the land, and mourn.

[Isaiah 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 24:8</span></span>

The mirth of tabrets - The joy and exultation which is produced by
tabrets. On the words 'tabret' (תף tôph) and 'harp' (כנור kinnôr), see
the notes at [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md).

[Isaiah 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 24:9</span></span>

drink wine with a song - That is, accompanied with a song, as the usual
mode was in their feasts.

Strong drink - On the word שׁכר shêkār see the note at [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md).

Shall be bitter ... - They shall cease to find pleasure in it in
consequence of the general calamitics that have come upon the nation.

[Isaiah 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 24:10</span></span>

The city of confusion - That Jerusalem is here intended there can be no
doubt. The name 'city of confusion.' is probably given to it by
anticipation of what it would be; that is, as it appeared in prophetic
vision to Isaiah (see the note at [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md). He gave to it a name that would
describe its state when these calamities should have come upon it. The
word rendered 'confusion' (תהו tôhû) does not denote disorder or
anarchy, but is a word expressive of emptiness, vanity, destitution of
form, waste. It occurs [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md) : 'And
the earth was without form.' In [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md), it is rendered 'the empty
place;' in [Sa1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021.md); [Isa
45:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md), 'in vain;' and usually
'emptiness,' 'vanity', 'confusion' (see [Isa
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010.md); [Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md); [Isa
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029).md). In [Job
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#024.md); [Psa
107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md), it denotes a wilderness. Here
it means that the city would be desolate, empty, and depopulated.

Is broken down - Its walls and dwellings are in ruins.

Every house is shut up - That is, either because every man, fearful of
danger, would fasten his doors so that enemies could not enter; or more
probably, the entrance to every house would be so obstructed by ruins as
to render it impossible to enter it.

[Isaiah 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 24:11</span></span>

There is a crying for wine in the streets - The inhabitants of the city,
turned from their dwellings, would cry for wine to alleviate their
distress, and to sustain them in their calamity (compare [Isa
16:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008).md).

All joy is darkened - Is gone, or has departed, like the joyful light at
the setting of the sun.

[Isaiah 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 24:12</span></span>

And the gate is smitten with destruction - The word rendered
'destruction' may denote 'a crash' (Gesenius). The idea is, that the
gates of the city, once so secure, are how battered down and demolished,
so that the enemy ran enter freely. Thus far is a description of the
calamities that would come upon the nation. The following verses show
that, though the desolation would be general, a few of the inhabitants
would be left - circumstance thrown in to mitigate the prospect. of the
impending ruin.

[Isaiah 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 24:13</span></span>

In the midst of the land - That is, in the midst of the land of Canaan.

There shall be as the shaking of an olive-tree - A few shall be left, as
in gathering olives a few will remain on the highest and outermost
boughs (see the notes at [Isa 17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 24:14</span></span>

They shall lift up their voice - They who are left in the land; or who
are not carried away to Babylon. 'To lift up the voice' in the
Scriptures may denote either grief or joy; compare [Gen
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006.md); [Sa1
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016.md); [Jdg
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#004.md); [Rut
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009.md), ..., where to lift up the voice
is conected with weeping; and [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md); [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md); [Isa
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#029.md); [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md), etc., where it is connected
with exultation and joy. The latter is evidently the idea here, that the
few who would escape from captivity by fleeing to neighboring countries,
would lift up their voice with exultation that they had escaped.

They shall sing for the majesty of the Lord - They shall sing on account
of the glory, or goodness of Yahweh, wire had so mercifully kept and
preserved them.

They shall cry aloud from the sea - From the isles and coasts of the
Mediterranean where they would have escaped, and where they would find a
refuge. No doubt many of the inhabitants adjacent to the sea, when they
found the land invaded, would betake themselves to the neighboring
islands, and find safety there until the danger should be overpast.
Lowth renders this,

'The waters shall resound with the exaltation of Jehovah,'

Where he supposes מים should be rendered as if pointed מים mayâm
'waters,' not as it is in the present Hebrew text, מים miyâm 'from the
sea.' The sense is not materially different; but there seems to be no
good reason for departing from the usual interpretation.

[Isaiah 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 24:15</span></span>

Wherefore glorify ye the Lord - The prophet, in this verse, calls upon
the people to join in the praise of Yahweh wherever they are scattered.
In the previous verse he describes the scattered few who were left in
the land, or who had escaped to the adjacent islands in the sea, as
celebrating the praises of God where they were. In this verse he calls
on all to join in this wherever they were scattered.

In the fires - Margin, 'Valleys.' The Septuagint reads, Ἐν τοῖς νήσοις
En tois nēsois - 'In the islands.' The Chaldee, 'Therefore, when light
shall come to the just, they shall glorify the Lord.' Lowth supposes
that the word: בארים bâ'uriym should have been באיים bâ'iyiym, 'in the
islands,' or 'coasts.' But the MSS. do not give authority for this
reading; the only authority which Lowth refers to being that of the
Septuagint. Other conjectures have been made by others, but all without
any authority from MSS. The Hebrew world in the plural form does not
occur elsewhere in the Scriptures. The proper signification of the word
אור 'ôr is light, and it is applied

\(a\) to daylight, or daybreak, [Sa1
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md); [Neh
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#003.md);

\(b\) to light from daybreak to mid-day, [Job
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#014.md);

\(c\) the sun, [Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md); [Job
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md);

\(d\) light as the emblem of happiness;

\(e\) light as the emblem of knowledge is also used to denote fire, [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md); [Isa
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#016.md); [Isa
47:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#014.md),

In the plural form it is applied, in connection with the word "Thummim,"
to the gems or images which were on the breastplate of the high priest,
and from which responses were obtained. [Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030.md) : 'And thou shalt put in the
breastplate of judgment the Urim (האוּרים hâ'ûriym) and the Thummim'
(compare [Lev 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#008.md); [Ezr
2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063).md). Probably it was thus used to
denote the splendor or beauty of the gems there set, or perhaps the
light or instruction which was the result of consulting the oracle. The
proper meaning of the word is, however, light, and it usually and
naturally suggests the idea of the morning light, the aurora; perhaps,
also, the northern light, or the aurora borealis. It in no instance
means caves, or valleys. Vitringa supposed it referred to caves, and
that the address was to the "Troglodytes," or those who had been driven
from their homes, and compelled to take up their residence in caves. The
word probably refers either to the regions of the morning light, the
rising of the sun; or of the northern light, the aurora borealis; and in
either case, the reference is doubtless to those who would be carried
away to Babylon, and who were called on there by the prophet to glorify
God. 'In those regions of light, where the morning dawns; or where the
northern skies are illuminated at night, there glorify God' (see the
note at [Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md). The reasons for
this opinion are,

\(1\) That such is the natural and proper sense of the word. It properly
refers to light, and not to caves, to valleys, or to islands.

\(2\) The parallelism, the construction, demands such an interpretation.

It would then be equivalent to calling on the scattered people to
glorify God in the East, and in the West; in the regions of the rising
sun and in the coasts of the sea; or wherever they were scattered. And
the sense is,

\(1\) that they should be encouraged to do this by the prospect of a
return;

\(2\) that it was their duty still to do this wherever they were; and

\(3\) that the worship of the true God would be in fact continued and
celebrated, though his people were scattered, and driven to distant
lands.

In the isle of the sea - The coasts and islands of the Mediterranean
[Isa 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014).md)

[Isaiah 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 24:16</span></span>

From the uttermost part of the earth - The word 'earth' here seems to be
taken in its usual sense, and to denote countries without the bounds of
Palestine, and the phrase is equivalent to remote regions or distant
countries (see the note at [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md). The prophet here represents
himself as hearing those songs from distant lands as a grand chorus, the
sound of which came in upon and pervaded Palestine. The worship of God
would be still continued, though the temple should be destroyed, the
inhabitants of the land dispersed, and the land of Judea be a widespread
desolation. Amidst the general wreck and woe, it was some consolation
that the worship of Yahweh was celebrated anywhere.

Have we heard songs - Or, we do hear songs. The distant celebrations of
the goodness of God break on the ear, and amidst the general calamity
these songs of the scattered people of God comfort the heart.

Glory to the righteous - This is the burden and substance of those
songs. Their general import and design is, to show that there shall be
honor to the people of God. They are now afflicted and scattered. Their
temple is destroyed, their land waste, and ruin spreads over the graves
of their fathers. Yet amidst these desolations, their confidence in God
is unshaken; their reliance on him is firm. They still believe that
there shall be honor and glory to the just, and that God will be their
protector and avenger. These assurances served to sustain them in their
afflictions, and to shed a mild and cheering influence on their saddened
hearts.

But I said - But I, the prophet, am constrained to say. This the prophet
says respecting himself, viewing himself as left in the land of Canaan;
or more probably he personifies, in this declaration, Jerusalem, and the
inhabitants of the land that still remained there. The songs that came
in from distant lands; the echoing praises from the exiles in the east
and the west seeming to meet and mingle over Judea, only served to
render the abounding desolation more manifest and distressing. Those
distant praises recalled the solemn services of the temple, and the
happiness of other times, and led each one of those remaining, who
witnessed the desolations, to exclaim, 'my leanness.'

My leanness, my leanness - The language of Jerusalem, and the land of
Judea. This language expresses calamity. The loss of flesh is emblematic
of a condition of poverty, want, and wretchedness - as sickness and
affliction waste away the flesh, and take away the strength; [Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024.md) :

My knees are weak through fasting,

And my flesh faileth of fatness.

[Psa 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md) :

By reason of the voice of my groaning

My bones cleave to my flesh.

See also [Job 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#012.md); [Job
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020.md); [Lam
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#004.md). Leanness is also put to denote
the displeasure of God, in [Psa 106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md)
:

And he gave them their request;

But sent leanness into their soul.

Compare [Isa 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md).

The treacherous dealers - The foreign nations that disregard covenants
and laws; that pursue their object by deceit, and stratagem, and fraud.
Most conquests are made by what are called the stratagems of war; that
is, by a course of perfidy and deception. There can be no doubt that the
usual mode of conquest was pursued in regard to Jerusalem. This whole
clause is exceedingly emphatic. The word implying treachery (בגד bâgad)
is repeated no less than five times in various forms in this single
clause, and shows how strongly the idea had taken possession of the mind
of the prophet. The passage furnishes one of the most remarkable
examples of the "paronomasia" occurring in the Bible. בגדוּ בגדים בגדוּ
וּבגד בוגדים bâgâdû bogidiym bâgâdû ûbeged bôgediym. In fact, this
figure abounds so much in this chapter that Gesenius contends that it is
not the production of Isaiah, but a composition belonging to a later and
less elegant period of Hebrew literature.

[Isaiah 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 24:17</span></span>

Fear, and the pit - This verse is an explanation of the cause of the
wretchedness referred to in the previous verse. The same expression is
found in [Jer 48:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043.md), in his account of
the destruction that would come upon Moab, a description which Jeremiah
probably copied from Isaiah - There is also here in the original a
"paronomasia" that cannot be retained in a translation - פחד ופחת ופח
pachad vâpachath vâpach - where the form פח pach occurs in each word.
The sense is, that they were nowhere safe; that if they escaped one
danger, they immediately fell into another. The expression is equivalent
to that which occurs in the writings of the Latin classics:

Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdin.

The same idea, that if a man should escape from one calamity he would
fall into another, is expressed in another form in [Amo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md) :

As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him;

Or went into a house, and leaned his hand on the wall,

And a serpent bit him.

In the passage before us, there is an advance from one danger to
another, or the subsequent one is more to be dreaded than the preceding.
The figure is taken from the mode of taking wild beasts, where various
nets, toils, or pitfalls were employed to secure them. The word 'fear'
(פחד pachad), denotes anything that was used to frighten or arouse the
wild beasts in hunting, or to drive them into the pitfall that was
prepared for them. Among the Romans the name 'fears' ("formidines") was
given to lines or cords strung with feathers of all colors, which, when
they fluttered in the air or were shaken, frightened the beasts into the
pits, or the birds into the snares which were prepared to take them
(Seneca, De Ira, ii. 122; virg. AE. xii. 7499; Geor. iii. 372). It is
possible that this may be referred to here under the name of 'fear.' The
word 'pit' (פחת pachat) denotes the pitfall; a hole dug in the ground,
and covered over with bushes, leaves, etc., into which they might fall
unawares. The word 'snare' (פח pach) denotes a net, or gin, and perhaps
refers to a series of nets enclosing at first a large space of ground,
in which the wild beasts were, and then drawn by degrees into a narrow
compass, so that they could not escape.

[Isaiah 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 24:18</span></span>

From the noise of the fear - A cry or shout was made in hunting,
designed to arouse the game, and drive it to the pitfall. The image
means here that calamities would be multiplied in all the land, and that
if the inhabitants endeavored to avoid one danger they would fall into
another.

And he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit - A figure taken still
from hunting. It was possible that some of the more strong and active of
the wild beasts driven into the pitfall would spring out, and attempt to
escape, yet they might be secured by snares or gins purposely contrived
for such an occurrence. So the prophet says, that though a few might
escape the calamities that would at first threaten to overthrow them,
yet they would have no security. They would immediately fall into
others, and be destroyed.

For the windows on high are open - This is evidently taken from the
account of the deluge in [Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md) :
'In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
great deep broken up, and the windows (or flood-gates, Margin) of heaven
were opened.' The word 'windows' here (ארבות 'ărubôth) is the same which
occurs in Genesis, and properly denotes a grate, a lattice, a window,
and then any opening, as a sluice or floodgate, and is applied to a
tempest or a deluge, because when the rain descends, it seems like
opening sluices or floodgates in the sky. The sense here is, that
calamities had come upon the nation resembling the universal deluge.

And the foundations of the earth do shake - An image derived from an
earthquake - a figure also denoting far-spreading calamities.

[Isaiah 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 24:19</span></span>

The earth is utterly broken down - The effect as it were of an
earthquake where everything is thrown into commotion and ruin.

The earth is moved exceedingly - Everything in this verse is intense and
emphatic. The verbs are in the strongest form of emphasis: 'By breaking,
the land is broken;' 'by scattering, the land is scattered;' 'by
commotion, the land is moved.' The repetition also of the expression in
the same sense three times, is a strong form of emphasis; and the whole
passage is designed to denote the utter desolation and ruin that had
come upon the land.

[Isaiah 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 24:20</span></span>

The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard - This is descriptive of
the agitation that occurs in an earthquake when everything is shaken
from its foundation, and when trees and towers are shaken by the mighty
concussion. The same figure is used in [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md). See also the description of a
tempest at sea, in [Psa 107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027.md) :

They reel to and fro,

And stagger like a drunken man,

And are at their wit's end.

And shall be removed like a cottage - Or rather, shall move or vacillate
(התנודדה hitenôdedâh) like a cottage. The word "cottage" (מלוּנה melûnâh
from לין lı̂yn, "to pass the night, to lodge for a night") means properly
a temporary shed or lodge for the watchman of a garden or vineyard (see
the note at [Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). Sometimes these
cottages were erected in the form of a hut; and sometimes they were a
species of hanging bed or couch, that was suspended from the limbs of
trees. They were made either by interweaving the limbs of a tree, or by
suspending them by cords from the branches of trees, or by extending a
cord or cords from one tree to another, and laying a couch or bed on the
cords. They were thus made to afford a convenient place for observation,
and also to afford security from the access of wild beasts. Travelers in
the East even now resort to such a temporary lodge for security (see
Niebuhr's Description of Arabia). These lodges were easily moved to and
fro, and swung about by the wind - and this is the idea in the verse
before us. The whole land was agitated as with an earthquake; it reeled
like a drunkard; it moved, and was unsettled, as the hanging couch on
the trees was driven to and fro by the wind.

And the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it - Like a vast
incumbent weight on a dwelling which it cannot sustain, and beneath
which it is crushed.

And it shall fall, and not rise again - This does not mean, as I
apprehend, that the nation should never be restored to its former
dignity and rank as a people, for the prophet immediately [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md) speaks of such a restoration,
and of the re-establishment of the theocracy; but it must mean that in
those convulsions it would not rise. It would not be able to recover
itself; it would certainly be prostrated. As we say of a drunkard, he
may stumble often, and partially recover himself, yet he will certainly
fall so as not then to be able to recover himself, so it would be with
that agitated and convulsed land. They would make many efforts to
recover themselves, and they would partially succeed, yet they would
ultimately be completely prostrate in the dust.

[Isaiah 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 24:21</span></span>

In that day - In the time of the captivity at Babylon.

Shall punish - Hebrew as the Margin, 'Shall visit upon' (see the note at
[Isa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012).md).

The host of the high ones - There have been various interpretations of
this expression. Jerome understands it of the host of heaven, and thinks
it refers to the fact that in the day of judgment God will judge not
only earthly things but celestial, and especially the sun and moon and
stars, as having 'been the objects of idolatrous worship (see [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Dan
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md); [Dan
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#013).md). Compare [Psa
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md); [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md), where the words 'on high' are
used to denote heaven. Aben Ezra supposes that by the phrase is meant
angels, who preside over the governors and kings of the earth, in
accordance with the ancient opinion that each kingdom was under the
tutelage of guardian angels. To this Rosenmuller seems to assent, and to
suppose that the beings thus referred to were evil spirits or demons to
whom the kingdoms of the world were subject. Others, among whom is
Grotius, have supposed that the reference is to the images of the sun,
moon, and stars, which were erected in high places, and worshipped by
the Assyrians. But probably the reference is to those who occupied
places of power and trust in the ecclesiastical arrangement of Judea,
the high priest and priests, who exercised a vast dominion over the
nation, and who, in many respects, were regarded as elevated even over
the kings and princes of the land. The comparison of rulers with the
sun, moon, and stars, is common in the Scriptures; and this comparison
was supposed especially to befit ecclesiastical rulers, who were
regarded as in a particular manner the lights of the nation.

Upon the earth - Beneath, or inferior to those who had places of the
highest trust and honor. The ecclesiastical rulers are represented as
occupying the superior rank; the princes and rulers in a civil sense as
in a condition of less honor and responsibility. This was probably the
usual mode in which the ecclesiastical and civil offices were estimated
in Judea.

[Isaiah 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 24:22</span></span>

And they shall be gathered together - That is, those who occupy posts of
honor and influence in the ecclesiastical and civil polity of the land.
"As prisoners." Margin, as in the Hebrew, 'With the gathering of
prisoners.' The reference is to the custom of collecting captives taken
in war, and chaining them together by the hands and feet, and thrusting
them in large companies into a prison.

In the pit - Margin, 'Dungeon.' The sense is, that he rulers of the land
should be made captive, and treated as prisoners of war. This was
undoubtedly true in the captivity under Nebuchadnezzar. The people were
assembled; were regarded as captives; and were conveyed together to a
distant land.

And shall be shut up in the prison - Probably this is not intended to be
taken literally, but to denote that they would be as secure as if they
were shut up in prison. Their prison-house would be Babylon, where they
were enclosed as in a prison seventy years.

And after many days - If this refers, as I have supposed, to the
captivity at Babylon, then these 'many days' refer to the period of
seventy years.

Shall they be visited - Margin, 'Found wanting.' The word used here (פקד
pâqad) may be used either in a good or bad sense, either to visit for
the purpose of reviewing, numbering, or aiding; or to visit for the
purpose of punishing. It is probably, in the Scriptures, most frequently
used in the latter sense (see [Sa1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002.md); [Job
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#014.md); [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md); [Psa
89:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md); [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md); [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024).md). But it is often used in the
sense of taking account of, reviewing, or mustering as a military host
(see [Num 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#044.md); [Num
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md); [Kg1
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#015.md); [Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004).md). In this place it may be taken
in either of these senses, as may be best supposed to suit the
connection. To me it seems that the connection seems to require the idea
of a visitation for the purpose of relief or of deliverance; and to
refer to the fact that at the end of that time there would be a
reviewing, a mustering, an enrollment of those who should have been
carried away to their distant prison-house, to ascertain how many
remained, and to marshal them for their return to the land of their
fathers (see the books of Ezra and Nehemiah). The word here used has
sometimes the sense expressed in the margin, 'found wanting' (compare
[Sa1 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006.md); [Sa1
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#015.md); [Isa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010).md); but such a sense does not suit
the connection here. I regard the verse as an indication of future mercy
and deliverance. They would be thrown into prison, and treated as
captives of war; but after a long time they would be visited by the
Great Deliverer of their nation, their covenant-keeping God, and
reconducted to the land of their fathers.

[Isaiah 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 24:23</span></span>

Then the moon shall be confounded - The heavenly bodies are often
employed in the sacred writings to denote the princes and kings of the
earth. These expressions are not to be pressed ad unguem as if the sun
denoted one thing and the moon another; but they are general poetic
expressions designed to represent rulers, princes, and magistrates of
all kinds (compare [Eze 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md); [Joe
2:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030).md).

Shall be confounded - Shall be covered with shame. That is, shall appear
to shine with diminished beauty, as if it were ashamed in the superior
glory that would shine around it. The sense is, that when the people
should be returned to their land, the theocracy would be restored, and
the magnificence of the kings and other civil rulers would be dimmed in
the superior splendor of the reign of God. Probably there is reference
here to the time when Yahweh would reign in Jerusalem through, or by
means of, the messiah.

In Mount Zion - (see the note at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). This would take place
subsequently to the captivity, and pre-eminently under the reign of the
messiah.

And before his ancients - That is, before the elders of the people; in
the presence of those entrusted with authority and rule.

Gloriously - He would reign gloriously when his laws should be respected
and obeyed; when his character as King and Ruler should be developed;
and when, under his scepter, his kingdom should be augmented and
extended. On this glad prospect the eye of the prophet was fixed; and
this was the bright and splendid object in the 'vision' that served to
relieve the darkness that was coming upon the nation. Present calamities
may be borne, with the hope that Yahweh will reign more gloriously
hereafter; and when the effect of all shall be such as to exalt Yahweh
in the view of the nations. It may be added that when Yahweh, by the
Messiah, shall reign over all the earth, all the glory of princes and
monarchs shall be dimmed; the celebrity of their wisdom and power and
plans shall be obscured in the superior splendor of the wisdom of God,
in reigning through his Son over the human race. Come that blessed day;
and speedily let the glory of the moon be confounded, and the sun be
ashamed, and all inferior magnificence t fade away before the splendor
of the Sun of righteousness!
