### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

The prophet had declared that evil should come down on Samaria and
Jerusalem for their sins. He had pronounced them sinners against God; he
now speaks of their hard unlovingness toward man, as our Blessed Lord in
the Gospel speaks of sins against Himself in His members, as the ground
of the condemnation of the wicked. The time of warning is past. He
speaks as in the person of the Judge, declaring the righteous judgments
of God, pronouncing sentence on the hardened, but blessing on those who
follow Christ. The sins thus visited were done with a high hand; first,
with forethought:

Woe - All woe, woe from God ; "the woe of temporal captivity; and,
unless ye repent, the woe of eternal damnation, hangeth over you." Woe
to them that devise iniquity. They devise it , "they are not led into it
by others, but invent it out of their own hearts." They plot and
forecast and fulfill it even in thought, before it comes to act. And
work evil upon their beds. Thoughts and imaginations of evil are works
of the soul [Psa 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md). "Upon their
beds" (see [Psa 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004).md), which ought to
be the place of holy thought, and of communing with their own hearts and
with God [Psa 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md). Stillness must be
filled with thought, good or bad; if not with good, then with bad. The
chamber, if not the sanctuary of holy thoughts, is filled with unholy
purposes and imaginations. Man's last and first thoughts, if not of
good, are especially of vanity and evil. The Psalmist says, "Lord, have
I not remembered Thee in my bed, and thought upon Thee when I was
waking?" [Psa 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#006.md). These men thought
of sin on their bed, and did it on waking. When the morning is light,
literally in the light of the morning, that is, instantly, shamelessly,
not shrinking from the light of day, not ignorantly, but knowingly,
deliberately, in full light. Nor again through infirmity, but in the
wantonness of might, because it is in the power of their hand , as, of
old, God said, "This they begin to do, and now nothing will be
restrained from them which they have imagined to do" [Gen
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md). Rup.: "Impiously mighty, and
mighty in impiety."

Lap.: See the need of the daily prayer, "Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us
this day without sin;" and "Almighty God, who hast brought us to the
beginning of this day, defend us in the same by Thy mighty power, that
we may fall into no sin, etc." The illusions of the night, if such be
permitted, have no power against the prayer of the morning.

[Micah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 2:2</span></span>

And they covet fields and take them by violence - (rend them away) and
houses, and take them away Still, first they sin in heart, then in act.
And yet, with them, to covet and to rob, to desire and to take, are the
same. They were prompt, instantaneous, without a scruple, in violence.
So soon as they coveted, they took. Desired, acquired! Coveted, robbed!
"They saw, they coveted, they took," had been their past history. They
did violence, not to one only, but, touched with no mercy, to whole
families, their little ones also; they oppressed a man and his house.
They spoiled pot goods only, but life, a man and his inheritance;
destroying him by false accusations or violence and seizing upon his
inheritance . Thus, Ahab first coveted Naboth's vineyard, then, through
Jezebel, slew him; and , "they who devoured widow's houses, did at the
last plot by night against Him of whom they said, Come, let us kill Him,
and the inheritance shall be our's; and in the morning, they practiced
it, leading Him away to Pilate." : "Who of us desires not the villas of
this world, forgetful of the possessions of Paradise? You see men join
field to field, and fence to fence. Whole places suffice not to the tiny
frame of one man." : "Such is the fire of concupiscence, raging within,
that, as those seized by burning fevers cannot rest, no bed suffices
them, so no houses or fields content these. Yet no more than seven feet
of earth will suffice them soon . Death only owns, how small the frame
of man."

[Micah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 2:3</span></span>

Such had been their habitual doings. They had done all this, he says, as
one continuous act, up to that time. They were habitually devisers of
iniquity, doers of evil. It was ever-renewed. By night they sinned in
heart and thought; by day, in act. And so he speaks of it in the
present. They do it. But, although renewed in fresh acts, it was one
unbroken course of acting. And so he also uses the form, in which the
Hebrews spoke of uninterrupted habits, They have coveted, they have
robbed, they have taken. Now came God's part.

Therefore, thus saith the Lord - Since they oppress whole families,
behold I will set Myself against this whole family ; since they devise
iniquity, behold I too, Myself, by Myself, in My own Person, am
devising. Very awful is it, that Almighty God sets His own Infinite
Wisdom against the devices of man and employs it fittingly to punish. "I
am devising no common punishment, but one to bow them down without
escape; "an evil from which" - He turns suddenly to them, "ye shall not
remove your necks, neither shall ye go haughtily." Ribera: "Pride then
was the source of that boundless covetousness," since it was pride which
was to be bowed down in punishment. The punishment is proportioned to
the sin. They had done all this in pride; they should have the liberty
and self-will wherein they had wantoned, tamed or taken from them. Like
animals with a heavy yoke upon them, they should live in disgraced
slavery.

The ten tribes were never able to withdraw their necks from the yoke.
From the two tribes God removed it after the 70 years. But the same sins
against the love of God and man brought on the same punishment. Our Lord
again spake the woe against their covetousness [Luk
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013.md); [Luk
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039.md); [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md), [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md), [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md); [Mar
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#040.md). It still shut them out from the
service of God, or from receiving Him, their Redeemer. They still
spoiled the goods [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md) of their
brethren. In the last dreadful siege , "there were insatiable longings
for plunder, searching-out of the houses of the rich; murder of men and
insults of women were enacted as sports; they drank down what they had
spoiled, with blood." And so the prophecy was for the third time
fulfilled. They who withdraw from Christ's easy yoke of obedience shall
not remove from the yoke of punishment; they who, through pride, will
not bow down their necks, but make them stiff, shall be bent low, that
they go not upright or haughtily anymore [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md). The Lord alone shall be exalted
in that Day. For it is an evil time. Perhaps he gives a more special
meaning to the words of Amos [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013.md), that a time of moral evil will
be, or will end in, a time, full of evil, that is, of sorest calamity.

[Micah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 2:4</span></span>

In that day shall one take up a parable against you - The mashal or
likeness may, in itself, be any speech in which one thing is likened to
another:

1\) "figured speech,"

2\) "proverb," and, since such proverbs were often sharp sayings against
others,

3\) "taunting figurative speech."

But of the person himself it is always said, he "is made, becomes a
proverb" [Deu 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md); [Kg1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007.md); [Ch2
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#020.md); [Psa
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md); [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012.md); [Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md); [Eze
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#008.md). To take up or utter such a
speech against one, is, elsewhere, followed by the speech itself; "Thou
shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, ..."
[Isa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md). "Shall not all these take
up a parable against him, and say, ..." [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md). Although then the name of the
Jews has passed into a proverb of reproach (Jerome, loc. cit.), this is
not contained here. The parable here must be the same as the doleful
lamentation, or dirge, which follows. No mockery is more cutting or
fiendish, than to repeat in jest words by which one bemoans himself. The
dirge which Israel should use of themselves in sorrow, the enemy shall
take up in derision, as Satan does doubtless the self-condemnation of
the damned. Ribera: "Men do any evil, undergo any peril, to avoid shame.
God brings before us that deepest and eternal shame," the shame and
everlasting contempt, in presence of Himself and angels and devils and
the good [Psa 52:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), that we may avoid shame by
avoiding evil.

And lament with a doleful lamentation - The words in Hebrew are varied
inflections of a word imitating the sounds of woe. It is the voice of
woe in all languages, because the voice of nature. Shall wail a wail of
woe, It is the funeral dirge over the dead [Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md), or of the living doomed to die
[Eze 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md); it is sometimes the
measured mourning of those employed to call forth sorrow [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md); [Jer
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md), [Jer
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019.md), or mourning generally [Sa1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md); [Jer
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#018.md). Among such elegies, are still
Zion-songs, (elegies over the ruin of Zion,) and mournings for the dead.
The word woe is thrice repeated in Hebrew, in different forms, according
to that solemn way, in which the extremest good or evil is spoken of;
the threefold blessing, morning and evening, with the thrice-repeated
name of God [Num 6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md), impressing
upon them the mystery which developed itself, as the divinity of the
Messiah and the personal agency of the Holy Spirit were unfolded to
them. The dirge which follows is purposely in abrupt brief words, as
those in trouble speak, with scarce breath for utterance. First, in two
words, with perhaps a softened inflection, they express the utterness of
their desolation. Then, in a threefold sentence, each clause consisting
of three short words, they say what God had done, but name Him not,
because they are angry with Him. God's chastisements irritate those whom
they do not subdue .

The portion of my people He changeth;

How removeth He (it) as to me!

To a rebel our fields He divideth.

They act the patriot. They, the rich, mourn over "the portion of my
people" (they say) which they had themselves despoiled: they speak, (as
men do,) as if things were what they ought to be: they hold to the
theory and ignore the facts. As if, because God had divided it to His
people, therefore it so remained! as if, because the poor were in theory
and by God's law provided for, they were so in fact! Then they are
enraged at God's dealings. He removeth the portion as to me; and to whom
giveth He our fields?

"To a rebel!" the Assyrian, or the Chaldee. They had deprived the poor
of their portion of "the Lord's land" . And now they marvel that God
resumes the possession of His own, and requires from them, not the
fourfold [Exo 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md); [Sa2
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#006.md); [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md) only of their spoil, but His
whole heritage. Well might Assyrian or Chaldee, as they did, jeer at the
word, renegade. They had not forsaken their gods; - but Israel, what was
its whole history but a turning back? "Hath a nation changed their gods,
which yet are no gods? But My people have changed their glory for that
which doth not profit" [Jer 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md).

Such was the meaning in their lips. The word "divideth" had the more
bitterness, because it was the reversal of that first "division" at the
entrance into Canaan. Then, with the use of this same word [Num
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#053.md), [Num
26:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md); [Jos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md); [Jos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#005.md); [Jos
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002.md), [Jos
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#005.md), [Jos
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md); [Jos
19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051.md), the division of the land of the
pagan was appointed to them. Ezekiel, in his great symbolic vision,
afterward prophesied the restoration of Israel, with the use of this
same term [Eze 47:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#021.md). Joel spoke of
the parting of their land, under this same term, as a sin of the pagan
(Joel 4:2, ([Joe 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003) in English).md).
Now, they say, God "divideth our fields," not to us, but to the pagan,
whose lands He gave us. It was a change of act: in impenitence, they
think it a change of purpose or will. But what lies in that, we be
"utterly despoiled?" Despoiled of everything; of what they felt,
temporal things; and of what they did not feel, spiritual things.

Despoiled of the land of promise, the good things of this life, but also
of the Presence of God in His Temple, the grace of the Lord, the image
of God and everlasting glory. "Their portion" was changed, as to
themselves and with others. As to themselvcs, riches, honor, pleasure,
their own land, were changed into want, disgrace, suffering, captivity;
and yet more bitter was it to see others gain what they by their own
fault had forfeited. As time went on, and their transgression deepened,
the exchange of the portion of that former people of God became more
complete. The casting-off of the Jews was the grafting-in of the
Gentiles [Act 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md). Seeing ye judge
yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo! we turn to the Gentiles.
And so they who were "no people" [Rom
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019.md), became the people of God, and
they who were His people, became, for the time, "not My people" [Hos
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md) : and "the adoption of sons, and
the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service of God,
and the promises" [Rom 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), came to
us Gentiles, since to us Christ Himself our God blessed forever came,
and made us His.

How hath He removed - The words do not say what He removed. They thought
of His gifts, the words include Himself. They say "How?" in amazement.
The change is so great and bitter, it cannot be said. Time, yea eternity
cannot utter it. "He hath divided our fields." The land was but the
outward symbol of the inward heritage. Unjust gain, kept back, is
restored with usury [Pro 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md); it
taketh away the life of the owners thereof. The vineyard whereof the
Jews said, the inheritance shall be ours, was taken from them and given
to others, even to Christians. So now is that awful change begun, when
Christians, leaving God, their only unchanging Good, turn to earthly
vanities, and, for the grace of God which He withdraws, have these only
for their fleeting portion, until it shall be finally exchanged in the
Day of Judgment [Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md). Son,
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and
likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and thou art
tormented.

Israel defended himself in impenitence and self-righteousness. He was
already the Pharisee. The doom of such was hopeless. The prophet breaks
in with a renewed, "Therefore." He had already prophesied that they
should lose the lands which they had unjustly gotten, the land which
they had profaned. He had described it in their own impenitent words.
Now on the impenitence he pronounces the judgment which impenitence
entails, that they should not be restored

[Micah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 2:5</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt have none that shall east a cord by lot in the
congregation of the Lord - Thou, in the first instance, is the
impenitent Jew of that day. God had promised by Hosea to restore Judah;
shortly after, the prophet himself foretells it [Mic
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md). Now he forewarns these and such
as these, that they would have no portion in it. They had "neither part
nor lot in this matter" [Act 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md).
They, the not-Israel then, were the images and ensamples of the
not-Israel afterward, those who seem to be God's people and are not;
members of the body, not of the soul of the Church; who have a sort of
faith, but have not love. Such was afterward the Israel after the flesh,
which was broken off, while the true Israel was restored, passing out of
themselves into Christ. Such, at the end, shall be those, who, being
admitted by Christ into "their portion," renounce the world in word not
in deed. Such shall have "no portion forever "in the congregation of the
Lord." For "nothing defiled shall enter there, nor whatsoever worketh
abomination or a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb's book of
life" [Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md).

The ground of their condemnation is their resistance to light and known
truth. These not only "entered not in" [Luk
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052.md), themselves, but, being
hinderers of God's word, them that were entering in, they hindered.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy; they shall not prophesy
to them, that they shall not take shame - The words are very emphatic in
Hebrew, from their briefness, "Prophesy not; they shall indeed prophesy;
they shall not prophesy to these; shame shall not depart." The people,
the false prophets, the politicians, forbade God and Micah to prophesy;
"Prophesy not." God, by Micah recites their prohibition to themselves,
and forewarns them of the consequences.

Prophesy ye not - , literally drop not. Amaziah and the God-opposing
party had already given an ungodly meaning to the word . "Drop not,"
"distill not," thus unceasingly, these same words, ever warning, ever
telling of "lamentation and mourning and woe [Eze
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010.md); prophesying not good concerning
us, but evil" [Kg1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018.md). So their
descendants commanded the Apostles [Act
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md); [Act
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md) not to speak at all or to teach
in the Name of Jesus [Act 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md). Did we
not straitly command you, that ye should not teach in this Name? [Act
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013.md). This man ceaseth not to speak
blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. God answers; They
shall certainly prophesy. The Hebrew word is emphatic. The prophets had
their commission from God, and Him they must obey, whether Israel [Eze
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005.md), [Eze
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007.md) would hear or whether they would
forbear. So must Micah and Isaiah [Isa
28:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md), [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022.md) now, or Jeremiah [Jer
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#007.md), [Jer
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017.md); [Jer
26:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010.md), Ezekiel, and the rest
afterward. "They shall not prophesy to these."

He does not say only, "They shall not prophesy to them," but, to these;
that is, they shall prophesy to others who would receive their words:
God's word would not be stayed; they who would hearken shall never be
deprived of their portion; but to these who despise, "they shall not
prophesy." It shall be all one, as though they did not prophesy; the
soft rain shall not bedew them. The barn-floor shall be dry, while the
fleece is moist [Jdg 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037.md). So God says
by Isaiah; "I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon
it" [Isa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md). The dew of God's word
shall be transferred to others. But so shame (literally shames manifold
shame,) shall not depart, but shall rest upon them forever. God would
have turned away the shame from them; but they, despising His warnings,
drew it to themselves. It was the natural fruit of their doings; it was
in its natural home with them. God spoke to them, that they might be
freed from it. They silenced His prophets; deafened themselves to His
words; so it departed not. So our Lord says [Joh
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041.md), Now ye say, we see; therefore
your sin remaineth; and John the Immerser [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md), The wrath of God abideth on him.
It hath not now first to come. It is not some new thing to be avoided,
turned aside. The sinner has but to remain as he is; the shame
encompasseth him already; and only departeth not. The wrath of God is
already upon him, and abideth on him.

[Micah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 2:7</span></span>

O thou that art named the house of Jacob - As Isaiah says, "Hear ye
this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel - which
make mention of the God of Israel, not in truth, nor in righteousness.
For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the
God of Israel" [Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md). They boasted
of what convicted them of faithlessness. They relied on being what in
spirit they had ceased to be, what in deeds they denied, children of a
believing forefather. It is the same temper which we see more at large
in their descendants; "We be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to
any man; how sayest Thou, ye shall be made free?" [Joh
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md) "Abraham is our Father" [Joh
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md). It is the same which John the
Immerser and our Lord and Paul reproved. "Think not to say within
yourselves, we have Abraham to our father" [Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md). "If ye were Abraham's children,
ye would do the works of Abraham" [Joh
8:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md). "Now ye seek to kill Me, a
Man that hath told you the truth - This did not Abraham" [Rom
2:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md).

He is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision
which is outward in the flesh. - Behold thou art called a Jew, and
restest in the law and makest thy boast of God, and knowest His Will and
approvest the things that are more excellent" - etc. The prophet answers
the unexpressed objections of those who forbade to prophesy evil. "Such
could not be of God," these said; "for God was pledged by His promises
to the house of Jacob. It would imply change in God, if He were to cast
off those whom He had chosen." Micah answers; "not God is changed, but
you." God's promise was to Jacob, not to those who were but named Jacob,
who called themselves after the name of their father, but did not his
deeds. "The Spirit of the Lord was not straitened", so that He was less
longsuffering than heretofore. These, which He threatened and of which
they complained, were not His doings, not what He of His own Nature did,
not what He loved to do, not His, as the Author or Cause of them, but
theirs.

God is Good, but to those who can receive good, "the upright in heart"
[Psa 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md). God is only Loving unto
Israel. He is all Love; nothing but Love: all His ways are Love; but it
follows, unto what Israel, the true Israel, the pure of heart [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md). All the paths of the Lord are
mercy and truth; but to whom? unto such as keep His covenant and His
testimonies [Psa 103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017.md); [Luk
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#050.md). The mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting; but hate them that fear Him. they becoming
evil, His good became to them evil. Light, wholesome and gladdening to
the healthful, hurts weak eyes. That which is straight cannot suit or
fit with the crooked. Amend your crookedness, and God's ways will be
straight to you. Do not My words do good? He doth speak good words and
comfortable words [Zac 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md). They are
not only good, but do good [Luk 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#032.md).
His Word is with power. Still it is with those who "walk uprightly;"
whether those who forsake not, or those who return the way of
righteousness. God flattereth deceiveth not, promiseth not what He not
do. He cannot "speak peace where there is no peace" [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md). As He saith, "Behold the and
severity of God; on them which but toward thee, goodness, if thou
continue in His goodness" [Rom 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md).
God Himself could not make a heaven for the proud or envious. Heaven
would be to them a hell.

[Micah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 2:8</span></span>

Even of late - (Literally, yesterday.) Jerome: "He imputeth not past
sins, but those recent and, as it were, of yesterday." "My people is
risen up vehemently". God upbraideth them tenderly by the title, "Mine
own people," as John complaineth, "He came unto His own, and His own
received Him not" [Joh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md). God
became not their enemy, but they arose as one man, - "is risen up," the
whole of it, as His. In Him they might have had peace and joy and
assured gladness, but they arose in rebellion against Him, requiting Him
evil for good, (as bad Christians do to Christ,) and brought war upon
their own heads. This they did by their sins against their brethren.
Casting off the love of man, they alienated themselves from the love of
God.

Ye pull off (strip off violently) the robe with the garment - Literally,
"over against the cloak." The שׂלמה s'almâh is the large enveloping
cloak, which was worn loosely over the other dress, and served by night
for a covering [Deu 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#017.md). Eder,
translated "robe," is probably not any one garment, but the remaining
dress, the comely, becoming , array of the person. These they stripped
violently off from persons, peaceable, unoffending, off their guard,
"passing by securely, men averse from war" and strife. These they
stripped of their raiment by day, leaving them half-naked, and of their
covering for the night. So making war against God's peaceful people,
they, as it were, made war against God.

[Micah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 2:9</span></span>

The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses -
(literally, from her pleasant house,) each from her home. These were
probably the widows of those whom they had stripped. Since the houses
were their's, they were widows; and so their spoilers were at war with
those whom God had committed to their special love, whom He had declared
the objects of His own tender care, "the widows and the fatherless." The
widows they "drove vehemently forth", as having no portion in the
inheritance which God had given them, as God had driven out their
enemies before them, each "from her pleasant house," the home where she
had lived with her husband and children in delight and joy.

From (off) their (young) children have ye taken away My glory -
Primarily, the glory, comeliness, was the fitting apparel which God had
given them (as [Hos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011).md), and laid
upon them , and which these oppressors stripped off from them. But it
includes all the gifts of God, wherewith God would array them. Instead
of the holy home of parental care, the children grew up in want and
neglect, away from all the ordinances of God, it may be, in a strange
land. "For ever." They never repented, never made restitution; but so
they incurred the special woe of those who ill-used the unprotected, the
widow, and the fatherless. The words "forever" anticipate the
punishment. The punishment is according to the sin. They never ceased
their oppression. They, with the generation who should come after them,
should be deprived of God's "glory," and cast out of His land forever.

[Micah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 2:10</span></span>

Arise ye and depart - Go your way, as being cast out of God's care and
land. It matters not where they went. "For this is not your rest." As ye
have done, so shall it be done unto you. As ye cast out the widow and
the fatherless, so shall ye be cast out; as ye gave no rest to those
"averse from war," so shall ye have none [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md). "He that leadeth into captivity
shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed
with the sword." The land was given to them as a temporary rest, a
symbol and earnest of the everlasting rest to the obedient. So Moses
spake, "ye are not as yet come to the rest and the inheritance which the
Lord your God giveth you. But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the
land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit, and when He giveth
you rest from your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety ..."
([Deu 12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009.md), add [Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056).md). And Joshua, "Remember the word
which Moses commanded you, saying, The Lord your God giveth you rest"
[Jos 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013.md). But the Psalmist had warned
them, that, if they hardened their hearts like their forefathers, they
too would "not enter into His rest" [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md).

Because it is polluted - (Literally, because of its pollution ) by
idolatry, by violence, by uncleanness. So Moses (using the same word)
says, "the land is defiled" by the abominations of the pagan; and warns
them, "that the land spue you not out, when you defile it, as it spued
out the nations which were before you." Ezekiel speaks of that
"defilement" [Eze 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017.md), as the ground
why God expelled Israel. "It shall destroy you, even with a sore
(literally sharp) destruction" ([Eze
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#018.md), add [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007).md). . It is a sore thing to abuse
the creatures of God to sin, and it is unfit that we should use what we
have abused. Hence, Holy Scripture speaks, as though even the inanimate
creation took part with God, "made subject to vanity, not willingly,"
and could not endure those who employed it against His Will.

The words, "Arise, depart, ye, for this is not your rest," became a sort
of sacred proverb, spoken anew to the soul, whenever it would find rest
out of God. : "We are bidden to think of no rest for ourselves in any
things of the world; but, as it were, arising from the dead, to stretch
upwards, and walk after the Lord our God, and say, 'My soul cleaveth
hard after Thee.' This if we neglect, and will not hear Him who saith,
'Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
give thee light,' we shall indeed slumber, but shall be deceived and
shall not find rest; for where Christ enlighteneth not the risen soul,
what seemeth to be rest, is trouble." All rest is wearisome which is not
in Thee, O our God.

[Micah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 2:11</span></span>

If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood - Literally, "in spirit"
(not My Spirit) "and falsehood," that is, in a lying spirit; such as
they, whose woe Ezekiel pronounces [Eze
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003.md), "Woe unto the foolish prophets
who walk after their own spirit and what they have not seen [Eze
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md), [Eze
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md); prophets out of their own
hearts, who prophesied a vision of falsehood, and a destruction and
nothingness; prophesied falsehood; yea, prophets of the deceit of their
hearts." These, like the true prophets, "walked in spirit;" as Isaiah
speaks of "walking in righteousness" [Isa
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md). Their habitual converse was m a
spirit, but of falsehood. If such an one do lie, saying, "I will
prophesy unto thee of wine and strong drink." Man's conscience must
needs have some plea in speaking falsely of God. The false prophets had
to please the rich men, to embolden them in their self-indulgence, to
tell them that God would not punish. They doubtless spoke of God's
temporal promises to His people, the land "flowing with milk and honey."
His promises of abundant harvest and vintage, and assured them, that God
would not withdraw these, that He was not so precise about His law.
Micah tells them in plain words, what it all came to; it was a
prophesying of "wine and strong drink."

He shall even be the prophet of this people - Literally "and shall be
bedewing this people." He uses the same words, which scorners of Israel
and Judah employed in forbidding to prophesy. They said, "drop not;"
forbidding God's word as a wearisome dropping. It wore away their
patience, not their hearts of stone. He tells them, who might speak to
them without wearying, of whose words they would never tire, who might
do habitually what they forbade to God, - one who, in the Name of God,
set them at ease in their sensual indulgences. This is the secret of the
success of everything opposed to God and Christ. Man wants a God. God
has made it a necessity of our nature to crave after Him. Spiritual,
like natural, hunger, debarred from or loathing wholesome food, must be
stilled, stifled, with what will appease its gnawings. Our natural
intellect longs for Him; for it cannot understand itself without Him.
Our restlessness longs for Him; to rest upon.

Our helplessness longs for Him, to escape from the unbearable pressure
of our unknown futurity. Our imagination craves for Him; for, being made
for the Infinite, it cannot be content with the finite. Aching
affections long for Him; for no creature can soothe them. Our
dissatisfied conscience longs for Him, to teach it and make it one with
itself. But man does not want to be responsible, nor to owe duty; still
less to be liable to penalties for disobeying. The Christian, not the
natural man, longs that his whole being should tend to God. The natural
man wishes to be well-rid of what sets him ill at ease, not to belong to
God. And the horrible subtlety of false teaching, in each age or
country, is to meet its own favorite requirements, without calling for
self-sacrifice or self-oblation, to give it a god such as it would have,
such as might content it. : "The people willeth to be deceived, be it
deceived," is a true proverb. "Men turn away their ears from the truth"
[Ti2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md) which they dislike; and so
are turned unto fables which they like. They who "receive not the love
of the truth, - believe a lie" [Th2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md). If men "will not retain God
in their knowledge, God giveth them over to an undistinguishing mind"
[Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md). They who would not receive
our Lord, coming in His Father's Name, have ever since, as He said,
"received them who came in their own" [Joh
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043.md). Men teach their teachers how
they wish to be mistaught, and receive the echo of their wishes as the
Voice of God.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the
remnant of Israel - God's mercy on the penitent and believing being the
end of all His threatenings, the mention of it often bursts in abruptly.
Christ is ever the Hope as the End of prophecy, ever before the
prophets' mind. The earthquake and fire precede the still small voice of
peace in Him. What seems then sudden to us, is connected in truth. The
prophet had said [Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md), where was
not their rest and how they should be cast forth; he saith at once how
they should be gathered to their everlasting rest. He had said, what
promises of the false prophets would not be fulfille [Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md). But, despair being the most
deadly enemy of the soul, he does not take away their false hopes,
without shewing them the true mercies in store for them. Jerome: "Think
not," he would say, "that I am only a prophet of ill. The captivity
foretold will indeed now come, and God's mercies will also come,
although not in the way, which these speak of."

The false prophets spoke of worldly abundance ministering to sensuality,
and of unbroken security. He tells of God's mercies, but after
chastisement, to "the remnant of Israel." But the restoration is
complete, far beyond their then condition. He had foretold the
desolation of Samaria [Mic 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006.md), the
captivity of Judah [Mic 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md); [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md); he foretells the restoration of
all Jacob, as one. The images are partly taken (as is the prophet's
custom) from that first deliverance from Egypt . Then, as the image of
the future growth under persecution, God multiplied His people
exceedingly [Exo 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012.md); then "the Lord
went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way"
[Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md); then God "brought them up"
"out of the house of bondage" (see below, [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004).md).

But their future prison-house was to be no land of Goshen. It was to be
a captivity and a dispersion at once, as Hosea had already foretold . So
he speaks of them emphatically, as a great throng, "assembling I will
assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; gathering I will gather the remnant of
Israel." The word, which is used of the gathering of a flock or its
lambs [Isa 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md); [Isa
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md), became, from Moses' prophecy
([Deu 30:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md), see [Neh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#009).md), a received word of the gathering
of Israel from the dispersion of the captivity (see below, [Mic
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md); [Psa
106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md); [Psa
107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003.md); [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Isa
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md); [Isa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md); [Isa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008.md); [Zep
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md); [Jer
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md); [Jer
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md); [Jer
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008.md), [Jer
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010.md); [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md); [Eze
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017.md); [Eze
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034.md), [Eze
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041.md); [Eze
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md); [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md); [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021.md); [Eze
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md); [Eze
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#027.md); [Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010).md). The return of the Jews from
Babylon was but a faint shadow of the fulfillment. For, ample as were
the terms of the decrees of Cyrus [Ezr
1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md) and Artaxerxes [Ezr
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013.md), and widely as that of Cyrus was
diffused [Ezr 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md), the restoration was
essentially that of Judah, that is, Judah, Benjamin and Levi : the
towns, whose inhabitants returned, were those of Judah and Benjamin Ezra
2; Neh. 7; the towns, to which they returned, were of the two tribes.

It was not a gathering of "all Jacob;" and of the three tribes who
returned, there were but few gathered, and they had not even an earthly
king, nor any visible Presence of God. The words began to he fulfilled
in the "many [Act 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md) tens of
thousands" who believed at our Lord's first Coming; and "all Jacob,"
that is, all who were Israelites indeed, "the remnant" according to the
election of grace [Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md), were
gathered within the one fold of the Church, under One Shepherd. It shall
be fully fulfilled, when, in the end, "the fullness of the Gentiles
shall come in and all Israel shall be saved" [Rom
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). "All Jacob" is the same as
"the remnant of Israel," the true Israel which remains when the false
severed itself off; all the seed-corn, when the chaff was winnowed away.
So then, whereas they were now scattered, then, God saith, "I will put
them together (in one fold) as the sheep of Bozrah," which abounded in
sheep [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), and was also a strong
city of Edom ; denoting how believers should be fenced within the
Church, as by a strong wall, against which the powers of darkness should
not prevail, and the wolf should howl around the fold, yet be unable to
enter it, and Edom and the pagan should become part of the inheritance
of Christ . "As a flock in the midst of their fold," at rest , "like
sheep, still and subject to their shepherd's voice. So shall these,
having one faith and One Spirit, in meekness and simplicity, obey the
one rule of truth. Nor shall it be a small number;" for the place where
they shall be gathered shall be too narrow to contain them, as is said
in Isaiah; "Give place to me, that I may dwell" [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md).

They shall make great noise - (it is the same word as our hum, "the hum
of men,") by reason of the multitude of men He explains his image, as
does Ezekiel [Eze 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md), "And ye are
My flock, the flock of My pasture; men are ye; I, your God, saith the
Lord God: and [Eze 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038.md), As a flock
of holy things, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall
the waste cities be full of a flock of men and they shall know that I am
the Lord." So many shall they be, that throughout the whole world they
shall make a great and public sound in praising God, filling Heaven and
the green pastures of Paradise with a mighty hum of praise;" as John saw
"a great multitude which no man could number" [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md), "with one united voice praising
the Good Shepherd, who smoothed for them all rugged places, and evened
them by His Own Steps, Himself the Guide of their way and the Gate of
Paradise, as He saith, 'I am the Door;' through whom bursting through
and going before, being also the Door of the way, the flock of believers
shall break through It. But this Shepherd is their Lord and King" . Not
their King only, but the Lord God; so that this, too, bears witness that
Christ is God.

[Micah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 2:13</span></span>

The Breaker is come up - (gone up) before them; they have broken up
(Broken through) and have passed the gate, and have gone forth The image
is not of conquest, but of deliverance. They "break through," not to
enter in but to "pass through the gate and go forth." The wall of the
city is ordinarily broken through, in order to make an entrance [Psa
80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md); [Psa
89:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#041.md); [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md); [Neh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013.md), or to secure to a conqueror the
power of entering in [Pro 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028.md); [Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md); [Ch2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023.md); [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md) at any time, or by age and decay
[Ch2 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md). But here the object is
expressed, to go forth. Plainly then, they were confined before, as in a
prison; and the gate of the prison was burst open, to set them free. It
is then the same image as when God says by Isaiah; "I will say to the
North, give up; and to the South, Hold not back" [Isa
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006.md), or, "Go ye forth of Babylon, Say
ye, the Lord hath redeemed His servant Jacob" [Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); or, with the same reminiscence
of God's visible leading of His people out of Egypt "Depart ye, depart
ye; for ye shall not go out with haste, nor yet by flight, for the Lord
God shall go before you, and the God of Israel will be your reward;" or
as Hosea describes their restoration ([Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md), ([Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002), Hebrew).md); "Then shall the
children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together and
appoint themselves one Head, and they shall go up out of the land".
Elsewhere, in Isaiah, the spiritual meaning of the deliverance from the
prison is more distinctly brought out, as the work of our Redeemer. "I
will give Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house" [Isa
42:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md); and, "the Spirit of the Lord
God is upon Me, because the Lord hath anointed Me to proclaim liberty to
the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound" [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md).

From this passage, the "Breaker-through" was one of the titles of the
Christ, known to the Jews , as One who should be "from below and from
above" also; and from it they believed that "captives should come up
from Gehenna, and the Sheehinah," or the Presence of God, "at their
head." : "He then, who shall break the way, the King and Lord who shall
go up before them, shall be the Good Shepherd, who puts them together in
the fold. And this He doth when, as He saith, 'He putieth forth His own
sheep, and He goeth before them, and the sheep follow Him, for they know
His Voice' [Joh 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md). How doth He go
befree them but by suffering for them, leaving them an example of
suffering, and opening the entrance of Paradise? The Good Shepherd goeth
up to time Cross [Joh 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md), and is lifted up from the
earth, laying down His Life for His sheep, to draw all men unto Him. He
goeth up, trampling on death by His resurrection; He goeth up above the
heaven of heavens, and sitteth on the Right Hand of the Father, opening
the way before them, so that the flock, in their lowliness, may arrive
where the Shepherd went before in His Majesty. And when He thus breaketh
through and openeth the road, they also 'break through and pass through
the gate and go out by it,' by that Gate, namely, whereof the Psalmist
saith, 'This is the Gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter into It'
[Psa 118:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020.md).

What other is this Gate than that same Passion of Christ, beside which
there is no gate, no way whereby any can enter into life? Through that
open portal, which the lance of the soldier made in His Side when
crucified, and 'there came thereout Blood and Water, they shall pass and
go through,' even as the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea,
which divided before them, when Pharaoh, his chariots and horsemen, were
drowned.'" Dionysius: "He will be in their hearts, and will teach and
lead them; He will shew them the way of Salvation, 'guiding their feet
into the way of peace' [Luk 1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079.md), and
they shall pass through the strait and narrow gate which leadeth unto
life; of which it is written, 'Enter ye in at the strait gate; because
strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and
few there be that find it. And their King shall pass before them' [Mat
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013.md), as He did, of old, in the
figure of the cloud, of which Moses said, 'If Thy Presence go not, carry
us not up hence; and wherein shall it be known that I have found grace
in Thy sight, I and Thy people, is it not in that Thou goest up with
us?' [Exo 33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md), and as He then did
when He passed out of this world to the Father." "And the Lord on (that
is, at) the head of them," as of His army.

Rup.: "For the Lord is His Name, and He is the Head, they the members;
He the King, they the people; He the Shepherd, they the sheep of His
pasture. And of this passing through He spake, 'By Me if any man enter
in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture' [Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md). For a man entereth in, when,
receiving the faith, he becomes a sheep of this Shepherd, and goeth out,
when he closeth this present life, and then findeth the pastures of
unfading, everlasting life" ; "passing from this pilgrimage to his home,
from faith to sight, from labor to reward." Again, as describing the
Christian's life here, it speaks of progress. Jerome: "Whoso shall have
entered in, must not remain in the state wherein he entered, but must go
forth into the pasture; so that, in entering in should be the beginning,
in going forth and finding pasture, the perfecting of graces. He who
entereth in, is contained within the bounds of the world; he who goeth
forth, goes, as it were, beyond all created things, and, counting as
nothing all things seen, shall find pasture above the Heavens, and shall
feed upon the Word of God, and say, "The Lord is my Shepherd" [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001), (and feedeth me,.md) I can lack
nothing.

But this going forth can only be through Christ; as it followeth, 'and
the Lord at the head of them.'" Nor, again, is this in itself easy, or
done for us without any effort of our own. All is of Christ. The words
express the closeness of the relation between the Head and the members;
and what He, our King and Lord, doth, they do, because He who did it for
them, doth it in them. The same words are used of both, shewing that
what they do, they do by virtue of His Might, treading in His steps,
walking where He has made the way plain, and by His Spirit. What they
do, they do, as belonging to Him. He "breaketh through," or, rather, in
all is "the Breaker-through." They, having broken through, pass on,
because He "passeth before them." He will [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md) break in pieces the gates of
brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron. He "breaketh through"
whatever would hold us back or oppose us, all might of sin and death and
Satan, as Moses opened the Red Sea, for "a way for the ransomed to pass
over" [Isa 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010.md); and so He saith, "I
will go before thee, I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut
in sunder the bars of iron, and I will give thee the treasures of
darkness, and hidden riches of secret places" [Isa
45:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md).

So then Christians, following Him, the Captain of their salvation,
strengthened by His grace, must burst the bars of the flesh and of the
world, the chains and bonds of evil passions and habits, force
themselves through the narrow way and narrow gate, do violence to
themselves [Ti2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md), endure hardness,
as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. The title of our Lord, the
Breaker-through, and the saying, "they break through," together express
the same as the New Testament doth in regard to our being partakers of
the sufferings of Christ [Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).
Joint heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may
be also glorified together [Ti2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md). If we be dead with Him, we
shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him
[Pe1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md). Forasmuch then as Christ
hath suffered for us in the flesh - arm yourselves likewise with the
same mind.

The words may include also the removal of the souls of the just, who had
believed in Christ before His Coming, into Heaven after His
Resurrection, and will be fully completed when, in the end, He shall
cause His faithful servants, in body and soul, to enter into the joy of
their Lord.
