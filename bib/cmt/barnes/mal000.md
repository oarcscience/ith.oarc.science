Introduction to Malachi

The last prophet of the Old Testament, like the forerunner of our Lord,
whom he foreannounced under his own name . "The messenger of the Lord,"
willed to be but "the voice of one crying in the wilderness;" as his
great successor, who took up his message, when asked, "Who art thou?
What sayest thou of thyself?" said [Joh
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023.md), "I am the voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord." He mentions neither
his parentage, nor birthplace, nor date; nor did he add the name of his
office , and he has left it to be guessed, whether the name under which
he is known, was the name which he bore among men; so wholly did he will
to be hidden. No one before him is recorded to have carried his name. It
may be that he framed it for himself, and willed to be known only as
what it designated, "the messenger of the Lord." This was a favorite
title with him, since, in this brief prophecy, he uses it, as describing
the priest's office, and that of the forerunner [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); whereas, before him, except once
by Haggai and once by Isaiah [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md); [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019.md), it had been used only of the
blessed angels.

There is, however, no ground to think that it was not his name. Even the
Septuagint, which paraphrases it, "His messenger," prefix to the book
the name Malachi; and the title, "my messenger," would not have
described that he was "the messenger of God," since the name of God had
not preceded. "If names are to be interpreted," Jerome says , "and
history is to be framed from them, not a spiritual meaning to be
derived, then Hosea who is called Saviour, and Joel whose name means,
'Lord God,' and the other prophets will not be men, but rather angels or
the Lord and Saviour, according to the meaning of their name." No
special stress was laid upon the name, even by the Origenists, who
supposed Haggai, Malachi and John the Immerser to have been angels .
Origen himself supposed John the Immerser to have been an angel in human
form , and Melchizedek , as well as Malachi. More widely, that , "they
became the words in the prophets."

At the time of our Lord, some accounted him to have been Ezra, perhaps
for his zeal for the Law. His date must, however, have been later, since
there is no mention of the building of the temple, whose service was in
its regular order. In the New Testament, like others of the twelve, he
is cited without his name , or the substance of his prophecy, is spoken
of or alluded to, without any reference to any human author [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md), [Luk
1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md); [Mat
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010.md); [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md); so entirely was his wish to
remain hidden fulfilled.

Yet he probably bore a great part in the reformation, in which Nehemiah
cooperated outwardly, and to effect which, after he had, on the expiring
of his 12 years of office [Neh 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md),
returned to Persia, he obtained leave to visit his own land again [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006.md), apparently for a short time. For
he mentions his obtaining that leave, in connection with abuses at
Jerusalem, which had taken place in his absence, and which he began
reforming, immediately on his arrival. But three chief abuses, the
neglect of God's service, the defilement of the priesthood and of their
covenant, and the cruelty to their own Jewish wives, divorcing them to
make way for idolatresses, are subjects of Malachi's reproofs. Nehemiah
found these practices apparently rampant. It is not then probable that
they had been, before, the subjects of Malachi's denunciation, nor were
his own energetic measures probably fruitless, so that there should be
occasion for these denunciations afterward. It remains, then, as the
most probable, that Malachi, as the prophet, cooperated with Nehemiah,
as the civil authority, as Haggai and Zechariah had with Zerubbabel ,
"So Isaiah cooperated with Hezekiah; Jeremiah with Josiah. Of a mere
external reformation there is no instance" in Jewish history.

It does not appear, whether Nehemiah, on his return, was invested by the
king of Persia with extraordinary authority for these reforms, or
whether he was appointed as their governor. The brief account affords no
scope for the mention of it. It is not then any objection to the
contemporaneousness of Malachi and Nehemiah, that, whereas Nehemiah,
while governor, "required not the bread of the governor," i. e., the
allowance granted him by the Persian government, as an impost upon the
people, Malachi upbraids the people that they would not offer to their
governor the poor things which they offered to Almighty God, or that the
governor would not accept it, in that it would be an insult rather than
an act of respect. For:

\(1\) the question in Malachi is of a free-offering, not of an impost;

\(2\) Nehemiah says that he did not "require it," not that he would not
accept it;

\(3\) there is no evidence that he was now governor, nor

\(4\) any reason why he should not accept in their improved condition,
what he did not "require [Neh 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018.md),
because the bondage was heavy upon this people."

Presents were, as they are still, a common act of courtesy in the East.

Like John the Immerser, though afar off, he prepared the way of the Lord
by the preaching of repentance. More than other prophets, he unveils
priests and people to themselves, interprets their thoughts to them, and
puts those thoughts in abrupt naked language, picturing them as
demurring to every charge which he brought against them. They were not,
doubtless, conscious hypocrites. For conscious hypocrisy is the sin of
individuals, aping the graces which others possess and which they have
not, yet wish to be held in estimation for having. Here, it is the mass
which is corrupt. The true Israel is the exception [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016.md) - "those who feared the Lord, the
jewels of Almighty God." It is the hypocrisy of self-deceit, contented
with poor, limited, outward service, and pluming itself upon it. Malachi
unfolds to them the meaning of their acts. His thesis is themselves,
whom he unfolds to them.

He interprets himself, putting into their mouths words, betokening a
simple unconsciousness either of God's goodness or their own evil [Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md). "Yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou
loved us?" This was their inward thought, as it is the thought of all,
ungrateful to God. But his characteristic is, that he puts these
thoughts into abrupt, bold bad words, which might startle them for their
hideousness, as if he would say, "This is what your acts mean." He
exhibits the worm and the decay, which lay under the whited exterior
[Mal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md). "Ye say, Wherein have we
despised Thy Name?" Perhaps, they were already learning, not to
pronounce the proper Name of God, while they caused it to be despised.
Or they pronounced it with reverent pause, while they showed that they
held cheap God and His service [Mal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007.md). "Ye say, The table of the Lord is
contemptible [Mal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007.md), [Mal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012.md). Ye say, the table of the Lord is
polluted; and the fruit thereof, his meat, is contemptible." Their acts
said it. What a reading of thoughts [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013.md)! "Ye said also, Behold, what a
weariness!" It is the language of the heart in all indevotion [Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md). "Ye say, Wherefore?" as if
innocently unconscious of the ground of God's judgment [Mal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md). "Wherein have we robbed Thee?"
The language of those who count the earth as their own [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md). "Ye say, Wherein have we wearied
Him? When ye say, Everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the
Lord, and in them doth He delight, or, Where is the God of judgment?"
The heart's speech in all envy at the prosperity of the wicked!

Yet the object of all this unfolding them to themselves, is their
repentance. We already have the self-righteousness of the Pharisees, and
the Sadducees' denial of God's Providence. And we already have the voice
of John the Immerser, "of the wrath to come." They professed to [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md) "delight in the coming of the
messenger of the covenant;" yet their deeds were such as would be burned
up with the fire of His coming, not, rewarded.

Pharisees and Sadduces are but two off-shoots of the same ungodliness;
Pharisees, while they hoped by outward acts to be in favor with God,
they become, at least, secret Sadducees, when the hope fails. First,
they justify themselves. God had said to them [Mal
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008.md), "Ye are departed out of the
way: I have made you base, as ye have not kept My ways." They say [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md), "It is vain to serve God; and
what profit, that we have kept His ordinance?" (affirming that they had
done, what God called them to repentance for not doing) God said [Mal
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#013.md), "Ye have covered the altar of
the Lord with tears," the tears of their wronged wives; they insist on
their own austerities [Mal 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md), "we
have walked mournfully before the Lord our God." Then comes the Sadducee
portion. God had called them to obedience and said ([Mal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010), וּבתנוּני ûbethânûnı̂y.md), "Prove
Me now herewith: they say, ([Mal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md),
בצנוּ bâchănû), the workers of wickedness have proved God, and are
saved." God promised . "All nations shall call you blessed;" they answer
, "and now we call the proud blessed. What have we spoken against Thee?"
is the last self-justifying question, which Malachi records of them; and
this, while reproaching God for the uselessness of serving Him, and
choosing the lot of those who rejected Him.

Thereon Malachi abandons this class to their own blindness. There was
hope amid any sin. However, it rebelled against God. This was a final
denial of God's Providence and rejection of Himself. So Malachi closes
with the same prophecy, with which John the Immerser prepared our Lord's
coming, "His [Luk 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017.md) fan is in His
hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor; and will gather the wheat
into His garner, but the chaff He shall burn with fire unquenchable."
The unspeakable tenderness of God toward "those who fear His name," and
the severity to those who finally rebel, are perhaps nowhere more
vividly declared, than in these closing words of the Old Testament. Yet
the love of God, as ever, predominates; and the last prophet closes with
the word "Remember," and with one more effort to avert the curse which
they were bringing upon themselves. Yet no prophet declares more
expressly the rejection of the people, to whom he came to minister, the
calling the Gentiles, the universal worship, in of the earth, of Him who
was hitherto worshiped by the Jews only; and that, not at Jerusalem, but
each offering, in his own place, the sacrifice which hitherto (as they
had recently experienced, in their captivity at Babylon) could be
offered up in Jerusalem only. To him alone it was reserved to prophesy
of the unbloody sacrifice, which should be offered unto God "in every
place" throughout the world "from the rising of the sun unto the going
down thereof." It has been said , "Malachi is like a late evening, which
closes a long day, but he is at the same time the morning twilight which
bears in its bosom a glorious day."

"When prophecy was to be withdrawn from the ancient Church of God, its
last light was mingled with the rising beams of the Sun of
Righteousness. In one view it combined a retrospect of the Law with the
clearest specific signs of the Gospel advent [Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md). Remember ye the law of Moses My
servant, which I commanded him on Mount Horeb, for all Israel, with the
statutes and the judgments. Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet,
before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Prophecy had been the
oracle of Judaism and of Christianity, to uphold the authority of the
one, and reveal the promise of the other. And now its latest admonitions
were like those of a faithful departing minister, embracing and summing
up his duties. Resigning its charge to the personal precursor of Christ,
it expired with the Gospel upon its lips."

A school, which regards the "prophets" chiefly as "poets," says that
"the language is prosaic, and manifests the decaying spirit of
prophecy." The office of the prophets was, to convey in forceful words,
which God gave them, His message to His people. The poetic form was but
an accident. God, who knows the hearts of His creatures whom He has
made, knows better than we, why He chose such an instrument. Zechariah,
full of imagination, He chose some years before. But He preserved in
history the account of the words which Zechariah spoke, not the words
wherewith he urged the rebuilding of the temple, in his own book. If
Malachi had spoken in imaginative language, like that of Ezekiel, to
whom God says [Eze 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#032.md), "thou art
unto them like a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and
can play well on an instrument, and they hear thy words and they do them
not," it may be that they would have acted then, as they did in the time
of Ezekiel. It may be, that times like those of Malachi, apathetic,
self-justifying, complaining, self-complacent, needed a sterner, more
abrupt, more startling voice to awaken them. "Wisdom was justified of
her children."

God performed by him a reformation for the time being: He gave through
him a warning to the generation, when our Lord would come, that He would
come, as their Judge as well as their Saviour, and, how they would stand
in the day of His coming. He gave it as a book to His whole Church,
whereby to distinguish seeming from real service. Parting words are
always solemn, as closing the past, and opening out a future of
expectation before us. The position of Malachi, as the last of the
prophets, bids us the more solemnly prepare for that dread day, our
Lord's second coming, which he foretold, in one with the first coming,
warning us that we do not deceive ourselves, in unconsciousness of our
own evil and remembrance of our seeming good, until He professes unto us
[Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md), "I never knew you; depart
from Me, ye that work iniquity."
