### [Judges Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

[Judges 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 8:1</span></span>

The success of Gideon's enterprise mortified the pride of Ephraim, as
the chief tribe, seeing that they had played a subordinate part. Compare
[Jdg 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md).

[Judges 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 8:2</span></span>

A civil war with the great tribe of Ephraim would soon have turned
Israel's victory into mourning. Gideon therefore soothes their wounded
pride by confessing that Ephraim had done more, though they had joined
him so late in the day, than he had been able to effect in the whole
campaign. The grape-gleaning of Ephraim was better than the whole
vintage of Abi-ezer.

[Judges 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 8:5</span></span>

Succoth was in the tribe of Gad which was entirely trans-Jordanic [Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md); and the ruins are at Sukkot, on
the east of Jordan, a little south of Bethshan.

Give, I pray you etc. - Gideon might fairly expect so much aid from the
trans-Jordanic tribes, and from so considerable a town as Succoth [Jdg
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#014.md).

[Judges 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 8:6</span></span>

The number of the followers of Zebah and Zalmunna was still so
formidable, and Gideon's enterprise still so doubtful, that the men of
Succoth (being on the same side of the Jordan) would not risk the
vengeance of the Midianites by giving supplies to Gideon's men.

[Judges 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 8:8</span></span>

Succoth was in the valley or Ghor of the Jordan [Jdg
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#005.md), and Penuel apparently in the
mountain. No identification of Penuel has taken place. It was south of
the Brook Jabbok, and on Jacob's way to Succoth. Gideon, journeying in
the opposite direction to Jacob, comes from Succoth to Penuel.

[Judges 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 8:10</span></span>

Zebah and Zalmunna seem to have fled nearly due east to Karkor, which
was probably an enclosure of some kind (perhaps a walled sheepfold,
compare [Num 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032) note.md). Its site is
unknown; but it was near Nobah, in the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead
[Num 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#040.md), and Jogbehah was in the
tribe of Gad [Num 32:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md). Gideon,
perhaps taking a circuit so as to come upon them from the east, fell
suddenly upon them, apparently at night, surprised them, and smote them.

[Judges 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 8:13</span></span>

Before the sun was up - The translation of the words is doubtful,
because of the rarity of the word rendered "sun" (חרס cheres). Many
suppose it to be the name of a mountain pass, and render it from the
ascent of Heres.

[Judges 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 8:14</span></span>

The written (see the margin) list would enable Gideon to punish the
guilty and spare the innocent people. Succoth was governed by a
sanhedrim or council of seventy elders (compare [Num
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016).md), with perhaps seven others of
superior rank called princes.

[Judges 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 8:16</span></span>

He taught - Thought to be a false reading, for "he threshed," as in [Jdg
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#007.md) margin.

[Judges 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 8:17</span></span>

The men of the city - Perhaps the rulers; who, it is likely, had
possession of the tower or citadel, and so could tyrannize over the
people. Gideon killed the great men, and beat down their towers, but did
not injure the inhabitants.

[Judges 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 8:18</span></span>

What manner of men - literally, "Where are the men?" The sense, "what
manner of men", is merely gathered from the tenor of the answer. Gideon
doubtless knew that his brethren had been killed by Zebah and Zalmunna,
and the desire of avenging their death was one motive for his impetuous
pursuit and attack. His question was rather a taunt, a bitter reproach
to his captives, preparing them for their fate. Zebah and Zalmunna, in
their answer, did not give evidence against themselves. Their hope was
by a flattering answer to soothe Gideon's wrath.

[Judges 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 8:19</span></span>

The sons of my mother - A much closer relation than that of brothers by
the father only. (Compare [Gen 43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029.md);
[Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md); [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008).md). This is the only hint preserved
of the transaction. We cannot say exactly when the slaughter of Gideon's
brethren on Mount Tabor took place, whether before the outbreak of the
war [Jdg 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md), or in the retreat and
flight of the Midianites [Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md).

[Judges 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 8:20</span></span>

It was Gideon's place to act the part of the "avenger of blood" [Num
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012.md); [Deu
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006.md). The fierce manners of the age
break out in the slaying of the captives (compare [Sa1
15:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032).md), and in Gideon's attempt to
initiate his youthful son Jether in the stern work of slaying his
country's enemies.

[Judges 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 8:21</span></span>

The ornaments - See marg. and compare [Isa
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#018.md). The custom of adorning the necks
of their camels with gold chains and ornaments prevailed among the Arabs
so late as the time of Mahomet.

[Judges 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 8:24</span></span>

In this desire for gold Gideon falls to the level of ordinary men, and
we may see in it the first decline of his glory, leading to a sad
tarnishing of the luster of his bright name. The idolatrous honor paid
to Gideon's ephod was probably a source of revenue to his house.
Contrast the conduct of Abraham [Gen
14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#021.md), and of Elisha [Kg2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016.md), [Kg2
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md).

The "ear-ring" here mentioned is properly a "nose-ring" (compare [Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022) note.md). The custom of wearing
nose-rings prevails in Eastern countries to the present day. The
circumstance of Job's friends each contributing a nose-ring of gold
([Job 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011) note.md) is a remarkable
parallel to the incident in Gideon's history. Rings of gold were also
used as money in Egypt, as appears on several early monuments, and by
the Celts.

[Judges 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 8:25</span></span>

They spread ... - The Septuagint reads "He spread his garment."

[Judges 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 8:26</span></span>

If the Ishmaelite nose-rings were half a shekel in weight, then 1,700
shekels weight of gold implied that 3,400 persons wearing, gold rings
had been slain. The "collars" were rather "ear-drops."

[Judges 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 8:27</span></span>

The ephod was that particular part of the high priest's dress which was
necessary to be worst when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim. It
seems that Gideon being now the civil ruler, desired to have an ephod of
his own, kept in his own city, to he worn by the priest whenever Gideon
might summon him to inquire of the Lord for him. His relations with the
tribe of Ephraim probably made him unwilling to resort to Shiloh.
Compare the act of Jeroboam [Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md).

[Judges 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 8:31</span></span>

Abimelech's mother was not reckoned among the wives, being, probably,
one of the Canaanite population in Shechem [Jdg
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#028.md) : neither was Abimelech himself
reckoned with the 70 other sons of Jerubbaal ([Jdg
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#024.md). Compare [Jdg
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001).md).

[Judges 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 8:33</span></span>

Turned again - Doubtless Gideon himself had no doubt prepared the way
for this apostacy by his unauthorized ephod. The Law of Moses, with its
strict unity of priesthood and altar, was the divinely-appointed and
only effectual preservative from idolatry.

Baal-bereth - The god of covenants or sworn treaties, corresponding to
the Zeus Orkius of the Greeks. The center of this fresh apostacy was at
Shechem.
