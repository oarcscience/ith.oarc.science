### [Psalms Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 40:0</span></span>

This psalm, which purports to have been composed by David, is another of
the psalms addressed or dedicated "to the chief Musician;" that is,
which he is desired to adjust to the appropriate music; and it is,
therefore, probably one that was particularly intended to be employed in
the public worship of the Hebrews. On the meaning of this expression,
see the notes to the inscription of [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

There is no method of ascertaining with certainty on what occasion the
psalm was composed. Doubtless it was in view of some of the trials which
occurred in the life of David, since there were many of these to which
the sentiments of the psalm may with propriety be applied. As it is
impossible now, however, from anything in the psalm itself, to ascertain
which of those afflictions were here referred to, or which suggested the
psalm, conjecture would be useless; nor, if we could ascertain to what
particular time of his life he made reference, would it furnish any
material aid in interpreting the psalm. It is to be presumed, however,
that there was a reference to some trouble or calamity in his own life;
and even if it be supposed that the psalm was designed to refer wholly
to the Messiah, and to be descriptive of his sufferings, still it is
probable that the language employed was suggested by something in the
life of the author of the psalm, and that he was led to contemplate the
future sufferings of the Messiah in connection with his own trials.

The contents of the psalm are as follows:

\(1\) A reference to some time of calamity or deep sorrow, represented
by being in a horrible pit, from which he had been delivered in answer
prayer - a deliverance so remarkable that the effect would be to lead
many, on account of it, to praise God, [Psa
40:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md).

\(2\) A statement of the blessedness of the man that made the Lord his
trust, and put confidence in him rather than in the proud of the earth,
or in those who were faithless or deceitful, [Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md).

\(3\) a grateful remembrance of the many works of the Lord; evidently as
laying the foundation of obligation to serve him in every way possible,
and as a "reason" of the purpose of obedience immediately referred to,
[Psa 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md).

\(4\) a statement of what He had done, or what he proposed to do, as
expressive of his sense of obligation, or of the service which God
required of him, [Psa 40:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md). The
speaker in the psalm says that God did not require of him sacrifice and
offering - that is, the bloody sacrifices prescribed in the Hebrew
ritual, [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); that God had
disposed him to obey, or had prepared him to render such obedience as
was required - ("Mine ears hast thou opened"), [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); that he came to obey, in
accordance with some prediction or previous record in regard to him,
[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); that he found his supreme
pleasure in doing the will of God, [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md); and that, in pursuance of this
arrangement and of this purpose, he had made known the will of God - had
preached righteousness in the great congregation, and had faithfully
declared the salvation of God, [Psa
40:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md).

\(5\) prayers and supplications founded on these facts - on his trials;
on his dangers; on the attempts of his enemies to destroy him; on his
desire for the welfare and safety of the people of God, [Psa
40:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md). Particularly:

\(a\) prayer for his own deliverance from the troubles which encompassed
him still, [Psa 40:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md);

\(b\) prayer that those who were opposed to him might be abased and
humbled, [Psa 40:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md);

\(c\) prayer that those who sought the Lord might rejoice and be glad,
[Psa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md); and

\(d\) a prayer for himself, as poor and needy, on the grounds that God
was his help and his deliverer, [Psa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md).

A very important and difficult question occurs here. It is the question
to whom the psalm originally referred.

On this question there have been the following opinions:

\(1\) that it refers originally and exclusively to David;

\(2\) that it had an original and exclusive reference to the Messiah;

\(3\) that it is susceptible of a double application, part of the psalm
having reference to David, and the other portion to the Messiah, as
having been suggested by his own circumstances; and

\(4\) that the portion of the psalm applied to the Messiah in [Heb
10:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md) is applied by way of
accommodation, or as expressing the meaning of the author of the epistle
to the Hebrews, but without affirming on the part of the writer of that
epistle that the psalm had originally any Messianic reference.

It would be too long to examine these opinions in detail; and all that
is needful in this brief introduction to the psalm may be to state some
reasons for what seems to me to be the true opinion, that the psalm had
an original and exclusive reference to the Messiah, or that it is one of
the compositions in the Old Testament, like [Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); Ps. 22, and [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), which were designed by the
Spirit of inspiration to describe the Messiah, as to some of his
characteristics, and as to what he would suffer.

\(1\) There are such psalms, such portions of the Old Testament. This is
admitted by all who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures. The
Messiah was the hope of the Jewish people. He was the subject of their
most sublime prophecies. The nation was accustomed to look forward to
him as their great Deliverer. In all times of national calamity they
looked forward to the period when He would appear for their rescue. He
was, so to speak, the hero of their national literature; the bright
object in the future to which all the sacred writers looked forward; the
glorious Saviour and Deliverer whose coming, and the anticipated benefit
of whose coming, animated their lays, and cheered them in the darkest
days of trouble and sorrow. Compare the Introduction to Isaiah, Section
7.

\(2\) The author of the epistle to the Hebrews expressly applies a part
of this psalm to the Messiah, [Heb
10:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). There can be no reasonable
doubt that he quoted this with the belief that the psalm had original
reference to him, and that he did not use the language by way of
accommodation, for he was endeavoring to demonstrate a point, or to
prove that what he was stating was true. This he does by relenting to
the passage in the psalm "as proof on the point then under
consideration." But there would have been no proof, no argument - in the
case, if he had merely quoted language by way of accommodation, which
had originally a different design. The very point of his quotation is
based on the fact that he was adducing a passage which had original
reference to the Messiah, and which might be properly quoted as
characterizing his work. The proof (as derived from this fact) that the
psalm had reference to the Messiah, consists of two things:

\(a\) That it is so applied by an inspired apostle, which, with all who
admit his inspiration would seem to be decisive of the question;

\(b\) that he so applied it, shows, in the circumstances, that this was
an ancient and admitted interpretation.

He was writing to those who had been Jews; to those whom he was desirous
of convincing as to the truth of what he was alleging in regard to the
notion of Hebrew sacrifices. For this purpose it was necessary to appeal
to the Old Testament; but it cannot be supposed that he would adduce, as
proof, a passage whose relevancy to the point would not be at once
admitted. It may be presumed, therefore, that the passage was commonly
applied by the Hebrews themselves to the purpose for which the apostle
used it, or that the application, when made, was so plain and obvious
that they would not call it in question.

\(3\) The entire psalm may be applied to the Messiah without anything
forced or unnatural in the interpretation. This will be shown, in
detail, in the exposition of the psalm; but in the meantime it may not
be improper to refer to the principal difficulties in such an
application, and to the principal objections derived from this source
against the idea that the psalm refers to the Messiah. The principal of
these relate to the following points:

\(a\) In [Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md) the speaker in the
psalm says: "He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, and out of
the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings;"
and on the ground of this, he gives thanks to God. But there is no real
difficulty in supposing that this refers to the Messiah, and that it was
actually fulfilled in the case of the Lord Jesus. His enemies often
plotted against his life; they laid snares for him; they endeavored to
destroy him; his dangers may well be represented as "an horrible pit,"
and as "miry clay;" and his deliverance from those perils may well be
compared with the case of one who is raised up from such a pit, and from
the deep mire. Even supposing that this was designed to refer to the
personal experience of the psalmist himself, still the language would be
figurative, and must be designed to refer to some danger, peril, or
trouble that would be well represented by being thrown into such a pit,
or sinking in miry clay. It cannot be supposed that the psalmist meant
to say this had really and literally occurred in his own life. Without
any impropriety, therefore, the language may be applied to the trials
and dangers of the Messiah, and to the merciful interposition of God in
delivering him.

\(b\) The second objection or difficulty in referring it to the Messiah
is derived from what is said in [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md) : "Mine iniquities have taken
hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
hairs of my head; therefore my heart faileth me." But, in reference to
the propriety of applying this to the Messiah, two remarks may be made:
First. It may be true that the Messiah was so identified with men -
became so truly a substitute for sinners - experienced in his own soul,
in the deep sorrows of the atonement, so intensely the effects of their
sin, and so bore the sufferings that were expressive of the divine sense
of the evil of sin, that the language might be applied to him as if
these sins were his own. He was treated as if they were his - as if he
had been a sinner. He so made them his own, that it was proper he should
be treated as if they were his, and that he might feel he was suffering
as if they were his.

It is true that they could not be literally transferred to him; it is
true that in no proper sense of the term was he a sinner; it is true
that in the just signification of the word he was not "guilty," and that
God always saw he was personally innocent; but still it is true that, in
the work of the atonement, he was treated as if he had been a sinner,
and that, in this sense, he might speak of the sins for which he
suffered as his own. He had voluntarily assumed them, and he was
suffering for them as if they had been his. Thus we have in [Isa
53:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md) similar language applied to
him: "He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows;" "he was
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the
chastisement of our peace was upon him;" "the Lord hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all." If such language might properly be applied to him
and his sufferings, then there could be no impropriety or incongruity in
his regarding himself as so identified with sinful men, and as so truly
bearing what was due to their sins, that he might speak of those sins
"as if" they were his own, as one might speak of a debt incurred by a
friend, and which he had brought himself under voluntary obligation to
pay, as if it were his own, and might say, "it is no longer his, but
mine."

The language of Scripture in regard to the relation of the Redeemer to
sin is often so marked and striking as to suggest and to justify this
language. See [Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md). Second. It is possible, after
all, that the word rendered "iniquities" in the psalm, means here merely
"calamity, trouble, sorrow." (See the notes at [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md); and compare Prof. Stuart on the
Epistle to the Hebrews, Excursus xx., p. 594.) So the same word which is
used here means, in [Sa2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012.md), "It
may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction." The words "iniquity"
and "calamity" - "sin" and "punishment" - are closely connected in the
Scriptures; so closely that the one is often put for the other, and when
a sacred writer speaks of his "sin," he often means the suffering or
calamity that has come upon him in consequence of his sin. So the
Messiah may be understood here to mean that the calamities or woes which
had come upon him in consequence of his taking upon him the sins of the
world made it proper to say that his "iniquities" - the iniquities which
he had assumed or which, in the language of Isaiah, he "bore" - had
"taken hold on him, so that he was not able to look up;" or, considering
their great number, he might say, "they are more than the hairs of my
head, therefore my heart faileth me."

\(c\) A third objection to the application of the psalm to the Messiah
is, that it cannot be supposed he would utter such imprecations on his
enemies as are found in [Psa 40:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md)
: "Let them be ashamed and confounded; let them be driven backward; let
them be desolate." To this it may be replied, that such imprecations are
as proper in the mouth of the Messiah as in the mouth of David; and that
they are improper in neither. Both David and the Messiah did utter
denunciations against the enemies of piety and of God. There is no
evidence that there was any malignant feeling in either case; nor is it
inconsistent with the highest benevolence to utter denunciation of
guilt. God constantly does it in his word; and he as often does it in
the dealings of his Providence. The wicked cannot walk through this
world without meeting denunciations of their guilt on every hand, and
there was no impiety in the fact that he who will pronounce a sentence
in the great day of judgment on all guilty men, should apprize them
beforehand of what would be sure to come upon them. The objections,
then, are not of such a nature that it is improper to regard the psalm
as wholly applicable to the Messiah.

\(4\) The psalm cannot be applied with propriety to David, nor do we
know of anyone to whom it can be applied but the Messiah. It was not
true of David that he "had come to do the will" of God, in view of the
fact that God did not require sacrifice and offerings, [Psa
40:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); it was not true that it was
written of him "in the volume of the book," that he delighted to do the
will of God, and that he had come into the world in view of the fact
that it "had been" so written [Psa
40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); it was not true that it had
been his characteristic work to "preach righteousness in the great
congregation" [Psa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md); but all this
was true of the Messiah. These expressions are such as can be applied
only to him; and, taking all these circumstances together, the
conclusion seems to be a proper one that the whole psalm had original
reference to the Redeemer, and is to be interpreted as applying to him
alone.

There is a remarkable resemblance between the close of this psalm [Psa
40:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md) and [Psa
70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md). Indeed, that entire psalm is
the same as the closing part of this one. Why that portion of the psalm
before us is thus repeated, and why it is separated from this and made a
psalm by itself, is wholly unknown. It cannot be supposed to be an error
in transcribing, for the error would be too material, and would most
certainly be detected. Perhaps it can best be accounted for by supposing
the author of [Psa 70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md) to have been
in the state of mind, and in the circumstances there described, and by
supposing that instead of writing a new psalm which would express his
feelings, he found that this part of Ps. 40, already composed, would
describe so exactly what he wished to express, and that he regarded it
as so adapted to be a prayer by itself, that he therefore copied it. The
fact, that it was thus copied, and that the sentiments were repeated,
does not in any manner detract from the supposition that it is inspired.

[Psalms 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 40:1</span></span>

I waited patiently for the Lord - Margin, as in Hebrew, "In waiting I
waited." That is, "I continued to wait." It was not a single, momentary
act of expectation or hope; it was continuous; or, was persevered in.
The idea is, that his prayer was not answered at once, but that it was
answered after he had made repeated prayers, or when it seemed as if his
prayers would not be answered. It is earnest, persevering prayer that is
referred to; it is continued supplication and hope when there seemed to
be no answer to prayer, and no prospect that it would be answered.

And he inclined unto me - That is, ultimately he heard and answered me;
or he turned himself favorably toward me, as the result of "persevering"
prayer. The word "inclined" here means properly "bowed;" that is, he
"bent forward" to hearken, or to place his ear near my mouth and to hear
me. At first, he seemed as one that would not hear; as one that throws
his head backward or turns his head away. Ultimately, however, he bent
forward to receive my prayer.

And heard my cry - The cry or supplication which I made for help; the
cry which I directed to him in the depth of my sorrows and my danger,
[Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md). As applied to the Redeemer,
this would refer to the fact that in his sorrows, in the deep sorrows
connected with the work of redemption, he persevered in calling on God,
and that God heard him, and raised him up to glory and joy. See [Mat
26:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md). Compare the notes at [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md). The time supposed to be referred
to, is after his sufferings were closed; after his work was done;
"after" he rose from the dead. It is the language of grateful
remembrance which we may suppose he uttered in the review of the amazing
sorrows through which he had passed in making the atonement, and in the
recollection that God had kept him in those sorrows, and had brought him
up from such a depth of woe to such a height of glory.

[Psalms 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 40:2</span></span>

He brought me up also out of an horrible pit - Margin: "A pit of noise."
The word used here means a pit; a cistern; a prison; a dungeon; a grave.
This last signification of the word is found in [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md); [Psa
88:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md); [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md); [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md). It may refer to any calamity -
or to trouble, like being in a pit - or it may refer to the grave. The
word rendered "horrible" - שׁאון shâ'ôn - means properly "noise, uproar,
tumult," as of waters; of a crowd of men; of war. Then it seems to be
used in the sense of "desolation" or "destruction," as applicable to the
grave. DeWette understands it here of a pit, a cavern, or an abyss that
roars or is tumultuous; that is, that is impassable. Perhaps this is the
idea - a cavern, deep and dark, where the waters roar, and which seems
to be filled with horrors. So Rosenmuller understands it. The Septuagint
renders it: ἐκ λάκκου ταλαιπωρίας ek lakkou talaipōrias, "a lake of
misery." It is a deep and horrid cavern, where there is no hope of being
rescued, or where it would seem that there would be certain destruction.

Out of the miry clay - At the bottom of the pit. Where there was no
solid ground - no rock on which to stand. See [Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md); [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md), [Psa
69:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014.md).

And set my feet upon a rock - Where there was firm standing.

And established my goings - Or, fixed my steps. That is, he enabled me
to walk as on solid ground; he conducted me along safely, where there
was no danger of descending to the pit again or of sinking in the mire.
If we understand this of the Redeemer, it refers to that time when, his
sorrows ended, and his work of atonement done, it became certain that he
would never be exposed again to such dangers, or sink into such a depth
of woes, but that his course ever onward would be one of safety and of
glory.

[Psalms 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 40:3</span></span>

And he hath put a new song in my mouth - See the notes at [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md). The idea is, that he had given a
new or fresh "occasion" for praise. The deliverance was so marked, and
was such an addition to former mercies, that a new expression of thanks
was proper. It was an act of such surprising intervention on the part of
God that the language used on former occasions, and which was adapted to
express the mercies then received, would not be sufficient to convey the
sense of gratitude felt for the present deliverance. As applied to the
Messiah, and referring (as it was supposed in the notes at [Psa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002).md) to his being raised up to glory
after the depth of his sorrows, it would mean that no language hitherto
employed to express gratitude to God would be adequate to the occasion,
but that the language of a new song of praise would be demanded to
celebrate so great an event.

Even praise unto our God - "To our God;" identifying himself, as the
Messiah does, with his people, and expressing the idea that the new song
of praise was appropriate to them as well as to "himself," since they
would be benefited by his work, and since God was their God as well as
his. Compare [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md).

Many shall see it - Great numbers of the human race shall be made
acquainted with the occasion which there was for such a song.

And fear - Learn to reverence, to worship, to honor God, as the result
of what had been done.

And shall trust in the Lord - Shall confide in God; shall put their
trust in him; shall become his true worshippers and friends:

\(a\) as the effect of this merciful interposition in behalf of him who
had been thus in trouble or distress, and who was enabled to triumph;

\(b\) as the result of the work accomplished by him.

The effect of the Redeemer's sorrows, and of God's merciful help, would
be that great numbers would learn to put their trust in God, or would
become his true friends. No man, in fact, can compute the "numbers" of
those who, in consequence of the work of the Messiah, will turn to God
and become his true worshippers and friends.

[Psalms 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 40:4</span></span>

Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust - See the notes at
[Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md). Compare [Psa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md). Literally, here, "The blessings
of the man who places Yahweh for his confidence;" that is, who makes Him
his seeurity, or who feels that his security for happiness and salvation
is in Him.

And respecteth not the proud - The haughty, or those who are confident
in themselves. Literally, "who looks not to the proud;" that is, who
does not depend on them for help and for salvation.

Nor such as turn aside to lies - Who depart from the straight path, and
incline to that which is false and deceitful. The reference is to those
who are easily made to swerve from that which is true and honest to that
which is delusive and false. Their integrity cannot be confided in.
There is no security that they will be disposed to do right. The idea
is, that the man who trusts in God is blessed or happy, as compared with
one who trusts in man; man confident in himself; man liable to fall into
error; man who is easily led astray; man who is deceitful, and who
cannot, therefore, be relied on. God is mighty, but not haughty; God
never is drawn aside from the truth; he never deceives.

[Psalms 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 40:5</span></span>

Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done -
literally, "Many (things), O Lord my God, hast thou done; thy wonderful
things and thy thoughts toward us, it is not (possible) to state unto
thee." The recollection of the particular kindness shown to the speaker,
as referred to in the previous verses, suggests the recollection of the
great number of wonders that God had done for his people - the acts of
his kindness which it would be hopeless to attempt to recount before
him. And who "could" enumerate and record all the acts of God's
benevolence toward men in the works of creation, providence, and
redemption; all that he has done in the history of the Church, and for
the individual members of the Church in past times; all that he has done
to save his people in the days of persecution; all that has been
accomplished in our own individual lives? Obviously these things are
beyond all power of enumeration by man. They can be admired now only in
the gross; eternity alone will be sufficient for us to look at them and
to recount them in detail. The phrase "wonderful works" means here
remarkable interventions; things fitted to excite astonishment; things
that surpass what man could have anticipated; things that could have
been done only by God.

And thy thoughts which are to us-ward - Toward us; or which pertain to
us. The word "thoughts" here refers to the plans, purposes, arrangements
of God designed for our welfare; the things that are the result of his
thinking of our wants - of what we need - of what would do us good. See
[Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md).

They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee - Margin, "None can order
them unto thee." Literally, "There is no putting them in order before
thee;" that is, there is no such arranging of them, or disposing of them
in order, that they can all be brought into their proper place, so as to
be perceived or numbered. The Hebrew word - ערך ‛ârak - means properly,
to place in a row; to put in order; to arrange; as, to put an army in
battle array, or to draw it up for battle, [Jdg
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#020.md), [Jdg
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#022.md); to put words in order for an
argument, or to arrange thoughts so as to present an argument, [Job
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#014.md); to set a cause in order before
a judge, or to lay it before him, [Job
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md). The word also means to place
together with anything, or by the side of anything - that is, to make a
comparison. Gesenius (Lexicon) supposes that this is the idea here, and
that the proper interpretation is, "Nothing can be compared unto thee."
But the other interpretation seems best to accord with the connection,
as referring to the wonderful works of God, and to his thoughts of mercy
and goodness as being beyond the power of computation, or as too
numerous to be brought into order and arrangement before the mind.

If I would declare and speak of them - If I should attempt to speak of
them; or to recount them.

They are more than can be numbered - More than man can enumerate. They
go beyond the power of language to express them. This is literally true.
No language of man can describe what God has done and has purposed in
fitting up this world as an abode for people, and in his mercy toward
them.

[Psalms 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 40:6</span></span>

Sacrifice and offering - The first of the words used here - זבח zebach -
means properly a bloody-offering; the other - מנחה minchāh - an offering
without blood, as a thank-offering. See the notes at [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md). The four words employed in this
verse - sacrifice, offering, burnt-offering, sin-offering - embrace all
the species of sacrifice and offerings known among the Hebrews; and the
idea here is, that such offering as they were accustomed to offer was
required of him who is here referred to. A higher service was needed.

Thou didst not desire - The word here rendered desire means to incline
to, to be favorably disposed, as in reference to doing anything; that
is, to will, to desire, to please. The meaning here is, that he did not
will this or wish it; he would not be pleased with it in comparison with
obedience, or as a substitute for obedience. He preferred obedience to
any external rites and forms; to all the rites and forms of religion
prescribed by the law. They were of no value without obedience; they
could not be substituted in the place of obedience. This sentiment often
occurs in the Old Testament, showing that the design of all the rites
then prescribed was to bring men to obedience, and that they were of no
value without obedience. See the notes at [Isa
1:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md); compare [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); [Psa
51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md); see also the notes at [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md).

Mine ears hast thou opened - Margin: "digged." The Hebrew word - כרה
kârâh - means "to dig;" as, to dig a well, [Gen
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025.md); to dig a sepulchre, [Gen
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#005.md). As used here this would properly
mean, "mine ears hast thou digged out;" that is, thou hast so opened
them that there is a communication with the seat of hearing; or, in
other words, thou hast caused me to hear this truth, or hast revealed it
to me. Compare [Isa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md), "The Lord
God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious." The meaning here
would be, that the ear had been opened, so that it was quick to hear. An
indisposition to obey the will of God is often expressed by the fact
that the ears are "stopped:" [Zac
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md); [Psa
58:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md); [Pro
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013.md). There is manifestly no allusion
here, though that has been supposed by many to be the reference, to the
custom of boring through the ear of a servant with an awl, as a sign
that he was willing to remain with his master: [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md); [Deu
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md). In that case the outer circle,
or rim of the ear was "bored through" with an awl; here the idea is that
of "hollowinq out," digging, excavating, that is, of making a passage
"through," so that one could hear; not the mere piercing of the outer
ear. The essential idea is, that this truth had been communicated to him
- that God preferred obedience to sacrifice; and that he had been made
attentive to that truth, "as if" he had been before deaf, and his ears
had been opened. The principal difficulty in the passage relates to its
application in the Epistle to the Hebrews, [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). That difficulty arises from the
fact that the Septuagint translates the phrase here by the words "a body
hast thou prepared me;" and that the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews founds an argument on that translation, with reference to the
work of the Messiah. On this point, see the notes at [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). It is perhaps not now possible
to explain this difficulty in a way that will be entirely satisfactory.

burnt-offering - See the notes at [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md). The uniqueness of this offering
was that it was consumed by fire.

And sin-offering - sin-offering was an offering or sacrifice made
specifically for sin, with a view to expiate either sin in general, or
some specific act of sin. In the Mosaic law there are two kinds of these
offerings prescribed; "trespass-offerings," or offerings for guilt or
fault, denoted by the word אשׁם 'âshâm; and sin-offering, denoted by the
word used here. They are offerings which were consumed by fire, Lev.
5:1-19; [Lev 6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md); [Lev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010.md). But the essential "idea" was
that they were for "sin," or for some act of guilt. In a general sense,
this was true of all bloody offerings or sacrifices; but in these cases
the attention of the worshipper was turned particularly to the fact of
sin or transgression.

Thou hast not required - That is, thou hast not required them as
compared with obedience; in other words, thou hast preferred the latter.
These offerings would not meet the case. More was necessary to be done
than was implied in these sacrifices. They would not expiate sin; they
would not remove guilt; they would not give the conscience peace. A
higher work, a work implied in an act of "obedience" of the most exalted
kind, was demanded in order to accomplish the work to be done. Compare
[Psa 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 40:7</span></span>

Then said I - In [Heb 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), the
apostle applies this to the Messiah. See the notes at that verse. This
is the most simple and satisfactory interpretation of the passage. The
word "then" in this verse means, "since this is the case;" or, "things
being thus." It does not refer to time, but to the condition of things.
"Since it was certain that the work needful to be done could not be
accomplished by bloody offerings - the sacrifice of animals - under
these circumstances I said;" that is, I resolved or purposed to come.

Lo, I come - It is difficult to see how this could be applied to David;
it is easy to see how it could be applied to the Messiah. When all
bloody offerings under the law - all the sacrifices which men could make
- did not avail to put away sin, it was true of the Messiah that he came
into the world to perform a higher work that would meet the case - a
lofty work of obedience, extending even unto death, [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md). This is precisely the use which
the apostle makes of the passage in [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), and this is clearly the most
obvious meaning. It is in no sense applicable to David; it is fully
applicable to the Messiah.

In the volume of the book - literally, "in the roll of the book." See
the notes at [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md). The phrase
would most naturally denote the "scroll of the law;" but it might
include any volume or roll where a record or prophecy was made. In a
large sense it would embrace all that had been written at the command of
God at the time when this was supposed to be spoken. That is, as spoken
by the Messiah, it would include all the books of the Old Testament. See
the notes at [Heb 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md).

It is written of me - It is recorded; or, there is a record made of me;
to wit, in this respect, that his great delight would be to do the will
of God. The proper interpretation of this expression must he, that there
must be some record to be found in the "book" or" volume" referred to,
which was designed to describe him in this respect, or which had an
original reference to him. The meaning is not that there was a general
record on the point of obedience which might be applied to him as well
as to others, but that the record was intended to be applied to him, and
to describe his character. This is one of the passages in the Psalms
which cannot with any propriety be applied to David himself. There was
no such antecedent record in regard to him; no statement in any "book"
or "volume" that this would be his character. There is no promise - no
intimation - in any of the books of Scripture written before the time of
David that he would come to do the will of God with a view to effect
that which could not be done by the sacrifices and offerings under the
law.

The reference of the language, therefore, must be to the Messiah - to
some place where it is represented or affirmed that he would come to
accomplish by his obedience what could not be done by the sacrifices and
oblations made under the law. Thus understood, and regarded as the
language of the Messiah himself, the reference might be to all the books
of the Old Testament (for all were completed before he came), and not
merely to those which had been written in the time of David. But still,
it is true that no such declaration, in so many words, can now be found
in any of those books; and the meaning must be that this was the
language which was everywhere implied respecting the Messiah; that this
was the substance of the description given of him; that this
characterized his work as predicted there; to wit, that when all
sacrifices and offerings under the law failed; when they had all shown
that they were not efficacious to put away sin, One would come to
perform some higher work that would be effectual in putting away
transgression, and that this work might, in the highest sense, be
described as "obedience," or as "doing the will of God." This was true.
The language and the institutions of the Old Testament contemplated him
as the One who only could put away sin. The entire spirit of the Mosaic
economy supposed that a Saviour would come to do the will of God by
making an atonement for the sin of the world. The meaning then is, "I
come to do thy will in making an atonement, for no other offering would
expiate sin; that I would do this, is the language of the Scriptures in
predicting my coming, and of the whole spirit and design of the ancient
dispensation."

[Psalms 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 40:8</span></span>

I delight to do thy will, O my God - To wit, in obeying the law; in
submitting to all the trials appointed to me; in making an atonement for
the sins of men. See the notes at [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md). Compare [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md); [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md).

Yea, thy law is within my heart - Margin, "In the midst of my bowels."
So the Hebrew. The idea is, that the law of God was within him. His
obedience was not external, but proceeded from the heart. How true this
was of the Redeemer it is not necessary here to say.

[Psalms 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 40:9</span></span>

I have preached righteousness in the great congregation - I have main
tained and defended the principles of righteousness and truth among
assembled multitudes. it would be difficult to see how this could be
applied to David himself, or on what occasion of his life this could be
said of him; but no one can doubt that this is applicable to the
Messiah:

\(a\) He was a preacher.

\(b\) He addressed vast multitudes.

\(c\) Before them all, and at all times, he maintained and illustrated
the great principles of "righteousness" as demanded by the law of God,
and unfolded the way in which all those multitudes might become
righteous before God.

Lo, I have not refrained my lips - I have not closed my lips. I have not
kept back the truth.

O Lord, thou knowest - He could make this solemn appeal to God as the
Searcher of hearts, in proof that he had faithfully uttered all that had
been required of him in making known the will of God. Compare [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md), [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md),[Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008.md), [Joh
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014.md), [Joh
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md).

[Psalms 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 40:10</span></span>

I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart - The word
"righteousness" here may denote the divine views on the subject of
righteousness, or the divine method of making man righteous; that is,
the method of justification, as the word is used in the New Testament.
See the notes at [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). The word,
as it might have been employed by David, would have been used in the
former sense, as meaning that, knowing what God requires of men, he had
not concealed that in his heart, or had not kept it to himself; as used
by the Messiah, as I suppose it to be here, it would be employed in the
latter sense, or perhaps embrace both. The idea would be, that he had
not concealed in his own mind, or had not kept to himself, the knowledge
which he had of the requirements of the law of God, or of the way in
which man can be justified or regarded and treated as righteous in his
sight. He had fully communicated this knowledge to others. It is not
necessary to say that this was literally fulfilled in the work of the
Redeemer. He spent his life in making known the great truths about the
righteousness of God; he died that he might disclose to man a way by
which God could consistently regard and treat men as righteous. See the
notes at [Rom 3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md).

I have declared thy faithfulness - Thy truthfulness; I have showed that
God is worthy of confidence. And thy salvation. Thy method of salvation,
or of saving men.

I have not concealed thy loving kindness - Thy mercy or thy merciful
disposition toward men. He had shown to the human race that God was a
merciful Being; a Being who would pardon sin.

And thy truth - The truth which thou hast revealed; the truth on all
subjects which it was important for men to understand.

From the great congregation - That is, as in [Psa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md), the assembled multitudes - the
throngs that gathered to hear the words of the Great Teacher. Compare
[Mat 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md); [Mat
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002.md); [Luk
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 40:11</span></span>

Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord - Do not restrain
or hold back thy compassions. Let thy mercies - the expressions of thy
love - flow out freely toward me in connection with what I have done. As
applicable to the Redeemer, this is a prayer that God would bestow upon
him in connection with his work, and as a reward of his work,
appropriate proofs of his goodness. And especially is this to be
understood here as a prayer for support and deliverance in the sorrows
that came upon him in the accomplishment of his work. The prayer is
intermediate between the expression of his purpose to do the will of God
when all other means of salvation had failed [Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), and the sorrows or sufferings
that would come upon him in the accomplishment of his work [Psa
40:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md). He saw himself at this point
of his life, as represented in the psalm, as about to sink into the
depth of woes. He had kept the law of God, and had by his obedience thus
far done His will. He had made known the truth of God, and had declared
His great message to the assembled multitude that had crowded his path,
and thronged to hear him. He saw himself now about to enter the vale of
sorrow; to plunge into that depth of the unutterable woes connected with
the making of an atonement. He prayed, therefore, that, in these
approaching sorrows, God would not withhold the expression of his tender
mercy. The point of time, therefore, in the Redeemer's life which the
verse before us occupies, is that awful and sorrowful hour when, his
public work of teaching and of miracles finished, he was about to endure
the agonies of Gethsemane and of the cross.

Let thy loving-kindness - Thy mercy. "And thy truth." Thy promises; thy
plighted support and strength; thy fidelity. That is, he prayed that God
would show himself true and faithful in bearing him through the great
work of the atonement.

Continually - Through the whole of these sorrows. Do not for a moment
leave or forsake me.

Preserve me - Keep me from sinking under these woes; from speaking any
improper word; from shrinking back; from being overcome by the tempter;
from failing in the great work now to be accomplished. As the Redeemer
had a human as well as a divine nature; as he was man, with all human
susceptibilities to suffering, it was not inappropriate that he should
utter this prayer, and lift up his heart with the utmost earnestness to
God, that he might not be forsaken in the consummation of the great work
of his life, and that this work might not fail.

[Psalms 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 40:12</span></span>

For innumerable evils have compassed me about - Have surrounded me, or
have beset me on every side. The evils here referred to, understood as
being those which came upon the Messiah, were sorrows that came upon him
in consequence of his undertaking to do what could not be done by
sacrifices and offerings [Psa 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md);
that is, his undertaking to save men by his own "obedience unto death."
The time referred to here, I apprehend, is that when the full effects of
his having assumed the sins of the world to make expiation for them came
upon him; when he was about to endure the agonies of Gethsemane and
Calvary.

Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me - On this passage, as
constituting one of the main objections, and the strongest objection, to
the application of the psalm to the Messiah, and on the way in which
such objection may be met, see introduction to this psalm (3b).

So that I am not able to look up - This is not the exact idea of the
Hebrew word. That is simply, I am not able to see; and it refers to the
dimness or failure of sight caused by distress, weakness, or old age.
[Sa1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md); [Sa1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#015.md); [Kg1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#004.md); compare [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md). The idea here is, not that he was
unable to look up, but that the calamities which came upon him were so
heavy and severe as to make his sight dim, or to deprive him of vision.
Either by weeping, or by the mere pressure of suffering, he was so
affected as almost to be deprived of the power of seeing.

They are more than the hairs of mine head - That is, the sorrows that
come upon me in connection with sin. The idea is that they were
innumerable - the hairs of the head, or the sands on the seashore; being
employed in the Scriptures to denote what cannot be numbered. See [Psa
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md). Compare [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md); [Jos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004.md); [Sa2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011.md).

Therefore my heart faileth me - Margin, as in Hebrew: "forsaketh." The
idea is that he sank under these sufferings; he could not sustain them.

[Psalms 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 40:13</span></span>

Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me - That is, in these troubles and
sorrows. See [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md). The prayer is
that, if possible, the cup of sorrow might be taken away.

O Lord, make haste to help me - This is the same form of prayer, and
referring, I suppose, to the same occasion as that which occurs in [Psa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019.md). See the notes at that verse.

[Psalms 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 40:14</span></span>

Let them be ashamed and confounded together - See at [Psa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md), note; [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md), note. This may be understood
here rather as a confident expectation than a wish or desire. It implies
the certainty that they would thus be ashamed and confounded; that is,
that they would not be successful, or would be foiled in their purposes.
But understood as a wish or prayer, it could not be improper. There is
no sin in the wish that the wicked may not be successful in their plans,
and may not be suffered to injure us. As the language of the Messiah it
was in every way an appropriate prayer that the purposes of those who
would defeat his design in coming into the world might be foiled - for
on the execution of that design depended the salvation of a lost race.

That seek after my soul to destroy it - That seek after my life; that
would destroy me. That is, they seek to kill me; they would take my life
before the full time is come. As understood of the Messiah, this would
refer to the times when his life was in danger, as it often was, before
the full period had arrived for him to die: [Joh
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md); [Mat
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018.md). The purpose of his enemies was
to take his life; to prevent the spread of his doctrines; to cheek him
in his work. The taking of his life at any time before the full period
had arrived, or in any other way than that in which he had purposed to
lay it down, would have been a defeat of his work, since in the plan of
salvation it was contemplated that he should die at a certain time, and
in a certain manner - that he should die at the time which had been
predicted by the prophets, and in such a mode as to make an atonement
for sin. All this would have been defeated if, before that time came, he
had been put to death by stoning, or in any of the numerous ways in
which his life was threatened.

Let them be driven backward, and put to shame, that wish me evil -
Turned backward, as they are who are unsuccessful, or are defeated.
Compare [Joh 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 40:15</span></span>

Let them be desolate - The word here employed means to be astonished or
amazed; then, to be laid waste, or made desolate. As used here, it
refers to their purposes, and the wish or prayer is that they might be
wholly unsuccessful, or that in respect to success they might be like a
waste and desolate field where nothing grows.

For a reward - The word used here - עקב ‛êqeb - means the end, the last
of anything; then, the recompence, reward, wages, as being the end, the
result, or issue of a certain course of conduct. That is, in this case,
the desolation prayed for would be a proper recompence for their
purpose, or for what they said. "Of their shame." Of their shameful act
or purpose; their act as deserving of ignominy.

That say unto me, Aha, aha - That use language of reproach and contempt.
This is a term of exultation over another; a word of rejoicing at the
calamities that come on another; an act of joy over a fallen enemy: [Eze
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md); see [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md), note; [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025.md), note. As understood of the
Messiah, this would refer to the taunts and reproaches of his enemies;
the exultation which they manifested when they had him in their power -
when they felt secure that their vexations in regard to him were at an
end, or that they would be troubled with him no more. By putting him to
death they supposed that they might feel safe from further molestation
on his account. For this act, this note of exultation and joy, on the
part of the Jewish rulers, and of the people as stimulated by those
rulers, the desolation which came upon them (the utter ruin of their
temple, their city, and their nation) was an appropriate reward. That
desolation did not go beyond their desert, for their treatment of the
Messiah - as the ruin of the sinner in the future world will not go
beyond his desert for having rejected the same Messiah as his Saviour.

[Psalms 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 40:16</span></span>

Let all those that seek thee - All those who desire to know thee; to
understand thy ways; to be thy friends. The phrase is used to denote the
truly pious, because it is a characteristic of all such that they truly
desire to be acquainted with God, and to find the way which leads to his
favor.

Rejoice and be glad in thee -

\(1\) By finding thee, or securing the object which they sought;

\(2\) in thee, as the source of all true comfort and joy.

The prayer is that all such may be successful in their efforts, while
those who have no such aim may be disappointed, [Psa
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md).

Let such as love thy salvation -

\(a\) Thy method of salvation, or the appointed way by which men may be
saved; and

\(b\) the salvation itself - deliverance from the guilt and dominion of
sin, and complete and eternal restoration to the favor of God.

Say continually, The Lord be magnified - See the notes at [Psa
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027.md), where the same expression

[Psalms 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 40:17</span></span>

But I am poor and needy - More literally, "I am afflicted and poor." The
language would describe the condition of one who was afflicted and was
at the same time poor; of one who had no resource but in God, and who
was passing through scenes of poverty and sorrow. There were undoubtedly
times in the life of David to which this language would be applicable;
but it would be far more applicable to the circumstances in which the
Redeemer was placed; and, in accordance with the interpretation which
has been given of the other parts of the psalm, I suppose that this is
designed to represent his afflicted and humble condition as a man of
poverty and sorrow.

Yet the Lord thinketh upon me - The Lord cares for me; he has not
forgotten me. Man forsakes me, but he will not. Man leaves me to poverty
and sorrow, but, he will not. How true this was of the Redeemer, that
the Lord, the Father of mercies; thought on him, it is not needful now
to say; nor can it be doubted that in the heavy sorrows of his life this
was a source of habitual consolation. To others also - to all his
friends - this is a source of unspeakable comfort. To be an object of
the thoughts of God; to be had in his mind; to be constantly in his
remembrance; to be certain that he will not forsake us in our trouble;
to be assured in our own minds that one so great as God is - the
infinite and eternal One - will never cease to think on us, may well
sustain us in all the trials of life. It matters little who does forsake
us, if he does not; it would be of little advantage to us who should
think on us, if he did not.

Thou art my help and my deliverer - Implying the highest confidence. See
the notes at [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).

Make no tarrying, O my God - Do not linger or delay in coining to my
assistance. The psalm closes with this prayer. Applied to the Redeemer,
it indicates strong confidence in God in the midst of his afflictions
and sorrows, with earnest pleading, coming from the depth of those
sorrows, that God would interpose for him. The vision of the psalmist
extended here no farther. His eye rested on a suffering Messiah -
afflicted, crushed, broken, forsaken - with all the woes connected with
the work of human redemption, and all the sorrows expressive of the evil
of sin clustering upon him, yet confident in God, and finding his last
consolation in the feeling that God "thought" on him, and in the
assurance that He would not ultimately forsake him. There is something
delightful, though pensive, in the close of the psalm. The last prayer
of the sufferer - the confident, earnest pleading - lingers on the ear,
and we almost seem to behold the Sufferer in the depth of his sorrows,
and in the earnestness of his supplication, calmly looking up to God as
One that "thought" on him when all others had forgotten him; as a last,
safe refuge when every other refuge had failed. So, in our sorrows, we
may lie before the throne, calmly looking up to God with a feeling that
we are not forgotten; that there is One who "thinks" on us; and that it
is our privilege to pray to him that he would hasten to deliver us. All
sorrow can be borne when we feel that God has not forgotten us; we may
be calm when all the world forsakes us, if we can feel assured that the
great and blessed God thinks on us, and will never cease to remember us.
