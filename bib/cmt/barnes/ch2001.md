Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 1:13</span></span>

From his journey - These words are not in the original text, which is
thought to be corrupt. It is best to correct the text, and then simply
to translate: "And Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon
to Jerusalem."

[2 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 1:14</span></span>

This passage is very nearly identical with [Kg1
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md).

[2 Chronicles 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 1:2</span></span>

The narrative here corresponds with [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004.md); but is very much fuller. We learn
from the present passage:

\(1\) that Solomon's sacrifice at Gibeon was a great public festivity,
to which he collected vast numbers of the people;

\(2\) that it was made upon the brass altar of Bezaleel, which

\(3\) stood before the tabernacle; and

\(4\) that Solomon's vision was on the night of his sacrifice. Consult
the marginal references

[Ch2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005.md)

Sought unto it - i. e., "frequented it" - "were in the habit of making
use of it."

[2 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 1:7</span></span>

The verbal differences between this passage and the corresponding one of
Kings [Kg1 3:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md) are very
considerable, and indicate the general truth that the object of the
sacred historians is to give a true account of the real bearing of what
was said: not ordinarily to furnish us with all or the exact words that
were uttered. The most important point omitted in Chronicles, and
supplied by Kings, is the conditional promise of long life made to
Solomon [Kg1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md); while the chief
point absent from Kings, and recorded by our author, is the solemn
appeal made by Solomon to the promise of God to David his father [Ch2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#009.md), which he now called upon God to
"establish," or to perform.

[Ch2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012.md)

I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor - Remark that the writer
says nothing of any promise to Solomon of "long life," which, however,
had been mentioned in [Ch2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011.md) among
the blessings which he might have been expected to ask. The reason for
the omission would seem to lie in the writer's desire to record only
what is good of this great king. Long life was included in the promises
made to him; but it was granted conditionally; and Solomon not
fulfilling the conditions, it did not take effect ([Kg1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014) note.md).
