### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

The sons of David - The writer returns to the point at which he had left
the posterity of Ram [Ch1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#009.md), [Ch1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015.md), and traces out the family of
David - the royal house of the tribe of Judah.

Daniel - See the marginal note and reference.

There are three lists of the sons of David, born in Jerusalem.

[Sa2 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014.md) [Ch1
3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md) [Ch1
14:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#004.md) 1. Shammuah Shimeah\* Shammuah
2. Shobab Shobab Shobab 3. Nathan Nathan Nathan 4. Solomon Solomon
Solomon 5. Ibhar Ibhar Ibhar 6. Elishua Elishama\* Elishua 7. a
Eliphelet\* Elpalet\* 8. a Nogah Nogah 9. Nepheg Nepheg Nepheg 10.
Japhia Japhia Japhia 11. Elishama Elishama Elishama 12. Eliada Eliada
Beeliada\* 13. Eliphelet Eliphelet Eliphelet (Differences are marked
with an asterick).

A comparison of the three lists serves to show:

\(1\) that "Shimeah" and the first "Elishama" in the list of this
chapter are corruptions;

\(2\) that David had really 13 sons born in Jerusalem, of whom two - the
first Eliphelet and Nogah - probably died in their childhood; and

\(3\) that Eliada, the twelfth son, was also called Beeliada, the term
Baal, "lord," not having (previous to the introduction of the Baal
worship) a bad sense, but being regarded as an equivalent with El,
"God."

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

Bathshua, the daughter of Ammiel - Both names are here given in an
unusual form, but it may be doubted whether in either case there has
been any corruption. In "Bathshua," for "Bathsheba," a ו (v) replaces
the ב (b) of the earlier writer, "w" and "b" having nearly the same
sound. In "Ammiel," for "Eliam," the two elements which form the name
are inverted, as in Jehoiachin =Jechoniah, and the like.

[1 Chronicles 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 3:10</span></span>

Abia - Rather, "Abijah," as in 2 Chr. 11-14, where the Hebrew word is
exactly the same.

[1 Chronicles 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 3:11</span></span>

Ahaziah - Called "Jehoahaz" by a transposition of the elements composing
the name, and "Azariah," probably by a transcriber's error (see marginal
notes and references).

[1 Chronicles 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 3:12</span></span>

Azariah - Elsewhere in Chronicles called uniformly "Uzziah" ([Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md), [Ch2
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#003.md),[Ch2
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md), [Ch2
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011), etc..md), but called indifferently
"Azariah" and "Uzziah" in Kings ("Azariah" in [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md); [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), [Kg2
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#006.md),[Kg2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#017.md), [Kg2
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023.md), [Kg2
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027.md), etc.; "Uzziah" in [Kg2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013.md), [Kg2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md), [Kg2
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034).md).

[1 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 3:15</span></span>

Of the sons of Josiah, Johanan, "the first-born," who is mentioned in
this place only, must, it would seem, have died before his father, or
with him at Megiddo; and Shallum (also called Jehoahaz, marginal note
and reference) was considerably older than Zedekiah, and was
consequently the third, and not the fourth, son. He is perhaps assigned
the fourth place here by way of intentional degradation. Compare [Jer
22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md); [Eze
19:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#003.md).

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

Assir - Perhaps born in the captivity, and therefore so named, who
either (died young, or was made a eunuch ([Isa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md); compare [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030).md). After Assir's decease, or
mutilation, the line of Solomon became extinct, and according to the
principles of the Jewish law [Num
27:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008.md) the inheritance passed to the
next of kin, who were Salathiel and his brethren, descendants from David
by the line of Nathan. Luke in calling Salathiel "the son of Neri" [Luk
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#027.md), gives his real, or natural,
descent; since no genealogy would assign to the true son and heir of a
king any inferior and private parentage. Hence, "Malchiram," etc., i. e.
not Salathiel only, but his brothers also were reckoned "sons" of
Jeconiah.

[1 Chronicles 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 3:19</span></span>

Zerubbabel, elsewhere always called "the son of Salathiel," was only
Salathiel's heir and legal son, being naturally his nephew, the son of
his brother, Pedaiah.

[1 Chronicles 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 3:22</span></span>

Six - There are only five names in the Hebrew text. The Syriac anti
Arabic versions supply "Azariah" between Neariah and Shaphat.

The question of the proper arrangement of the genealogy of the
descendants of Zerubbabel [Ch1 3:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md)
is important in its bearing on the interesting point of the time at
which the canon of the Old Testament was closed. Assuming the average of
a generation to be 20 years in the East, the genealogy of the present
chapter, drawn out according to the Hebrew text, does not descend below
about 410 B.C., and thus falls within the probable lifetime of Nehemiah.

If, further, we regard it as most probable that Ezra died before 431
B.C., and that this passage in question was not wholly written by him,
this does not disprove the theory (see the introduction to Chronicles),
that Ezra was the author of Chronicles. Deuteronomy is by Moses, though
the last chapter cannot be from his hand. The "dukes of Edom" might he
an insertion into the text of Genesis [Gen
36:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040.md) without the authorship of the
remainder of the work being affected by it. So here; Nehemiah, or
Malachi, may have carried on the descent of the "sons of David" as far
as it had reached in their time, adding to the account given by Ezra
one, or at the most two verses.
