### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 7:0</span></span>

Eccl. 7 and Eccl. 10 show a striking resemblance to the style of the
writer of the Book of Proverbs. Hereto the principal object has been to
state the vanity of the conditions of human life: henceforth, the
principal object will be to direct man how to conduct himself under
those conditions.

The general drift of the writer's counsels throughout the last six
chapters, and particularly in Eccl. 7:1-22, points to wisdom united with
the fear of God as the "good for man in this life." It is illustrated by
frequent reference to, and contrast with, that evil which consists of
folly allied with wickedness.

[Ecclesiastes 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 7:1</span></span>

Name ... ointment - The likeness between reputation and odor supplies a
common metaphor: the contrast is between reputation, as an honorable
attainment which only wise people win, and fragrant odor, as a
gratification of the senses which all people enjoy.

The connection of this verse with the preceding verses is this: the man,
who wants to know what is profitable for man and good in this life, is
here told to act in such a way as ordinarily secures a good reputation
(i. e., to act like a wise man), and to teach himself this hard lesson -
to regard the day of death as preferable to the day of birth. Though
Solomon seems in some places to feel strongly ([Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md); [Ecc
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019) ff.md) that natural fear of death
which is, in a great measure, mistrust founded on the ignorance which
Christ dispelled; yet he states the advantage of death over life in
respect of its freedom from toil, oppression, restlessness [Ecc
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md); [Ecc
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md); [Ecc
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005.md), and in respect of its implying an
immediate and a nearer approach to God [Ecc
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md); [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md). While Solomon preferred the day
of death, he might still (with Luther here) have regarded birth as a
good thing, and as having its place in the creation of God.

[Ecclesiastes 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 7:2</span></span>

That - Namely, what is seen in the house of mourning.

Lay it to his heart - Consider it attentively.

[Ecclesiastes 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 7:3</span></span>

Sorrow - Rather, Seriousness.

The heart is made better - i. e., is made bright and joyful (compare
[Co2 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010).md). The mind which bears
itself equally in human concerns, whether they be pleasant or sorrowful,
must always be glad, free, and at peace.

[Ecclesiastes 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 7:4</span></span>

House of mourning ... house of mirth - These phrases acquire a forcible
significance from the Eastern custom of prolonging both festive and
mournful celebrations through several days. See [Gen
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#010.md); [Jdg
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md). This verse indicates that a
life of enjoyment, does not mean the abandonment of ourselves to
pleasures, but the thankful and sober use of the beautiful things which
God gives us.

[Ecclesiastes 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 7:6</span></span>

As the crackling of thorns - Noisy while it lasts, and quickly
extinguished. See [Psa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md) note.

[Ecclesiastes 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 7:7</span></span>

Rather, oppression (or extortions) maketh a wise man foolish; and a
bribe etc. If a wise man, being in a high position, exercises oppression
(see [Psa 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010).md), or practices
extortion, he becomes a fool in so doing. This verse is a warning
against impatience in the exercise of power or the acquisition of
riches.

[Ecclesiastes 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 7:8</span></span>

Better - Inasmuch as something certain is attained, man contemplates the
end throughout an entire course of action, and does not rest upon the
beginning.

Patient ... proud - literally, "Long," long-suffering ..."high," in the
sense of impatient.

[Ecclesiastes 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 7:11</span></span>

And by it there is profit ... - literally, And is profitable to the
living. The same word as in [Ecc 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#011.md),
to the question in which it looks like an answer.

[Ecclesiastes 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 7:12</span></span>

Wisdom is a defense ... - See the margin and [Psa
121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005.md), i. e., He who is defended from
adversity by his wisdom is in as good a position as he who is defended
by his riches.

Excellency - literally, Profit.

Giveth life to - literally, "Causes to live," "makes alive" [Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md); the deeper meaning of which is
elicited by comparing these words with [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md); [Mat
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 7:13</span></span>

The work of God - The scheme of Divine Providence, the course of events
which God orders and controls (compare [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011).md). It comprises both events which
are "straight," i. e., in accordance with our expectation, and events
which are "crooked," i. e., which by their seeming inequality baffle our
comprehension.

[Ecclesiastes 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 7:14</span></span>

Good and prosperous days are in God's design special times of comfort
and rejoicing: the days of affliction and trouble, are in God's design
the proper seasons of recollection and serious consideration. The
Providence of God hath so contrived it, that our good and evil days
should be intermingled each with the other. This mixture of good and
evil days is by the Divine Providence so proportioned, that it
sufficiently justifies the dealings of God toward the sons of men, and
obviates all their discontent and complaints against Him.

Set the one over against the other - Rather, made this as well as that,
i. e., the day of adversity, as well as the day of prosperity. The
seeming imitation of this passage in Ecclesiasticus (Ecclesiasticus
36:13-15) affords a strong presumption that this book was written before
the days of the son of Sirach.

To the end ... - God hath constituted the vicissitude of prosperity and
adversity in such a way that no man can forecast the events that shall
follow when he is removed from his present state. Compare the [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md) note.

[Ecclesiastes 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 7:15</span></span>

The days of my vanity - This does not imply that those days of vanity
were ended (see [Ecc 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012) note.md).

The meaning may be best explained by a paraphrase. Solomon states how
the wise man should regard the "crooked [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013.md) work of God" when it bears upon
him. He says in effect, "Do not think that thou couldest alter the two
instances (described in [Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015).md) of
such crooked work so as to make it straight, that thou art more
righteous or more wise than He is Who ordained these events. To set up
thy judgment in opposition to His would imply an excess of wickedness
and folly, deserving the punishment of premature death. But rather it is
good for thee to grasp these seeming anomalies; if thou ponder them they
will tend to impress on thee that fear of God which is a part of wisdom,
and will guide thee safely through all the perplexities of this life"
(compare [Ecc 8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012).md). The suggestion
that these verses are intended to advocate a middle course between sin
and virtue is at variance with the whole tenor of the book.

[Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md)

Destroy thyself - The Septuagint and Vulgate render it: "be amazed."
Compare "marvel not" [Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 7:20</span></span>

The connection of this verse with [Ecc
7:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018.md) becomes clearer if it is borne
in mind that the fear of God, wisdom, and justice, are merely different
sides of one and the same character, the formation of which is the aim
of all the precepts in this chapter. The words "just" [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015.md), [Ecc
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020.md) and "righteous" [Ecc
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md) are exactly the same in Hebrew.

[Ecclesiastes 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 7:21</span></span>

Curse ... cursed - Rather, speak evil of ... spoken evil of.

[Ecclesiastes 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 7:23</span></span>

I will be - Or, I am. There was a time when Solomon thought himself wise
enough to comprehend the work of God, and therefore needed for himself
the self-humbling conviction declared in this verse.

It - i. e. Wisdom. Compare [Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md).

[Ecclesiastes 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 7:24</span></span>

literally, Far off is that which hath been i. e., events as they have
occurred in the order of Divine Providence), and deep, deep, who can
find it out?

[Ecclesiastes 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 7:25</span></span>

Reason - The same word is translated "account" [Ecc
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027.md), "invention" [Ecc
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md), and "device" [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md) : it is derived from a root
signifying "to count."

[Ecclesiastes 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 7:26</span></span>

Compare the account of Solomon's wives [Kg1
11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md) : see also [Pro
2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016.md); [Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md)...

[Ecclesiastes 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ecc 7:28</span></span>

One man - One whose good qualities quite satisfy our expectation.
Compare the expression "one among a thousand" (marginal reference).

A woman - The number of Solomon's wives and concubines [Kg1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md) was a thousand.

[Ecclesiastes 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ecc 7:29</span></span>

God hath made - Rather, God made. A definite allusion to the original
state of man: in which he was exempt from vanity.
