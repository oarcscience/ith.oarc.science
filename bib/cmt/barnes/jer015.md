*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Jeremiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 15:1</span></span>

Cast them out of my sight - Rather, "send them out of My presence, and
let them go away." The prophet is to dismiss them, because their
mediators, Moses and Samuel, whose intercession had been accepted in old
times (marginal references), would intercede now in vain.

[Jeremiah 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 15:3</span></span>

Kinds - literally, as the margin, i. e., classes of things. The first is
to destroy the living, the other three to mutilate and consume the dead.

To tear - literally, "to drag along the ground." It forcibly expresses
the contumely to which the bodies of the slain will be exposed.

[Jeremiah 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 15:4</span></span>

To be removed - Rather, "to be a terror."

Because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah - The name of the pious father
intensifies the horror at the wickedness of the son.

[Jeremiah 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 15:6</span></span>

This verse gives the reason of the refusal of Yahweh to hear the
prophet's intercession. The punishment due has been delayed unto
wearisomeness, and this seeming failure of justice has made Judah
withdraw further from God.

[Jeremiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 15:7</span></span>

I will fan them ... - Or, "I have winnowed them with a winnowing
shovel." The "gates of the land" mean the places by which men enter or
leave it. As God winnows them they are driven out of the land through
all its outlets in every direction.

I will bereave - Rather, "I have bereaved, I have destroyed my people."
Omit "of children."

Since they return not ... - Rather, "from their ways they have not
returned."

[Jeremiah 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 15:8</span></span>

Translate, "I have brought upon them, even upon the mother of the young
man, a spoiler etc." The word rendered "young man" means a picked
warrior. The mother has borne a valiant champion; but neither his
prowess nor the numerous offspring of the other can avail to save those
who gave them birth; war bereaves both alike.

At noonday - i. e., unexpectedly, as armies used to rest at noon (see
[Jer 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004) note).

I have caused him ... - Rather, "I have brought suddenly upon her," the
mother of the young warrior, "anguish and terrors."

[Jeremiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 15:9</span></span>

She hath been ashamed - Or, "is ashamed." To a Hebrew mother to be
childless was a disgrace. Many consider that [Jer
15:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007) refer to the battle of Megiddo,
and depict the consternation of Jerusalem at that sad event. If so, in
the sun going down while it was day, there will be a reference to the
eclipse on September 30, 610 b.c.

[Jeremiah 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 15:10</span></span>

Jeremiah vents his sorrow at the rejection of his prayer. In reading
these and similar expostulations we feel that we have to do with a man
who was the reluctant minister of a higher power, from where alone he
drew strength to be content to do and suffer.

Strife - More exactly, "lawsuit;" the sense is, "I am as a man who has
to enter into judgment with and reprove the whole earth."

I have neither lent ... - i. e., I have no personal cause of quarrel
with the people, that I should thus be perpetually at strife with them.
The relations between the moneylender and the debtor were a fruitful
source of lawsuits and quarrelling.

[Jeremiah 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 15:11</span></span>

Shall be well with thy remnant - Or, thy loosing shall be for good; in
the sense of being set free, deliverance.

To entreat thee well ... - Rather, "to supplicate thee in the time of
evil etc.;" fulfilled in [Jer 21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001);
[Jer 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003); [Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002).

[Jeremiah 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 15:12</span></span>

The steel - "brass," i. e., bronze. By the "iron" is meant Jeremiah's
intercession; but this cannot alter the divine purpose to send Judah
into exile, which is firm as steel and brass. For "brass" see [Exo
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003) note. The alloy of copper and
zinc now called brass was entirely unknown to the ancients.

[Jeremiah 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 15:13</span></span>

Jeremiah is personally addressed in the verse, because he stood before
God as the intercessor, representing the people.

\(1\) God would give Judah's treasures away for nothing; implying that
He did not value them.

\(2\) the cause of this contempt is Judah's sins.

\(3\) this is justified by Judah having committed them throughout her
whole land.

[Jeremiah 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 15:14</span></span>

Render, "And I will make thee serve thine enemies in a land thou knewest
not."

For a fire ... - See the marginal reference. The added words show that
the punishment then predicted is about to be fulfilled.

[Jeremiah 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 15:15</span></span>

This is the prayer of a man in bitter grief, whose human nature cannot
at present submit to the divine will. God's long-suffering toward the
wicked seemed to the prophet to be the abandonment of himself to death;
justice itself required that one who was suffering contumely for God's
sake should be delivered.

Rebuke - i. e., reproach, contumely.

[Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016)

Thy words were found - Jeremiah's summons to the prophetic office had
not been expected or sought for by him.

I did eat them - i. e., I received them with joy. This eating of the
divine words expresses also the close union between that which came from
God and the prophet's own being.

I am called by thy name - i. e., I am consecrated to Thy service, am
ordained to be Thy prophet.

[Jer 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017)

Rather, "I sat not in the assembly of the laughers, and was merry." From
the time God's words came to Jeremiah he abstained from things innocent,
and a gravity came over him beyond his years.

I sat alone because of thy hand - As a person consecrated to God he
would also be "separated." See [Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005); compare [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).

With indignation - The prophet thus taught of God sees the sins of the
people as offences against God, and as involving the ruin of His Church.

[Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)

Why is my pain perpetual - i. e., Are all my labors to be in vain?

As a liar ... - Really, "as a deceitful brook," a brook which flows only
in the winter, the opposite of the "perennial stream" of [Amo
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024). Jeremiah had expected that there
would be a perpetual interference of Providence in his behalf, instead
whereof things seemed to take only their natural course.

[Jeremiah 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 15:19</span></span>

Jeremiah had questioned God's righteousness (see [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001) note); he is told, "If thou
return," if thou repent thee of thy doubts, and think only of thy duty,
"then will I bring thee again, then will I cause thee again to stand
before Me." To stand before a person means to be his chief officer or
vicegerent. It implies therefore the restoration of Jeremiah to the
prophetic office.

If thou take forth the precious from the vile - i. e., if thou cause the
precious metal to come forth from the dross. Jeremiah was to separate in
himself what was divine and holy from the dross of human passion. Let
him abandon this mistrust, this sensitiveness, this idea that God did
not deal righteously with him, and then "he shall be as God's mouth, i.
e., as the organ by which God speaks.

Let them return ... - Rather, "they shall return unto thee, but thou
shalt not return unto them." A flattering prophet perishes with the
people whom his soft speeches have confirmed in their sin: but the
truthful speaking of God's word saves both.
