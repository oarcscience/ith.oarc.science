### [Ezekiel Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 43:0</span></span>

The consecration of the new temple [Eze
43:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001). The glory of the God of
Israel must take possession of the new sanctuary, as, in time past, of
the tabernacle and of Solomon's Temple. But it is in a different form.
The glory was of old veiled in a cloud resting on the mercy-Seat of the
ark between cherubim of carved wood. Now the glory appears in the form
with which Ezekiel is familiar, in all its symbolic significance (see
[Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001) note). A personal and living
God enters the sanctuary [Eze 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002),
condescending to occupy it, not merely as a fixed dwelling-place, but as
a center from where His Power and mercy radiate freely to the utmost
ends of the earth. Hence, amidst the detailed preparations of the house
no mention is made of the ark or mercy-Seat, so important a part in the
former sanctuary. The living cherubim, the firmament and the rainbow of
mercy, replace the cherubic figures and the golden chest.

The ark, having been in some way destroyed in Nebuchadnezzars siege, was
never replaced. In its stead there was within the veil a flat stone on
which the high priest poured the blood on the Day of Atonement.

[Ezekiel 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 43:1</span></span>

The gate - This was the eastern gate from the precincts to the outer
court.

[Ezekiel 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 43:4</span></span>

By this gate the glory of the Lord had departed. See the marginal
reference.

[Ezekiel 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 43:5</span></span>

The glory of the Lord filled the house - Compare the marginal reference;
[Exo 40:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).

[Ezekiel 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 43:6</span></span>

The man - A "man." Probably an angel different from "the man" who had
hitherto accompanied the seer. That angel guided, measured, and
explained; this is present only to guide.

[Ezekiel 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 43:7</span></span>

He said - i. e., God "said." Both the Septuagint and the Vulgate break
this verse into two, so as to make the first half the solemn words of
dedication. place a full stop after "forever;" the words mark the
distinction between the new and the former sanctuary.

The palace of Solomon abutted upon the southern side of the embankment
of the temple-platform; there was but "a wall between Yahweh and them."
When the kings gave themselves up to idolatry, this vicinity was to the
temple a pollution and defilement. Thus it has been conjectured that
"the garden of Uzza" in which Manasseh and Amon were buried [Kg2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#018), [Kg2
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#026), and on which now stands the
mosque of Omar, was on the temple area itself; if so, this would explain
the mention of "high places" in connection with the defilement by the
"carcases of kings," since the platform of the mosque of Omar at the
time of Ezekiel rose to a considerable height above the temple.

Besides this, idolatrous kings of Judah did actually introduce their
idolatries into the temple courts themselves (compare [Kg2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#011); [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004)).

[Ezekiel 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 43:10</span></span>

Deviation from the exact rules of the Mosaic ordinances was connected
with the transgression of the people. So the restoration, according to
the pattern of the Law, was symbolic of their return to obedience.

[Ezekiel 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 43:12</span></span>

See also [Eze 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012). This is the law
of the ordinance of the new sanctuary. After the consecration, God
pronounces the "law" which is to govern the ordinances of the sanctuary
(compare 1 Kings 8), first briefly repeating the general rule that the
place must be kept holy to the Lord (compare [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)), and then proceeding to
specific ordinances commencing with the altar.

[Ezekiel 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 43:13</span></span>

The altar of sacrifice which stood in the inner court, not the altar of
incense described [Eze 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022). In the
temple of the vision the dimensions differ from those of the tabernacle
[Exo 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001), and of Solomon's Temple
[Ch2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001), with a view to introduce
definite propositions and symbolic numbers. See Plan L.

The bottom - The base (I) of the altar so called, because it forms with
its "border" (K) a kind of socket to receive the "lower settle" (L). It
was to be "a cubit" in depth.

The "breadth" is the breadth of that portion of the base which was not
covered by the "lower settle."

The higher place - the base, literally back; the base is called the back
because the altar rested upon it.

[Ezekiel 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 43:14</span></span>

The bottom - The basement just described is now called "the bottom upon
the ground." The altar (independently of the bottom) was composed of two
stages called "settles," the base of the "upper settle" (M) being less
than that of the "lower" (L).

To the lower settle - That is, to the top of "the lower settle," which
was to be "two cubits high."

From the lesser settle ... to the greater settle - i. e., from the top
of the "lower settle" to the top of the "upper settle," called "lesser"
and "greater," because the height of the lower is less than that of the
"upper; The breadth" here is the part of the lower settle not covered by
the upper settle, projecting one cubit on every side.

[Ezekiel 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 43:15</span></span>

The altar ... the altar - See the margin. The two words may denote, the
first a square block (N) placed upon the upper settle, the second a slab
(O), the thickness of which is not given, from which rose four horns
[Exo 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002); and to which it seems
probable that the victims of sacrifice were at times bound. [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027). Why the names Harel and Ariel
were used must be conjectural. Mount of God may have been a title
naturally given to the place of sacrifice as elsewhere to the place of
worship [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002); Lion of God was a
term used for the Holy City itself [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001).

[Ezekiel 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 43:16</span></span>

altar - Ariel was to be an exact square on all sides. Compare [Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001); [Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016).

[Ezekiel 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 43:17</span></span>

The settle - The "lower settle" (L), projecting beyond the "upper
settle" (M) one cubit on every side.

His stairs - Jewish tradition says that the approach to the altar was by
an inclined plane, because to go up "by steps" was forbidden [Exo
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026).

The number "twelve" was symbolic of the twelve tribes, "four," of the
earth; "sixteen" is the square of "four," and "fourteen" the double of
"seven," the number of the covenant, as being composed of "three," the
number of God, and of "four," the number of the world. Thus we have in
the altar a special instance of Hebrew symbolism.

[Ezekiel 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 43:18</span></span>

The rites here described are not those of the regular service, but those
to be observed on the day of dedication. (Compare [Lev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#010) ff; [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063) ff; [Ch2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#004) ff, In the tabernacle the priest
killed the victims, but Moses sprinkled the blood. In the vision the
seer is addressed as though he were to perform the part of Moses.

[Ezekiel 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 43:19</span></span>

The seed of Zadok - See [Eze 40:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#046)
note.

[Ezekiel 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 43:21</span></span>

In the appointed place of the house - A place within the temple-court,
but "without the sanctuary" properly so called, that is to say, without
the temple and inner court. This was probably the "separate place" (see
[Eze 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012)).

[Ezekiel 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 43:22</span></span>

They shall cleanse - By sprinkling the blood [Eze
43:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#018). Here "they" marks the act as
that of the priests. Moses did his part before the priests were
consecrated, and the seer could act through them.

[Ezekiel 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 43:23</span></span>

There was, on each of the seven days, a burnt-offering of a bullock and
a ram, preceded by a "sin-offereng of a bullock" on the first day, and
of a "kid of the goats" on the other days.

[Eze 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024)

Salt is here added to the "burnt-offering" to express still more the
idea of purification. In the second temple no sacrifice was complete
without the use of salt, and the rabbis assert that there was a great
heap of salt close to the altar, always ready for use, and that the
inclined plane to the altar was kept covered with salt. Compare [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049).

[Eze 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026)

Consecrate themselves - literally, as in the margin. [Lev
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#027). The priests are already
consecrated, but the memory of their consecration was thus kept up at
the dedication of the altar.

[Ezekiel 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 43:27</span></span>

After this inauguration the regular service shall be resumed, and be
acceptable unto God (compare [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)).

The Epistle to the Hebrews Heb. 8-10 helps us to recognize in this
vision the symbol of the purification of the Church of God by the
cleansing blood of Christ, Victim and priest.
