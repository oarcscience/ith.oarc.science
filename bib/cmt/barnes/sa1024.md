### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 24:2</span></span>

The rocks of the wild goats - To signify the craggy precipitous
character of the country.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 24:3</span></span>

Remained in the sides - Rather, "were in the sides of the cave dwelling
or abiding there." Some of these caverns are very deep and spacious. Any
one near the mouth of the cave would be visible, but those in the
recesses would be quite in the dark and invisible, especially if the
incident occurred at night. [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md), according to the title, was
composed on this occasion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 24:4</span></span>

The day of which the Lord said ... - This was the version by David's men
of such divine predictions as [Sa1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028.md); [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md), [Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md). Jonathan's words [Sa1
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#015.md); [Sa1
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017.md) show clearly that these
predictions were known.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 24:5</span></span>

David's heart smote him - He thought the action inconsistent with the
respect which he owed to the king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 24:9</span></span>

David was quite aware that there were flatterers at Saul's court who
were continually inflaming the King's mind by their false accusations
against him. This explains the language of many of the Psalms, e. g. Ps.
10; [Psa 11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md); 35; and many more.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 24:11</span></span>

My father - The respectful address of a junior and an inferior (see [Kg2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013.md), and compare [Sa1
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016.md); [Sa1
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#008).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 24:14</span></span>

After whom ... - i. e., was it consistent with the dignity of the king
of Israel to lead armies in pursuit of a weak and helpless individual
like David?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 24:21</span></span>

Swear now ... - The same request which Jonathan made [Sa1
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#015.md). The deep, genealogical feeling
of the Israelites breaks out here as so often elsewhere.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 24:22</span></span>

Saul does not appear to have invited David to return to Gibeah, or to
have given him any security of doing so with safety. David, with his
intuitive sagacity, perceived that the softening of Saul's feelings was
only momentary, and that the situation remained unchanged.
