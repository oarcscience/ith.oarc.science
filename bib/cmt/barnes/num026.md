### [Numbers Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 26:0</span></span>

The mustering of the tribes described in this chapter was immediately
preparatory to the war against Midian, and to the invasion of Canaan
wbich shortly followed. With a view also to an equitable allotment of
the land to be conquered (compare [Num
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054).md) the numbers of the several
tribes were taken according to their families.

[Numbers 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

After the plague - These words serve to show approximately the date at
which the census was taken, and intimate the reason for the great
decrease in numbers which was found to have taken place in certain
tribes. Compare [Deu 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#003.md) and [Num
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md) note in this chapter.

[Numbers 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 26:5</span></span>

Following The tribes are mentioned in the same order as in the earlier
census Num. 1, except that Manasseh here precedes Ephraim; probably as
being now the larger tribe.

The following table shows the numbers of the tribes at each census; at
Sinai, and in the Plains of Moab:

At Sinai Plains of Moab Reuben 46,500 43,730 Simeon 9,300 22,200 Gad
45,650 40,500 Judah 74,600 76,500 Issachar 54,400 64,300 Zebulun 57,400
60,500 Ephraim 40,500 32,500 Manasseh 32,200 52,700 Benjamin 35,400
45,600 Dan 62,700 64,400 Asher 41,500 53,400 Naphtali 53,400 45,400
Totals 603, 550 601, 730

Seven of the tribes, of which three are tribes belonging to the camp of
Judah, show an increase of numbers; and five, among whom are the three
belonging to the camp of Reuben, show a decrease. The greatest increase
of any one tribe is in Manasseh. The most remarkable decrease is in
Simeon, which now shows less than half its former strength. To this
tribe Zimri, the chief offender in the recent transgression, belonged
[Num 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#014.md). Probably his tribesmen
generally had followed his example, and had accordingly suffered most
severely in the plague. In the parting blessing of Moses, uttered at no
great interval from this date, the tribe of Simeon alone is omitted.

The families of all the tribes, excluding the Levites, number 57. The
ancestral heads after whom these families are named correspond nearly
with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jacob, enumerated in
[Gen 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008.md) ff. Both lists consist
mainly of grandchildren of Jacob, both contain also the same two
grandchildren of Judah, and the same two grandchildren of Asher. The
document in Genesis should be regarded as a list, not of those who went
down in their own persons with Jacob into Egypt, but of those whose
names were transmitted to their posterity at the date of the Exodus as
the heads of Israelite houses, and wire may thus be reckoned the early
ancestors of the people.

[Numbers 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 26:10</span></span>

Together with Korah - i. e., they were engulfed at the same time that
Korah perished, for Korah himself appears to bare died among the two
hundred and fifty incense offerers at the door of the tabernacle, not
with Dathan and Abiram (compare [Num
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032) note.md).

[Numbers 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 26:11</span></span>

The children of Korah died not - Compare [Num
26:58](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#058.md). Samuel the prophet was of this
family, and Heman, "the king's seer" [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md), [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md); [Ch1
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md). Several of the Psalms appear
from the titles to have been composed for the sons of Korah: compare
titles of [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md); 44; 45, etc.

[Numbers 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">num 26:51</span></span>

This shows a decrease of 1,820 from the number at Sinai; a decrease due
to the recent plague.

[Numbers 26:56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">num 26:56</span></span>

According to the lot ... - This method was adopted not only in order to
preclude jealousies and disputes, but also that the several tribes might
regard the territories as determined for them by God Himself: compare
[Pro 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md).

[Numbers 26:59](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">num 26:59</span></span>

whom her mother bare - literally, "whom she bare;" the subject is
wanting, and the verb is in the feminine gender. The words "her mother"
are merely conjectural. The text is probably imperfect.

[Numbers 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">num 26:62</span></span>

The total number of male Levites, 23,000, shows an increase of 1,000 on
the number at Sinai [Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md). It is
doubtless to be taken as a round number; and, as before, includes the
male children from a month old and upward, as well as the male adults.

[Numbers 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">num 26:64</span></span>

It appears from [Deu 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014.md) that the
generation numbered at the former census had perished before the host
crossed the brook Zered.
