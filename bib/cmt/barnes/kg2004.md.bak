### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 4:1</span></span>

The creditor is come ... - The Law of Moses, like the Athenian and the
Roman law, recognized servitude for debt, and allowed that pledging of
the debtor's person, which, in a rude state of society, is regarded as
the safest and the most natural security (see the marginal reference).
In the present case it would seem that, so long as the debtor lived, the
creditor had not enforced his right over his sons, but now on his death
he claimed their services, to which he was by law entitled.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 4:2</span></span>

A pot of oil - Or, "an anointing of oil" - so much oil, i. e., as would
serve me for one anointing of my person. The word used occurs only in
this passage.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

And it fell on a day - The original of the expression here used, which
occurs three times in the present narrative [Kg2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#011.md), [Kg2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md), is also found in [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md), [Job
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#013.md); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md). The character of the expression
perhaps supports the view that the author of Kings has collected from
various sources his account of the miracles of Elisha, and has kept in
each case the words of the original writer.

A great woman - That is, "a rich woman." Compare [Sa1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002.md); [Sa2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#032.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 4:10</span></span>

A little chamber on the wall - The room probably projected like a
balcony beyond the lower apartments - an arrangement common in the East.

A stool - Rather, "a chair." The "chair" and "table," unusual in the
sleeping-rooms of the East, indicate that the prophet was expected to
use his apartment for study and retirement, not only as a
sleeping-chamber.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 4:13</span></span>

Thou hast been careful for us - For the prophet and his servant, who
must have been lodged as well as his master.

I dwell among mine own people - The woman declines Elisha's offer. She
has no wrong to complain of, no quarrel with any neighbor, in respect of
which she might need the help of one in power. She "dwells among her own
people" - her friends, and dependents, with whom she lives peaceably.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 4:16</span></span>

Do not lie - Compare a similar incredulity in [Gen
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md); [Gen
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md); [Luk
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md). The expression, "do not lie,"
which is harsh to us, accords with the plain, straightforward simplicity
of ancient speech. It would not mean more than "deceive" (compare the
marginal reference).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 4:19</span></span>

The child's malady was a sunstroke. The inhabitants of Palestine
suffered from this ([Psa 121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010); Judith 8:3.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 4:22</span></span>

Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of the asses - All
the "young men" and all the "asses" were in the harvest field, the young
men cutting and binding the sheaves, and placing them upon carts or
wains, the donkeys drawing these vehicles fully laden, to the
threshing-floor. Compare [Amo 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 4:23</span></span>

Her husband did not connect the illness with his wife's demand, but
thought she wished to attend one of the prophet's devotional services.
It is evident that such services were now held with something like
regularity on Carmel for the benefit of the faithfull in those parts.

New moon - By the Law the first day of each month was to be kept holy.
Offerings were appointed for such occasions [Num
28:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md), and they were among the days
on which the silver trumpets were to be blown [Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md); [Psa
81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003.md). Hence, "new moons" are
frequently joined with "sabbaths" (see [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md); [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md); [Hos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md); [Ch1
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031).md).

It shall be well - Rather, as in the margin, "Peace." i. e., "Be quiet -
trouble me not with inquiries - only let me do as I wish."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 4:24</span></span>

Slack not thy riding - Translate, "delay me not in my riding, except I
bid thee." The servant went on foot with the donkey to urge it forward,
as is the ordinary custom in the East.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 4:25</span></span>

The distance was about sixteen or seventeen miles.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 4:27</span></span>

She caught him by the feet - To lay hold of the knees or feet has always
been thought in the East to add force to supplication, and is practiced
even at the present day. Compare [Mat
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#029.md); [Joh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#032.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 4:28</span></span>

Great grief shrinks from putting itself into words. The Shunammite
cannot bring herself to say, "My son is dead;" but by reproaching the
prophet with having "deceived" her, she sufficiently indicates her loss.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 4:29</span></span>

Salute him not - Compare the marginal reference. Salutation is the
forerunner of conversation and one bent on speed would avoid every
temptation to loiter.

Lay my staff upon the face of the child - Perhaps to assuage the grief
of the mother, by letting her feel that something was being done for her
child.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 4:31</span></span>

There was neither voice nor hearing - Compare [Kg1
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#029.md).

The child is not awakened - See [Kg2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#020.md). The euphemism by which death is
spoken of as a sleep was already familiar to the Jews (see [Kg1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 4:33</span></span>

Prayed - Prayer was the only remedy in such a case as this (compare the
marginal reference and [Jam 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).md),
though it did not exclude the use of other means [Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 4:34</span></span>

Be stretched himself - Or, "prostrated himself." The word is a different
one from that used of Elijah, and expresses closer contact with the
body. Warmth may have been actually communicated from the living body to
the dead one; and Elisha's persistence [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md), may have been a condition of
the child's return to life.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 4:36</span></span>

Take up thy son - Compare Elijah's action (marginal reference "t") and
our Blessed Lord's [Luk 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#015.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg2 4:38</span></span>

There was a dearth in the land - Rather, "The famine was in the land."
The seven years' dearth of which Elisha had prophesied (marginal
reference) had begun.

The sons of the prophets - See [Kg1
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#035.md) note. They were sitting before
him as scholars before their master, hearing his instructions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg2 4:39</span></span>

A wild vine - Not a real wild vine, the fruit of which, if not very
palatable, is harmless; but some climbing plant with tendrils. The plant
was probably either the Ecbalium elaterium, or "squirting cucumber," the
fruit of which, egg-shaped, and of a very bitter taste, bursts at the
slightest touch, when it is ripe, and squirts out sap and seed grains;
or the Colocynthis, which belongs to the family of cucumbers, has a
vine-shaped leaf, and bears a fruit as large as an orange, very bitter,
from which is prepared the drug sold as colocynth. This latter plant
grows abundantly in Palestine.

His lap full - literally, "his shawl full." The prophet brought the
fruit home in his "shawl" or "outer garment."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg2 4:41</span></span>

Then bring meal - The natural properties of meal would but slightly
diminish either the bitterness or the unwholesomeness of a drink
containing colocynth. It is evident, therefore, that the conversion of
the food from a pernicious and unsavory mess into palatable and
wholesome nourishment was by miracle.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg2 4:42</span></span>

Baal-shalisha - Fifteen Roman miles north of Lydda, in the Sharon plain
to the west of the highlands of Ephraim. It was, apparently, the chief
city of the "land of Shalisha" (marginal reference).

Bread of the first fruits - It appears by this that the Levitical
priests having withdrawn from the land of Israel (see [Ch2
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013).md), pious Israelites
transferred to the prophets, whom God raised up, the offerings required
by the Law to be given to the priests [Num
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013.md); [Deu
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md).

In the husk thereof - "In his bag." The word does not occur elsewhere in
Scripture.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg2 4:43</span></span>

This miracle was a faint foreshadowing of our Lord's far more marvelous
feeding of thousands with even scantier materials. The resemblance is
not only in the broad fact, but in various minute particulars, such as
the distribution through the hands of others; the material, bread; the
surprised question of the servant; and the evidence of superfluity in
the fragments that were left (see the marginal references). As Elijah
was a type of the Baptist, so Elisha was in many respects a type of our
Blessed Lord. In his peaceful, non-ascetic life, in his mild and gentle
character, in his constant circuits, in his many miracles of mercy, in
the healing virtue which abode in his bodily frame [Kg2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md), he resembled, more than any
other prophet, the Messiah, of whom all prophets were more or less
shadows and figures.
