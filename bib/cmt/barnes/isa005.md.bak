### [Isaiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 5:0</span></span>

This chapter Isa. 5 commences a new subject, and is in itself an entire
prophecy, having no connection with the preceding or the following
chapter. "When" it was delivered is unknown; but from the strong
resemblance between the circumstances referred to here, and those
referred to in Isa. 2, it is probable it was at about the same period.
The fact, also, that it is closely connected with that in the place
which has been assigned it in the collection of the prophecies of
Isaiah, is a circumstance which strongly corroborates that view. The
general design of the chapter is to denounce the prevalent vices of the
nation, and to proclaim that they will be followed with heavy judgments.
The chapter may be conveniently regarded as divided into three parts.

I. A beautiful parable illustrative of the care which God had shown for
his people, [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). He states what
he had done for them; calls on them to judge themselves whether he had
not done for them all that he could have done; and, since his vineyard
had brought forth no good fruit, he threatens to break down its hedges,
and to destroy it.

II\. The various vices and crimes which prevailed in the nation are
denounced, and punishment threatened, Isa. 5:8-23.

1\. The sin of covetousness, [Isa
5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md).

2\. The sins of intemperance, revelry, and dissipation, [Isa
5:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md).

3\. The sin of despising and contemning God, and of practicing iniquity
as if he did not see it, or could not punish it, [Isa
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md).

4\. The sin of those who pervert things, and call evil good and good
evil, [Isa 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md).

5\. The sin of vain self-confidence, pride, and inordinate self-esteem,
[Isa 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md).

6\. The sin of intemperance is again reproved, and the sin of receiving
bribes; probably because these were in fact connected, [Isa
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md).

III\. Punishment is denounced on the nation for indulgence in these
sins, [Isa 5:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md). The punishment
would be, that he would, call distant nations to invade their land, and
it should be laid waste.

"The subject of this prophecy," says Lowth, "does not differ materially
from Isa. i., but it is greatly superior to it in force, in severity, in
variety, in elegance."

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

Now will I sing - This is an indication that what follows is poetic, or
is adapted to be sung or chanted.

To my well-beloved - The word used here - ידיד yedı̂yd - is a term of
endearment. It properly denotes a friend; a favorite; one greatly
beloved. It is applied to saints as being the beloved, or the favorites
of God, in [Psa 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md); [Deu
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md). In this place, it is evidently
applied to Yahweh, the God of the Jewish people. As there is some reason
to believe that the God of the Jews - the manifested Deity who undertook
their deliverance from Egypt, and who was revealed as "their" God under
the name of 'the Angel of the covenant' - was the Messiah, so it may be
that the prophet here meant to refer to him. It is not, however, to the
Messiah "to come." It does not refer to the God incarnate - to Jesus of
Nazareth; but to the God of the Jews, in his capacity as their lawgiver
and protector in the time of Isaiah; not to him in the capacity of an
incarnate Saviour.

A Song of my beloved - Lowth, 'A song of loves,' by a slight change in
the Hebrew. The word דוד dôd usually denotes 'an uncle,' a father's
brother. But it also means one beloved, a friend, a lover; [Sol
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md), [Sol
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016.md); [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md), [Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md), [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md); [Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md). Here it refers to Jehovah, and
expresses the tender and affectionate attachment which the prophet had
for his character and laws.

Touching his vineyard - The Jewish people are often represented under
the image of a vineyard, planted and cultivated by God; see Ps. 80; [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md); [Jer
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md). Our Saviour also used this
beautiful figure to denote the care and attention which God had bestowed
on his people; [Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md) ff; [Mar
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md), following.

My beloved - God.

Hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill - Hebrew 'On a horn of the son
of oil.' The word "horn" used here in the Hebrew, denotes the "brow,
apex," or sharp point of a hill. The word is thus used in other
languages to denote a hill, as in the Swiss words "shreckhorn, buchorn."
Thus "Cornwall," in England, is called in the old British tongue
"Kernaw," as lessening by degrees, like a horn, running out into
promontories, like so many horns; for the Britons called a horn "corn,"
and in the plural "kern." The term 'horn' is not unfrequently applied to
hills. Thus, Pococke tells us (vol. ii. p. 67), that there is a low
mountain in Galilee which has both its ends raised in such a manner as
to look like two mounts, which are called the 'Horns of Hutin.' Harmer,
however, supposes that the term is used here to denote the land of
Syria, from its resemblance to the shape ofa horn; Obs. iii. 242. But
the idea is, evidently, that the land on which God respresents himself
as having planted his vineyard, was like an elevated hill that was
adapted eminently to such a culture. It may mean either the "top" of a
mountain, or a little mountain, or a "peak" divided from others. The
most favorable places for vineyards were on the sides of hills, where
they would be exposed to the sun. - Shaw's "Travels," p. 338. Thus
Virgil says:

\- denique apertos

Bacchus amat colles.

'Bacchus loves open hills;' "Georg." ii. 113. The phrase, "son of oil,"
is used in accordance with the Jewish custom, where "son" means
descendant, relative, etc.; see the note at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). Here it means that it was so
fertile that it might be called the very "son of oil," or fatness, that
is, fertility. The image is poetic, and very beautiful; denoting that
God had planted his people in circumstances where he had a right to
expect great growth in attachment to him. It was not owing to any want
of care on his part, that they were not distinguished for piety. The
Chaldee renders this verse, 'The prophet said, I will sing now to
Israel, who is compared to a vineyard, the seed of Abraham my beloved: a
song of my beloved to his vineyard.'

[Isaiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 5:2</span></span>

And he fenced it - Margin, 'Made a wall about it.' The word used here is
supposed rather to mean "to dig about, to grub," as with a pick-axe or
spade. - "Gesenius." It has this signification in Arabic, and in one
place in the Jewish Talmud. - "Kimchi." The Vulgate and the Septuagint
understands it of making a hedge or fence, probably the first work in
preparing a vineyard. And as 'a hedge' is expressly mentioned in [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md), it seems most probable that that
is its meaning here.

And gathered out the stones ... - That it might be easily cultivated.
This was, of course, a necessary and proper work.

And planted it with the choicest vine - Hebrew, 'With the sorek.' This
was a choice species of vine, the grapes of which, the Jewish
commentators say, had very small and scarcely perceptible stones, and
which, at this day, is called "serki" in Morocco; in Persia, "kishmis."
- "Gesenius."

And built a tower - For the sake of watching and defending it. These
towers were probably placed so as to overlook the whole vineyard, and
were thus posts of observation; compare the note at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md); see also the note at [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).

And also made a wine-press - A place in which to put the grapes for the
purpose of expressing the juice; see the note at [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).

And he looked - He waited in expectation; as a farmer waits patiently
for the vines to grow, and to bear grapes.

Wild grapes - The word used here is derived from the verb באשׁ bâ'ash,
"to be offensive, to corrupt, to putrify;" and is supposed by Gesenius
to mean "monk's-hood," a poisonous herb, offensive in smell, which
produces berries like grapes. Such a meaning suits the connection better
than the supposition of grapes that were wild or uncultivated. The
Vulgate understands it of the weed called "wild vine - labruscas." The
Septuagint translates it by "thorns," ἄκανθας akanthas. That there were
vines in Judea which produced such poisonous berries, though resembling
grapes, is evident; see [Kg2 4:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md) :
'And one went out into the fields to gather pot herbs, and he found a
field vine, and he gathered from it wild fruit.' Moses also refers to a
similar vine; [Deu 32:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md) : 'For
their vine is as the vine of Sodom; their grapes are grapes of gall;
their clusters are bitter.' Hasselquist thinks that the prophet here
means the "nightshade." The Arabs, says he, call it "wolf-grapes." It
grows much in vineyards, and is very pernicious to them. Some poisonous,
offensive berries, growing on wild vines, are doubtless intended here.

The general meaning of this parable it is not difficult to understand;
compare the notes at [Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).
Jerome has attempted to follow out the allegory, and explain the
particular parts. He says, 'By the metaphor of the vineyard is to be
understood the people of the Jews, which he surrounded or enclosed by
angels; by gathering out the stones, the removal of idols; by the tower,
the temple erected in the midst of Judea; by the wine-press, the altar.'
There is no propriety, however, in attempting thus minutely to explain
the particular parts of the figure. The general meaning is, that God had
chosen the Jewish people; had bestowed great care on them in giving them
his law, in defending them, and in providing for them; that he had
omitted nothing that was adapted to produce piety, obedience, and
happiness, and that they had abused it all, and instead of being
obedient, had become exceedingly corrupt.

[Isaiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 5:3</span></span>

And now ... - This is an appeal which God makes to the Jews themselves,
in regard to the justice and propriety of what he was about to do. A
similar appeal he makes in [Mic 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md) :
'O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied
thee? Testify against me.' He intended to "punish" them [Isa
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md), and he appeals to them for the
justice of it. He would do to them as they would do to a vineyard that
had been carefully prepared and guarded, and which yet was valueless. A
similar appeal he makes in [Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md);
and our Saviour made an application remarkably similar in his parable of
the vineyard, [Mat 21:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md). It is not
improbable that he had his eye on this very place in Isaiah; and it is,
therefore, the more remarkable that the Jews did not understand the
bearing of his discourse.

[Isaiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 5:4</span></span>

What could I... - As a man who had done what is described in [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), would have done all that "could"
be done for a vineyard, so God says that he has done all that he could,
in the circumstances of the Jews, to make them holy and happy. He had
chosen them; had given them his law; had sent them prophets and
teachers; had defended them; had come forth in judgment and mercy, and
he now appeals "to them" to say what "could" have been done more. This
important verse implies that God had done all that he could have done;
that is, all that he could consistently do, or all that justice and
goodness required him to do, to secure the welfare of his people. It
cannot, of course, be meant that he had no physical ability to do
anything else, but the expression must be interpreted by a reference to
the point in hand; and that is, an appeal to others to determine that he
had done all that could be done in the circumstances of the case. In
this respect, we may, without impropriety, say, that there is a limit to
the power of God. It is impossible to conceive that he "could" have
given a law more holy; or that he could append to it more solemn
sanctions than the threatening of eternal death; or that he could have
offered higher hopes than the prospect of eternal life; or that he could
have given a more exalted Redeemer. It has been maintained (see the
"Princeton Bib. Repert.," April 1841) that the reference here is to the
future, and that the question means, 'what remains now to be done to my
vineyard as an expression of displeasure?' or that it is asked with a
view to introduce the expression of his purpose to punish his people,
stated in [Isa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md). But that the above
is the meaning or the passage, or that it refers to what God had
actually done, is evident from the following considerations:

\(1\) He had specified at length [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md) what he had done. He had performed
"all" that was usually done to a vineyard; in fencing it, and clearing
it of stones, and planting in it the choicest vines, and building a
wine-press in it. Without impropriety, it might be said of a man that,
whatever wealth he had, or whatever power he had to do "other" things,
he "could do nothing more to perfect a vineyard."

\(2\) It is the meaning which is most naturally suggested by the
original. Literally, the Hebrew is, 'What to do more?' עוד מה־לעשׂות
mah-la‛ăs'ôth ‛ôd. Coverdale renders this, as it is in our translation,
'What more could have been done for it?' Luther, 'What should one do
more to my vineyard, that I have not done for it?' Was sollte man doth
mehr thun an meinem Weinberge, das ich nicht gethun babe an illin?
Vulgate, Quid est quod debui ultra facere. 'What is there which I ought
to do more?' Septuagint, Τί ποιήσω ἔτι Ti poiēsō eti, 'What shall I do
yet?' implying that he had done all that he could for it. The Chaldee
renders it, 'What good thing - טבא מה mah ṭâbâ' - shall I say that I
will do to my people that I have not done for them?' implying that he
had done for them all the good which could be spoken of. The Syriac,
'What remains to be done to my vineyard, and I have not done it?' In all
these versions, the sense given is substantially the same - that God had
done all that could be done to make the expectation that his vineyard
would produce fruit, proper. There is no reference in one of these
versions to what he "would" do afterward, but the uniform reference is
to what he "had" done to make the expectation "reasonable," that his
vineyard would produce fruit.

\(3\) That this is the fair interpretation is apparent further, because,
when, in [Isa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md), he says what he
"would do," it is entirely different from what he said he "had done." He
"had" done all that could be done to make it proper to expect fruit; he
now "would" do what would be a proper expression of his displeasure that
no fruit had been produced. He would take away its hedge; break down its
walls, and lay it waste. But in the interpretation of the passage
proposed by the "Princeton Repert.," there is an entire omission of this
part of the verse - 'that I have not done in it.' It is not improper,
therefore, to use this passage to show that God had done all that could
be consistently done for the salvation of man, and the same appeal may
now be made to sinners everywhere; and it may be asked, what God "could"
have done for their salvation more than has been done? "Could" he have
given them a purer law? "Could" he present higher considerations than
have been drawn from the hope of an "eternal" heaven, and the fear of an
"eternal" hell? Could he have furnished a more full atonement than has
been made by the blood of his own Son? The conclusion to which we should
come would be in accordance with what is said in the prophet, that God
has done "all" for the salvation of sinners that in the circumstances of
the case could be done, and that if they are lost, they only will bear
the blame.

[Isaiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 5:5</span></span>

Go to - The Hebrew word here is one that is commonly rendered, 'I pray
you,' and is used "to call the attention to" what is said. It is the
word from which we have derived the adverb "now," נא nā'.

I will take away the hedge - A "hedge" is a fence of thorns, made by
suffering thorn-bushes to grow so thick that nothing can pass through
them. Here it means that God would withdraw his protection from the
Jews, and leave them exposed to be overrun and trodden down by their
enemies, as a vineyard would be by wild beasts if it were not protected.

The wall ... - Vineyards, it seems, had a "double" enclosure. -
"Gesenius." Such a double protection might be necessary, as some animals
might scale a wall that would yet find it impossible to pass through a
thorn-hedge. The sense here is, that though the Jews had been protected
in every way possible, yet that protection would be withdrawn, and they
would be left defenseless.

[Isaiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 5:6</span></span>

I will lay it waste ... - The description here is continued from [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md). The image is carried out, and
means that the Jews should be left utterly without protection.

I will also command the clouds ... - It is evident here, that the
parable or figure is partially dropped. A farmer could not command the
clouds. It is God alone who could do that; and the figure of the
vineyard is dropped, and God is introduced speaking as a sovereign. The
meaning is, that he would withhold his divine influences, and would
abandon them to desolation. The sense of the whole verse is plain. God
would leave the Jews without protection; he would remove the guards, the
helps, the influences, with which he had favored them, and leave them to
their own course, as a vineyard that was unpruned, uncultivated,
unwatered. The Chaldee has well expressed the sense of the passage: 'I
will take away the house of my sanctuary (the temple), and they shall be
trodden down. I will regard them as guilty, and there shall be no
support or defense for them; they shall be abandoned, and shall become
wanderers. I will command the prophets, that they shall not prophesy
over them.' The lesson taught here is, that when a people become
ungrateful, and rebellious, God will withdraw from them, and leave them
to desolation; compare [Rev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#003.md).

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

For the vineyard ... - This is the application of the parable. God had
treated the Jews as a farmer does a vineyard. This was "his" vineyard -
the object of his faithful, unceasing care. This was his "only"
vineyard; on this people alone, of all the nations of the earth, had he
bestowed his special attention.

His pleasant plant - The plant in which he delighted. As the farmer had
been at the pains to plant the "sorek" [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), so had God selected the ancient
stock of the Jews as his own, and made the race the object of his chief
attention.

And he looked for judgment - For justice, or righteousness.

But behold oppression - The word rendered "oppression" means properly
"shedding of blood." In the original here, there is a remarkable
"paranomasia," or play upon words, which is not uncommon in the Hebrew
Scriptures, and which was deemed a great beauty in composition:

He looked for "judgment," משׁפט mishpâṭ, And lo! "shedding of blood,"
משׂפח mis'pâch; For "rightousness," צדקה tsedâqâh, But lo! "a clamor,"
צעקה tse‛âqâh.

It is impossible, of course, to retain this in a translation.

A cry. A clamor - tumult, disorder; the clamor which attends anarchy,
and covetousness, and dissipation [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md), [Isa
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md), rather than the soberness and
steadiness of justice.

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

Wo unto them ... - The prophet now proceeds to "specify" some of the
crimes to which he had referred in the parable of the vineyard, of which
the Jews had been guilty. The first is "avarice."

That join house to house - That seek to possess many houses; or perhaps
that seek to live in large and magnificent palaces. A similar
denunciation of this sin is recorded in [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002.md); [Neh
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001.md). This, together with what
follows, was contrary to the law of Moses. He provided that when the
children of Israel should enter the land of Canaan, the land should be
equitably divided; and in order to prevent avarice, he ordained the
"jubilee," occurring once in fifty years, by which every man and every
family should be restored to their former possession; Lev. 25. Perhaps
there could have been no law so well framed to prevent the existence,
and avoid the evils of covetousness. Yet, in defiance of the obvious
requirements and spirit of that law, the people in the time of Isaiah
had beome generally covetous.

That lay field to field - That purchase one farm after another. The
words 'that lay,' mean "to cause to approach;" that is, they "join" on
one farm after another.

Till there be no place - Until they reach the "outer limit" of the land;
until they possess all.

That they may be placed alone - That they may displace all others; that
they may drive off from their lands all others, and take possession of
them themselves.

In the midst of the earth - Or rather, in the midst of the "land." They
seek to obtain the whole of it, and to expel all the present owners.
Never was there a more correct description of avarice. It is satisfied
with no present possessions, and would be satisfied only if all the
earth were in its possession. Nor would the covetous man be satisfied
then. He would sit down and weep that there was nothing more which he
could desire. How different this from that "contentment" which is
produced by religion, and the love of the happiness of others!

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

In mine ears - This probably refers to the prophet. As if he had said,
'God has revealed it to me,' or 'God has said in my ears,' i. e, to me.
The Septuagint reads it, 'These things are heard in the ears of the Lord
of hosts,' that is, the wishes" of the man of avarice. The Chaldee, 'The
prophet said, In my ears I have heard; a decree has gone from the Lord
of hosts,' etc.

Many houses shall be desolate - Referring to the calamities that should
come upon the nation for its crimes.

[Isaiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 5:10</span></span>

Yea, ten acres - In this verse a reason is rendered why the houses
mentioned in the previous verse should become desolate. The reason is,
that the land would become sterile and barren, as a divine judgment for
their oppression. To what particular time the prophet refers, here, is
not apparent. It is certain, however, that the land of Canaan was
frequently given up to sterility. The withholding of the early and
latter rains, or the neglect of cultivation from any cause, would
produce this. At present, this formerly fertile country is among the
most unproductive on the face of the earth.

Ten acres - An "acre," among the Hebrews, was what could be plowed by
one yoke of oxen in a day. It did not differ materially from our acre.

Shall yield one bath - One bath of wine. The "bath" was a Jewish measure
for liquids, containing about seven gallons and a half. To say that "ten
acres" should produce no more wine than this; was the same as to say
that it would produce almost nothing.

And the seed of an homer - An "homer" was a Hebrew measure for grain,
containing about eight bushels.

An ephah - The "ephah" contained about three pecks. Of course, to say
that an homer of seed should produce about three pecks, would be the
same as saying that it would produce almost nothing.

[Isaiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 5:11</span></span>

Wo unto them - The prophet, having denounced "avarice," proceeds now to
another vice - that of "intemperance, or dissipation."

That rise up early ... - That rise "for this purpose," when nothing else
would rouse them. It may illustrate this somewhat, to remark, that it
was not common among the ancients to become intoxicated at an early hour
of the day; see the note at [Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md);
compare [Th1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007.md). It indicated then,
as it does now, a confirmed and habitual state of intemperance when a
man would do this early in the morning. 'The Persians, when they commit
a debauch, arise betimes, and esteem the morning as the best time for
beginning to drink wine, by which means they carry on their excess until
night.' - "Morier."

That they may follow strong drink - - שׁכר shêkār, or sichar. This word
is derived from a verb signifying to drink, to become intoxicated. All
nations have found out some intoxicating drink. That which was used by
the Hebrews was made from grain, fruit, honey, dates, etc., prepared by
fermentation. The word sometimes means the same as wine [Num
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007.md), but more commonly it refers to a
stronger drink, and is distinguished from it, as in the common phrase,
'wine and strong drink;' [Lev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md);
[Num 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md); [Jdg
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004.md), [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007.md). Sometimes it may be used for
"spiced wine" - a mixture of wine with spices, that would also speedily
produce intoxication. The Chaldee renders the words עתיק חמר chămar
‛atı̂yq, 'old fermented liquor;' denoting the "mode" in which strong
drink was usually prepared. It may be remarked here, that whatever may
be the "form" in which intoxicating drink is prepared, it is
substantially the same in all nations. Intoxication is caused by
"alcohol," and that is produced by fermentation. It is never created or
increased by distillation. The only effect of distillation is, to
collect and preserve the alcohol which existed in the beer, the wine, or
the cider. Consequently, the same substance produces intoxication when
wine is drank, which does when brandy is drank; the same in cider or
other fermented liquor, as in ardent spirits.

That continue until night - That drink all day. This shows that the
"strong drink" intended here, did not produce "sudden," intoxication.
This is an exact description of what occurs constantly in oriental
nations. The custom of sitting long at the wine, when they have the
means of indulgence, prevails everywhere. D'Ar-vieux says, that while he
was staying among the Arabs on mount Carmel, a wreck took place on the
coast, from which one of the emirs obtained two large casks of wine. He
immediately sent to the neighboring emirs, inviting them to come and
drink it. They gladly came, and continued drinking for two days and two
nights, until not a drop of the wine was left. In like manner, Tavernier
relates that the king of Persia sent for him early one morning to the
palace, when, with other persons, he was obliged to sit all the day, and
late at night, drinking wine with the shah; but at last, 'the king
growing sleepy, gave us leave to depart, which we did very willingly,
having had hard labor for seventeen hours together.'

Inflame them - Excite them; or stimulate them. We have the same phrase -
denoting the "burning" tendency of strong drink. The American Indians
appropriately call "fire-water."

[Isaiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 5:12</span></span>

The prophet proceeds to state still further the extent of their crimes.
This verse contains an account of their dissipated habits, and their
consequent forgetfulness of God. That they commonly had musical
instruments in their feasts, is evident from many passages of the Old
Testament; see [Amo 6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005.md). Their
feasts, also, were attended with songs; [Isa
24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md).

The harp - - כנור kinnôr. This is a well-known stringed instrument,
employed commonly in sacred music. It is often mentioned as having been
used to express the pious feelings of David; [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md); [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md); [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md). It is early mentioned as having
been invented by Jubal; [Gen 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#021.md). It
is supposed usually to have had ten strings (Josephus, "Ant." B. x. ch.
xii. Section 3). It was played by the hand; [Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md); [Sa1
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#009.md). The "root" of the word כנור
kinnôr, is unknown. The word "kinnor" is used in all the languages
cognate to the Hebrew, and is recognized even in the Persian. It is
probable that the instrument here referred to was common in all the
oriental nations, as it seems to have been known before the Flood, and
of course the knowledge of it would be extended far. It is an oriental
name and instrument, and from this word the Greeks derived their word
κινύρα kinura. The Septuagint renders it κιθάρα kithara and κινύρα
kinura.

Once they substitute for it ὄργανον organon, [Psa
136:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#002.md); and five times ψαλτήριον
psaltērion, [Gen 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#020.md); [Psa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md); [Psa
80:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#002.md); [Psa
149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md); [Eze
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013.md). The harp - כנור kinnôr - is not
only mentioned as having been invented by Jubal, but it is also
mentioned by Laban in the description which be gives of various
solemnities, in regard to which he assures the fleeing Jacob that it had
been his wish to accompany him with all the testimonials of joy - 'with
music - תף tôph and כנור kinnôr;' [Gen
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md). In the first age it was
consecrated to joy and exultation. Hence, it is referred to as the
instrument employed by David to drive away the melancholy of Saul [Sa1
16:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016.md), and is the instrument
usually employed to celebrate the praises of God; [Psa
33:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md); [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md); [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md); [Psa
71:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022.md). But the harp was not only
used on sacred occasions. Isaiah also mentions it as carried about by
courtezans [Isa 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md), and also refers
to it as used on occasions of gathering in the vintage, and of
increasing the joy of the festival occasion.

So also it was used in military triumphs. Under the reign of
Jehoshaphat, after a victory which had been gained over the Moabites,
they returned in triumph to Jerusalem, accompanied with playing on the
כנור kinnôr;" [Ch2 20:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027.md). The harp
was generally used on occasions of joy. Only in one place, in Isaiah
[Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md), is it referred to as
having been employed in times of mourning. There is no ancient figure of
the כנור kinnôr that can be relied on as genuine. We can only say that
it was an instrument made of sounding wood, and furnished with strings.
Josephus says that it was furnished with ten strings, and was played
with the plectrum ("Ant." B. viii. ch. x.) Suidas, in his explanation of
it, makes express mention of strings or sinews (p. 318); and Pollux
speaks of goats' claws as being used for the plectrum. David made it out
of the ברושׁ berôsh, or fir, and Solomon out of the almug. Pfeiffer
supposes, that the strings were drawn over the belly of a hollow piece
of wood, and that it had some resemblance to our violin. But it is more
probable that the common representation of the harp as nearly in the
form of a triangle, with one side or the front part missing, is the
correct one. For a full discussion of the subject, see Pfeiffer on the
Music of the ancient Hebrews, "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 366-373.
Montfaucon has furnished a drawing of what was supposed to be the
ancient כנור kinnôr, which is represented in the book. But, after all,
the usual form is not quite certain.

Bruce found a sculpture of a harp resembling that usually put into the
hands of David, or nearly in the form of a triangle, and under
circumstances which led him to suppose that it was as old as the times
of Sesostris.

And the viol - נבל nebel. From this word is derived the Greek word νάβλα
nabla, and the Latin nablium and nabla. But it is not very easy to form
a correct idea of this instrument. The derivation would lead us to
suppose that it was something in the shape of a "bottle," and it is
probable that it had a form in the shape of a leather bottle, such as is
used in the East, or at least a vessel in which wine was preserved; [Sa1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#003.md); [Sa1
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018.md); [Sa2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md). It was at first made of the
ברושׁ berôsh or fir; afterward it was made of the almug tree, and
occasionally it seems to have been made of metal; [Sa2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md); [Ch1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008.md). The external parts of the
instrument were of wood, over which strings were drawn in various ways.
Josephus says it had twelve strings ("Ant." B. viii. ch. x.) He says
also that it was played with the fingers. - "Ibid." Hesychius and Pollux
reckon it among stringed instruments. The resonance had its origin in
the vessel or the bottom part of the instrument, upon which the strings
were drawn. According to Ovid, this instrument was played on with both
hands:

Quaravis mutus erat, voci favisse putatur

Piscis, Aroniae fabula nora lyrae.

Disce etiam duplice genialia palma

Verrere.

De Arte Amandi, lib. iii. 327.

According to Jerome, Isodorus, and Cassiodorus, it had the form of an
inverted Greek Delta δ d. Pfeiffer supposes that this instrument was
probably the same as is found represented on ancient monument. The belly
of the instrument is a wooden bowl, having a small hole in the under
part, and is covered over with a stretched skin, which is higher in the
middle than at the sides. Two posts, which are fastened together at the
top by a cross piece, pass obliquely through this skin. Five strings
pass over this skin, having a bridge for their support on the cross
piece. The instrument has no pins or screws, but every string is
fastened by means of some linen wound with it around this cross piece.
The description of this instrument is furnished by Niebuhr ("Thess." i.
p. 179). It is played on in two ways, either by being struck with the
finger, or by a piece of leather, or perhaps a quill hung at its side
and drawn across the strings. It cannot with certainty be determined
when this instrument was invented, or when it came into use among the
Hebrews. It is first mentioned in the time of Saul [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md), and from this time onward it is
frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. It was used particularly in
the public worship of God; [Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md);
[Kg1 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012.md); [Ch2
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028.md); [Ch2
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#025.md); [Ch1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md); [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005.md). It was usually accompanied with
other instruments, and was also used in festivals and entertainments;
see "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 357-365. The usual form of representing
it is shown in the preceding cut, and is the form in which the lyre
appears on ancient monuments, in connection with the statues of Apollo.

The drawing in the book is a representation of a lyre from a Jewish
shekel of the time of Simon Maccabeus, and may have been, not
improbably, a form in frequent use among the Jews.

Niebuhr has furnished us with an instrument from the East, which is
supposed to bare a very near resemblance to that which is referred to by
Isaiah. This instrument is represented by the picture in the book.

The tabret - תף tôph. This was one of the instruments which were struck
with the hands. It was the kettle-drum of the ancients, and it is more
easy to determine its form and use than it is of most of the instruments
used by the Hebrews. The Septuagint and other Greek translators render
it by τύμπανον tumpanon. This word, as well as the Latin tympanum, is
manifestly derived from the Hebrew. The Arabic word "duf" applied to the
same instrument is also derived from the same Hebrew word. It was an
instrument of wood, hollowed out, and covered over with leather and
struck with the hands - a species of drum, This form of the drum is used
by the Spaniards, and they have preserved it ever since the time of the
Moors. It was early used. Laban wished to accompany Jacob with its
sound; [Gen 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#027.md). Miriam, the sister
of Moses, and the females with her, accompanied the song of victory with
this instrument; [Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md).

Job was acquainted with it [Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006.md);
[Job 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012.md), and David employed it in
the festivities of religion; [Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md).
The occasions on which it is mentioned as being used are joyful
occasions, and for the most part those who play on it are females, and
on this account they are called 'drum-beating women' [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md) - in our translation, 'damsels
playing with timbrels,' In our translation it is rendered "tabret," [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md); [Gen
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#026.md); [Isa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md); [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md); [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md); [Eze
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013.md); [Jer
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004.md); [Job
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006.md); "tabering," [Nah
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007.md); and "timbrel," [Psa
81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md); [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Job
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012.md); [Psa
149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003.md); [Psa
150:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#004.md); [Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md); [Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025.md). It is no where mentioned as
employed in war or warlike transactions. It was sometimes made by merely
stretching leather over a wooden hoop, and thus answered to the
instrument known among us as the tambourine. It was in the form of a
sieve, and is often found on ancient monuments, and particularly in the
hands of Cybele. In the East, there is now no instrument more common
than this.

Niebuhr (Thes i. p. 181) has given the following description of it: 'It
is a broad hoop covered on one side with a stretched skin. In the rim
there are usually thin round pullies or wheels of metal which make some
noise, when this drum, held on high with one hand, is struck with the
fingers of the other hand. No musical instrument perhaps is so much
employed in Turkey as this. When the females in their harems dance or
sing, the time is always beat on this instrument. It is called doff.'
See "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 398-402. it is commonly supposed that
from the word "toph, Tophet" is derived - a name given to the valley of
Jehoshaphat near Jerusalem, because this instrument was used there to
drown the cries of children when sacrificed to Moloch.

And pipe. - חליל châlı̂yl. This word is derived either from חלל châlal,
"to bore through," and thence conveys the idea of a flute bored through,
and furnished with holes ("Gesenius"); or from חלל châlal, "to leap" or
"to dance;" and thence it conveys the idea of an instrument that was
played on at the dance. - "Pfeiffer."

The Greek translators have always rendered it by αὐλός aulos. There are,
in all, but four places where it occurs in the Old Testament; [Kg1
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040.md); [Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md); [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md); and it is uniformly rendered
"pipe or pipes," by our translators. The origin of the pipe is unknown.
It was possessed by most ancient nations, though it differed much in
form. It was made sometimes of wood, at others of reed, at others of the
bones of animals, horns, etc. The "box-wood" has been the common
material out of which it was made. It was sometimes used for plaintive
music (compare [Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023).md); but it was
also employed in connection with other instruments, while journeying up
to Jerusalem to attend the great feasts there; see the note at [Isa
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md). Though employed on plaintive
occasions, yet it was also employed in times of joy and pleasure. Hence,
in the times of Judas Maccabeus, the Jews complained 'that all joy had
vanished from Jacob, and, that the flute and cithera were silent;' 1
Macc. 3:45; see "Bib. Repos." vol. vi. pp. 387-392. The graceful figures
(shown in the book) will show the manner of playing the flute or pipe
among the Greeks. It was also a common art to play the double flute or
pipe, in the East, in the manner represented in the book. In the use of
these instruments, in itself there could be no impropriety. That which
the prophet rebuked was, that they employed them not for praise, or even
for innocent amusement, but that they introduced them to their feasts of
revelry, and thus made them the occasion of forgetting God.
Forgetfulness of God, in connection with music and dancing, is
beautifully described by Job:

They send forth their little ones like a flock,

And their children dance;

They take the timbrel and harp,

And rejoice at the sound of the organ;

They spend their days in mirth,

And in a moment go down to the grave.

And they say unto God -

'Depart from us;

For we know not the knowledge of thy ways.

What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?

And what profit should we have if we pray unto him?'

[Job 21:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011.md).

In their feasts - 'The Nabathaeans of Arabia Petrea always introduced
music at their entertainments (Strabo, xvi.), and the custom seems to
have been very general among the ancients. They are mentioned as having
been essential among the Greeks, from the earliest times; and are
pronounced by Homer to be requisite at a feast:

Μολπή τ ̓ ὀρχηστύ; τε τά γάρ τ ̓ ἀναθήματα δαιτός.

Molpē t' orchēstu; te ta gar t' anathēmata daitos.

Odyssey i. 152.

Aristoxenus, quoted by Plutarch, "De Musica," says, that 'the music was
designed to counteract the effects of inebriety, for as wine discomposes
the body and the mind, so music has the power of soothing them, and of
restoring their previous calmness and tranquility.' "See Wilkinsoh's
Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," vol. ii. pp. 248, 249.

But they regard not ... - The reproof is especially, that they forget
him in their entertainments. They employ music to inflame their
passions; and amid their songs and wine, their hearts are drawn away
from God. That this is the tendency of such feasts, all must know. God
is commonly forgotten in such places; and even the sweetest music is
made the occasion for stealing the affections from him, and of inflaming
the passions, instead of being employed to soften the feelings of the
soul, and raise the heart to God.

The operation of his hands - The work of his hands - particularly his
dealings among the people. God is round about them with mercy and
judgment, but they do not perceive him.

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

Therefore my people are gone - This is evidently used with reference to
the "future." The prophet described events as "passing before his eyes"
as a vision (note, [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md); and he
here seems to "see" the people going into captivity, and describes it as
an event actually occurring.

Into captivity - Referring, doubtless, to the captivity at Babylon.

Because they have no knowledge - Because they do not choose to retain
the knowledge of God.

And their honorable men - The Hebrew is, 'The glory of the people became
people of famine;' that is, they shall be destroyed with famine. This
was to be a "punishment" for their dissipation at their feasts.

And their multitude - The mass, or body of the nation; the common
people.

Dried up with thirst - Are punished in this manner for their indulgence
in drinking. The punishment here specified, refers particularly to a
journey through an arid, desolate region, where drink could be obtained
only with difficulty. Such was the route which the nation was compelled
afterward to take in going to Babylon.

[Isaiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 5:14</span></span>

Therefore hell - The word transated "hell," שׁאול she'ôl, has not the
same meaning that we now attach to that word; its usual signification,
among the Hebrews, was "the lower world, the region of departed
spirits." It corresponded to the Greek ἅδης Hadēs, "hades," or place of
the dead. This word occurs eleven times in the New Testament [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md); [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md); [Luk
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015.md); [Luk
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023.md); [Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md), [Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031.md); [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md); [Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md); [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md); [Rev
20:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013.md), in all of which places,
except [Co1 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md), it is rendered
"hell," though denoting, in most of those places, as it does in the Old
Testament, the abodes of the dead. The Septuagint, in this place, and
usually, translates the word שׁאול she'ôl by ἅδης Hadēs, "Hades." It was
represented by the Hebrews as "low down, or deep" in the earth -
contrasted with the height of heaven; [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md); [Job
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008.md); [Psa
139:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md). It was a place where thick
darkness reigns; [Job 10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md) : 'The
land of darkness and the shadow of death; a land of darkness, as
darkness itself.' It is described as having "valleys, or depths," [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md). It is represented also as having
"gates," [Isa 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md); and as being
inhabited by a great multitude, some of whom sit on thrones, occupied in
some respects as they were on earth; see the note at [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md). And it is also said that the
wicked descend into it by openings in the earth, as Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram did; [Num 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md), ... In this
place, it means evidently the "regions of the dead," without the idea of
punishment; and the poetic representation is, that so many of the Jews
would be cut off by famine, thirst, and the sword, that those vast
regions would be obliged "to enlarge themselves" in order to receive
them. It means, therefore, that while many of them would go into
captivity [Isa 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md), vast multitudes
of them would be cut off by famine, thirst, and the sword.

Opened her mouth - As if to absorb or consume them; as a "cavern," or
opening of the earth does; compare [Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md).

Without measure - Without any limit.

And their glory - All that they esteemed their pride and honor shall
descend together into the yawning gulf.

Their multitude - The multitude of people; their vast hosts.

Their pomp - Noise, tumult; the bustle, and shouting, and display made
in battle, or war, or victory; [Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md); [Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002.md); [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md).

And he that rejoiceth - All that the nation prided itself on, and all
that was a source of joy, should be destroyed.

[Isaiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 5:15</span></span>

And the mean man ... the mighty man - The expressions here mean that
"all" ranks would be subdued and punished; see the note at [Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md).

The eyes of the lofty ... - see [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), note; [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017.md), note.

Shall be exalted in judgment - In his justice; he shall so manifest his
justice as to be exalted in the view of tbe people.

Shall be sanctified - Shall be "regarded" as holy. He shall so manifest
his righteousness in his dealings, that it shall be seen and felt that
he is a holy God.

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

Then shall the lambs feed - This verse is very variously interpreted.
Most of the Hebrew commentators have followed the Chaldee
interpretation, and have regarded it as desired to console the pious
part of the people with the assurance of protection in the general
calamity. The Chaldee is, 'Then the just shall feed, as it is said, to
them; and they shall be multiplied, and shall possess the property of
the inpious.' By this interpretation, "lambs" are supposed, as is
frequently the case in the Scriptures, to represent the people of God.
But according to others, the probable design of the prophet is, to
denote the state of utter desolation that was coming upon the nation.
Its cities, towns, and palaces would be destroyed, so as to become a
vast pasturage where the flocks would roam at pleasure.

After their manner - Hebrew, 'According to their word,' that is, under
their own "command," or at pleasure. They would go where they pleased
without being obstructed by fences.

And the waste places of the fat ones - Most of the ancient interpreters
suppose, that the waste places of the fat ones here refer to the
desolate habitations of the rich people; in the judgments that should
come upon the nation, they would become vacant, and strangers would come
in and possess them. This is the sense given by the Chaldee. The Syriac
translates it, 'And foreigners shall devour the ruins which are yet to
be restored.' If this is the sense, then it accords with the "first"
interpretation suggested of the previous verse - that the pious should
be fed, and that the proud should be desolate, and their property pass
into the hands of strangers. By others (Gesenius, etc.), it is supposed
to mean that strangers, or foreigners, would come in, and fatten their
cattle in the desert places of the nation. The land would be so utterly
waste, that they would come there to fatten their cattle in the rank and
wild luxuriancy that would spontaneously spring up. This sense will suit
the connection of the passage; but there is some difficulty in making it
out from the Hebrew. The Hebrew which is rendered 'the waste places of
the fat ones,' may, however, be translated 'the deserts that are rich -
rank - luxuriant.' The word "stranger" denotes "foreigners;" or those
who are not "permanent" dwellers in the land.

[Isaiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 5:18</span></span>

Wo unto them ... - This is a new denunciation. It introduces another
form of sin, and threatens its appropriate punishment.

That draw iniquity with cords of vanity - The general idea in this verse
and the next, is, doubtless, that of plunging deeper and deeper into
sin. The word "sin" here, has been sometimes supposed to mean "the
punishment" for sin. The word has that meaning sometimes, but it seems
here to be taken in its usual sense. The word "cords" means strings of
any kind, larger or smaller; and the expression "cords of vanity," is
supposed to mean "small, slender, feeble" strings, like the web of a
spider. The word vanity שׁוא shâv', May, perhaps, have the sense here of
falsehood or deceit; and the cords of deceit may denote the schemes of
evil, the plans for deceiving people, or of bringing them into a snare,
as the fowler springs his deceitful snare upon the unsuspecting bird.
The Chaldee translates it, 'Woe to those who begin to sin by little and
little, drawing sin by cords of vanity; these sins grow and increase
until they are strong, and are like a cart-rope.' The Septuagint renders
it, 'Woe to those who draw sin with a long cable;' that is," one sin is
added to another, until it comes to an enormous length, and the whole is
drawn along together. Probably the true idea is that of the ancient
interpretation of the rabbis, 'An evil inclination is at first like a
fine hair string, but the finishing like a cart-rope.' At first, they
draw sin with a slender cord, then they go on to greater deeds of
iniquity that urge them on, and draw them with their main strength, as
with a cart-rope. They make a strong "effort" to commit iniquity.

[Isaiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 5:19</span></span>

That say ... - They add one sin to another for "the purpose of defying"
God, and provoking him to anger. They pretend that he will not punish
sin; and hence, they plunge deeply into it, and defy him to punish them.

Let him make speed - Let him come quick to punish.

And hasten his work - His punishment.

That we may see it - An expression of defiance. We would like to see him
undertake it.

The counsel of the Holy One ... - His threatened purpose to punish. This
is the language of all sinners. They plunge deep into sin; they mock at
the threatenings of God; they defy him to do his utmost; they do not
believe his declarations. It is difficult to conceive more dreadful and
high-handed iniquity than this.

[Isaiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 5:20</span></span>

Wo unto them that call evil good ... - This is the fourth class of sins
denounced. The sin which is reprobated here is that of "perverting and
confounding" things, especially the distinctions of morality and
religion. They prefer erroneous and fake doctrines to the true; they
prefer an evil to an upright course of conduct. The Chaldee renders
this, 'Wo to those who say to the impious, who are prospered in this
age, You are good; and who say to the meek, Ye are impious.' Jarchi
thinks that the prophet here refers to those who worship idols, but he
evidently has a more general reference to those who confound all the
distinctions of right and wrong, and who prefer the wrong.

That put darkness for light - "Darkness," in the Scriptures, is the
emblem of ignorance, error, false doctrine, crime. Light denotes truth,
knowledge, piety. This clause, therefore, expresses in a figurative, but
more emphatic manner, what was said in the previous member of the verse.

That put bitter - "Bitter and bitterness" are often used to denote
"sin;" see the note at [Act 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023.md); also
[Rom 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014.md); [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md); [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md); [Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); [Jer
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md). The meaning here does not differ
from that expressed in the other parts of the verse, except that there
is "implied" the additional idea that sin "is" bitter; and that virtue,
or holiness, is sweet: that is, that the one is attended with painful
consequences, and the other with pleasure.

[Isaiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 5:21</span></span>

Wo unto them that are wise ... - This is the fifth crime specified. It
refers to those who are inflated with a false opinion of their own
knowledge, and who are, therefore, self-confident and vain. This is
expressly forbidden; [Pro 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md) : 'Be
not wise in thine own eyes;' compare [Pro
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#012.md).

In their own eyes - In their own opinion, or estimation.

And prudent - Knowing; self-conceited. This was, doubtless, one
characteristic of the times of Isaiah. It is known to have been
strikingly the characteristic of the Jews - particularly the Pharisees -
in the time of our Saviour. The evil of this was,

\(1\) That it evinced and fostered "pride."

\(2\) That it rendered them unwilling to be instructed, and especially
by the prophets.

As they supposed that they were already wise enough, they refused to
listen to others. This is always the effect of such self-confidence: and
hence, the Saviour required his disciples to be meek, and humble, and
teachable as children.

[Isaiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 5:22</span></span>

Wo unto them that are mighty ... - This is the sixth specification of
crime. He had already denounced the intemperate in [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md). But probably this was a
prevailing sin. Perhaps there was no evidence of reform; and it was
needful to "repeat" the admonition, in order that people might be
brought to regard it. The prophet repeats a similar denunciation in [Isa
56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012.md).

Mighty - Perhaps those who prided themselves on their ability to drink
"much" without becoming intoxicated; who had been so accustomed to it,
that they defied its effects, and boasted of their power to resist its
usual influence. A similar idea is expressed in [Isa
56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012.md).

Men of strength - The Chaldee understands this of "rich" men; but,
probably, the reference is to those who boasted that they were able to
bear "much" strong drink.

To mingle - To mix wine with spices, dates, drugs, etc., to make it more
intoxicating; [Pro 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md). They boasted that they were able
to drink, without injury, liquor of extraordinary intoxicating
qualities.

Strong drink - Note, [Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md). On the
subject of the strong drink used in the East, "see Harmer's
Observations," vol. ii. pp. 140-148. Ed. Lond. 1808.

[Isaiah 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 5:23</span></span>

Which justify - This refers, doubtless, to magistrates. They gave unjust
decisions.

For reward - For bribes.

And take away the righteousness - That is, they do not decide the cause
in favor of those who have just claims, but are determined by a bribe;
see the note at [Isa 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023.md). It is
remarkable, that this is introduced in immediate connection with their
being mighty to mingle strong drink. One effect of intemperance is to
make a man ready to be "bribed." Its effect is seen as clearly in courts
of justice, and in the decisions of such courts, as any where. A man
that is intemperate, or that indulges in strong drink, is not qualified
to be a judge.

[Isaiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 5:24</span></span>

Therefore as the fire ... - The remainder of this chapter is occupied
with predicting "judgments," or punishments, upon the people for their
sins which had been specified. The Hebrew here is, 'The tongue of fire.'
The figure is beautiful and obvious. It is derived from the pyramidal,
or tongue-like appearance of "flame." The concinnity of the metaphor in
the Hebrew is kept up. The word "devoureth" is in the Hebrew "eateth:"
'As the tongue of fire eats up,' etc. The use of the word "tongue" to
denote "flame" is common in the Scriptures; see the note at [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003.md).

And the flame consumeth the chaff - The word rendered "chaff here,"
means rather "hay, or dried grass." The word rendered 'consumeth,'
denotes properly "to make to fall," and refers to the appearance when a
fire passes through a field of grain or grass, consuming the stalks near
the ground, so that the upper portion "falls down," or sinks gently into
the flames.

So their root shall be as rottenness - Be rotten; or decayed - of course
furnishing no moisture, or suitable juices for the support of the plant.
The idea is, that all the sources of national prosperity among the Jews
would be destroyed. The word "root" is often used to denote the source
of "strength or prosperity;" [Isa
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030.md); [Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md); [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md).

And their blossom - This word rather means germ, or tender branch. It
also means the flower. The figure is kept up here. As the root would be
destroyed, so would all that was supported by it, and all that was
deemed beautiful, or ornamental.

As dust - The Hebrew denotes "fine dust," such as is easily blown about.
The root would be rotten; and the flower, lacking nourishment, would
become dry, and turn to dust, and blow away. Their strength, and the
sources of their prosperity would be destroyed; and all their splendor
and beauty, all that was ornamental, and the source of national wealth,
would be destroyed with it.

They have cast away - They have refused to "obey" it. This was the cause
of all the calamities that would come upon them.

[Isaiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 5:25</span></span>

Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled - The Lord is "enraged," or
is angry. Similar expressions often occur; [Num
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033.md); [Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md); [Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017.md); [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md) :40; [Job
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#011.md); [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). The "cause" of his anger was the
crimes which are specified in this chapter.

And he hath stretched forth his hand - To stretch forth the hand may be
an action expressive of protection, invitation, or punishment. Here it
is the latter; compare [Isa 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027.md).

And hath smitten them - Punished them. To what this refers particularly
is not clear. Gesenius supposes that the expressions which follow are
descriptive of pestilence. Lowth and Rosenmuller suppose that they refer
to the earthquakes which occurred in the days of Uzziah, and in the time
of the prophets; [Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md). The words, perhaps, will bear
either construction.

And the hills did tremble - This expression is one that is often used in
the Scriptures to denote the presence and anger of God. It is well
adapted to describe an earthquake; but it is also often used poetically,
to describe the presence and the majesty of the Most High; compare [Psa
144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md); [Job
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006.md); [Job
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011.md); [Psa
114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md); [Jer
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#024.md); [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md); [Psa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md); [Psa
97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005.md); [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md). The image is one that is very
sublime. The earth, as if conscious of the presence of God, is
represented as alarmed, and trembling. Whether it refers here to the
earthquake, or to some other mode of punishment, cannot be determined.
The fact, however, that such an earthquake had occurred in the time of
Isaiah, would seem to fix the expression to that. Isaiah, from that,
took occasion also to denounce future judgments. This was but the
beginning of woes.

And their carcasses were torn - The margin here is the more correct
translation. The passage means that their dead bodies were strewed,
unburied, like filth, through the streets. This expression would more
naturally denote a pestilence. But it may be descriptive of an
earthquake, or of any calamity.

For all this - Notwithstanding all this calamity, his judgments are not
at an end. He will punish the nation more severely still. In what way he
would do it, the prophet proceeds in the remainder of the chapter to
specify; compare [Isa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md); [Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 5:26</span></span>

And he will lift up an ensign ... - The idea here is, that the nations
of the earth are under his control, and that he can call whom he pleases
to execute his purposes. This power over the nations he often claims;
compare [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); [Isa
45:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md); [Isa
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Isa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md); [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md). An "ensign" is the "standard,"
or "flag" used in an army. The elevation of the standard was a signal
for assembling for war. God represents himself here as simply raising
the standard, expecting that the nations would come at once.

And will hiss unto them - This means that he would "collect" them
together to accomplish his purposes. The expression is probably taken
from the manner in which bees were hived. Theodoret and Cyril, on this
place, say, that in Syria and Palestine, they who kept bees were able to
draw them out of their hives, and conduct them into fields, and bring
them back again, with the sound of a flute or the noise of hissing. It
is certain also that the ancients had this idea respecting bees. Pliny
(lib. xi. ch. 20) says: Gaudent plausu, atque tinnitu aeris, coque
convocantur. 'They rejoice in a sound, and in the tinkling of brass, and
are thus called together.' AElian (lib. v. ch. 13) says, that when they
are disposed to fly away, their keepers make a musical and harmonious
sound, and that they are thus brought back as by a siren, and restored
to their hives. So Virgin says, when speaking of bees:

Tinnitusque cie, et Matris quate cymbala circum.

Georg. iv. 64.

'On brazen vessels beat a tinkling sound,

And shake the cymbals of the goddess round;

Then all will hastily retreat, and fill

The warm resounding hollow of their cell.'

Addison

So Ovid:

Jamque erat ad Rhodopen Pangaeaque flumina ventum,

Aeriferae comitum cum crepuere manus.

Ecce! novae coeunt volucres tinnitibus actae

Quosque movent sonitus aera sequuntur apes.

Fastor, lib. iii., 739.

See also Columella, lib. x. ch. 7; Lucan, lib. ix. ver. 288; and
Claudian, "Panegyric. in sextum consul. Honorii," ver. 259; compare
Bochart, "Hieroz." P. ii. lib. iv. ch. x. pp. 506, 507. The prophets
refer to that fact in several places, [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Zac
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008.md). The simple meaning is, that God,
at his pleasure; would collect the nations around Judea like bees, that
is, in great numbers.

The end of the earth - That is, the remotest parts of the world. The
most eastern nations known to them were probably the Babylonians, Medes,
Persians, and perhaps the inhabitants of India. The general idea is,
that he would call in the distant nations to destroy them. In [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md), Egypt and Assyria are
particularly specified. This was in accordance with the prediction in
[Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md).

[Isaiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 5:27</span></span>

None shall be weary - In this verse and the following, the prophet
describes the condition of the army that would be summoned to the
destruction of Judea. It would be composed of bold, vigorous, courageous
men; they would be unwearied by long and painful journies; they would be
fierce and violent; they would come fully prepared for conquest. None
would be "weary," that is, fatigued with long marches, or with hard
service; [Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018.md); [Sa2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014.md).

Nor stumble - They shall be chosen, select men; not those who are
defective, or who shall easily fall by any impediments in the way of
their march.

None shall slumber - They shall be unwearied, and indefatigable,
pursuing their purpose with ever watchfull vigilance - so much as not to
be off their guard. They cannot be taken by surprise.

Neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed - The ancients wore a
loose, large, flowing robe, or upper garment. When they labored, or ran,
it was necessary to "gird" this up round the body, or to lay it aside
altogether. The form of expression here may mean, that they will not
relax their efforts; they will not unloose their girdle; they will not
unfit themselves for vigorous action, and for battle. "In" that girdle,
with which they bound up their robes, the orientals usually carried
their dirks and swords; see [Neh 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018.md);
[Eze 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015.md). It means that they should
be fully, and at all times, prepared for action.

Nor the latchet of their shoes be broken - They will be constantly
prepared for marches. The shoes, sandals, or "soles" were attached to
the feet, not by upper leather, but were girded on by thongs or strings;
see the notes at [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

[Isaiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 5:28</span></span>

Whose arrows are sharp - Bows and arrows were the common instruments of
fighting at a distance. Arrows were, of course, made sharp, and usually
pointed with iron, for the purpose of penetrating the shields or coats
of mail which were used to guard against them.

And all their bows bent - All ready for battle.

Their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint - It is supposed that
the ancients did not usually shoe their horses. Hence, a hard, solid
hoof would add greatly to the value of a horse. The prophet here means,
that their horses would be prepared for any fatigue, or any expedition;
see a full description of horses and chariots in Bochart's "Hieroz." P.
i. lib. ii. ch. viii. ix.

And their wheels like a whirlwind - That is, the wheels of their
chariots shall be swift as the wind, and they shall raise a cloud of
dust like a whirlwind. This comparison was very common, as it is now;
see "Bochart." See, also, a magnificent description of a war-horse in
[Job 39:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019.md).

[Isaiah 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 5:29</span></span>

Their roaring ... - Their battle cry, or their shout as they enter into
an engagement. Such a "shout," or cry, was common at the commencement of
a battle. War was very much a personal conflict; and they expected to
accomplish much by making it as frightful and terrible as possible. A
shout served not only to excite their own spirits, but to produce an
impression of their numbers and courage, and to send dismay into the
opposite ranks. Such "shouts" are almost always mentioned by Homer, and
by other writers, in their accounts of battles. They are often
mentioned, also, in the Old Testament; [Exo
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#018.md); [Jos
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#010.md), [Jos
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md), [Jos
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md); [Sa1
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md), [Sa1
17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md); [Ch2
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#015.md); [Job
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025.md).

Like a lion - This comparison is common in the Bible; [Jer
51:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#038.md); [Hos
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md); [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md); compare [Num
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024.md).

Like young lions - This variation of the expression, from the lion to
the young lion, is very common. It is the Hebrew form of poetry, where
the second member expresses little more than the first. Here the
description is that of a lion, or more probably a "lioness" and her
whelps, all ravenous, and all uniting in roaring for prey. The idea is,
that the army that would come up would be greedy of plunder; they would
rush on to rapine in a frightful manner.

[Isaiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 5:30</span></span>

They shall roar against them - The army that shall come up shall roar
against the Jews. The image of "the roaring of the sea" indicates the
great number that would come; that of the roaring of the "lion" denotes
their fierceness and terror.

And if one look unto the land - This expression has given some
perplexity, because it is supposed not to be full or complete. The whole
image, it has been supposed (see "Lowth"), would be that of looking
"upward" to the heaven for help, and then to the land, or "earth;"
compare [Isa 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md), where the same
expression is used. But there is no need of supposing the expression
defective. The prophet speaks of the vast multitude that was coming up
and roaring like the tumultuous "ocean." On "that" side there was no
safety. The waves were rolling, and everything was suited to produce
alarm. It was natural to speak of the "other" direction, as the "land,"
or the shore; and to say that the people would look there for safety.
But, says he, there would be no safety there. All would be darkness.

Darkness and sorrow - This is an image of distress and calamity. There
should be no light; no consolation; no safety; compare [Isa
59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md), [Amo
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#020.md); [Lam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#002.md).

And the light is darkened ... - That which gave light is turned to
darkness.

In the heavens thereof - In the "clouds," perhaps, or by the gloomy
thick clouds. Lowth renders it, 'the light is obscured by the gloomy
vapor.' The main idea is plain, that there would be distress and
calamity; and that there would be no light to guide them on their way.
On the one hand a roaring, ragtag multitude, like the sea; on the other
