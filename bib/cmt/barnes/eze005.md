### [Ezekiel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 5:1</span></span>

Translate it: take thee a sharp sword, for a barber's razor thou shalt
take it thee. Even if the action were literal, the use of an actual
sword would best enforce the symbolic meaning. The "head" represents the
chief city, the "hair" the inhabitants - its ornament and glory - the
"hair cut from the head" the exiles cast forth from their homes. It adds
to the force of the representation that "to shave the head" was a token
of mourning [Job 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020), and was
forbidden to the priests [Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).
Thus, in many ways, this action of Ezekiel "the priest" is significant
of calamity and ruin. The sword indicates the avenging power; the
shaving of the head the removal of grace and glory; the scales and
weights the determination of divine justice. Compare [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008).

[Ezekiel 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 5:2</span></span>

"The third part burnt in the midst of the city" represents those who
perished within the city during the siege; "the third part smitten about
it" (the city) "with" the sword, those who were killed about the city
during the same period: "the third part scattered to the wind" those who
after the siege were dispersed in foreign lands.

In the midst of the city - The prophet is in exile, and is to do this in
the midst of Jerusalem. His action being ideal is fitly assigned to the
place which the prophecy concerns.

When the days of the siege are fulfilled - i. e., "when the days of the
figurative representation of the siege are fulfilled."

[Ezekiel 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 5:3</span></span>

Of the third part a few are yet to be taken and kept in the fold of the
garment (representing those still to remain in their native land), and
yet even of those few some are to be cast into the fire. Such was the
fate of those left behind after the destruction of Jerusalem Jer. 40;
41. The whole prophecy is one of denunciation.

[Eze 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004)

Thereof - Or, from thence, out of the midst of the fire. Omit "For."

[Ezekiel 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 5:5</span></span>

I have set it in the midst of the nations - It was not unusual for
nations to regard the sanctuary, which they most revered, as the center
of the earth. In the case of the holy land this was both natural and
appropriate. Egypt to the south, Syria to the north, Assyria to the east
and the Isles of the Gentiles in the Great Sea to the west, were to the
Jew proofs of the central position of his land in the midst of the
nations (compare [Jer 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019)). The
habitation assigned to the chosen people was suitable at the first for
separating them from the nations; then for the seat of the vast dominion
and commerce of Solomon; then, when they learned from their neighbors
idol-worship, their central position was the source of their punishment.
Midway between the mighty empires of Egypt and Assyria the holy land
became a battlefield for the two powers, and suffered alternately from
each as for the time the one or the other became predominant.

[Ezekiel 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 5:6</span></span>

They - The inhabitants of Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 5:7</span></span>

Because ye multiplied - Some prefer: Because ye have raged
tumultuously."

Neither have done according to the judgments - (or, ordinances) of the
nations The reproach is that the Israelites have not even been as
faithful to their one true God as the nations have been to their false
gods (compare [Kg2 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033)).

[Ezekiel 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 5:8</span></span>

Execute judgments - As upon the false gods of Egypt [Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012); [Num
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004).

[Ezekiel 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 5:9</span></span>

Compare [Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021). The calamities of
the Babylonian were surpassed by the Roman siege, and these again were
but a foreshadowing of still more terrible destruction at the last day.

[Ezekiel 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 5:12</span></span>

The judgments [Eze 5:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012) of "famine,
pestilence," and the "sword," were precisely those which attended the
coming siege of Jerusalem ([Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002)
ff). The "drawing out the sword after them" indicates that the anger of
God will follow them even to the land of their exile (compare [Jer
42:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019); [Lev
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#025)), and that the horrors of the
Babylonian siege are but the beginning of the sorrows of the nation.

[Ezekiel 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 5:13</span></span>

Comforted - In the sense of "consoling oneself" and "feeling
satisfaction in punishing;" hence, to "avenge oneself."

The fury is to "rest" upon them, abide, so as not to pass away. The
"accomplishment" of the divine anger is not the "completion" in the
sense of bringing it to a close, but in the sense of carrying it out to
the full.
