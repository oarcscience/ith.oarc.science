### [Jeremiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 2:0</span></span>

In the prophecies contained in Jer. 2-6, we have, probably, the records
of Jeremiah's earlier ministrations during the comparatively uneventful
years of Josiah's reign. The great object of the prophet's mission was
to urge upon the people the necessity of making use of that final
opportunity of repentance then given them. If personal amendment
followed upon the king's reforms Judah might yet be saved. We have then
in these chapters such portions of Jeremiah's earlier teaching,
published during Josiah's reign, as were deemed fit also for the
Church's use in all time.

The prophecy Jer. 2:1-3:5 consists of three parts, of which the first
[Jer 2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001) contains an appeal from
God to all Israel, i. e., the whole twelve tribes, proving to them His
past love, and that their desertion of Him was without ground or reason.
In the second [Jer 2:14-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014) the prophet
shows that Israel's calamities were entirely the result of her apostasy.
In the last Jer. 2:29-3:5 we see Judah imitating Samaria's sin, and
hardening itself against correction.

[Jeremiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 2:1</span></span>

Moreover - literally, And. Notice the connection between Jeremiah's call
and first prophecy.

[Jeremiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 2:2</span></span>

Up to this time Jeremiah had lived at Anathoth, he is now to make
Jerusalem the scene of his ministrations.

I remember ... - Or, I have remembered for thee the grace "of thy youth,
the love of thine espousals," thy going "after me in the wilderness" in
an unsown land. Jeremiah contrasts the present unfriendly relations
between Yahweh and His people with their past love. Israel, as often
elsewhere, is represented as a young bride [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008); [Hos
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020); [Joe
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008). The walking after God in the
wilderness was an act of love on Israel's part. Israel did leave Egypt
at Moses' bidding, and at Sinai was solemnly espoused to Yahweh.

[Jeremiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 2:3</span></span>

Render: "Israel" is an offering consecrated to Yahweh, His firstfruits
of increase. The firstfruits were God's consecrated property, His
portion of the whole harvest. Pagan, i. e., unconsecrated, nations must
not meddle with Israel, because it is the nation consecrated to God. If
they do, they will bring such guilt upon themselves as those incur who
eat the first-fruits [Lev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010), [Lev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#016).

[Jeremiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 2:6</span></span>

Modern researches have shown that this description applies only to
limited portions of the route of the Israelites through the Sinaitic
peninsula.

[Jeremiah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 2:7</span></span>

A plentiful country - literally, "a land of the Carmel," a Carmel land
(see [Kg1 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019), note; [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017), note).

[Jeremiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 2:8</span></span>

The guilt of this idolatry is ascribed to the four ruling classes:

\(a\) The accusation brought against the priests is indifference.

\(b\) "They that handle the law" belonged also to the priestly class
[Deu 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010). Their offence was that
"they knew not God." Compare [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).

\(c\) The third class are "the pastors" or shepherds, that is the
temporal rulers. Their crime is disobedience.

\(d\) The fourth class are "the prophets." It was their business to
press the moral and spiritual truths of the law home to the hearts of
the people: but they drew their inspiration from Baal, the Sun-god. Upon
the corruption of the prophetic order at this time, see the [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013) note.

Things that do not profit - Here idols, which are not merely unreal, but
injurious. See [Sa1 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021); [Isa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009).

[Jeremiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 2:9</span></span>

Plead - The word used by the plaintiff setting forth his accusation in a
law-court (see [Job 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013) note).

With you - The present generation, who by joining in Manasseh's apostasy
have openly violated Yahweh's covenant. The fathers made the nation what
it now is, the children will receive it such as the present generation
are now making it to be, and God will judge it according as the
collective working of the past, the present, and the future tends to
good or to evil.

[Jeremiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 2:10</span></span>

Kedar signifies the whole East, and the isles of Chittim ([Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012) note) the West. If then you
traverse all lands from west to east, it will be impossible to find any
nation guilty of such apostasy as that committed by Israel.

[Jeremiah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 2:11</span></span>

A nation - A Gentile nation, in strong antithesis to people, the
appellation of Israel.

Their glory - Though the worship of the one true God is a nation's
greatest glory, yet it is irksome because it puts a constraint on human
passions.

That which doth not profit - Israel had exchanged the prosperity which
was God's reward of obedience for the calamities which resulted from
idol-worship.

[Jeremiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 2:12</span></span>

Be astonished - The King James Version uses this word as equivalent "to
be stupefied."

Desolate - Or, "be dry." In horror at Israel's conduct the heavens
shrivel and dry up.

[Jeremiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 2:13</span></span>

The pagan are guilty of but one sin - idolatry; the covenant-people
commit two - they abandon the true God; they serve idols.

Fountain - Not a spring or natural fountain, but a tank or reservoir dug
in the ground (see [Jer 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007)), and
chiefly intended for storing living waters, i. e., those of springs and
rivulets. The cistern was used for storing up rain-water only, and
therefore the quantity it contained was limited.

[Jeremiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 2:14</span></span>

It was Israel's glory to be Yahweh's servant [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010), and slaves born in the house
were more prized than those bought with money as being more faithful
[Gen 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014). Cannot Yahweh guard His
own household? How happens it that a member of so powerful a family is
spoiled? In the next verse the prophet gives the reason. Israel is a
runaway slave, who has deserted the family to which he belongs by right
of birth, and thereby brought upon himself trouble and misery.

[Jeremiah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 2:15</span></span>

Upon him - Rather, against him. Israel has run away from his master's
house, but only to find himself exposed to the beasts of prey in the
wilderness.

They made his land waste - The prophet points to the actual results of
Israel's until the multiplication of wild beasts rendered human life
unsafe [Kg2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025), but the Assyrian
invasions had reduced Judaea to almost as sad a state.

Burned - Others render, "leveled to the ground."

[Jeremiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 2:16</span></span>

Noph, i. e., Napata, a town situated in the extreme south of Egypt. Some
take it to be Memphis (see [Isa 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013)
note).

Tahapanes - Daphne Pelusii, a bordertown toward Palestine.

Have broken the crown of thy head - literally, shall depasture the crown
of thy head; i. e., make it bald; baldness was accounted by the Jews a
sign of disgrace [Kg2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023), and also a
mark of mourning [Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002); [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012). The Egyptians in slaying
Josiah, and capturing Jerusalem, brought ruin, disgrace, and sorrow upon
the Jews.

[Jeremiah 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 2:17</span></span>

The way - Either, the journey through the wilderness, or the way of
holiness.

[Jeremiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 2:18</span></span>

Sihor - The Nile. To lean upon Egypt was a violation of the principles
of theocracy.

The two rivers are the two empires, and to drink their waters is to
adopt their principles and religion. Compare also [Isa
8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006).

[Jeremiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 2:19</span></span>

Correct thee - Or, "chastise thee." Alliances with foreign powers shall
bring trouble and not safety.

[Jeremiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 2:20</span></span>

Transgress - Rather, as in marg. If the "yoke" and "bands" refer to the
slavery in Egypt from which Yahweh freed Israel, the sense is - "For of
old time I Yahweh broke thy yoke, I burst thy bands," not that thou
mightest be free to do thy own will, but that thou mightest serve me:
"and thou saidst, I will not serve."

When ... - "For ... under every leafy tree thou" layest thyself down as
a harlot. The verb indicates the eagerness with which she prostrates
herself before the objects of her idolatrous worship.

[Jeremiah 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 2:21</span></span>

A noble vine - Properly, a Sorek vine (see [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002)), which produced a red wine [Pro
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031), and had a lasting reputation
[Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011).

A right seed - literally, "a seed of truth," i. e., true, genuine seed,
not mixed with weeds, nor with seed of an inferior quality. Compare [Mat
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024).

How then art thou turned - Or, "How then" hast thou changed thyself
"unto me" (i. e., to my hurt or vexation) "into the degenerate" branches
"of a strange vine?" The stock, which was God's planting, was genuine,
and of the noblest sort: the wonder was how such a stock could produce
shoots of a totally different kind [Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032).

[Jeremiah 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 2:22</span></span>

Nitre - Or, natron, a mineral alkali, found in the Nile valley, where it
effloresces upon the rocks and surfaces of the dykes, and in old time
was carefully collected, and used to make lye for washing (see [Pro
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020)).

Sope - A vegetable alkali, now called "potash," because obtained from
the ashes of plants. Its combination with oils, etc., to form soap was
not known to the Hebrews until long after Jeremiah's time, but they used
the lye, formed by passing water through the ashes. Thus then, though
Israel use both mineral and vegetable alkalies, the most powerful
detergents known, yet will she be unable to wash away the stains of her
apostasy.

Thine iniquity is marked - i. e., as a stain.

[Jeremiah 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 2:23</span></span>

In their defense of themselves (compare [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035)), the people probably appealed to
the maintenance of the daily sacrifice, and the Mosaic ritual: and even
more confidently perhaps to Josiah's splendid restoration of the temple,
and to the suppression of the open worship of Baal. All such pleas
availed little as long as the rites of Moloch were still privately
practiced.

Thy way in the valley - i. e., of Hinnom (see [Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010) note). From the time of Ahaz it
had been the seat of the worship of Moloch, and the prophet more than
once identifies Moloch with Baal. "Way" is put metaphorically for
"conduct, doings."

Traversing - Interlacing her ways. The word describes the tangled mazes
of the dromedary's course, as she runs here and there in the heat of her
passion.

[Jeremiah 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 2:24</span></span>

A wild donkey used to the wilderness - The type of an untamed and
reckless nature.

Snuffeth up the wind - The wind brings with it the scent of the male.
Israel does not wait until temptation comes of itself, but looks out for
any and every incentive to idolatry.

Occasion ... month - i. e., the pairing season.

[Jeremiah 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 2:25</span></span>

God the true husband exhorts Israel not to run barefoot, and with
parched throat, like a shameless adulteress, after strangers.

There is no hope - i. e., It is in vain.

[Jeremiah 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 2:27</span></span>

"Stone" being feminine in Hebrew is here represented as the mother.

Arise, and save us - Whether it be idolatry or infidelity, it satisfies
only in tranquil and prosperous times. No sooner does trouble come, than
the deep conviction of the existence of a God, which is the witness for
Him in our heart, resumes its authority, and man prays.

[Jeremiah 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 2:28</span></span>

A question of bitter irony. Things are made for some use. Now is the
time for thy deities to prove themselves real by being useful. When
every city has its special deity, surely among so many there might be
found one able to help his worshippers.

O Judah - Hereto the argument had been addressed to Israel: suddenly the
prophet charges Judah with the habitual practice of idolatry, and points
to the conclusion, that as Jerusalem has been guilty of Samaria's sin,
it must suffer Samaria's punishment.

[Jeremiah 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 2:30</span></span>

Your own sword hath detoured your prophets - An allusion probably to
Manasseh [Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016). Death was the
usual fate of the true prophet [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026); [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).

[Jeremiah 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 2:31</span></span>

Or, "O generation" that ye are! An exclamation Of indignation at their
hardened resistance to God.

A land of darkness - This word is written in Hebrew with two accents, as
being a compound, signifying not merely darkness, but the darkness of
Yahweh, i. e., very great darkness.

We are lords - Others render it: We rove about, wander about at our
will, go where we like.

[Jeremiah 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 2:32</span></span>

A bride treasures all her life the girdle, which first indicated that
she was a married woman, just as brides now treasure the wedding ring;
but Israel, Yahweh's bride [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002),
cherishes no fond memorials of past affection.

[Jeremiah 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 2:33</span></span>

Why trimmest thou thy way - literally, "Why makest thou thy way good," a
phrase used here of the pains taken by the Jews to learn the idolatries
of foreign nations.

The wicked ones ... - Or, "therefore thou hast taught" thy ways
wickednesses."

[Jeremiah 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 2:34</span></span>

I have not found it ... - Rather, thou didst not find them breaking into
thy house. The meaning is, that these poor innocents had committed no
crime: they were not thieves caught in the act, whom the Law permitted
men to slay [Exo 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#002), and therefore
Israel in killing them was guilty of murder. The one crime here of theft
is put for crime generally.

Upon all these - Or, because of all this. Thou killedst the poor
innocents, not for any crime, but because of this thy lust for idolatry.

[Jeremiah 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 2:35</span></span>

Because I am innocent - Rather, But "I am innocent," or, "I am
acquitted." Those blood-stains cannot be upon my skirts, because now, in
king Josiah's days, the idolatry of Manasseh has been put away.

Shall turn from me - Or, has turned away "from me."

Plead - Or, enter into judgment.

[Jeremiah 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 2:36</span></span>

To change thy way - The rival parties at Jerusalem looked one to
Assyria, the other to Egypt, for safety. As one or other for the time
prevailed, the nation "changed its way," sending its embassies now
eastward to Nineveh, now westward to Memphis.

Thou also ... - literally, also of Egypt "shalt thou be ashamed." This
was literally fulfilled by the failure of the attempt to raise the siege
of Jerusalem [Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005).

[Jeremiah 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 2:37</span></span>

From him - From it, from this Egypt, which though fem. as a land, yet as
a people may be used as a masc. (compare [Jer
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008)). Now that Nineveh is trembling
before the armies of Cyaxares and Nabopalassar, thou hastenest to Egypt,
hoping to rest upon her strength: but thou shalt retrace thy steps, with
thy hands clasped upon thy head, disgraced and discarded.

Confidences - Those in whom thou confidest.

In them - literally, "with respect to them."
