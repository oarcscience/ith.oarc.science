### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

[Mark 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 8:1</span></span>

See this passage explained in the notes at [Mat
15:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md).

[Mar 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

In those days - While in the wilderness, where he had cured the
deaf-mute man.

Having nothing to eat - Having come unprovided, or having consumed what
they had brought.

[Mar 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#002.md)

I have compassions - I pity their condition. I am disposed to relieve
them.

[Mar 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#009.md)

Four thousand - Four thousand "men," besides women and children. See
[Mat 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#038.md). See this passage explained
in the notes at [Mat 15:32-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md).

[Mark 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 8:10</span></span>

Dalmanutha - In [Mat 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039.md) it is said
that he came into the coasts of "Magdala." See the note on the place.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

See this passage explained in [Mat
16:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md).

[Mar 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012.md)

Sighed deeply in his spirit - His heart was deeply affected at their
wickedness and hypocrisy. The word "spirit" here is taken as the seat of
the emotions, passions, affections. He drew groans deeply from his
breast.

No sign be given - That is, no such sign as they asked, to wit, a sign
"from heaven." He said a sign should be given, the same as was furnished
by Jonas, [Mat 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004.md). But this was not
what they "asked," nor would it be given "because" they asked it.

[Mar 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md)

Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees - See [Mat
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md).

Of Herod - Of the Herodians - of Herod and his followers. Matthew,
instead of "Herod," has "the Sadducees." It is not improbably that he
cautioned them against them all. The Pharisees sought his life, and were
exceedingly corrupt in their doctrine and practice; the Sadducees denied
some of the essential doctrines of religion, and the Herodians probably
were distinguished for irreligion, sensuality, and corrupt living. They
were united, therefore, with the Pharisees and Sadducees in opposing the
claims of Jesus. Matthew has recorded his caution to avoid the Pharisees
and Sadducees, and Mark has added, what Matthew had omitted. the caution
likewise to beware of the Herodians. Thus, the evangelists speak the
same thing.

[Mark 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 8:22</span></span>

To Bethsaida - See the notes at [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md).

And they bring a blind man unto him - The healing of the blind man of
Bethsaida is recorded only by Mark.

Besought him to touch him - That is, to heal him, for they believed that
his touch would restore his sight.

[Mark 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 8:23</span></span>

Led him out of the town - Why this was done the sacred writers have not
told us. It might have been to avoid the collecting of a multitude, and
thus to have escaped the designs of the Pharisees who were attempting to
take his life, and chiefly on a charge of sedition and of exciting the
people. On this account Jesus chose to perform the miracle alone, thus
showing that while he did good, he desired to do it in such a way as to
avoid the "appearance" of evil, and to prevent, at the same time,
ostentation and the malice of his enemies.

Spit on his eyes - Why this was done is not known. It was evidently not
intended to perform the cure by any natural effect of the spittle. It
was to the man a "sign," an evidence that it was the power of Jesus. The
eyes were probably closed. They were perhaps "gummed" or united together
by a secretion that had become hard. To apply spittle to them - to wet
them - would be a "sign," a natural expression of removing the
obstruction and opening them. The power was not in the spittle, but it
attended the application of it.

Saw aught - Saw anything.

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

I see men, as trees, walking - I see men walking, but see them so
indistinctly that, but for their "motion," I could not distinguish them
from trees. I cannot distinctly see their shapes and features. Probably
our Lord did not "at once" restore him fully to sight, that he might
strengthen his faith. Seeing that Jesus had partially restored him, it
was evidence that he could "wholly," and it led him to exercise faith
anew in him, and to feel more strikingly his dependence on him.

[Mark 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 8:25</span></span>

Every man clearly - Could see their form and features. His sight was
completely restored. Though our Lord did not by this, probably, "intend"
to teach any lesson in regard to the way in which the mind of a sinner
is enlightened, yet it affords a striking illustration of it. Sinners
are by nature blind, [Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011.md); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md). The effect of religion, or of
the influence of the Holy Spirit, is to open the eyes, to show the
sinner his condition and his danger, and to lead him to "look" on him as
a Saviour. Yet at first he sees indistinctly. He does not soon learn to
distinguish objects. When converted he is in a new world. Light is shed
on every object, and he sees the Scriptures, the Saviour, and the works
of creation, the sun, the stars, the hills, the vales, in a new light.
He sees the beauty of the plan of salvation, and wonders that he has not
seen it before. Yet he sees at first indistinctly. It is only by
repeated applications to the Source of light that he sees all things
clearly. At first religion appears full of mysteries. Doctrines and
facts are brought before his mind that he cannot fully comprehend. He is
still perplexed, and he may doubt whether he has ever seen anything
aright, or has been ever renewed. Yet let him not despair. Light, in due
time, will be shed on these obscure and mysterious truths. Faithful and
repeated application to the Father of lights in prayer, and in searching
the Scriptures, and in the ordinances of religion, will dissipate these
doubts, and he will see all things clearly, and the universe will appear
to be filled with one broad flood of light.

[Mark 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 8:26</span></span>

The town - The town of Bethsaida.

Nor tell it ... - Lest it excite the jealousy of the Pharisees, and
produce commotion and danger.

[Mark 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 8:27</span></span>

See this passage illustrated in the notes at Mat. 16:13-28.

[Mar 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032.md)

He spake that saying openly - With boldness or confidence, or without
parables or figures, so that there could be no possibility of
misunderstanding him.

[Mar 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md)

Ashamed of me - Ashamed to own attachment to me on account of my lowly
appearance and my poverty.

And of my words - My doctrines, my instructions.

This adulterous and sinful generation - This age given to wickedness,
particularly to adultery.

In the glory of his Father - In the day of judgment. See the notes at
[Mat 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md). The meaning of this verse
is, Whosoever shall refuse, through pride or wickedness, to acknowledge
and serve Christ here, shall be excluded from his kingdom hereafter. He
was lowly, meek, and despised; yet there was an inimitable beauty in his
character even then. But he will come again in awful grandeur; not as
the babe of Bethlehem, not as the man of Nazareth, but as the Son of
God, in majesty and glory. They that would not acknowledge him here must
be rejected by him there; they that would not serve him on earth will
not enjoy his favor in heaven; they that would cast Him out and despise
him must be cast out by him, and consigned to eternal, hopeless sorrow.
