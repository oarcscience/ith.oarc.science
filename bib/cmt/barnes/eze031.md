### [Ezekiel Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

In the third month - More than a month before Jerusalem was taken
(compare [Jer 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 31:3</span></span>

Fifth prophecy against Egypt: a warning to Pharaoh from the fate of the
Assyrians. The Assyrian empire, after having been supreme in Asia for
four centuries, had been overthrown by the united forces of the
Babylonians and Medes, in the year of the battle of Carchemish (605
b.c.), which had broken the power of Egypt. This gives force to the
warning to Egypt from Assyria's fall.

[Eze 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md)

His plants - Rather, her plantation. The water represents the riches and
might which flowed into Assyria.

[Eze 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005.md)

When be shot forth - Or, when the deep water sent forth its streams.

[Eze 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md)

Garden of God - Paradise.

[Ezekiel 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 31:10</span></span>

Assyria's fall.

[Eze 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md)

More accurately: Therefore I will deliver him, etc ... he shall surely
deal with him. I have driven him out, etc.

[Eze 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md)

Their trees - Rather, as in the margin, "standing unto themselves"
meaning "standing in their own strength." The clause will then run thus:
"Neither all that drink water stand up" in their own strength. "All that
drink water" means mighty princes to whom wealth and prosperity flow in.
The Egyptians owed everything to the waters of the Nile. The substance
is, that Assyria's fall was decreed in order that the mighty ones of the
earth might learn not to exalt themselves in pride or to rely on
themselves, seeing that they must share the common lot of mortality.

[Ezekiel 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 31:15</span></span>

Effect of Assyria's fall.

[Eze 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md)

I covered the deep - To cover with sack-cloth was an expression of
mourning [Eze 27:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#031.md). The deep, the
source of Assyria's prosperity [Eze
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md), was made to mourn, being dried
up instead of giving forth its waters, its glad abundance.

For him - Upon his account.

Floods ... great waters - Or, rivers ... the multitude of waters (as in
[Eze 31:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004).md).

Lebanon represents the country which Assyria governed; "the trees," the
tributary princes.

[Eze 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md)

See the marginal references.

[Eze 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#017.md)

His arm ... - The subject princes who were his strength and support in
war.

[Ezekiel 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 31:18</span></span>

Application to Pharaoh.

The uncircumcised - The Egyptians, at least their nobles, were
circumcised. Pharaoh should thus be dishonored with those whom the
Egyptians themselves deemed unclean.
