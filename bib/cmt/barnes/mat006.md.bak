### [Matthew Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 6:1</span></span>

Take heed that ye do not your alms - The word "alms" here denotes
liberality to the poor and needy. In the margin, as in the best editions
of the Greek it is "righteousness;" either referring to almsgiving as
eminently a righteous act, or more probably including all that is
specified in this and the following verses - almsgiving, prayer,
fasting, Mat. 6:2-18. Our Saviour here does not positively command his
disciples to aid the poor, but supposes that they would do it of course,
and gives them directions how to do it. It is the nature of religion to
help those who are really needy; and a real Christian does not wait to
be "commanded" to do it, but only asks for the opportunity. See [Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md); [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md).

Before men ... - Our Lord does not require us never to give alms before
people, but only forbids our doing it "to be seen of them," for the
purposes of ostentation and to seek their praise. To a person who is
disposed to do good from a right motive, it matters little whether it be
in public or in private. The only thing that renders it even desirable
that our good deeds should be seen is that God may be glorified. See
[Mat 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016.md).

Otherwise - If your only motive for doing it is to be seen by people,
God will not reward you. Take heed, therefore, that you do not do it to
be seen, "otherwise" God will not reward you.

[Matthew 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 6:2</span></span>

Do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do - The word
"hypocrite" is taken from "stage-players," who act the part of others,
or speak not their own sentiments, but the sentiments of others. It
means here, and in the New Testament generally, those who "dissemble" or
hide their real sentiments, and assume or express other feelings than
their own - those who, for purposes of ostentation, gain, or applause,
put on the appearance of religion. It is probable that such persons,
when they were about to bestow alms, caused a trumpet to be sounded,
professedly to call the poor together to receive it, but really to call
the people to see the proofs of their liberality and piety; or perhaps
it may mean that they should not make a great noise about it, like
sounding a trumpet.

In the synagogues - The word "synagogue" commonly means the place of
assembling for religious worship known by that name. See the notes at
[Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md). It might mean, however, any
"collection of people" assembled for any purpose, and it is not
improbable that it has that meaning here. It does not appear that they
made a noise in bestowing charity in the synagogues, or that charity was
commonly bestowed there; but it was probably done on occasion of any
great assemblage, in any place of concourse, and at the corners of the
streets, where it could be seen by many.

They have their reward - That is, they obtain the applause they seek the
reputation of being charitable; and as this applause was all they
wished, there is, of course, no further reward to be looked for or
obtained.

[Matthew 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 6:3</span></span>

Let not thy left hand know ... - This is a proverbial expression,
signifying that the action should be done as secretly as possible. The
Hebrews often attribute actions to members which properly belong to
persons. The encouragement for performing our acts of charity in secret
is that it will be pleasing to God; that he will see the act, however
secret it may be, and will openly reward it. If the reward is not
granted in this life, it will be in the life to come. In multitudes of
cases, however, alms given to the poor are "lent to the Lord" [Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md), and will be repaid in this
life. Rarely, perhaps never, has it been found that the man who is
liberal to the poor has ever suffered by it in his worldly
circumstances.

[Matthew 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 6:5</span></span>

And when thou prayest ... - Hypocrites manifested the same spirit about
prayer as almsgiving; it was done in public places. The word
"synagogues," here, clearly means, not the place of worship of that
name, but places where many were accustomed to assemble - near the
markets or courts, where they could be seen of many. Our Lord evidently
could not mean to condemn prayers in the synagogues. It might be said
that he condemned ostentatious prayer there, while they neglected secret
prayer; but this does not appear to be his design. The Jews were much in
the habit of praying in public places. At certain times of the day they
always offered their prayers. Wherever they were, they suspended their
employment and paid their devotions. This is also practiced now
everywhere by Muslims, and in many places by Roman Catholics. It seems,
also, that they sought publicity, and regarded it as proof of great
piety.

[Matthew 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 6:6</span></span>

Enter into thy closet - Every Jewish house had a place for secret
devotion. The roofs of their houses were flat places, well adapted for
walking, conversation, and meditation. See the notes at [Mat
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md). Professor Hackett ("Illustrations
of Scripture," p. 82) says: "On the roof of the house in which I lodged
at Damascus were chambers and rooms along the side and at the corners of
the open space or terrace, which constitutes often a sort of upper
story. I observed the same thing in connection with other houses." Over
the porch, or entrance of the house, there was frequently a small room
of the size of the porch, raised a story above the rest of the house,
expressly appropriated for the place of retirement. Here, in secrecy and
solitude, the pious Jew might offer his prayers, unseen by any but the
Searcher of hearts. To this place, or to some similar place, our Saviour
directed his disciples to repair when they wished to hold communion with
God. This is the place commonly mentioned in the New Testament as the
"upper room," or the place for secret prayer.

The meaning of the Saviour is, that there should be some place where we
may be in secret - where we may be alone with God. There should be some
"place" to which we may resort where no ear will hear us but "His" ear,
and no eye can see us but His eye. Unless there is such a place, secret
prayer will not be long or strictly maintained. It is often said that we
have no such place, and can secure none. We are away from home; we are
traveling; we are among strangers; we are in stages and steamboats, and
how can we find such places of retirement? I answer, the desire to pray,
and the love of prayer, will create such places in abundance. The
Saviour had all the difficulties which we can have, but yet he lived in
the practice of secret prayer. To be alone, he rose up "a great while
before day," and went into a solitary place and prayed, [Mar
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035.md). With him a grove, a mountain, a
garden, furnished such a place, and, though a traveler, and among
strangers, and without a house, he lived in the habit of secret prayer.
What excuse can they have for not praying who have a home, and who spend
the precious hours of the morning in sleep, and who will practice no
self-denial that they may be alone with God? O Christian! thy Saviour
would have broken in upon these hours, and would have trod his solitary
way to the mountain or the grove that he might pray. He did do it. He
did it to pray for thee, too indolent and too unconcerned about thy own
salvation and that of the world to practice the least self-denial in
order to commune with God! How can religion live thus? How can such a
soul be saved?

The Saviour does not specify the times when we should pray in secret. He
does not say how often it should be done. The reasons may have been:

\(1\) that he designed that his religion should be "voluntary," and
there is not a better "test" of true piety than a disposition to engage
often in secret prayer. He intended to leave it to his people to show
attachment to him by coming to God often, and as often as they chose.

\(2\) an attempt to specify the times when this should be done would
tend to make religion formal and heartless. Mohammed undertook to
regulate this, and the consequence is a cold and formal prostration at
the appointed hours of prayer all over the land where his religion has
spread.

\(3\) the periods are so numerous, and the seasons for secret prayer
vary so much, that it would nor be easy to fix rules when this should be
done.

Yet without giving rules, where the Saviour has given none, we may
suggest the following as times when secret prayer is proper:

1\. In the morning. Nothing can be more appropriate when we have been
preserved through the night, and when we are about to enter upon the
duties and dangers of another day, than to render to our great Preserver
thanks, and to commit ourselves to His fatherly care.

2\. In the evening. When the day has closed, what would be more natural
than to offer thanksgiving for the mercies of the day, and to implore
forgiveness for what we have said or done amiss? And when about to lie
down again to sleep, not knowing but it may be our last sleep and that
we may awake in eternity, what more proper than to commend ourselves to
the care of Him "who never slumbers nor sleeps?"

3\. We should pray in times of embarrassment and perplexity. Such times
occur in every man's life, and it is then a privilege and a duty to go
to God and seek his direction. In the most difficult and embarrassed
time of the American Revolution, Washington was seen to retire to a
grove in the vicinity of the camp at Valley Forge. Curiosity led a man
to observe him, and the father of his country was seen on his knees
supplicating the God of hosts in prayer. Who can tell how much the
liberty of this nation is owing to the answer to the secret prayer of
Washington?

4\. We should pray when we are beset with strong temptations. So the
Saviour prayed in the garden of Gethsemane (compare [Heb
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md), and so we should pray when we
are tempted.

5\. We should pray when the Spirit prompts us to pray; when we feel lust
like praying; when nothing can satisfy the soul but prayer. Such times
occur in the life of every Christian, (and they are "spring-times" of
piety - favorable gales to waft us on to heaven. Prayer to the
Christian, at such times, is just as congenial as conversation with a
friend when the bosom is filled with love; as the society of father,
mother, sister, child is, when the heart glows with attachment; as the
strains of sweet music are to the ear best attuned to the love of
harmony; as the most exquisite poetry is to the heart enamored with the
muses; and as the most delicious banquet is to the hungry.

Prayer, then, is the element of being - the breath the vital air; and,
then, the Christian must and should pray. He is the most eminent
Christian who is most favored with such strong emotions urging him to
prayer. The heart is then full; the soul is tender; the sun of glory
shines with unusual splendor; no cloud intervenes; the Christian rises
above the world, and pants for glory. then we may go to be alone with
God. We may enter the closet, and breathe forth our warm desires into
his ever-open ear, and He who sees in secret will reward us openly.

In secret - Who is unseen.

Who seeth in secret - Who sees what the human eye cannot see; who sees
the real designs and desires of the heart. Prayer should always be
offered, remembering that God is acquainted with our real desires; and
that it is those real desires, and not the words of prayer, that he will
answer.

[Matthew 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 6:7</span></span>

Use not vain repetitions - The original word here is supposed to be
derived from the name of a Greek poet, who made long and weary verses,
declaring by many forms and endless repetitions the same sentiment.
Hence, it means to repeat a thing often; to say the same thing in
different words, or to repeat the same words, as though God did not hear
at first. An example of this we have in [Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md); "They called on Baal from
morning until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us!" It may serve to illustrate
this passage, and to show how true is the description here of prevailing
modes of prayer, to refer to the forms and modes of devotion still
practiced in Palestine by the Muslims. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the
Book") gives the following description of what actually occurs: "See
those men on that elevated terrace. One has spread his cloak, other
their Persian rugs toward the south. They are Muslims, preparing to say
prayers - rather perform them, in this most public place, and in the
midst of all this noise and confusion.

"Let us stop and watch the ceremony as it goes on. That man next us
raises his open hands until the thumbs touch the ears, exclaiming aloud,
"Allah-hu-akbar" - 'God is great.' After uttering mentally a few short
petitions, the hands are brought down and folded Together near the
girdle, while he recites the first chapter of the Koran, and two or
three other brief passages from the same book. And now he bends forward,
rests his hands upon his knees, and repeats three times a formula of
praise to 'God most great.' Then, standing erect, he cries
"Allah-hu-akbar," as at the beginning. Then see him drop upon his knees,
and bend forward until his nose and forehead touch the ground directly
between his expanded hands. This he repeats three times, muttering all
the while the same short formulas of prayer and praise. The next move
will bring him to his knees, and then, settling back upon his heels, he
will mumble over various small petitions, with sundry grunts and
exclamations, according to taste and habit. He has now gone through one
regular Rek'ah; and, standing up as at the first, and on exactly the
same spot, he will perform a second, and even a third, if specially
devout, with precisely the same genuflections.

"They are obliged to repeat some expressions thirty times, others many
hundred times. Would that these remarks did not apply to nominal
Christians in this land as well as to Muslims!"

The heathen do - The original word is that which is commonly translated
"Gentile." The world was divided into two parts, the Jews and the
Gentiles; that is, in the original, the "nations," the nations destitute
of the true religion. Christ does not fix the length of our prayers. He
says that we should not repeat the same thing, as though God did not
hear; and it is not improbable that he intended to condemn the practice
of long prayers. His own supplications were remarkably short.

[Matthew 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 6:9</span></span>

This passage contains the Lord's prayer, a composition unequalled for
comprehensiveness and for beauty. It is supposed that some of these
petitions were taken from those in common use among the Jews. Indeed
some of them are still to be found in Jewish writings, but they did not
exist in this beautiful combination. This prayer is given as a "model."
It is designed to express the "manner" in which we are to pray,
evidently not the precise words or petitions which we are to use. The
substance of the prayer is recorded by Luke, [Luk
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002.md). In Luke, however, it varies
from the form given in Matthew, showing that he intended not to
prescribe this as a form of prayer to be used always, but to express the
substance of our petitions, or to show what petitions it would be proper
to present to God. That he did not intend to prescribe this as a form to
be invariably used is further evident from the fact that there is no
proof that either he or his disciples ever used exactly this form of
prayer, but clear evidence that they prayed often in other language. See
[Mat 26:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md), [Mat
26:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#044.md); [Luk
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md); John 17; [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md).

[Mat 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md)

Our Father - God is called a Father,

1\. as he is the Creator and the Great Parent of all;

2\. the Preserver of the human family and the Provider for their wants,
[Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md); [Mat
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032.md);

3\. in a special sense he is the Father of those who are adopted into
his family; who put confidence in him; who are the true followers of
Christ, and made heirs of life, [Rom
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md).

Hallowed be thy name - The word "hallowed" means to render or pronounce
holy. God's name is essentially holy; and the meaning of this petition
is, "Let thy name be celebrated, venerated, and esteemed as holy
everywhere, and receive from all people proper honor." It is thus the
expression of a wish or desire, on the part of the worshipper, that the
name of God, or that God himself, should be held everywhere in proper
veneration.

[Mat 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#010.md)

Thy kingdom come - The word "kingdom" here means "reign." Note, [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). The petition is the expression of
a wish that God may "reign" everywhere; that his laws may be obeyed; and
especially that the gospel of Christ may be advanced everywhere, until
the world shall be filled with his glory.

Thy will be done - The will of God is, that people should obey his law,
and be holy. The word "will," here, has reference to his law, and to
what would be "acceptable" to him. To pray, then, that his will may be
done, on earth as in heaven, is to pray that his "law," his "revealed
will," may be obeyed and loved. His law is perfectly obeyed in heaven,
and his true children most ardently desire and pray that it may also be
obeyed on the earth.

The object of these three "first" petitions, is, that God's name should
be glorified and his kingdom established; and by being placed first, we
learn that his glory and kingdom are of more consequence than our wants,
and that these should be first in our hearts and petitions before a
throne of grace.

[Mat 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011.md)

Give us this day ... - The word "bread," here, denotes doubtless
everything necessary to sustain life. See the notes at [Mat
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md). Compare [Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md). This petition implies our
dependence on God for the supply of our wants. As we are dependent on
him one day as much as another, it was evidently the intention of the
Saviour that prayer should be offered every day. The petition, moreover,
is expressed in the plural number - give us - and it is evidently
therefore, intended to be used by more than one, or by some community of
people. No community or congregation can meet every day for worship but
families. It is therefore evident that this prayer contains a strong
implied command for daily family prayer. It can nowhere else be used so
as fully to come up to the meaning of the original intention; and
nowhere else can it be breathed forth with so much propriety and beauty
as from the lips of a father, the venerable priest of his household, and
the pleader with God for those rich blessings which a parental bosom
desires on his beloved offspring.

[Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md)

And forgive us our debts ... - The word "debts" is used here
figuratively.

It does not mean "literally" that we are "debtors to God," but that our
sins have a resemblance to debts. Debtors are those who are bound to
others for some claim in commercial transactions; for something which we
have had, and for which we are bound to pay according to contract.
"Literally" there can be no such transaction between God and us. It must
be used figuratively. We have not met the claims of law. We have
violated its obligations. We are exposed to its penalty. We are guilty,
and God only can forgive, in the same way as none but a "creditor" can
forgive a debtor. The word "debts" here, therefore, means "sins," or
offences against God - offences which none but God can forgive. In the
parallel place in [Luk 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004.md), the word
sins is used. The measure by which we may expect forgiveness is that
which we use in reference to others See [Psa
18:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md); [Mat
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023.md); [Mar
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#026.md); [Luk
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004.md).

This is the invariable rule by which God dispenses pardon He that comes
before him unwilling to forgive, harboring dark and revengeful thoughts,
how can he expect that God will show him that mercy which he is
unwilling to show to others? It is not, however, required that we should
forgive "debts" in a pecuniary sense. To them we have a right, though
they should not be pushed with an overbearing and oppressive spirit; not
so as to sacrifice the feelings of mercy in order to secure the claims
of justice. No one has a right to oppress; and when a debt cannot be
paid, or when it would greatly distress a debtor's wife and children, or
a widow and an orphan, or when calamity has put it out of the power of
an honest man to pay the debt, the spirit of Christianity requires that
it should be forgiven. To such cases this petition in the Lord's prayer
doubtless extends. But it was probably intended to refer principally to
injuries of character or person which we have received from others. If
we cannot from the heart forgive them, we have the assurance that God
will never forgive us.

[Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md)

And lead us not into temptation - A petition similar to this is offered
by David, [Psa 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md); "Incline not my
heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with the workers of
iniquity." God tempts no man. See [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md). This phrase, then, must be used
in the sense of "permitting." Do not "suffer" us, or "permit" us, to be
tempted to sin. In this it is implied that God has such control over the
tempter as to save us from his power if we call upon him. The word
"temptation," however (see the note at [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001).md), means sometimes "trial,
affliction," anything that "tests" our virtue. If this be the meaning
here, as it may be, then the import of the prayer is, "Do not afflict or
try us." It is not wrong to pray that we may be saved from suffering if
it be the will of God. See [Luk 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042.md).

Deliver us from evil - The original in this place has the article -
deliver us from the evil - that is, as has been supposed, the Evil One,
or Satan. He is elsewhere called, by way of eminence, the "Evil One,"
[Mat 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md); [Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md). The meaning here is, "deliver us
from his power, his snares, his arts, his temptations." He is supposed
to be the great parent of evil, and to be delivered from him is to be
safe. Or it may mean, "deliver us from the various evils and trials
which beset us, the heavy and oppressive calamities into which we are
continually liable to fall."

Thine is the kingdom - That is, thine is the reign or dominion. Thou
hast control over all these things, and canst so order them as to answer
these petitions.

Thine is the power - Thou hast power to accomplish what we ask. We are
weak, and cannot do it; but thou art Almighty, and all things are
possible with thee.

Thine is the glory - That is, thine is the honor or praise. Not for "our
honor," but that thy glory, thy goodness, may be displayed in providing
for our wants; thy power exerted in defending us; thy praise be
celebrated by causing thy kingdom to spread through the earth.

This "doxology," or ascription of praise, is connected with the prayer
by the word "for," to signify that all these things - the reign, power,
and glory of God - will be manifested by granting these petitions. It is
not because we are to be benefited, but that God's name and perfections
may be manifested. His glory is, then, the first and principal thing
which we are to seek when we approach him. We are to suffer our concerns
to be lost sight of in the superior glory and honor of his name and
dominion. We are to seek temporal and eternal life chiefly because the
honor of our Maker will be promoted, and his name be more illustriously
displayed to his creatures. He is to be "first, last, supremest, best,"
in our view; and all selfish and worldly views are to be absorbed in
that one great desire of the soul that God may be "all in all."
Approaching him with these feelings, our prayers will be answered; our
devotions will ascend like incense, and the lifting up our hands will be
like the evening sacrifice.

Amen - This is a word of Hebrew origin, from a verb signifying "to be
firm, secure, to be true and faithful." It is a word expressing consent
or strong approbation; a word of strong asseveration. It means "verily,
certainly, so be it." It is probable that this word was used by the
people in the synagogue to signify their assent to the prayer that was
uttered by the minister, and, to some extent, it was probably so used in
the Christian Church. See [Co1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md).

It may be proper to remark that this doxology, "for thine is the
kingdom," etc., is missing in many manuscripts, and that its
authenticity is doubtful.

[Matthew 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 6:14</span></span>

For if ye forgive men their trespasses - If ye forgive others when they
offend or injure you.

Your heavenly Father will also forgive you - This is constantly required
in the Bible. See the notes at [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md). Our Saviour says we should
forgive even if the offence be committed seventy times seven times, [Mat
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#022.md). By this is meant, that when a
man asks forgiveness, we are cordially and forever to pardon the
offence; we are to declare our willingness to forgive him. If he does
not ask forgiveness, yet we are still to treat him kindly; not to harbor
malice, not to speak ill of him, to be ready to do him good, and be
always prepared to declare him forgiven when he asks it, and if we are
not ready and willing to forgive him; we are assured that God will not
forgive us.

[Matthew 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 6:16</span></span>

Moreover, when ye fast - The word "fast" literally signifies to abstain
from food and drink, whether from necessity or as a religious
observance. It is, however, commonly applied in the Bible to the latter.
It is, then, an expression of grief or sorrow. Such is the constitution
of the body, that in a time of grief or sorrow we are not disposed to
eat; or, we have no appetite. The grief of the "soul" is so absorbing as
to destroy the natural appetites of the "body." People in deep
affliction eat little, and often pine away and fall into sickness,
because the body refuses, on account of the deep sorrow of the mind, to
discharge the functions of health. "Fasting, then, is the natural
expression of grief." It is not arbitrary; it is what every person in
sorrow naturally does. This is the foundation of its being applied to
religion as a sacred rite. It is because the soul, when oppressed and
burdened by a sense of sin, is so filled with grief that the body
refuses food. It is, therefore, appropriate to scenes of penitence, of
godly sorrow, of suffering, and to those facts connected with religion
which are suited to produce grief, as the prevalence of iniquity, or
some dark impending calamity, or storm, or tempest, pestilence, plague,
or famine. It is also useful to humble us, to bring us to reflection, to
direct the thoughts away from the allurements of this world to the bliss
of a better. It is not acceptable except it be the "real expression," of
sorrow; the natural effect of the feeling that we are burdened with
crime.

The Jews fasted often. They had four "annual" fasts in commemoration of
the capture of Jerusalem [Jer 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md), of
the burning of the temple [Zac 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md), of
the death of Gedaliah [Jer 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#004.md), and
of the commencement of the attack on Jerusalem [Zac
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019.md). In addition to these, they had a
multitude of occasional fasts. It was customary, also, for the Pharisees
to fast twice a week, [Luk 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012.md).

Of a sad countenance - That is, sour, morose; with assumed expressions
of unfelt sorrow.

They disfigure their faces - That is, they do not anoint and wash
themselves as usual: they are uncombed, filthy, squalid, and haggard. It
is said that they were often in the habit of throwing ashes on their
heads and faces; and this, mixing with their tears, served still further
to disfigure their faces. So much pains will people take, and so much
suffering will they undergo, and so much that is ridiculous will they
assume, to impose on God and people. But they deceive neither. God sees
through the flimsy veil. Human eyes can pierce a disguise so thin.
Hypocrites overact their part. Not having the genuine principles of
piety at heart, they know not what is its proper expression, and hence
they appear supremely contemptible and abominable. Never should people
exhibit outwardly more than they feel; and never should they attempt to
exhibit anything for the mere sake of ostentation.

They have their reward - They have all that they desired - the praise of
men and "the pleasure of ostentation." See the notes at [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002.md).

[Matthew 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 6:17</span></span>

But thou when thou fastest, anoint ... - That is, appear as you do
daily. Do not assume any new appearance, or change your visage or dress.
The Jews and all neighboring nations were much in the habit of washing
and anointing their bodies. This washing was performed at every meal;
and where it could be effected, the head, or other parts of the body,
was daily anointed with sweet or olive oil. In a warm climate, exposed
to the great heat of the sun, this practice conduced much to health,
preserved the skin smooth and tender, and afforded a most grateful
sensation and odor. See [Mar 7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md);
[Jam 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md); [Mar
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013.md); [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003.md).

The meaning of this whole commandment is, when you regard it to be your
duty to fast, do it as a thing expressing deep feeling or sorrow for
sin, not by assuming unfelt gravity and moroseness, but in your ordinary
dress and appearance; not to attract attention, but as an expression of
feeling toward God, and he will approve and reward it.

[Matthew 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 6:19</span></span>

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth - Treasures, or wealth,
among the ancients, consisted in clothes or changes of raiment, as well
as in gold, silver, gems, wine, lands, and oil. It meant an abundance of
"anything" that was held to be conducive to the ornament or comfort of
life. As the Orientals delighted much in display, in splendid equipage,
and costly garments, their treasures, in fact, consisted much in
beautiful and richly-ornamented articles of apparel. See [Gen
45:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#022.md), where Joseph gave to his
brethren "changes of raiment;" [Jos
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021.md), where Achan coveted and secreted
"a goodly Babylonian garment." Compare also [Jdg
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md). This fact will account for the
use of the word "moth." When we speak of "wealth," we think at once of
gold, and silver, and lands, and houses. When a Hebrew or an Orientalist
spoke of wealth, he thought first of what would make a "display;" and
included, as an essential part, splendid articles of dress. The "moth"
is a small insect that finds its way to clothes and garments, and
destroys them. The "moth" would destroy their apparel, the "rust" their
silver and gold; thus all their treasure would waste away. The word
rendered "rust" signifies anything which "eats into," and hence,
anything which would consume one's property, and may have a wider
signification than mere rust.

And where thieves break through and steal - The houses in the East were
not unfrequently made of clay hardened in the sun, or of loose stones,
and hence it was comparatively easy, as it was not uncommon, for thieves
to "dig through" the wall, and effect an entrance in that way. See the
notes at [Job 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#016.md).

[Matthew 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 6:20</span></span>

Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven - That is, have provision made
for your eternal felicity. Do not exhaust your strength and spend your
days in providing for the life here, but let your chief anxiety be to be
prepared for eternity. Compare the notes at [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md). In heaven nothing corrupts;
nothing terminates; no enemies plunder or destroy. To have treasure in
heaven is to possess evidence that its purity and joys will be ours. It
is to be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, to an inheritance
incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). The heart, or affections, will of
course be fixed on the treasure. To regulate the heart, it is therefore
important that the treasure, or object of attachment, should be right.

[Matthew 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 6:22</span></span>

The light of the body ... - The sentiment stated in the preceding verses
- the duty of fixing the affections on heavenly things - Jesus proceeds
to illustrate by a reference to the "eye." When the eye is directed
steadily toward an object, and is in health, or is single, everything is
clear and plain. If it vibrates, flies to different objects, is fixed on
no one singly, or is diseased, nothing is seen clearly. Everything is
dim and confused. The man, therefore, is unsteady. The eye regulates the
motion of the body. To have an object distinctly in view is necessary in
order to correct and regulate action. Rope-dancers, that they may steady
themselves, fix the eye on some object on the wall, and look steadily at
that. If they should look down on the rope or the people, they might
become dizzy and fall. A man crossing a stream on a log, if he will look
across at some object steadily, will be in little danger. If he looks
down on the dashing and rolling waters, he will become dizzy, and fall.
So Jesus says, in order that the conduct may be right, it is important
to fix the affections on heaven. Having the affections there - having
the eye of faith single, steady, unwavering - all the conduct will be
correspondent.

Single - Steady, directed to one object. Not confused, as persons' eyes
are when they see double.

Thy body shall be full of light - Your conduct will be regular and
steady. All that is needful to direct the body is that the eye be fixed
right. No other light is required. So all that is needful to direct the
soul and the conduct is, that the eye of faith be fixed on heaven; that
the affections be there.

If, therefore, the light that is in thee ... - The word "light," here,
signifies "the mind," or principles of the soul. If this is dark, how
great is that darkness! The meaning of this passage may be thus
expressed: The light of the body, the guide and director, is the eye.
All know how calamitous it is when that light is irregular or
extinguished, as when the eye is diseased or lost. So the light that is
in us is the soul. If that soul is debased by attending exclusively to
earthly objects - if it is diseased, and not fixed on heaven how much
darker and more dreadful will it be than any darkness of the eye!
Avarice darkens the mind, obscures the view, and brings in a dreadful
and gloomy night over all the faculties.

[Matthew 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 6:24</span></span>

No man can serve two masters ... - Christ proceeds to illustrate the
necessity of laying up treasures in heaven from a well-known fact, that
a servant cannot serve two masters at the same time. His affections and
obedience would be divided, and he would fail altogether in his duty to
one or the other. One he would love, the other he would hate. To the
interests of the one he would adhere, the interests of the other he
would neglect. This is a law of human nature. The supreme affections can
be fixed on only one object. So, says Jesus, the servant of God cannot
at the same time obey him. and be avaricious, or seek treasures
supremely on earth. One interferes with the other, and one or the other
will be, and must be, surrendered.

Mammon - Mammon is a Syriac word, a name given to an idol worshipped as
the god of riches. It has the same meaning as Plutus among the Greeks.
It is not known that the Jews ever formally worshipped this idol, but
they used the word to denote wealth. The meaning is, ye cannot serve the
true God, and at the same time be supremely engaged in obtaining the
riches of this world. One must interfere with the other. See [Luk
16:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009.md).

[Matthew 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 6:25</span></span>

Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought ... - The general design of
this paragraph, which closes the chapter, is to warn his disciples
against avarice, and, at the same time, against anxiety about the supply
of their needs. This he does by four arguments or considerations,
expressing by unequalled beauty and force the duty of depending for the
things which we need on the providence of God. The "first" is stated in
[Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md); "Is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment?" In the beginning of the verse he
charged his disciples to take "no thought" - that is, not to be
"anxious" about the supply of their wants. In illustration of this he
says that God has given "life," a far greater blessing than "meat;" that
he has created the body, of far more consequence than raiment. Shall not
he who has conferred the "greater" blessing be willing to confer the
"less?" Shall not he who has formed the body so curiously, and made in
its formation such a display of power and goodness, see that it is
properly protected and clothed? He who has displayed "so great" goodness
as to form the body, and breathe into it the breath of life, will surely
"follow up" the blessing, and confer the "smaller" favor of providing
that that body shall be clothed, and that life preserved.

No thought - The word "thought," when the Bible was translated, meant
"anxiety," and is so used frequently in Old English authors. Thus, Bacon
says, "Haweis died with 'thought' and anguish before his business came
to an end." As such it is used here by our translators, and it answers
exactly to the meaning of the original. Like many other words, it has
since somewhat changed its signification, and would convey to most
readers an improper idea. The word "anxiety" would now exactly express
the sense, and is precisely the thing against which the Saviour would
guard us. See [Luk 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014.md); [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md); [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md). "Thought" about the future is
right; "anxiety, solicitude, trouble" is wrong. There is a degree of
"thinking" about the things of this life which is proper. See [Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md); [Th2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010.md); [Rom
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011.md). But it should not be our
supreme concern; it should not lead to anxiety; it should not take time
that ought to be devoted to religion.

For your life - For what will "support" your life.

Meat - This word here means "food" in general, as it does commonly in
the Bible. We confine it now to animal food. When the Bible was
translated, it denoted all kinds of food, and is so used in the old
English writers. It is one of the words which has changed its meaning
since the translation of the Bible was made.

Raiment - Clothing.

[Matthew 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 6:26</span></span>

Behold the fowls of the air - The second argument for confidence in the
providence of God is derived from a beautiful reference to the fowls or
feathered tribes. See, said the Saviour, see the fowls of the air: they
have no anxiety about the supply of their wants; they do not sow or
reap; they fill the grove with music, and meet the coming light of the
morning with their songs, and pour their notes on the zephyrs of the
evening, unanxious about the supply of their needs; yet how few die with
hunger! How regularly are they fed from the hand of God! How he
ministers to their unnumbered wants! How cheerfully and regularly are
their necessities supplied! You, said the Saviour to his disciples, you
are of more consequence than they are; and shall God feed them in such
numbers, and suffer you to want? It cannot be. Put confidence, then, in
that Universal Parent that feeds all the fowls of the air, and do not
fear but that he will also supply your needs.

Better than they - Of more consequence. Your lives are of more
importance than theirs, and God will therefore provide for them.

[Matthew 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 6:27</span></span>

Which of you, by taking thought - The third argument is taken from their
extreme weakness and helplessness. With all your care you cannot
increase your stature a single cubit. God has ordered your height.
Beyond his appointment your powers are of no avail, and you can do
nothing. So of raiment. He, by His providence, orders and arranges the
circumstances of your life. "Beyond" that appointment of His providence,
beyond his care for you, your efforts avail nothing. Seeing, then, that
he alike orders your growth and the supply of your needs, how obvious is
the duty of depending upon him, and of beginning all your efforts,
feeling that He only can grant you the means of preserving life.

One cubit - The cubit was originally the length from the elbow to the
end of the middle finger. The cubit of the Scriptures is not far from 22
inches. Terms of "length" are often applied to life, and it is thought
by many to be so here. Thus, it is said, "Thou hast made my days as a
handbreadth" [Psa 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md); "Teach me the
measure of my days" [Psa 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004.md). In this
place it is used to denote a "small length." You cannot increase your
stature even a cubit, or in the smallest degree. Compare [Luk
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#026.md).

Stature - This word means "height." The original word, however, means
oftener "age," [Joh 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#021.md); "He is of
age;" so also [Joh 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#023.md). If this be
its meaning here, as is probable (compare Robinson, Lexicon), it denotes
that a man cannot increase the length of his life at all. The utmost
anxiety will not prolong it one hour beyond the time appointed for
death.

[Matthew 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 6:28</span></span>

Consider the lilies of the field - The fourth consideration is taken
from the care which God bestows on lilies. Watch the growing of the
lily. It toils not, and it spins not; yet night and day it grows. With a
beauty with which the most splendid monarch of the East was never
adorned. it expands its blossom and fills the air with fragrance. Yet
this beauty is of short continuance. Soon it will fade, and the
beautiful flower will be cut down and burned. God "so little" regards
the bestowment of beauty and ornament as to give the highest adorning to
this which is soon to perish. When He thus clothes a lily - a fair
flower, soon to perish - will he be unmindful of his children? Shall
they dear to His heart and imbued with immortality - lack that which is
proper for them, and shall they in vain trust the God that decks the
lily of the valley?

Even Solomon in all his glory ... - The common dress of Eastern kings
was purple, but they sometimes wore white robes. See [Est
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015.md); [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md). It is to this that Christ refers.
Solomon, says he, the richest and most magnificent king of Israel, was
not clothed in a robe of "so pure a white" as the lily that grows wild
in the field.

[Matthew 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 6:30</span></span>

Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field - What grows up in
the field, or grows wild and without culture. The word "grass," applied
here to the lily, denotes merely that it is a vegetable production, or
that it is among the things which grow wild, and which are used for
fuel.

Which today is - It lives today, or it lives for a day. It is
short-lived, and seems to be a thing of no value, and is so treated.

Is cast into the oven - The Jews had different modes of baking. In early
times they frequently baked in the sand, warmed with the heat of the
sun. They constructed, also, movable ovens made of clay, brick, or
plates of iron. But the most common kind, and the one here probably
referred to, was made by excavating the ground 2 1/2 feet in diameter,
and from 5 to 6 feet deep. This kind of oven still exists in Persia. The
bottom was paved with stones. It was heated by putting wood or dry grass
into the oven, and, when heated, the ashes were removed and the bread
was placed on the heated stones. Frequently, however, the oven was an
earthen vessel without a bottom, about 3 feet high, smeared outside and
inside with clay, and placed upon a frame or support. Fire was made
within or below it. When the sides were sufficiently heated, thin
patches of dough were spread on the inside, and the top was covered,
without removing the fire as in the other cases, and the bread was
quickly baked.

[Matthew 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 6:32</span></span>

For after all these things do the Gentiles seek - That is, those
destitute of the true doctrines of religion, and unacquainted with
proper dependence on Divine Providence, make it their chief anxiety thus
to seek food and clothing. But you, who have a knowledge of your Father
in heaven; who know that He will provide for your needs, should not be
anxious. Seek first His kingdom; seek first to be righteous, and to
become interested in His favor, and all necessary things will be added
to you. He has control over all things, and He can give you what you
need. He will give you what he deems best for you.

[Matthew 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 6:34</span></span>

Take therefore no thought ... - That is, no anxiety. Commit your way to
God. The evil, the trouble, the anxiety of each day as it comes, is
sufficient without perplexing the mind with restless cares about another
day. It is wholly uncertain whether you live to see another day. If you
do, it will bring its own trouble, and it will also bring the proper
supply of your needs. God will be the same Father then as today, and
will make then, as he does now, proper provision for your wants.

The morrow shall take thought - The morrow will have anxieties and cares
of its own, but it will also bring the proper provision for those cares.
Though you will have needs, yet God will provide for them as they occur.
Do not, therefore, increase the cares of today by borrowing trouble from
the future. Do your duty faithfully now, and depend upon the mercy of
God and his divine help for the troubles which are yet to come.

Remarks On Matthew 6

1\. Christ has here forcibly taught the necessity of charity, of prayer,
and of all religious duties.

2\. We see the necessity of sincerity and honesty in our religious
duties. They are not to be done to be seen by people. If they are, they
cannot be performed acceptably. God looks upon the heart, nor is it
possible to deceive Him. And of what avail is it to deceive people? How
poor and pitiable is the reward of a hypocrite! How contemptible the
praise of people when God is displeased! How awful will be the condition
of such a one beyond the grave!

3\. Christ has here, in a particular manner, urged the duty of prayer.
He has given a model for prayer. Nothing can equal this composition in
simplicity, beauty, and comprehensiveness. At the same time that it is
so simple that it can be understood by a child, it contains the
expression of all the needs of man at any age and in every rank of life.

The duty of prayer is urged by every consideration. None but God can
provide for us; none but He can forgave, and guide, and support us; none
but He can bring us into heaven. He is always ready to hear us. The
humble He sends not empty away. Those who ask receive, and they who seek
find. How natural and proper, then, is prayer! How strange that any man
can live, and not pour out his desires to God! How strange that anyone
is willing to go to eternity with this sad reflection: "I have gone
through this world, spent my probation, wasted my strength, and am
dying, and have never prayed!" How awful will be the reflection of the
soul through all eternity: "I was offered eternal life, but I never
asked for it. I lived from day to day and from year to year in God's
world, breathed His air, rioted on His beneficence, forgot His goodness,
and never once asked Him to save my soul!" Who will be to blame if the
prayerless soul is lost?

Secret and family prayer should be daily. We daily have the same
necessities, are exposed to the same dangers, tread upon the borders of
the same heaven or hell. How should the voice of praise and prayer go up
as incense in the morning, and rise as a rich perfume in the shades of
each evening! What more lovely object on earth is there than that of one
in the bloom of health and the dew of youth, bending with reverence
before the King of heaven, seeking forgiveness, peace, guidance, and
salvation! And what a strange, misguided, and piteous object is a soul
that never prays!

4\. Forgiveness is essential in prayer. If we come to God harboring
malice and unwilling to forgive, we have his solemn assurance that we
shall not be ourselves forgiven.

5\. "Avarice" is alike foolish and an insult to God, [Mat
6:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md). It is the parent of many
foolish and hurtful lusts. It alienates the affections from God produces
envy of another's prosperity; leads to fraud, deception, and crime to
obtain wealth, and degrades the soul. Man is formed for nobler pursuits
than the mere desire to be rich. He lives for eternity, where silver
will not be needed and where gold will be of no value. That eternity is
near; and though we have wealth like Solomon, and though we be adorned
as the lily, yet like Solomon we must soon die, and like the lily our
beauty will soon fade. Death will lay us alike low; the rich and the
poor will sleep together; and the worm will feed no more sweetly on the
unfed and unclothed son of poverty, than on the man clothed in fine
linen, and the daughter of beauty and pride. As avarice is moreover the
parent of discontent, he only that is contented with the allotments of
Providence, and is not restless for a change, is happy. After all, this
is the true source of enjoyment. Anxiety and care, perplexity and
disappointment, find their way more readily to the mansions of the rich
than to the cottages of the poor. It is the mind, not mansions, and
gold, and adorning, that gives ease; and he that is content with his
situation will "smile upon his stool, while Alexander weeps upon the
throne of the world."

6\. We see how comparatively valueless is "beauty." How little it is
regarded by God! He gives it to the lily, and in a day it fades and is
gone. He gives it to the wings of the butterfly, and soon it dies and
its beauty is forgotten. He gives it to the flowers of the spring, soon
to fall; to the leaves of the forest, soon to grow yellow and decay in
the autumn. How many lilies and roses does he cause to blossom in
solitude where no man is, where they "waste their sweetness on the
desert air!" How many streams ripple in the wilderness, and how many
cataracts age after age, have poured their thunders on the air, unheard
and unseen by mortals! So little does God think of beauty. So the human
form and "face divine." How soon is all that beauty marred; and, as in
the lily, how soon is its last trace obliterated! In the cold grave,
among the undistinguished multitudes of the dead, who can tell which of
all the mouldering host was blessed with a "lovely set of features or
complexion?" Alas, all has faded like the morning flower. How vain,
then, to set the affections on so frail a treasure!

7\. We see the duty and privilege of depending for our daily needs on
the bounties of Providence. Satisfied with the troubles of today, let us
not add to those troubles by anxieties about tomorrow. The pagan, and
they who know not God, will be anxious about the future; but they who
know him, and have caught the spirit of Jesus, may surely trust him for
the supply of their wants. The young lions do roar, and seek their meat
at the hand of God, [Psa 104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md). The
fowls of heaven are daily supplied. Shall man only, of all the creatures
on earth, vex himself and be filled with anxious cares about the future?
Rather, like the rest of the creation, let us depend on the aid of the
universal Parent, and feel that he who hears the young ravens which cry
will also supply our necessities.

8\. Especially is the remark just made of value in reference to those in
early life. Life is a stormy ocean. Over that ocean no being presides
but God. He holds the winds in his hands, and can still their howlings,
and calm the heaving billows. On that ocean the young have just launched
their frail bark. Daily they will need protection; daily will they need
supplies; daily will they be in danger, and exposed to the rolling of
the billows that may ingulf them forever. Ignorant, inexperienced, and
in danger, how should they look to God to guide and aid them! Instead of
vexing themselves with anxious cares about the future, how should they
place humble reliance on God! Safe in His hand, we shall outride the
storm and come to a haven of peace. he will supply our wants if we trust
him, as he does those of the songsters of the grove. He will be the
guide of our youth and the strength of our manhood. If we seek Him, He
will be found of us; if we forsake Him, He will cast us off forever,
[Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md).

9\. From all this, how manifest is the propriety of seeking first the
kingdom of God! First in our affections, first in the objects of
pursuit, first in the feelings and associations of each morning, be the
desire and the aim for heaven. Having this, we have assurance of all
that we need. God, "our" Father, will then befriend us, and in life and
death all will be well.
