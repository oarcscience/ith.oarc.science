### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 24:0</span></span>

This prophecy [Jer 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md) is the
final outcome of what has gone before. Never perhaps has a reigning king
been addressed in such contemptuous terms. When Jeconiah was carried to
Babylon, Zedekiah, the priests, prophets, and people of Jerusalem
congratulated themselves upon being saved from such a fate: really all
that was good among them was then culled out, and placed in safety; and
they were left behind because they were not worth the taking.

[Jeremiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 24:1</span></span>

Omit "were." "Set before," i. e put in the appointed place for offerings
of firstfruits in the forecourt of the temple.

Carpenters - "Craftsmen" (see the marginal reference).

[Jeremiah 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 24:2</span></span>

Fig-trees bear three crops of figs, of which the first is regarded as a
great delicacy.

[Jeremiah 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 24:4</span></span>

The complete fulfillment of this prophecy belongs to the Christian
Church. There is a close analogy between Jeremiah at the first
destruction of Jerusalem and our Lord at the second. There the good figs
were those converts picked out by the preaching of Christ and the
Apostles; the bad figs were the mass of the people left for Titus and
the Romans to destroy.

[Jer 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md)

Acknowledge ... for their good - Specially their spiritual good. Put a
comma after Chaldaeans.

[Jer 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md)

That dwell in the land of Egypt - Neither those carried captive with
Jehoahaz into Egypt, nor those who fled there, are to share in these
blessings. The new life of the Jewish nation is to be the work only of
the exiles in Babylon.
