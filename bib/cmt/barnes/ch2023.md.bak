### [2 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 23:0</span></span>

Compare the history in Kings (the marginal reference). Both accounts
were probably drawn from a common source. The writer of Kings treated
the points of civil and historic importance, the later author of
Chronicles collected the notices of the part taken in the transactions
by the sacred order to which he probably belonged.

[2 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 23:1</span></span>

The five names do not occur in Kings; only, and incidentally, the five
divisions of the royal guard ([Kg2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 23:2</span></span>

Jehoiada was unwilling to trust the success of the revolution wholly and
entirely to the royal body-guard. Accordingly, the captains collected
from the cities of Judah a strong body of Levites and the chief of the
fathers of Israel (i. e. "Judah," see [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034) note.md) who were brought up to
Jerusalem.

[2 Chronicles 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 23:3</span></span>

By "all the congregation" here is meant the persons referred to in [Ch2
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#002.md).

[2 Chronicles 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 23:4</span></span>

The writer of Chronicles relates the orders that were given to the
Levites, the author of Kings those received by the royal body-guard
([Kg2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 23:6</span></span>

Keep the watch of the Lord - i. e. guard against any attempt that might
be made by the Baal-worshippers to force their way through the courts
into the temple.

[2 Chronicles 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 23:7</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#008.md), [Kg2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#011.md). The soldiers and the Levites in
the temple were probably intermixed in about equal proportions.

[2 Chronicles 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 23:8</span></span>

And took every man his men ... - i. e. the relief, already organized by
Jehoiada into three bodies [Ch2
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#004.md), was further strengthened by
the members of the outgoing "course," who were associated in the work to
be done.

[2 Chronicles 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 23:13</span></span>

At the entering in - i. e. at, or near, the opening from the main
chamber of the temple into the holy of holies.

[2 Chronicles 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 23:16</span></span>

Between him ... - In [Kg2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md) the
covenant is said to have been made "between the Lord," etc. To the
writer of Chronicles Jehoiada was God's representative, and received the
pledges of king and people.

[2 Chronicles 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 23:18</span></span>

The priests the Levites - Rather, with the versions, "the priests and
the Levites." It was the duty of the priests alone to offer the burnt
offerings [Num 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001.md), and of the
Levites alone to praise God with singing and music [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md); [Ch1
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 23:20</span></span>

The high gate - See [Kg2 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md) note.
