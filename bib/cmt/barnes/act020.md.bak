### [Acts Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md)

[Acts 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 20:1</span></span>

The uproar - The tumult excited, by Demetrius and the workmen. After it
had been quieted by the town-clerk, [Act
19:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md).

Embraced them - Saluted them; gave them parting expressions of kindness.
Compare the [Luk 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045.md) note; [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md) note; [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md) note; [Co2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#012.md) note; [Th1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026.md) note; [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md) note. The Syriac translates this,
"Paul caned the disciples, and consoled them, and kissed them."

To go into Macedonia - On his way to Jerusalem, agreeably to his
purpose, as recorded in [Act 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md).

[Acts 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 20:2</span></span>

Over those parts - The parts of country in and near Macedonia. He
probably went to Macedonia by Troas, where he expected to find Titus
[Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md); but, not finding him there,
he went by himself to Philippi, Thessalonica, etc., and then returned to
Greece proper.

Into Greece - Into Greece proper, of which Athens was the capital. While
in Macedonia he had great anxiety and trouble, but was at length
comforted by the coming of Titus, who brought him intelligence of the
liberal disposition of the churches of Greece in regard to the
collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, [Co2
7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md). It is probable that the Second
Epistle to the Corinthians was written during this time in Macedonia,
and sent to them by Titus.

[Acts 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 20:3</span></span>

And there abode - Why he remained here is unknown. It is probable that
while in Greece he wrote the Epistle to the Romans. Compare [Rom
15:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025.md).

And when the Jews laid wait for him - There was a design formed against
him by the Jews, which they sought to execute. Why they formed this
purpose the historian has not informed us.

As he was about to sail - It would seem from this, that the design of
the Jews was to attack the ship in which he was about to sail, or to
arrest him on shipboard. This fact determined him to take a much more
circuitous route by land, so that the churches of Macedonia were favored
with another visit from him.

Into Syria - On his way to Jerusalem.

He purposed ... - He resolved to avoid the snare which they had laid for
him, and to return by the same way in which he had come into Greece.

[Acts 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 20:4</span></span>

And there accompanied him - It was usual for some of the disciples to
attend the apostles in their journeys.

Into Asia - It is not meant that they attended him from Greece through
Macedonia, but that they went with him to Asia, having gone before him,
and joined him at Troas.

Sopater of Berea - Perhaps the same person who, in [Rom
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md), is called Sosipater, and who is
there said to have been a kinsman of Paul.

Aristarchus - [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md).

Gaius of Derbe - See the notes on [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md).

Tychicus - This man was high in the confidence and affection of Paul. In
[Eph 6:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md) he styles him "a beloved
brother, and faithful minister in the Lord."

And Trophimus - Trophimus was from Ephesus, [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md). When Paul wrote his Second
Epistle to Timothy he was at Miletum, sick, [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md).

[Acts 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 20:5</span></span>

These going before - Going before Paul and Luke. Dr. Doddridge supposes
that only Tychicus and Trophimus went before the others. Perhaps the
Greek most naturally demands this interpretation.

Tarried for us - The word "us," here, shows that Luke had again joined
Paul as his companion. In [Act 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md)
it appears that Luke was in Philippi, in the house of Lydia. Why he
remained there, or why he did not attend Paul in his journey to Athens,
Corinth, Ephesus, etc., is not known. It is evident, however, that he
here joined him again.

At Troas - See the notes on [Act 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008.md).

[Acts 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 20:6</span></span>

After the days of unleavened bread - After the seven days of the
Passover, during which they ate only unleavened bread. See Exo. 12.

In five days - They crossed the Aegean Sea. Paul, when he crossed it on
a former occasion, did it in two days [Act
16:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011.md); but the navigation of the
sea is uncertain, and they were now probably hindered by contrary winds.

[Acts 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 20:7</span></span>

And upon the first day of the week - Showing thus that this day was then
observed by Christians as holy time. Compare [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md).

To break bread - Evidently to celebrate the Lord's Supper. Compare [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md). So the Syriac understands it, by
translating it, "to break the eucharist"; that is, the eucharistic
bread. It is probable that the apostles and early Christians celebrated
the Lord's Supper on every Lord's day.

And continued his speech until midnight - The discourse of Paul
continued until the breaking of day, [Act
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md). But it was interrupted about
midnight by the accident that occurred to Eutychus. The fact that Paul
was about to leave them on the next day, probably to see them no more,
was the principal reason why his discourse was so long continued. We are
not to suppose, however, that it was one continued or set discourse. No
small part of the time might have been passed in hearing and answering
questions, though Paul was the chief speaker. The case proves that such
seasons of extraordinary devotion may, in special circumstances, be
proper. Occasions may arise where it will be proper for Christians to
spend a much longer time than usual in public worship. It is evident,
however, that such seasons do not often occur.

[Acts 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 20:8</span></span>

And there were many lights - Why this circumstance is mentioned is not
apparent. It, however, meets one of the slanders of the early enemies of
Christianity, that the Christians in their assemblies were accustomed to
extinguish all the lights, and to commit every kind of abomination.
Perhaps the mention of many lights here is designed to intimate that it
was a place of public worship, as not only the Jews, but the Gentiles
were accustomed to have many lights burning in such places.

In the upper chamber - See the notes on [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md).

[Acts 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 20:9</span></span>

And there sat in a window - The window was left open, probably to avoid
the malice of their enemies, who might be disposed otherwise to charge
them with holding their assemblies in darkness for purposes of iniquity.
The window was probably a mere opening in the wall to let in light, as
glass was not common at that time. As the shutters of the window were
not closed, there was nothing to prevent Eutychus from falling down.

The third loft - The third story.

And was taken up dead - Some have supposed that he was merely stunned
with the fall, and that he was still alive. But the obvious meaning is,
that he was actually killed by the fall, and was miraculously restored
to life. This is an instance of sleeping in public worship that has some
apology. The late hour of the night, and the length of the services,
were the excuse. But, though the thing is often done now, yet how seldom
is a sleeper in a church furnished with an excuse for it. No practice is
more shameful, disrespectful, and abominable than that so common of
sleeping in the house of God.

[Acts 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 20:10</span></span>

And fell on him ... - Probably stretching himself on him as Elisha did
on the Shunammite's son, [Kg2 4:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md).
It was an act of tenderness and compassion, evincing a strong desire to
restore him to life.

Trouble not yourselves - They would doubtless be thrown into great
consternation by such an event. Paul therefore endeavoured to compose
their minds by the assurance that he would live.

For his life is in him - He is restored to life. This has all the
appearance of having been a miracle. Life was restored to him as Paul
spoke.

[Acts 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 20:11</span></span>

Come up again - To the upper room, [Act
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008.md).

And had broken bread, and eaten - Had taken refreshment. As this is
spoken of Paul only, it is evidently distinguished from the celebration
of the Lord's Supper.

[Acts 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 20:12</span></span>

Not a little comforted - By the fact that he was alive; perhaps also
strengthened by the evidence that a miracle had been performed.

[Acts 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 20:13</span></span>

Sailed unto Assos - There were several cities of this name. One was in
Lycia; one in the territory of Eolis; one in Mysia; one in Lydia; and
another in Epirus. The latter is the one intended here. It was between
Troas and Mitylene. The distance to it from Troas by land was about 20
miles, while the voyage round Cape Lecture was nearly twice as far, and
accordingly Paul chose to go to it on foot.

Minding himself - Choosing or preferring to go on foot. Most of his
journeys were probably performed in this way.

[Acts 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 20:14</span></span>

Came to Mitylene - This was the capital of the island of Lesbos. It was
distinguished by the beauty of its situation, and the splendor and
magnificence of its edifices. The island on which it stood, Lesbos, was
one of the largest in the Aegean Sea, and the seventh in the
Mediterranean. It is a few miles distant from the coast of Aeolia, and
is about 168 miles in circumference. The name of the city now is Castro.

[Acts 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 20:15</span></span>

Over against Chios - Opposite to. Into the neighborhood of; or near to
it. Chios, called also Coos, is an island in the Archipelago, between
Lesbos and Samos. It is on the coast of Asia Minor, and is now called
Scio. It will long be remembered as the seat of a dreadful massacre of
almost all its inhabitants by the Turks in 1823.

At Samos - This was also an island of the Archipelago, lying off the
coast of Lydia, from which it is separated by a narrow strait. These
islands were celebrated among the ancients for their extraordinary
wines.

Trogyllium - This was the name of a town and promontory of Ionia in Asia
Minor, between Ephesus and the mouth of the river Meander, opposite to
Samos. The promontory is a spur of Mount Mycale.

Miletus - Called also Mileturn. It was a city and seaport, and the
ancient capital of Ionia. It was originally composed of a colony of
Cretans. It became extremely powerful, and sent out colonies to a great
number of cities on the Euxine Sea. It was distinguished for a
magnificent temple dedicated to Apollo. It is now called by the Turks
Melas. It was the birthplace of Thales, one of the seven wise men of
Greece. It was about 40 or 50 miles from Ephesus.

[Acts 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 20:16</span></span>

To sail by Ephesus - The word "by" in our translation is ambiguous. We
say to go by a place, meaning either to take it in our way and to go to
it, or to go past it. Here it means the latter. He intended to sail past
Ephesus without going to it.

For he hasted ... - Had he gone to Ephesus, he would probably have been
so delayed in his journey that he could not reach Jerusalem at the time
of Pentecost.

The day of Pentecost - See the notes on [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md).

[Acts 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 20:17</span></span>

He sent to Ephesus - Perhaps a distance of twenty or thirty miles.

The elders of the church - Who had been appointed while he was there to
take charge of the church. See the notes on [Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002.md).

[Acts 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 20:18</span></span>

And when they were come to him - The discourse which follows is one of
the most tender, affectionate, and eloquent which is anywhere to be
found. It is strikingly descriptive of the apostle's manner of life
while with them; evinces his deep concern for their welfare; is full of
tender and kind admonition; expresses the firm purpose of his soul to
live to the glory of God, and his expectation to be persecuted still;
and is a most affectionate and solemn farewell. No man can read it
without being convinced that it came from a heart full of love and
kindness; and that it evinces a great and noble purpose to be entirely
employed in one great aim and object - the promotion of the glory of
God, in the face of danger and of death.

Ye know - From your own observation. He had been with them three years,
and could make this solemn appeal to themselves that he had led a
faithful and devoted life. How happy is it when a minister can thus
appeal to those with whom he has labored in proof of his own sincerity
and fidelity! How comforting to himself, and how full of demonstration
to a surrounding world, of the truth and power of the gospel which is
preached! We may further remark that this appeal furnishes strong proof
of the purity and holiness of Paul's life. The elders at Ephesus must
have had abundant opportunity to know him. They had seen him, and heard
him publicly, and in their private dwellings. A man does not make such
an appeal unless he has a consciousness of integrity, nor unless there
is conclusive proof of his integrity. It is strong evidence of the
holiness of the character of the apostles, and proof that they were not
impostors, that they could thus appeal with the utmost assurance to
those who had every opportunity of knowing them.

From the first day - He was with them three years, [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md).

Into Asia - Asia Minor. They would probably know not only how he had
demeaned himself while with them, but also how he had conducted in other
places near them.

After what manner I have been with you - How I have lived and acted.
What has been my manner of life. What had been his mode of life he
specifies in the following verses.

At all seasons - At all times.

[Acts 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 20:19</span></span>

Serving the Lord - In the discharge of the appropriate duties of his
apostolic office, and in private life. To discharge aright our duties in
any vocation is serving the Lord. Religion is often represented in the
Bible as a service rendered to the Lord.

With all humility - Without arrogance, pride, or a spirit of dictation;
without a desire to "lord it over God's heritage"; without being elated
with the authority of the apostolic office, the variety of the miracles
which he was enabled to perform, or the success which attended his
labors. What an admirable model for all who are in the ministry; for all
who are endowed with talents and learning; for all who meet with
remarkable success in their work! The proper effect of such success, and
of such talent, will be to produce true humility. The greatest
endowments are usually connected with the most simple and childlike
humility.

And with many tears - Paul not infrequently gives evidence of the
tenderness of his heart, of his regard for the souls of people, and of
his deep solicitude for the salvation of sinners, [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md); [Phi
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md); [Co2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004.md). The particular thing, however,
here specified as producing weeping was the opposition of the Jews. But
it cannot be supposed that those tears were shed from an apprehension of
personal danger. It was rather because the opposition of the Jews
impeded his work, and retarded his progress in winning souls to Christ.
A minister of the gospel will:

\(1\) Feel, and deeply feel for the salvation of his people. He will
weep over their condition when he sees theta going astray, and in danger
of perishing. He will,

\(2\) Be specially affected with opposition, because it will retard his
work, and prevent the progress and the triumph of the gospel. It is not
because it is a personal concern, but because it is the cause of his
Master.

And temptations - Trials arising from their opposition. We use the word
"temptation" in a more limited sense, to denote inducements offered to
one to lead him into sin. The word in the Scriptures most commonly
denotes "trials" of any kind.

Which befell me - Which happened to me; which I encountered.

By the lying in wait ... - By their snares and plots against my life.
Compare [Act 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md). Those snares and
plans were designed to blast his reputation and to destroy his
usefulness.

[Acts 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 20:20</span></span>

I kept back nothing ... - No doctrine, no admonition, no labor. Whatever
he judged would promote their salvation, he faithfully and fearlessly
delivered. A minister of the gospel must be the judge of what will be
profitable to the people of his charge. His aim should be to promote
their real welfare to preach what will be profitable. His object will
not be to please their fancy, to gratify their taste, to flatter their
pride, or to promote his own popularity. "All Scripture is profitable"
[Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md); and it will be his aim to
declare that only which will tend to promote their real welfare. Even if
it be unpalatable; if it be the language of reproof and admonition; if
it be doctrine to which the heart is by nature opposed; if it run
counter to the native prejudices and passions of people; yet, by the
grace of God, it should be, and will be delivered. No doctrine that will
be profitable should be kept back; no labor that may promote the welfare
of the flock should be withheld.

But have showed you - Have announced or declared to you. The word here
used ἀναγγεῖλαι anangeilai is most commonly applied to "preaching in
public assemblies, or in a public manner."

Have taught you publicly - In the public assembly; by public preaching.

And from house to house - Though Paul preached in public, and though his
time was much occupied in manual labor for his own support [Act
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md), yet he did not esteem his
public preaching to be all that was required of him, nor his daily
occupation to be an excuse for not visiting from house to house. We may
observe here:

\(1\) That Paul's example is a warrant and an implied injunction for
family visitation by a pastor. If proper in Ephesus, it is proper still.
If practicable in that city, it is in other cities. If it was useful
there, it will be elsewhere. If it furnished to him consolation in the
retrospect when he came to look over his ministry, and if it was one of
the things which enabled him to say, "I am pure from the blood of all
men," it will be so in other cases.

\(2\) the design for which ministers should visit should be a religious
design. Paul did not visit for mere ceremony; for idle gossip, or
chit-chat; or to converse on the news or politics of the day. His aim
was to show the way of salvation, and to teach in private what he taught
in public.

\(3\) how much of this is to be done is, of course, to be left to the
discretion of every minister. Paul, in private visiting, did not neglect
public instruction. The latter he evidently considered to be his main or
chief business. His high views of preaching are evinced in his life, and
in his letters to Timothy and Titus. Yet, while public preaching is the
main, the prime, the leading business of a minister, and while his first
efforts should be directed to preparation for that, he may and should
find time to enforce his public instructions by going from house to
house; and often he will find that his most immediate and apparent
success will result from such family instructions.

\(4\) if it is his duty to visit, it is the duty of is people to receive
him as becomes an ambassador of Christ. They should be willing to listen
to his instructions; to treat him with kindness, and to aid his
endeavours in bringing a family under the influence of religion.

[Acts 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 20:21</span></span>

Testifying - Bearing witness to the necessity of repentance toward God.
Or teaching them the nature of repentance, and exhorting them to repent
and believe. Perhaps the word "testifying" includes both ideas of giving
evidence, and of urging with great earnestness and affection that
repentance and faith were necessary. See [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md); [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md); where the word used here, and
here translated "testify," is there translated correctly, "charge," in
the sense of "strongly urging, or entreating with great earnestness."

And also to the Greeks - To all who were not Jews. "The Greeks" properly
denoted "those who lived in Greece, and who spoke the Greek language."
But the phrase, "Jews and Greeks," among the Hebrews, denoted "the whole
human race." He urged the necessity of repentance and faith in all.
Religion makes no distinction, but regards all as sinners, and as
needing salvation by the blood of the Redeemer.

Repentance toward God - See the notes on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). Repentance is to be exercised
"toward God," because:

\(1\) Sin has been committed against him, and it is proper that we
express our sorrow to the Being whom we have offended; and,

\(2\) Because only God can pardon. Sincere repentance exists only where
there is a willingness to make acknowledgment to the very Being whom we
have offended or injured.

And faith - See the notes on [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md).

Toward - εἰς eis. In regard to; in; confidence in the work and merits of
the Lord Jesus. This is required, because there is no other one who can
save from sin. See the notes on [Act
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md).

[Acts 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 20:22</span></span>

Bound in the spirit - Strongly urged or constrained by the influences of
the Holy Spirit on my mind. Not by any desire to see the place where my
fathers worshipped, and not urged merely by reason, but by the
convictions and mighty promptings of the Holy Spirit to do my duty in
this case. The expression "bound in the spirit" δεδεμένος τῷ πνεύματι
dedemenos tō pneumati is one of great strength and emphasis. The word
δέω deō, "to bind," is usually applied to "confinement by cords,
fetters, or bands" [Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md); [Mat
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003.md); [Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md); and then it denotes "any strong
obligation" [Rom 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), or "anything
that strongly urges or impels," [Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md). When we are strongly urged by
the convictions of duty, by the influences of the Holy Spirit, we should
not shrink from danger or from death. Duty is to be done at all hazards.
It is ours to follow the directions of God; results we may safely and
confidently leave with him.

Not knowing the things that shall befall me there - He knew that
calamities and trials of some kind awaited him [Act
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md), but he did not know:

\(1\) Of what particular kind they would be; nor,

\(2\) Their issue, whether it would be life or death.

We should commit our way unto God, not knowing what trials may be before
us in life; but knowing that, if we are found faithful at the post of
duty, we have nothing to fear in the result.

[Acts 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 20:23</span></span>

Save that - Except that. This was all that he knew, that bonds and
afflictions were to be his portion.

The Holy Ghost witnesseth - Either by direct revelation to him, or by
the predictions of inspired men whom Paul might meet. An instance of the
latter mode occurs in [Act 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md). It
is probable that the meaning here is that the Holy Spirit had deeply
impressed the mind of Paul by his direct influences, and by his
experience in every city, that bonds and trials were to be his portion.
Such had been his experience in every city where he had preached the
gospel by the direction of the Holy Spirit, that he regarded it as his
certain portion that he was thus to be afflicted.

In every city - In almost every city where Paul had been, he had been
subjected to these trials. He had been persecuted, stoned, and scourged.
So uniform was this, so constant had been his experience in this way,
that he regarded it as his certain portion to be thus afflicted, and he
approached Jerusalem, and every other city, with a confident expectation
that such trials awaited him there.

Saying - In his experience, by direct revelation, and by the mouth of
prophets, [Act 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md). When Paul was
called to the apostleship it was predicted that he would suffer much,
[Act 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016.md).

Bonds - Chains. That I would be bound, as prisoners are who are
confined.

Abide me - See the margin. They remain or wait for me; that is, I must
expect to suffer them.

[Acts 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 20:24</span></span>

Move me - Alarm me, or deter me from my purpose. Greek: "I make an
account of none of them." I do not regard them as of any moment, or as
worth consideration in the great purpose to which I have devoted my
life.

Neither count I my life - I do not consider my life as so valuable as to
be retained by turning away from bonds and persecutions. I am certain of
bonds and afflictions; I am willing also, if it be necessary, to lay
down my life in the prosecution of the same purpose.

Dear unto myself - So precious or valuable as to be retained at the
sacrifice of duty. I am willing to sacrifice it if it be necessary. This
was the spirit of the Saviour, and of all the early Christians. Duty is
of more importance than life; and when either duty or life is to be
sacrificed, life is to be cheerfully surrendered.

So that - This is my main object, to finish my course with joy. It is
implied here:

\(1\) That this was the great purpose which Paul had in view.

\(2\) that if he should even lay down his life in this cause, it would
be a finishing his course with joy. In the faithful discharge of duty,
he had nothing to fear. Life would be ended with peace whenever God
should require him to finish his course.

Finish my course - Close my career as an apostle and a Christian. Life
is thus represented as a course, or race that is to be run, [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md); [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Act
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025.md).

With joy - With the approbation of conscience and of God, with peace in
the recollection of the past. Man should strive so to live that he will
have nothing to regret when he lies on a bed of death. It is a glorious
privilege to finish life with joy. It is most sad when the last hours
are embittered with the reflection that life has been wasted. The only
way in which life may be finished with joy is by meeting faithfully
every duty, and encountering, as Paul did, every trial, with a constant
desire to glorify God.

And the ministry - That I may fully discharge the duty of the apostolic
office, the preaching of the gospel. In [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md), he charges Timothy to make full
proof of his ministry. He here shows that this was the ruling principle
of his own life.

Which I have received of the Lord Jesus - Which the Lord Jesus has
committed to me, [Act 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md). Paul
regarded his ministry as an office entrusted to him by the Lord Jesus
himself. On this account he deemed it to be especially sacred, and of
high authority, [Gal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012.md). Every
minister has been entrusted with an office by the Lord Jesus. He is not
his own; and his great aim should be to discharge fully and entirely the
duties of that office.

To testify the gospel - To bear witness to the good news of the favor of
God. This is the great design of the ministry. It is to bear witness to
a dying world of the good news that God is merciful, and that his favor
may be made manifest to sinners. From this verse we may learn:

\(1\) That we all have a course to run, a duty to perform. Ministers
have an allotted duty; and so have men in all ranks and professions.

\(2\) we should not be deterred by danger, or the fear of death, from
the discharge of that duty. We are safe only when we are doing the will
of God. We are really in danger only when we neglect our duty, and make
the great God our enemy.

\(3\) we should so live as that the end of our course may be joy. It is,
at best, a solemn thing to die; but death may be a scene of triumph and
of joy.

\(4\) it matters little when, or where, or how we die if we die in the
discharge of our duty to God. He will order the circumstances of our
departure, and He can sustain us in the last conflict. Happy is that
life which is spent in doing the will of God, and peaceful that death
which closes a life of toil and trial in the service of the Lord Jesus.

[Acts 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 20:25</span></span>

I know that ye all - Perhaps this means simply, "I have no expectation
of seeing you again; I have every reason to suppose that this is my
final interview with you." He expected to visit Ephesus no more. The
journey to Jerusalem was dangerous. Trials and persecutions he knew
awaited him. Besides, it is evident that he designed to turn his
attention to other countries, and to visit Rome; and probably he had
already formed the purpose of going into Spain. See [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md); compare [Rom
15:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md). From all these
considerations it is evident that he had no expectation of being again
at Ephesus. It is probable, however, that he did again return to that
city. See the notes on [Act 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#031.md).

Among whom I have gone preaching - Among whom I have preached. The
parting of a minister and people is among the most tender and affecting
of the separations that occur on earth.

The kingdom of God - Making known the nature of the reign of God on
earth by the Messiah. See the notes on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

[Acts 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 20:26</span></span>

Wherefore - In view of the past, of my ministry and labors among you, I
appeal to your own selves to testify that I have been faithful.

I take you to record - Greek: I call you to witness. If any of you are
lost; if you prove unfaithful to God, I appeal to yourselves that the
fault is not mine. It is well when a minister can make this appeal, and
call his hearers to bear testimony to his own faithfulness. Ministers
who preach the gospel with fidelity may thus appeal to their hearers;
and in the day of judgment may call on themselves to witness that the
fault of the ruin of the soul is not to be charged to them.

That I am pure - I am not to be charged with the guilt of your
condemnation, as owing to my unfaithfulness. This does not mean that he
set up a claim to absolute perfection; but that, in the matter under
consideration, he had a conscience void of offence.

The blood of all men - The word "blood" is often used in the sense of
"death, of bloodshed"; and hence, of the "guilt or crime of putting one
to death," [Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md); [Mat
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025.md); [Act
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md); [Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md). It here means that if they
should die the second death; if they should be lost forever, he would
not be to blame. He had discharged his duty in faithfully warning and
teaching them; and now, if they were lost, the fault would be their own,
not his.

All men - All classes of people - Jews and Gentiles. He had warned and
instructed all alike. Ministers may have many fears that their hearers
will be lost. Their aim, however, should be:

\(1\) To save them, if possible; and,

\(2\) If they are lost, that it should be by no neglect or fault of
theirs.

[Acts 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 20:27</span></span>

For - This verse contains a reason for what had been said in the
previous verse. It shows why Paul regarded himself as innocent if they
should be lost.

I have not shunned - I have not kept back; I have not been deterred by
fear, by the desire of popularity, by the fact that the doctrines of the
gospel are unpalatable to people, from declaring them fully. The proper
meaning of the word translated here, "I have not shunned" ὑπεστειλάμην
hupesteilamēn, is "to disguise any important truth; to withdraw it from
public view; to decline publishing it from fear, or an apprehension of
the consequences." Paul means that he had not disguised any truth; he
had not withdrawn or kept it from open view, by any apprehension of the
effect which it might have on their minds. Truth may be disguised or
kept back:

\(1\) By avoiding the subject altogether from timidity, or from an
apprehension of giving offence if it is openly proclaimed; or,

\(2\) By giving it too little prominency, so that it shall be lost in
the multitude of other truths; or,

\(3\) By presenting it amidst a web of metaphysical speculations, and
entangling it with other subjects; or,

\(4\) By making use of other terms than the Bible does, for the purpose
of involving it in a mist, so that it cannot be understood.

People may resort to this course:

\(1\) Because the truth itself is unpalatable;

\(2\) Because they may apprehend the loss of reputation or support;

\(3\) Because they may not love the truth them selves, and choose to
conceal its prominent and offensive points;

\(4\) Because they may be afraid of the rich, the great, and the
frivolous, and apprehend that they shall excite their indignation; and,

\(5\) By a love of metaphysical philosophy, and a constant effort to
bring everything to the test of their own reason. People often preach a
philosophical explanation of a doctrine instead of the doctrine itself
They deserve the credit of ingenuity, but not that of being open and
bold proclaimers of the truth of God.

All the counsel - πᾶσαν τὴν βουλὴν pasan tēn boulēn. The word "counsel"
(βουλὴ boulē) denotes properly "consolation, deliberation," and then
"will or purpose," [Luk 23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md); [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md). It means here the will or
purpose of God, as revealed in regard to the salvation of people. Paul
had made a full statement of that plan of the guilt of people, of the
claims of the Law, of the need of a Saviour, of the provisions of mercy,
and of the state of future rewards and punishments. Ministers ought to
declare all that counsel, because God commands it; because it is needful
for the salvation of people; and because the message is not theirs, but
God's, and they have no right to change, to disguise, or to withhold it.
And if it is the duty of ministers to declare that counsel, it is the
duty of a people to listen to it with respect and candor, and with a
desire to know the truth, and to be saved by it. Declaring the counsel
of God will do no good unless it is received into honest and humble
hearts, and with a disposition to know what God has revealed for
salvation.

[Acts 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 20:28</span></span>

Take heed, therefore - Attend to; be on your guard against the dangers
which beset you, and seek to discharge your duty with fidelity.

Unto yourselves - To your own piety, opinions, and mode of life. This is
the first duty of a minister; for without this all his preaching will be
vain. Compare [Col 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md); [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md). Ministers are beset with unique
dangers and temptations, and against them they should be on their guard.
In addition to the temptations which they have in common with other
people, they are exposed to those special to their office - arising from
flattery, and ambition, and despondency, and worldly-mindedness. And
just in proportion to the importance of their office is the importance
of the injunction of Paul, to take heed to themselves.

And to all the flock - The church; the charge entrusted to them. The
church of Christ is often compared to a flock. See the John 10:1-20
notes; also [Joh 21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md) notes. The
word "flock" here refers particularly to the church, and not to the
congregation in general, for it is represented to be what was purchased
with the blood of the atonement. The command here is:

\(1\) To take heed to the church; that is, to instruct, teach, and guide
it; to guard it from enemies [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md), and to make it their special
object to promote its welfare.

\(2\) to take heed to all the flock the rich and the poor, the bond and
the free, the old and the young. It is the duty of ministers to seek to
promote the welfare of each individual of their charge not to pass by
the poor because they are poor, and not to be afraid of the rich because
they are rich. A shepherd regards the I interest of the tenderest of the
fold as much as the strongest; and a faithful minister will seek to
advance the interest of all. To do this he should know all his people;
should be acquainted, as far as possible, with their unique needs,
character, and dangers, and should devote himself to their welfare as
his first and main employment.

Over the which the Holy Ghost - Though they had been appointed,
doubtless, by the church, or by the apostles, yet it is here represented
as having been done by the Holy Spirit. It was by him:

\(1\) Because he had called and qualified them for their work; and,

\(2\) Because they had been set apart in accordance with his direction
and will.

Overseers - ἐπισκόπους episkopous. "Bishops." The word properly denotes
those who are appointed "to oversee or inspect anything." This passage
proves that the name "bishop" was applicable to elders; that in the time
of the apostles, the name "bishop" and "presbyter," or "elder," was
given to the same class of officers, and, of course, that there was no
distinction between them. One term was originally used to denote
"office," the other term denotes "age," and both words were applied to
the same persons in the congregation. The same thing occurs in [Tit
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md), where those who in [Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md) are called "elders," are in [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md) called "bishops." See also [Ti1
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md).

To feed - ποιμαίνειν poimainein. This word is properly applied to the
care which a shepherd exercises over his flock. See the notes on [Joh
21:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md). It is applicable not only to
the act of feeding a flock, but also to that of protecting, guiding, and
guarding it. It here denotes not merely the "duty" of instructing the
church, but also of "governing" it; of "securing" it from enemies [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md), and of "directing" its affairs
so as to promote its edification and peace.

The church of God - This is one of three passages in the New Testament
in regard to which there has been a long controversy among critics,
which is not yet determined. The controversy is, whether is this the
correct and genuine reading. The other two passages are, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md), and [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md). The mss. and versions here
exhibit three readings: "the church of God" τοῦ Θεός tou Theos the
church of the Lord τοῦ Κυρίου tou Kuriou; and the church of the Lord and
God Κυρίος καὶ Θεός Kurios kai Theos. The Latin Vulgate reads it "God."
The Syriac, "the Lord." The Arabic, "the Lord God." The Ethiopic, "the
Christian family of God." The reading which now occurs in our text is
found in no ancient mss. except the Vatican Codex, and occurs nowhere
among the writings of the fathers except in Athanasius, in regard to
whom also there is a various reading.

It is retained, however, by Beza, Mill, and Whitby as the genuine
reading. The most ancient mss., and the best, read "the church of the
Lord," and this probably was the genuine text. It has been adopted by
Griesbach and Wetstein; and many important reasons may be given why it
should be retained. See those reasons stated at length in Kuinoel "in
loco"; see also Griesbach and Wetstein. It may be remarked, that a
change from Lord to God might easily be made in the transcribing, for in
ancient mss. the words are not written at length, but are abbreviated.
Thus, the name Christ Χριστός Christos is written ChoS; the name God
θεός theos is written ThoS; the name Lord κύριος kurios is written KOS;
and a mistake, therefore, of a single letter would lead to the
variations observable in the manuscripts. Compare in this place the note
of Mill in his Greek Testament. The authority for the name "God" is so
doubtful that it should not be used as a proof text on the divinity of
Christ, and is not necessary, as there are so many undisputed passages
on that subject.

Which he hath purchased - The word used here περιεποιήσατο periepoiēsato
occurs but in one other place in the New Testament - [Ti1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md), "For they that have used the
office of deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and great
boldness in the faith." The word properly means "to acquire or gain
anything; to make it ours." This may be done by a price, or by labor,
etc. The noun (περιποίησις peripoiēsis) derived from this verb is used
several times in the New Testament, and denotes "acquisition:" [Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md), God hath appointed us "to obtain"
(unto the obtaining or acquisition of) salvation"; [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md), "Whereunto he called you by our
gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ"; [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). In this place it means that
Christ had "acquired, gained, or procured," the church for himself by
paying his own life as the price. The church is often represented as
having thus been bought with a price, [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md); [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md).

With his own blood - With the sacrifice of his own life; for blood is
often put for life, and to shed the blood is equivalent to faking the
life. See the notes on [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md). The
doctrines taught here are:

\(1\) That the death of Christ was an atoning sacrifice; that he offered
himself to purchase a people to his own service.

\(2\) that the church is, therefore, of special value a value to be
estimated by the price paid for it. Compare [Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md).

\(3\) that this fact should make the purity and salvation of the church
an object of special solicitude with ministers of the gospel. They
should be deeply affected in view of that blood which has been shed for
the church; and they should guard and defend it as having been bought
with the highest price in the universe. The chief consideration that
will make ministers faithful and self-denying is, that the church has
been bought with a price. If the Lord Jesus so loved it; if he gave
himself for it, they should be willing to deny themselves; to watch, and
toil, and pray, that the great object of his death the purity and the
salvation of that church - may be obtained.

[Acts 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 20:29</span></span>

For I know this - By what he had seen in other places; by his knowledge
of human nature, and of the dangers to which they were exposed; and by
the guidance of inspiration.

After my departure - His presence had been the means of guarding the
church, and preserving it from these dangers. Now that the founder and
guide of the church was to be removed, they would be exposed to
dissensions and dangers.

Grievous wolves - Heavy βαρεῖς bareis, strong, mighty, dangerous wolves
- so strong that the feeble flock would not be able to resist them. The
term "wolves" is used to denote "the enemies of the flock - false, and
hypocritical, and dangerous teachers." Compare [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md).

Enter in among you - From abroad; doubtless referring particularly to
the Jews, who might be expected to distract and divide them.

Not sparing the flock - Seeking to destroy the church. The Jews would
regard it with special hostility, and would seek to destroy it in every
way. Probably they would approach them with great professed friendship
for them, and expressing a desire only to defend the laws of Moses.

[Acts 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 20:30</span></span>

Also of your own selves - From your own church; from those who profess
to. be Christians.

Speaking perverse things - Crooked, perverted, distracting doctrines
διεστραμμένα diestrammena. Compare the notes on [Act
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010.md). They would proclaim doctrines
tending to distract and divide the church. The most dangerous enemies
which the church has had have been nurtured in its own bosom, and have
consisted of those who have perverted the true doctrines of the gospel.
Among the Ephesians, as among the Corinthians [Co1
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011.md), there might be parties
formed; there might be people influenced by ambition, like Diotrephes
[Jo3 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md), or like Phygellus or
Hermogenes [Ti2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015.md), or like Hymeneus
and Alexander, [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md). Men under
the influence of ambition, or from the love of power or popularity, form
parties in the church, produce divisions and distractions, and greatly
retard its internal prosperity, and mar its peace. The church of Christ
would have little to fear from external enemies if it nurtured no foes
in its own bosom; and all the power of persecutors is not so much to be
dreaded as the plans, the parties, the strifes, the heart burnings, and
the contentions which are produced by those who love and seek power,
among the professed friends of Christ.

[Acts 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 20:31</span></span>

Therefore watch - [Mat 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042.md). In view
of the dangers which beset yourselves [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md), the danger from people not
connected with the church [Act 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md),
and the danger which will arise from the love of power among yourselves
[Act 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md), be on your guard. Observe
the approach of danger, and set yourselves against it.

Remember - Recall my counsels and admonitions in reference to these
dangers.

By the space of three years - In [Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md), we are told that Paul spent two
years in the school of Tyrannus. In [Act
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md), it is said that he was teaching
in the synagogue at Ephesus three months. In addition to this, it is not
improbable that he spent some months more in Ephesus in instructing the
church in other places. Perhaps, however, by the phrase three years, he
meant to use merely a round number, denoting about three years; or, in
accordance with the Jewish custom, part of each of the three years one
whole year, and a considerable portion of the two others. Compare the
notes on [Mat 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040.md).

I ceased not - I continued to do it.

To warn - To admonish; to place before the mind νουθετῶν nouthetōn;
setting the danger and duty of each individual before him.

Everyone - He had thus set them an example of what he had enjoined, [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md). He had admonished each
individual, whatever was his rank or standing. It is well when a
minister can refer to his own example as an illustration of what he
meant by his precepts.

Night and day - Continually; by every opportunity.

With tears - Expressive of his deep feeling, and his deep interest in
their welfare. See the notes on [Act
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019.md).

[Acts 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 20:32</span></span>

And now, brethren - About to leave them, probably to see them no more,
he committed them to the faithful care and keeping of God Amidst all the
dangers of the church, when human strength fails or is withdrawn, we may
commit that church to the safe keeping and tender care of God.

I commend you - I commit you; I place you παρατίθεμαι paratithemai in
his hands and under his protection. See the notes on [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md).

And to the word of his grace - That is, to his gracious word; to his
merciful promise. Paul refers, doubtless, to the gospel, including its
promises of support, its consoling truths, and its directions to seek
all needful help and comfort in God.

Which is able - Which has power. Τῷ δυναμένῳ Tō dunamenō. Which word, or
gospel, has power to build you up, [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md), "For the Word of God is quick
(living, life-giving, ζῶν zōn), and powerful, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, etc." Compare [Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002.md); [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md), "Is not my word like as a fire?
saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" It
is implied here that the gospel is not a dead letter; that it has power
to accomplish a great work; that it is adapted to the end in view, the
conversion and sanctification of the soul. There is no danger in
representing the gospel as mighty, and as suited by infinite wisdom to
secure the renovation and salvation of man. Compare [Rom

To build you up - The word used here is properly applied to a house
which is raised and completed by slow degrees, and by toil. It here
means to establish, make firm, or permanent, and hence, to instruct, to
establish in doctrine and in hope. The idea is, that the Word of God was
able to confirm and establish them, amidst the dangers to which they
would be exposed.

And to give you an inheritance - To make you heirs, or to make you joint
partakers with the saints of the blessings in reserve for the children
of God. Those blessings are often represented as an inheritance, or
heirship, which God will confer on his adopted children, [Mat
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md); [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md); [Mar

21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007.md); [Eph

8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md).

Among all them which are sanctified - With all who are holy; with an the
saints. See the notes on [Joh 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036.md).
Those who shall be saved are made holy. They who receive a part in the
inheritance beyond the grave will have it only among the sanctified and
the pure. They must, therefore, be pure themselves, or they can have no
part in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

[Acts 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 20:33</span></span>

I have coveted - I have not desired. I have not made it an object of my
living among you to obtain your property. Thus, [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md) he says, "I seek not yours, but
you." Paul had power to demand support in the, ministry as the reward of
his labor, [Co1 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md). Yet he did
not choose to exercise it, lest it should bring the charge of avarice
against the ministry, [Co1 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012.md), [Co1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md). He also had power in another
respect. He had a vast influence over the people. The early Christians
were disposed to commit their property to the disposal of the apostles.
See [Act 4:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md), [Act
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037.md). The pagan had been accustomed to
devote their property to the support of religion. Of this propensity, if
the object of Paul had been to make money, he might have availed
himself, and have become enriched. Deceivers often thus impose upon
people for the purpose of amassing wealth; and one of the incidental but
striking proofs of the truth of the Christian religion is here furnished
in the appeal which the apostle Paul made to his hearers, that this had
not been his motive. If it had been, how easy would it have been for
them to have contradicted him! And who, in such circumstances, would
have dared to make such an appeal? The circumstances of the case,
therefore, prove that the object of the apostle was not to amass wealth.
And this fact is an important proof of the truth of the religion which
he defended. What should have induced him to labor and toil in this
manner but a conviction of the truth of Christianity? And if he really
believed it was true, it is, in his circumstances, a strong proof that
this religion is from heaven. See this proof stated in Faber's
"Difficulties of Infidelity," and in Lord Lyttleton's "Letter on the
Conversion of Paul."

Or apparel - Raiment. Changes of raiment among the ancients, as at
present among the Orientals, constituted an important part of their
property. See the notes on [Mat 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md).

[Acts 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 20:34</span></span>

Yea, ye yourselves know - By your own acquaintance with my manner of
life. In Corinth he had lived and labored with Apollos (note, [Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003).md); and he refers elsewhere to the
fact that he had supported himself, in part at least, by his own labor,
[Co1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012.md); [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md). We may hence learn that it is no
discredit to a minister to labor. Whatever it may be to a people who put
him under a necessity to toil for his support, yet the example of Paul
shows that a man should rejoice in the privilege of preaching the
gospel, even if it is done while he is obliged to resort to labor for
his daily bread. It is well when a minister of the gospel can make an
appeal to his people like this of Paul, and say, "I have coveted no
man's gold, or silver, or apparel." Every minister should so live that
he can make this appeal to their own consciences of the sincerity and
disinterestedness of his labors from the pulpit; or when called to
separate from them as Paul did; or when on a dying bed. Every minister
of the gospel, when be comes to lie down to die, will desire to be able
to make this appeal, and to leave a solemn testimony there, that it was
not for gold, or ease, or fame, that he toiled in the ministerial
office. How much more influence will such a man have than he who has
been worldly-minded; he who has sought to become rich; and he, the only
memorials of whose life is, that he has sought "the fleece, not the
flock" - that he has gained the property, not the souls of people.

[Acts 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 20:35</span></span>

I have showed you - I have taught you by instruction and example. I have
not merely discoursed about it, but have showed you how to do it.

All things - Or, in respect to all things. In everything that respects
preaching and the proper mode of life, I have for three years set you an
example, illustrating the design, nature, and duties of the office by my
own self-denials and toil.

How that - Or, that - ὅτι hoti. I have showed you that ye should by so
laboring support the weak.

So labouring - Laboring as I have done. Setting this example, and
ministering in this way to the needs of others.

To support the weak - To provide for the needs of the sick and feeble
members of the flock, who are unable to labor for themselves. "The weak"
here denotes "the poor, the needy, the infirmed."

And to remember - To call to mind for encouragement, and with the force
of a command,

The words of the Lord Jesus - These words are nowhere recorded by the
evangelists. But they did not pretend to record all his sayings and
instructions. Compare [Joh 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025.md).
There is the highest reason to suppose that many of his sayings which
are not recorded would be treasured up by those who heard them; would be
transmitted to others; and would be regarded as a precious part of his
instructions. Paul evidently addresses the elders of Ephesus as if they
had heard this before, and were acquainted with it. Perhaps he had
himself reminded them of it. This is one of the Redeemer's most precious
sayings; and it seems even to have a special value from the fact that it
is not recorded in the regular and professed histories of his life. It
comes to us recovered, as it were, from the great mass of his unrecorded
sayings; rescued from that oblivion to which it was hastening if left to
mere tradition, and placed in permanent form in the sacred writings by
the act of an apostle who had never seen the Saviour before his
crucifixion. It is a precious relic - a memento of the Saviour - and the
effect of it is to make us regret that more of his words were not
recovered from an uncertain tradition, and placed in a permanent form by
an inspired penman. God, however, who knows what is requisite to guide
us, has directed the words which are needful for the welfare of the
church, and has preserved by inspiration the doctrines which are adapted
to convert and bless man.

It is more blessed to give - It is a higher privilege; it tends more to
the happiness of the individual and of the world. The giver is more
blessed or happy than the receiver. This appears:

\(1\) Because it is a condition for which we should be thankful when we
are in a situation to promote the happiness of others.

\(2\) because it tends to promote the happiness of the benefactor
himself. There is pleasure in the act of giving when it is done with
pure motives. It promotes our own peace; is followed by happiness in the
recollection of it; and will be followed by happiness forever. That is
the most truly happy man who is most benevolent. He is the most
miserable who has never known the luxury of doing good, but who lives to
gain all he can, and to hoard all he gains.

\(3\) it is blessed in the reward that shall result from it. Those who
give from a pure motive God will bless. They will be rewarded, not only
in the peace which they shall experience in this life, but in the higher
bliss of heaven, [Mat 25:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md). We may
also remark that this is a sentiment truly great and noble. It is worthy
of the Son of God. It is that on which he himself acted when he came to
give pardon to the guilty, comfort to the disconsolate and the mourner,
peace to the anxious sinner, sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf,
life to the dead, and heaven to the guilty and the lost. Acting on this,
he gave his own tears to weep over human sorrows and human guilt; his
own labors and toils to instruct and save man; his own life a sacrifice
for sin on the cross. Loving to give, he has freely given us all things.
Loving to give, he delights in the same character in his followers, and
seeks that they who have wealth, and strength, and influence should be
willing to give all to save the world. Imitating his great example, and
complying with his command, the church shall yet learn more and more to
give its wealth to bless the poor and needy; its sons and its daughters
to bear the gospel to the benighted pagan; its undivided and constant
efforts to save a lost world. Here closes this speech of Paul; an
address of inimitable tenderness and beauty. Happy would it be if every
minister could bid such an adieu to his people, when called to part from
them; and happy if, at the close of life, every Christian could leave
the world with a like consciousness that he had been faithful in the
discharge of his duty. Thus dying, it will be blessed to leave the
world; and thus would the example of the saints live in the memory of
survivors long after they themselves have ascended to their rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 20:36</span></span>

He kneeled down - The usual attitude of prayer. It is the proper posture
of a suppliant. It indicates reverence and humility; and is represented
in the Scriptures as the usual attitude of devotion, [Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013.md); [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md); [Luk

[Acts 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 20:37</span></span>

Wept sore - Wept much. Greek: "There was a great weeping of all."

And fell on Paul's neck - Embraced him, as a token of tender affection.
The same thing Joseph did when he met his aged father Jacob, [Gen
46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md).

And kissed him - This was the common token of affection. See the [Mat
26:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048.md) note; [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md) note; [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md) note; [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md) note.

[Acts 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 20:38</span></span>

Sorrowing most of all ... - This was a most tender and affectionate
parting scene. It can be more easily imagined than described. We may
learn from it:

\(1\) That the parting of ministers and people is a most solemn event,
and should be one of much tenderness and affection.

\(2\) the effect of true religion is to make the heart more tender; to
make friendship more affectionate and sacred; and to unite more closely
the bonds of love.

\(3\) ministers of the gospel should be prepared to leave their people
with the same consciousness of fidelity and the same kindness and love
which Paul evinced. They should live such lives as to be able to look
back upon their whole ministry as pure and disinterested, and as having
been employed in guarding the flock, and in making known to them the
whole counsel of God. So parting, they may separate in peace; and so
living and acting, they will be prepared to give up their account with
joy, and not with grief. May God grant to every minister the spirit
which Paul evinced at Ephesus, and enable each one, when called to leave
his people by death or otherwise, to do it with the same consciousness
of fidelity which Paul evinced when he left his people to see their face
no more.
