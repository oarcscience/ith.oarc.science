### [Isaiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 21:0</span></span>

The prophecy which commences this chapter occupies the first ten verses.
That it relates to Babylon is apparent from [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md), [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md). The object is to foretell the
destruction of that city by the Medes and Persians, and the design is
the same as in the more extended and minute description of the same
event in Isa. 13; 14: Whether it was delivered at the same, or at
another time, cannot be determined from the prophecy. The purpose,
however, of the prophecy is the same as there - to give consolation to
the Jews who should be carried captive to that city; to assure them that
Babylon would be destroyed, and that they would be delivered from their
long and severe bondage. This is indicated in a brief and graphic manner
in [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md).

This oracle, or ode, is one of singular beauty. It is distinguished for
its brevity, energy, and force, for the variety and the rapidity of the
action, and for the vivid manner in which the events are made to pass
before the mind. It is the language of strong excitement and of alarm;
language that expresses rapid and important movements; and language
appropriate to great vigor of conception and sublimity in description.
In the oracle the prophet supposes himself in Babylon, and the events
which are described are made to pass rapidly in vision (see the
Introduction, Section 7, 4) before him. He first sees [Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md) the dreadful storm coming at a
distance (the hostile armies), approaching like a whirlwind and
threatening destruction to everything in its way. He then [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md) hears God's direction to the
invading armies; represents himself as made acquainted with the design
of the vision, and hears the command of God to Elam (Persia) and Media
to go up and commence the siege.

Regarding himself as among the exiles in the midst of Babylon, he [Isa
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md) describes himself as deeply
affected in view of this sudden invasion, and of the calamities that
were coming upon Babylon. In [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md), he describes the state of the
Babylonians. They are represented, first as preparing the table, making
ready for feasting and revelry, setting the watch on the watch-tower,
and giving themselves up to dissipation; and secondly, as suddenly
alarmed, and summoned to prepare for war. He then ([Isa
21:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md) declares the way in which the
princes of Babylon would be roused from their revelry. But it is
described in a very remarkable manner. He does not "narrate" the events,
but he represents himself as directed to appoint a watchman [Isa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md) to announce what he should see.
That watchman [Isa 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007.md) sees two
chariots - representing two nations coming rapidly onward to execute the
orders of God. So rapid is their approach, so terrible their march, that
the watchman cries out [Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md) that
Babylon is fallen, and will be inevitably destroyed. The prophecy is
then closed [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md) by an address
to the afflicted Jews whom God had 'threshed,' or punished by sending
them captive to Babylon, and with the declaration that this was intended
by the Lord of hosts to be declared unto them. The whole design of the
prophecy, therefore, is to console them, and to repeat the assurance
given in Isa. 13; 14, that Babylon would be destroyed, and that they
would be delivered from bondage.

[Isaiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 21:1</span></span>

The burden - (see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md).

Of the desert - There have been almost as many interpretations of this
expression, as there have been interpreters. That it means Babylon, or
the country about Babylon, there can be no doubt; but the question why
this phrase was applied, has given rise to a great diversity of
opinions. The term 'desert' (מדבר midbâr) is usually applied to a
wilderness, or to a comparatively barren and uncultivated country - a
place for flocks and herds ([Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md); [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009) ff.md); to an actual waste, sandy
desert [Isa 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md); [Isa
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md); and particularly to the deserts
of Arabia [Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md); [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md). It may here be applied to
Babylon either historically, as having been "once" an unreclaimed
desert: or by "anticipation," as descriptive of what it "would be" after
it should be destroyed by Cyrus, or possibly both these ideas may have
been combined. That it was "once" a desert before it was reclaimed by
Semiramis is the testimony of all history; that it is "now" a vast waste
is the united testimony of all travelers. There is every reason to think
that a large part of the country about Babylon was formerly overflowed
with water "before" it was reclaimed by dykes; and as it was naturally a
waste, when the artificial dykes and dams should be removed, it would
again be a desert.

Of the sea - (ים yâm). There has been also much difference of opinion in
regard to this word. But there can be no doubt that it refers to the
Euphrates, and to the extensive region of marsh that was covered by its
waters. The name 'sea' (ים yâm) is not unfrequently given to a large
river, to the Nile, and to the Euphrates (see the note at [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); compare [Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005)). Herodotus (i. 184.md), says, that
'Semiramis confined the Euphrates within its channel by raisin great
dams against it; for before, it overflowed the whole country like a
sea.' And Abydenus, in Eusebius, ("Prepara. Evang.," ix. 457) says,
respecting the building of Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, that 'it is
reported that all this was covered with water, and was called a sea -
λέγεται δὲ πάντα μεν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὕδωρ εἶναι, θαλασσων καλουμένην legetai de
panta men ech archēs hudōr einai, thalassōn kaloumenēn (Compare Strabo,
"Geog." xvi. 9, 10; and Arrianus, "De Expedit. Alexandri," vii. 21).
Cyrus removed these dykes, reopened the canals, and the waters were
suffered to remain, and again converted the whole country into a vast
marsh (see the notes at Isa. 13; 14)

As whirlwinds - That is, the army comes with the rapidity of a
whirlwind. In [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md) (compare [Hab
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011).md), an army is compared to an
overflowing and rapid river.

In the south - Whirlwinds or tempests are often in the Scriptures
represented as coming from the south, [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014.md); [Job
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md) :

Out of the south cometh the whirlwind,

And cold out of the north.

So Virgil:

\- creberque procellis

Africus -

AEneid, i. 85.

The deserts of Arabia were situated to the south of Babylon, and the
south winds are described as the winds of the desert. Those winds are
represented as being so violent as to tear away the tents occupied by a
caravan (Pietro della Valle, "Travels," vol. iv. pp. 183, 191). In [Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019.md), the whirlwind is represented as
coming 'from the wilderness; that is, from the "desert" of Arabia
(compare [Jer 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#024.md); [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015).md).

So it cometh from the desert - (see [Isa
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004), and the note on that place.md). God
is there represented as collecting the army for the destruction of
Babylon 'on the mountains,' and by mountains are probably denoted the
same as is here denoted by the desert. The country of the "Medes" is
doubtless intended, which, in the view of civilized and refined Babylon,
was an uncultivated region, or a vast waste or wilderness.

From a terrible land - A country rough and uncultivated, abounding in
forests or wastes.

[Isaiah 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 21:2</span></span>

A grievous vision - Margin, as in Hebrew 'Hard.' On the word 'vision,'
see the note at [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md). The sense
here is, that the vision which the prophet saw was one that indicated
great calamity [Isa 21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md).

Is declared unto me - That is, is caused to pass before me, and its
meaning is made known to me.

The treacherous dealer - (חבוגד chabôgēd). The perfidious, unfaithful
people. This is the usual signification of the word; but the connection
here does not seem to require the signification of treachery or perfidy,
but of "violence." The word has this meaning in [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), and in [Pro
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#003.md), [Pro
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#006.md). It refers here to the Medes; and
to the fact that oppression and violence were now to be exercised toward
Babylon. Lowth renders this:

'The plunderer is plundered, and the destroyer is destroyed;'

But the authority for so rendering it is doubtful. He seems to suppose
that it refers to Babylon. The Hebrew evidently means, that there is to
be plundering and devastation, and that this is to be accomplished by a
nation accustomed to it, and which is immediately specified; that is,
the united kingdom of Media and Persia. The Chaldee renders it, 'They
who bring violence, suffer violence; and the plunderers are plundered.'
Jarchi says, that the sense of the Hebrew text according to the Chaldee
is, 'Ah! thou who art violent! there comes another who will use thee
with violence; and thou plunderer, another comes who will plunder thee,
even the Medes and Persians, who will destroy and lay waste Babylon.'
But the Hebrew text will not bear this interpretation. The sense is,
that desolation was about to be produced by a nation "accustomed" to it,
and who would act toward Babylon in their true character.

Go up - This is an address of God to Media and Persia (see the note at
[Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017).md).

O Elam - This was the name of the country originally possessed by the
Persians, and was so called from Elam a son of Shem [Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md). It was east of the Euphrates,
and comprehended properly the mountainous countries of Khusistan and
Louristan, called by the Greek writers "Elymais." In this country was
Susa or Shushan, mentioned in [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md). It is here put for Persia in
general, and the call on Elam and Media to go up, was a call on the
united kingdom of the Medes and Persians.

Besiege - That is, besiege Babylon.

O Media - (see the note at [Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017).md).

All the sighing thereof have I made to cease - This has been very
differently interpreted by expositors. Some understand it (as
Rosenmuller, Jerome, and Lowth,) as designed to be taken in an "active"
sense; that is, all the groaning "caused" by Babylon in her oppressions
of others, and particularly of God's people, would cease. Others refer
it to the army of the Medes and Persians, as if "their" sighing should
be over; that is, their fatigues and labors in the conquest of Babylon.
Calvin supposes that it means that the Lord would be deaf to the sighs
of Babylon; that is, he would disregard them and would bring upon them
the threatened certain destruction. The probable meaning is that
suggested by Jerome, that God would bring to an end all the sighs and
groans which Babylon had caused in a world suffering under her
oppressions (compare [Isa 14:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 21:3</span></span>

Therefore - In this verse, and the following, the prophet represents
himself as "in" Babylon, and as a witness of the calamities which would
come upon the city. He describes the sympathy which he feels in her
sorrows, and represents himself as deeply affected by her calamities. A
similar description occurred in the pain which the prophet represents
himself as enduring on account of the calamities of Moab (see [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md), note; [Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011), note.md).

My loins - (see the note at [Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011).md).

With pain - The word used here (חלחלה chalchâlâh) denotes properly the
pains of parturition, and the whole figure is taken from that. The sense
is, that the prophet was filled with the most acute sorrow and anguish,
in view of the calamities which were coming on Babylon. That is, the
sufferings of Babylon would be indescribably great and dreadful (see
[Nah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md); [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004.md), [Eze
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009).md).

I was bowed down - Under the grief and sorrow produced by these
calamities.

At the hearing it - The Hebrew may have this sense, and mean that these
things were made to pass before the eye of the prophet, and that the
sight oppressed him, and bowed him down. But more probably the Hebrew
letter מ (m) in the word משׁמע mishemoa' is to be taken "privatively,"
and means, 'I was so bowed down or oppressed that I could not see; I was
so dismayed that I could not hear;' that is, all his senses were taken
away by the greatness of the calamity, and by his sympathetic
sufferings. A similar construction occurs in [Psa
69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023.md) : 'Let their eyes be darkened
that they see not' (מראות mēre'ôth) that is, "from" seeing.

[Isaiah 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 21:4</span></span>

My heart panted - Margin, 'My mind wandered.' The Hebrew word rendered
'panted' (תעה tâ‛âh) means to wander about; to stagger; to be giddy; and
is applied often to one that staggers by being intoxicated. Applied to
the heart, it means that it is disquieted or troubled. The Hebrew word
"heart" here is to be taken in the sense of "mind."

The night of my pleasure - There can be no doubt that the prophet here
refers to the night of revelry and riot in which Babylon was taken. The
prophet calls it the night of "his" pleasure, because he represents
himself as being "in" Babylon when it should be taken, and, therefore,
uses such language as an inhabitant of Babylon would use. "They" would
call it the night of their pleasure, because it was set apart to
feasting and revelry.

Hath he turned into fear - God has made it a night of consternation and
alarm. The prophet here refers to the fact that Babylon would be taken
by Cyrus during that night, and that consternation and alarm would
suddenly pervade the affrighted and guilty city (see Dan. 5).

[Isaiah 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 21:5</span></span>

Prepare the table - This verse is one of the most striking and
remarkable that occurs in this prophecy, or indeed in any part of
Isaiah. It is language supposed to be spoken in Babylon. The first
direction - perhaps supposed to be that of the king - is to prepare the
table for the feast. Then follows a direction to set a watch - to make
the city safe, so that they might revel without fear. Then a command to
eat and drink: and then immediately a sudden order, as if alarmed at an
unexpected attack, to arise and anoint the shield, and to prepare for a
defense. The "table" here refers to a feast - that impious feast
mentioned in Dan. 5 in the night in which Babylon was taken, and
Belshazzar slain. Herodotus (i. 195), Xenophon ("Cyr." 7, 5), and Daniel
Dan. 5 all agree in the account that Babylon was taken in the night in
which the king and his nobles were engaged in feasting and revelry. The
words of Xenophon are, 'But Cyrus, when he heard that there was to be
such a feast in Babylon, in which all the Babylonians would drink and
revel through the whole night, on that night, as soon as it began to
grow dark, taking many people, opened the dams into the river;' that is,
he opened the dykes which had been made by Semiramis and her successors
to confine the waters of the Euphrates to one channel, and suffered the
waters of the Euphrates again to flow over the country so that he could
enter Babylon beneath its wall in the channel of the river. Xenophon has
also given the address of Cyrus to the soldiers. 'Now,' says he, 'let us
go against them. Many of them are asleep; many of them are intoxicated;
and all of them are unfit for battle (ἀσὺντακτοι asuntaktoi).' Herodotus
says (i. 191), 'It was a day of festivity among them, and while the
citizens were engaged in dance and merriment, Babylon was, for the first
time, thus taken.' Compare the account in Dan. 5.

Watch in the watch-tower - place a guard so that the city shall be
secure. Babylon had on its walls many "towers," placed at convenient
distances (see the notes at Isa. 13), in which guards were stationed to
defend the city, and to give the alarm on any approach of an enemy.
Xenophon has given a similar account of the taking of the city: 'They
having arranged their guards, drank until light.' The oriental
watch-towers are introduced in the book for the purpose of illustrating
a general subject often referred to in the Scriptures.

Eat, drink - Give yourselves to revelry during the night (see Dan. 5)

Arise, ye princes - This language indicates sudden alarm. It is the
language either of the prophet, or more probably of the king of Babylon,
alarmed at the sudden approach of the enemy, and calling upon his nobles
to arm themselves and make, a defense. The army of Cyrus entered Babylon
by two divisions - one on the north where the waters of the Euphrates
entered the city, and the other by the channel of the Euphrates on the
south. Knowing that the city was given up to revelry on that night, they
had agreed to imitate the sound of the revellers until they should
assemble around the royal palace in the center of the city. They did so.
When the king heard the noise, supposing that it was the sound of a
drunken mob, he ordered the gates of the palace to be opened to
ascertain the cause of the disturbance. When they were thus opened, the
army of Cyrus rushed in, and made an immediate attack on all who were
within. It is to this moment that we may suppose the prophet here
refers, when the king, aroused and alarmed, would call on his nobles to
arm themselves for battle (see Jahn's "Hebrew Commonwealth," p. 153, Ed.
Andover, 1828).

Anoint the shield - That is, prepare for battle. Gesenius supposes that
this means to rub over the shield with oil to make the leather more
supple and impenetrable (compare [Sa2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#021).md). The Chaldee renders it, 'Fit,
and polish your arms.' The Septuagint, 'Prepare shields.' Shields were
instruments of defense prepared to ward off the spears and arrows of an
enemy in battle. They were usually made of a rim of brass or wood, and
over this was drawn a covering of the skin of an ox or other animal in
the manner of a drum-head with us. Occasionally the hide of a rhinoceros
or an elephant was used. Burckhardt ("Travels in Nubia") says that the
Nubians use the hide of the hippopotamus for the making of shields. But
whatever skin might be used, it was necessary occasionally to rub it
over with oil lest it should become hard, and crack, or lest it should
become so rigid that an arrow or a sword would easily break through it.
Jarchi says, that 'shields were made of skin, and that they anointed
them with the oil of olive.' The sense is, 'Prepare your arms! Make
ready for battle!'

[Isaiah 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 21:6</span></span>

Go, set a watchman - This was said to Isaiah in the vision. He
represents himself as in Babylon, and as hearing God command him to set
a watchman on the watch-tower who would announce what was to come to
pass. All this is designed merely to bring the manner of the destruction
of the city more vividly before the eye.

[Isaiah 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 21:7</span></span>

And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen - This passage is very
obscure from the ambiguity of the word רכב rekeb - 'chariot.' Gesenius
contends that it should be rendered 'cavalry,' and that it refers to
cavalry two abreast hastening to the destruction of the city. The word
רכב rekeb denotes properly a chariot or wagon [Jdg
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028.md); a collection of wagons [Ch2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md); [Ch2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#006.md); [Ch2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025.md); and sometimes refers to the
"horses or men" attached to a chariot. 'David houghed all the chariots'
[Sa2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004.md); that is, all the "horses"
belonging to them. 'David killed of the Syrians seven hundred chariots'
[Sa2 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md); that is, all "the men"
belonging to seven hundred chariots. According to the present Masoretic
pointing, the word רכב rekeb does not mean, perhaps, anything else than
a chariot strictly, but other forms of the word with the same letters
denote "riders or cavalry." Thus, the word רכב rakâb denotes a horseman
[Kg2 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#017.md); a charioteer or driver of a
chariot [Kg1 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034.md); [Jer
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#021.md). The verb רבב râbab means "to
ride," and is usually applied to riding on the backs of horses or
camels; and the sense here is, that the watchman saw "a riding," or
persons riding two abreast; that is, "cavalry," or men borne on horses,
and camels, and asses, and hastening to attack the city.

With a couple of horsemen - The word 'couple' (צמד tsemed) means
properly a "yoke or pair;" and it means here that the cavalry was seen
"in pairs, that is," two abreast.

A chariot of asses - Or rather, as above, "a riding" on donkeys - an
approach of men in this manner to battle. Asses were formerly used in
war where horses could not be procured. Thus Strabo (xv. 2, 14) says of
the inhabitants of Caramania, 'Many use donkeys for war in the want of
horses.' And Herodotus (iv. 129) says expressly that Darius Hystaspes
employed donkeys in a battle with the Scythians.

And a chariot of camels - A "riding" on camels. Camels also were used in
war, perhaps usually to carry the baggage (see Diod. ii. 54; iii. 44;
Livy, xxxvii. 40; Strabo, xvi. 3). They are used for all purposes of
burden in the East, and particularly in Arabia.

[Isaiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 21:8</span></span>

And he cried, A lion - Margin, 'As a lion.' This is the correct
rendering. The particle כ (k) - 'as,' is not unfrequently omitted (see
[Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001).md). That is, 'I see them approach
with the fierceness, rapidity, and terror of a lion (compare [Rev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003).md).

My lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower - This is the speech
of the watchman, and is addressed, not to Yahweh, but to him that
appointed him. It is designed to show the "diligence" with which he had
attended to the object for which he was appointed. He had been unceasing
in his observation; and the result was, that now at length he saw the
enemy approach like a lion, and it was certain that Babylon now must
fall. The language used here has a striking resemblance to the opening
of the "Agamemnon" of AEschylus; being the speech of the watchman, who
had been very long upon his tower looking for the signal which should
make known that Troy had fallen. It thus commences:

'Forever thus! O keep me not, ye gods,

Forever thus, fixed in the lonely tower

Of Atreus' palace, from whose height I gaze

O'er watched and weary, like a night-dog, still

Fixed to my post; meanwhile the rolling year

Moves on, and I my wakeful vigils keep

By the cold star-light sheen of spangled skies.'

Symmons, quoted in the "Pictorial Bible."

I am set in my ward - My place where one keeps watch. It does not mean
that he was confined or imprisoned, but that he had kept his watch
station (משׁמרת mishemeret from שׁמר shâmar "to watch, to keep, to
attend to").

Whole nights - Margin, 'Every night.' It means that he had not left his
post day or night.

[Isaiah 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 21:9</span></span>

And, behold ... a chariot of men - This place shows that the word
'chariot' (רכב rekeb) may denote something else than a wagon or
carriage, as a chariot drawn by men cannot be intended. The sense can be
expressed, perhaps, by the word "riding," 'I see a riding of men
approach;' that is, I see "cavalry" drawing near, or men riding and
hastening to the battle.

With a couple of horsemen - The word 'with' is not in the Hebrew. The
meaning is, 'I see a riding of men, or cavalry; and they come in pairs,
or two abreast.' A part of the sentence is to be supplied from [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007.md). He saw not only horsemen, but
riders on donkeys and camels.

And he answered - That is, the watchman answered. The word 'answer,' in
the Scriptures, means often merely to commence a discourse after an
interval; to begin to speak [Job 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#002.md);
[Dan 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#026.md); [Act
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md).

Babylon is fallen - That is, her ruin is certain. Such a mighty army is
drawing near, and they approach so well prepared for battle, that the
ruin of Babylon is inevitable. The "repetition" of this declaration that
'Babylon is fallen,' denotes emphasis and certainty. Compare [Psa
92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009.md) :

For lo, thine enemies, O Lord,

For lo, thine enemies shall perish.

[Psa 93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md) :

The floods have lifted up, O Lord;

The floods have lifted up their waves.

A similar description is given of the fall of Babylon in [Jer
50:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#032.md); [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md); and John has copied this
description in the account of the overthrow of the mystical Babylon [Rev
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001.md). Babylon was distinguished for
its pride, arrogance, and haughtiness. It became, therefore, the emblem
of all that is haughty, and as such is used by John in the Apocalypse;
and as such it was a most striking emblem of the pride, arrogance,
haughtiness, and oppression which have always been evinced by Papal
Rome.

And all the graven images - Babylon was celebrated for its idolatry, and
perhaps was the place where the worship of idols commenced. The
principal god worshipped there was Belus, or Bel (see the note at [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md).

Are broken ... - That is, shall be destroyed; or, in spite of its idols,
the whole city would be ruined.

[Isaiah 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 21:10</span></span>

O my threshing - The words 'to thresh,' 'to tread down,' etc., are often
used in the Scriptures to denote punishments inflicted on the enemies of
God. An expression likes this occurs in [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md), in describing the destruction
of Babylon: 'The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor; it is
time to thresh her.' In regard to the mode of threshing among the
Hebrews, and the pertinency of this image to the destruction of the
enemies of God, see the note at [Isa
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md). Lowth, together with many
others, refers this to Babylon, and regards it as an address of God to
Babylon in the midst of her punishment: 'O thou, the object on which I
shall exercise the severity of my discipline; that shall lie under my
afflicting hand like grain spread out upon the floor to be threshed out
and winnowed, to separate the chaff from the wheat.' But the expression
can be applied with more propriety to the Jews; and may be regarded as
the language of "tenderness" addressed by God through the prophet to his
people when they should be oppressed and broken down in Babylon: 'O
thou, my people, who hast been afflicted and crushed; who hast been
under my chastening hand, and reduced to these calamities on account of
your sins; hear what God has spoken respecting the destruction of
Babylon, and your consequent certain deliverance.' Thus it is the
language of consolation; and is designed, like the prophecies in Isa.
13; 14, to comfort the Jews, when they should be in Babylon, with the
certainty that they would be delivered. The language of "tenderness" in
which the address is couched, as well as the connection, seems to demand
this interpretation.

And the corn of my floor - Hebrew, 'The son of my threshing floor' - a
Hebraism for grain that was on the floor to be threshed. The word 'son'
is often used in this special manner among the Hebrews (see the note at
[Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).md).

That which I have heard ... - This shows the scope or design of the
whole prophecy - to declare to the Jews the destruction that would come
upon Babylon, and their own consequent deliverance. It was important
that they should be "assured" of that deliverance, and hence, Isaiah
"repeats" his predictions, and minutely states the manner in which their
rescue would be accomplished.

Analysis of [Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md), [Isa
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012.md). - VISION 17. Dumah, or Idumea.

This prophecy is very obscure. It comprises but two verses. When it was
delivered, or on what occasion, or what was its design, it is not easy
to determine. Its brevity has contributed much to its obscurity; nor,
amidst the variety of interpretations which have been proposed, is it
possible to ascertain with entire certainty the true explanation.
Perhaps no portion of the Scriptures, of equal length, has been
subjected to a greater variety of exposition. It is not the design of
these Notes to go at length into a detail of opinions which have been
proposed, but to state as accurately as possible the sense of the
prophet. Those who wish to see at length the opinions which have been
entertained on this prophecy, will find them detailed in Vitringa and
others.

The prophecy relates evidently to Idumea. It stands in connection with
that immediately preceding respecting Babylon, and it is probable that
it was delivered at that time. It has the appearance of being a reply by
the prophet to language of "insult or taunting" from the Idumeans, and
to have been spoken when calamities were coming rapidly on the Jews. But
it is not certain that that was the time or the occasion. It is certain
only that it is a prediction of calamity succeeding to prosperity -
perhaps prosperity coming to the afflicted Hebrews in Babylon, and of
calamity to the taunting Idumeans, who had exulted over their downfall
and captivity, and who are represented as sneeringly inquiring of the
prophet what was the prospect in regard to the Jews. This is
substantially the view given by Vitringa, Rosenmuller, and Gesenius.

According to this interpretation, the scene is laid in the time of the
Babylonlsh captivity. The prophet is represented as having been placed
on a watch-tower long and anxiously looking for the issue. It is night;
that is, it is a time of calamity, darkness, and distress. In this state
of darkness and obscurity, someone is represented as calling to the
prophet from Idumea, and tauntingly inquiring, what of the night, or
what the prospect was. He asks, whether there was any prospect of
deliverance; or whether these calamities were to continue, and perhaps
whether Idumea was also to be involved in them with the suffering Jews.
To this the prophet answers, that the morning began to dawn - that there
was a prospect of deliverance. But he adds that calamity was also
coming; calamity probably to the nation that made the inquiry - to the
land of Idumea - "perhaps" calamity that should follow the deliverance
of the Hebrew captives, who would thus be enabled to inflict vengeance
on Edom, and to overwhelm it in punishment. The morning dawns, says the
watchman; but there is darkness still beyond. Light is coming - but
there is night also: light for us - darkness for you. This
interpretation is strengthened by a remarkable coincidence in an
independent source, and which I have not seen noticed, in the 137th
Psalm. The irritated and excited feelings of the captive Jews against
Edom; their indignation at the course which Edom pursued when Jerusalem
was destroyed; and their desire of vengeance, are all there strongly
depicted, and accord with this interpretation, which supposes the
prophet to say that the glad morning of the deliverance of the "Jews"
would be succeeded by a dark night to the taunting Idumean. The feelings
of the captured and exiled Jews were expressed in the following language
in Babylon [Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md) :

Remember, O Jehovah, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem;

Who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation.

That is, we desire vengeance on Idumea, who joined with our enemies when
Jerusalem was destroyed; and when Jerusalem shall be again rebuilt, we
pray that they may be remembered, and that punishment may be inflicted
on them for exulting over our calamities. The watchman adds, that if the
Idumean was disposed to inquire further, he could. The result could be
easily ascertained. It was clear, and the watchman would be disposed to
give the information. But he adds, 'return, come;' perhaps meaning,
'repent; then come and receive an answer;' denoting that if the Idumeans
"wished" a favorable answer, they should repent of their treatment of
the Jews in their calamities, and that "then" a condition of safety and
prosperity would be promised them.

As there is considerable variety in the ancient versions of this
prophecy, and as it is brief, they may be presented to advantage at a
single view. The Vulgate does not differ materially from the Hebrew. The
following are some of the other versions:

Septuagint: "The vision of Idumea." Unto me he called out of Seir, Guard
the fortresses - Φυλάσσετε ἐπάλξεις phulassete epalcheis). I guard
morning and night. If you inquire, inquire, and dwell with me. In the
grove (δρυμῷ drumō) thou shalt lie down, and in the way of Dedan (Δαιδάn
Daidan).

Chaldee: "The burden of the cup of malediction which is coming upon
Duma." - He cries to me from heaven, O prophet, prophesy; O prophet,
prophesy to them of what is to come. The prophet said, There is a reward
to the just, and revenge to the unjust. If you will be converted, be
converted while you can be converted.

Syriac: "The burden of Duma." The nightly watchman calls to me out of
Seir. And the watchman said, The morning cometh and also the night. If
ye will inquire, inquire, and then at length come.

Arabic: "A prophecy respecting Edom and Seir, the sons of Esau." Call me
from Seir. Keep the towers. Guard thyself morning and evening. If you
inquire, inquire.

It is evident, from this variety of translation, that the ancient
interpreters felt that the prophecy was enigmatical and difficult. It is
not easy, in a prophecy so brief, and where there is scarcely any clue
to lead us to the historical facts, to give an interpretation that shall
be entirely satisfactory and unobjectionable. Perhaps the view given
above may be as little liable to objection as any one of the numerous
interpretations which have been proposed.

Verse 11

The burden - (see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md). This word 'burden' naturally
leads to the supposition that "calamity" in some form was contemplated
in the prophecy. This is also indicated in the prophecy by the word
night.

Of Dumah - Dumah (דוּמה dûmâh) is mentioned in [Gen
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#014.md), and [Ch1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030.md), as one of the twelve sons of
Ishmael. It is known that those sons settled in Arabia, and that the
Arabians derive their origin from Ishmael. The name 'Dumah,' therefore,
properly denotes one of the wandering tribes of the Ishmaelites. The
Septuagint evidently read this as if it had been אדום 'ĕdôm - Edom or
Idumea - Ἰδουμαία Idoumaia Jakut mentions two places in Arabia to which
the name 'Dumah' is given, Dumah Irak, and Dumah Felsen. The former of
these, which Gesenius supposes is the place here intended, lies upon the
borders of the Syrian desert, and is situated in a valley seven days'
journey from Damascus, according to Abulfeda, in lon. 45 degrees E.; and
in lat. 29 degrees 30' N; and about three and a half days' journey from
Medina. Niebuhr mentions Dumah as a station of the Wehabites (see
Gesenius, "Commentary in loc.") There can be little doubt that the place
referred to is situated on the confines of the Arabian and Syrian
deserts, and that it is the place called by the Arabians "Duma the
stony, or Syrian Duma" (Robinson's Calmet). It has a fortress, and is a
place of strength Jerome says, 'Duma is not the whole province of
Idumea, but is a certain region which lies toward the south, and is
twenty miles distant from a city of Palestine called Eleutheropolis,
near which are the mountains of Seir.' It is evident from the prophecy
itself that Idumea is particularly referred to, for the prophet
immediately adds, that the voice came to him from mount 'Seir,' which
was the principal mountain of Idumea. Why the name 'Dumah' is used to
designate that region has been a matter on which critics have been
divided.

Vitringa supposes that it is by a play upon the word 'Dumah,' because
the word "may" be derived from דמם dâmam to be silent, to be still; and
that it is used to denote the "silence," or the "night," which was about
to come upon Idumea; that is, the calamity of which this was a
prediction. Kocher supposes that the prophet used the word denoting
'silence' (דוּמה dûmâh) by a paranomasia, and by derision for אדום
'ĕdôm, as if Idumea was soon to be reduced to silence, or to
destruction. Idumea, or the country of Edom, is frequently referred to
by the prophets (see [Jer 49:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md),
[Jer 49:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md); [Eze
35:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md), [Eze
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#007.md), [Eze
35:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#009.md), [Eze
35:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#014.md); [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019.md); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md); Obad. 1:2-18; [Mal
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003).md). For a description of Idumea,
and of the prophecies respecting it, see the notes at Isa. 34.

He calleth - One calleth; there is a voice heard by me from Seir. Lowth
renders it, 'A voice crieth unto me.' But the sense is, that the prophet
hears one crying, or calling (קרא qorē') to him from the distant
mountain.

Unto me - The prophet Isaiah.

Out of Seir - The name 'Seir' was given to a mountainous tract or region
of country that stretched along from the southern part of the Dead Sea,
to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, terminating near Ezion-geber.
Mount Hor formed a part of this range of mountains. Esau and his
descendants possessed the mountains of Seir, and hence, the whole region
obtained the name of Edom or Idumea. Mount Seir was anciently the
residence of the "Horites" [Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md),
but Esau made war upon them and destroyed them (compare [Gen
36:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#008.md); [Deu
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#005.md), [Deu
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012).md). Here it is put for the country
of Idumea, and the sense is, that the whole land, or the inhabitants of
the land, are heard by the prophet in a taunting manner asking him what
of the night.

Watchman - (see the note at [Isa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006).md). The prophet Isaiah is here
referred to (compare [Isa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010).md). He is represented as being in
the midst of the calamities that had come upon Judea, and as having his
station in desolate Jerusalem, and looking for the signs of returning
day. The eye is turned toward the east - the source from where light
comes, and from where the exiles would return to their own land. Thus
anxiously waiting for the indications of mercy to his desolate country,
he hears this taunting voice from Idumea, asking him what was the
prospect? what evidence there was of returning prosperity?

What of the night? - (compare [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md). 'How stands the night? What is
the prospect? What have you to announce respecting the night? How much
of it is passed? And what is the prospect of the dawn?' 'Night' here is
the emblem of calamity, affliction, oppression, as it often is in the
Scriptures (compare [Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md); [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006).md); and it refers here probably to
the calamities which had come upon Judea. The inquiry is, How much of
that calamity had passed? What was the prospect? How long was it to
continue? How far was it to spread? The inquiry is "repeated" here to
denote "intensity" or "emphasis," manifesting the deep interest which
the inquirer had in the result, or designed to give emphasis and point
to the cutting taunt.

[Isaiah 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 21:12</span></span>

The watchman said - Or rather "saith;" indicating that this is the
answer which the prophet returned to the inquiry from Idumea.

The morning cometh - There are signs of approaching day. The 'morning'
here is an emblem of prosperity; as the light of the morning succeeds to
the darkness of the night. This refers to the deliverance from the
captivity of Babylon, and is to be supposed as having been spoken near
the time when that captivity was at an end - or nearly at break of day
after the long night of their bondage. This declaration is to be
understood as referring to a different people from those referred to in
the expression which immediately follows - 'and also the night.' 'The
morning cometh' - to the captive Jews; 'and also the night' - to some
other people - to wit, the Idumeans. It "might" mean that the morning
was to be succeeded by a time of darkness to the same people; but the
connection seems to demand that we understand it of others.

And also the night - A time of calamity and affliction. This is
emphatic. It refers to the Idumeans. 'The morning cometh to the captive
Jews; it shall be closely succeeded by a night - a time of calamity - to
the taunting Idumeans.' During the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, the
Idumeans invaded and took possession of the southern part of Judea. The
prophet here refers to the fact, perhaps, that on the return of the Jews
to their native land, they would revenge this by expelling them, and by
inflicting punishment on the land of Edom. For a full proof that
calamities came upon the land of Idumea, see Keith "On the Prophecies."
Art. "Idumea," and the notes at Isa. 34)

If ye will inquire, inquire ye - If you choose to ask anything further
in regard to this, you can. The sense is probably this: 'You Idumeans
have asked respecting the night in derision and reproach. An answer has
been given somewhat agreeably to that inquiry. But if you seriously wish
to know anything further respecting the destiny of your land, you can
ask me (Isaiah) or any other prophet, and it will be known. But ask it
in seriousness and earnestness, and with a suitable regard for the
prophetic character and for God. And especially if you wish a more
favorable answer to your inquiries, it is to be obtained only by
forsaking sin and turning to God, and then you may come with the hope of
a brighter prospect for the future.' The design of this is, therefore:

\(1\) to "reprove" them for the manner in which they had asked the
question;

\(2\) to assure them that God was willing to direct humble and serious
inquirers; and

\(3\) to show in what way a favorable answer could be obtained - to wit,
by repentance. And this is as true of sinners now as it was then. "They"
often evince the reproachful and taunting spirit which the Idumeans did.
"They" hear only a similar response - that prosperity and happiness
await the Christian, though now in darkness and affliction; and that
calamity and destruction are before the guilty. They "might" have the
same answer - an answer that God would bless them and save them, if they
would inquire in a humble, serious, and docile manner.

Return - Turn from your sins; come back to God, and show respect for him
and his declarations.

Come - "Then" come and you shall be accepted, and the watch man will
also announce "morning" as about to dawn on you. This seems to be the
sense of this very dark and difficult prophecy. It is brief,
enigmatical, and obscure. Yet it is beautiful; and if the sense above
given be correct, it contains most weighty and important truth - alike
for the afflicted and persecuted friends, and the persecuting and
taunting foes of God. With reference to the interpretation here
proposed, which supposes, as will have been seen:

\(1\) a state of excited feeling on the part of the Jews toward the
Idumeans, for the part which they took in the destruction of their city;

\(2\) the prospect of speedy deliverance to the Jews in Babylon; and

\(3\) a consequent desolation and vengeance on the Idumeans for the
feelings which they had manifested in the destruction of Jerusalem, see
the prophecy of Obadiah, [Oba 1:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008.md) :

Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord,

Even destroy the wise men out of Edom,

And understanding out of the mount of Esau?

And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,

To the end that every one of the mount of Esau

May be cut off by slaughter.

For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,

And thou shalt be cut off for ever.

In the day that thou stoodest on the other side;

In the day that the stranger carried away captive his forces;

And foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem;

Even thou wast as one of them.

But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother

In the day that he became a stranger;

Neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah

In the day of their destruction;

Neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen;

As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee;

Thy reward shall return upon thine own head, etc.

In this prophecy these circumstances are all to be found;

\(1\) the hostility of the Edomites against Jerusalem, and the part
which they took in the destruction of the city, in [Isa
21:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md);

\(2\) the fact of the deliverance of the Jews from captivity, in [Isa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017.md);

\(3\) the consequent vengeance upon the Idumeans [Isa
34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md).

This remarkable coincidence in an independent prophecy is a strong
circumstance to prove that the interpretation above proposed is correct.
In regard to the general reasons for the interpretation here proposed,
and the lessons which the prophecy is suited to convey, I may be
permitted to refer to my "Practical Sermons," pp. 325-341.

[Isaiah 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 21:13</span></span>

Analysis of [Isa 21:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md). - Vision
18. "Arabia."

The remainder of this chapter is occupied with a single prophecy
respecting Arabia. It was "probably" delivered about the time that the
former was uttered - during the reign of Hezekiah, and before the
invasion of Sennacherib. It had reference, I suppose, to Sennacherib;
and was designed to foretell the fact that, either in his march to
attack Judea, or on his return from Egypt, he would pass through Arabia,
and perhaps oppress and overthrow some of their clans. At all events, it
was to be fulfilled within a year after it was uttered [Isa
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md), and refers to "some" foreign
invasion that was to conic upon their land. Rosenmuller supposes that it
relates to the same period as the prophecy in [Jer
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md), following, and refers to the
time when Nebuchadnezzar sent Nebuzaradan to overran the lands of the
Ammonites, the Moabites, the Philistines, the Arabians, the Idumeans,
and others who had revolted from him, and who had formed an alliance
with Zedekiah.

The sentiment of the prophecy is simple - that within a year the country
of Arabia would be overrun by a foreign enemy. The form and manner of
the prophecy is highly poetic and beautiful. The images are drawn from
customs and habits which pertain to the Arabians, and which characterize
them to this day. In [Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md), the
prophecy opens with a declaration that the caravans that were accustomed
to pass peacefully through Arabia would be arrested by the apprehension
of war. They would seek a place of refuge in the forests and fastnesses
of the land. Thither also the prophet sees the Arabians flocking, as if
to exercise the rites of hospitality, and to minister to the needs of
the oppressed and weary travelers. But the reasons why "they" are there,
the prophet sees to be that "they" are oppressed and driven out of their
land by a foreign invader, and "they" also seek the same places of
security and of refuge [Isa 21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md).
All this would be accomplished within a year [Isa
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md); and the result would be, that
the inhabitants of Arabia would be greatly diminished [Isa
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md).

[Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md)

The burden - (see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md).

Upon Arabia - (בערב ba‛ărâb). This is an unusual form. The title of the
prophecies is usually without the ב (b) rendered 'upon.' Lowth supposes
this whole title to be of doubtful authority, chiefly because it is
missing in most MSS. of the Septuagint. The Septuagint connects it with
the preceding prophecy respecting Dumab, and makes this a continuance of
that. The preposition ב (b) - 'upon,' means here "respecting,
concerning," and is used instead of על ‛al as in [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001.md). Arabia is a well-known country of
western Asia, lying south and southeast of Judea. It was divided into
three parts, Arabia Deserta, on the east; Arabia Petrea, lying south of
Judea; and Arabia Felix, lying still further south. What part of Arabia
is here denoted it may not be easy to determine. It is probable that it
was Arabia Petrea, because this lay between Judea and Egypt, and would
be exposed to invasion by the Assyrians should they invade Egypt; and
because this part of Arabia furnished, more than the others, such
retreats and fastnesses as are mentioned in [Isa
21:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md).

In the forest - (ביער baya‛ar). The word (יער ya‛ar) 'forest' usually
denotes a grove, a collection of trees. But it may mean here, any place
of refuge from a pursuing foe; a region of thick underwood; an
uncultivated, inaccessible place, where they would be concealed from an
invading enemy. The word rendered 'forest' is commonly supposed to mean
a forest in the sense in which that word is now used by us, meaning an
extensive wood - large tract of land covered with trees. It is doubtful,
however, whether the word is so used in the Bible. The Rev. Eli Smith
stated to me that he had visited several of the places in Palestine to
which the word (יער ya‛ar) 'forest' or 'grove' is given, and that he was
satisfied that there never was a forest there in our use of the word.
The same word יער ya‛ar - the י (y) not being used to begin a word in
Arabic, but the ו (v) being used instead of it - occurs often in Arabic.
It means, as used by the Arabs, a rough, stony, impassable place; a
place where there are no roads; which is inaccessible; and which is a
safe retreat for robbers - and it is not improbable that the word is so
used here.

In Arabia - (בערב ba‛ărâb). The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the
Chaldee, understand this of the "evening" - 'In the evening.' The word
ערב ‛ereb, with different points from those which the Masorites have
used here, means "evening," but there is no necessity of departing from
the translation in our English version. The sense would not be
materially affected whichever rendering should be preferred.

Shall ye lodge - Shall you pass the night. This is the usual
signification of the word. But here it may be taken in a larger sense,
as denoting that they would pitch their tents there, or that they would
seek a refuge there. The sense I suppose to be this: 'O ye traveling
caravans of Dedan! Ye were accustomed to pass through Arabia, and to
find a safe and hospitable entertainment there. But now, the Arabians
shall be overrun by a foreign enemy; they shall be unable to show you
hospitality, and to insure your safety in their tents, and for fear of
the enemy still in the land you will be obliged to seek a lodging in the
inaccessible thickets of the forests.' The passage is intended to denote
the "change" that had taken place, and to show the "insecurity" for
caravans.

O ye traveling companies - Ye "caravans" (ארחות 'orechôt). This word
usually signifies "ways, paths, cross roads." But it is used here
evidently to denote those who "traveled" in such ways or paths; that is,
caravans of merchants. So it is used in [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md) : 'The caravans of Tema.' It is
well known that in the East it is usual for large companies to travel
together, called "caravans." Arabia Petrea was a great thoroughfare for
such companies.

Of Dedanim - Descendants of "Dedan." There are two men of this name
mentioned in the Old Testament - the son of Raamah, the son of Cush,
mentioned in [Gen 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md); and the son of
Jokshan, the son of Abraham by Keturah [Gen
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md). The descendants of the latter
settled in Arabia Petrea, and the descendants of the former near the
Persian Gulf. It is not easy to determine which is here intended, though
most probably those who dwelt near the Persian Gulf, because they are
often mentioned as merchants. They dealt in ivory, ebony, etc., and
traded much with Tyre [Eze 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#021.md), and
doubtless also with Egypt. They are here represented as passing through
Arabia Petrea on their way to Egypt, and as compelled by the calamities
in the country to find a refuge in its fastnesses and inaccessible
places.

[Isaiah 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 21:14</span></span>

Of the land of Tema - Tema was one of the sons of Ishmael [Gen
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015.md), and is supposed to have
populated the city of Thema in Arabia Deserta. The word denotes hero one
of the tribes of Ishmael, or of the Arabians. Job speaks [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019.md) of 'the troops of Tema,' and
Jeremiah [Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md) connects Tema and
Dedan together. Jerome and Eusebius say that the village of Theman
(Θαιμάν Thaiman) existed in their time. It was, according to Jerome,
five, and according to Eusebius, fifteen miles from Petra, and was then
occupied as a Roman garrison (Onomas Urb. et Locor). Ptolemy speaks of a
city called Themme (Θαιμάν Themmē) in Arabia Deserta. This city lies,
according to D'Anville, in longitude 57 degrees East, and in latitude 27
degrees North. According to Seetsen, it is on the road usually pursued
by caravans from Mecca to Damascus. Lowth renders it 'The southern
country,' but without authority. The Septuagint renders it, Θαιμάν
Thaiman - 'Thaiman.'

Brought water - Margin, 'Bring ye.' This might be rendered in the
imperative, but the connection seems rather to require that it be read
as a declaration that they did so. To bring water to the thirsty was an
act of hospitality, and especially in eastern countries, where water was
so scarce, and where it was of so much consequence to the traveler in
the burning sands and deserts. The idea is, that the inhabitants of the
land would be oppressed and pursued by an enemy; and that the Arabians,
referred to by the prophet [Isa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md),
would be driven from their homes; and be dependent on others; that they
would wander through the vast deserts, deprived of the necessaries of
life; and that they would be dependent on the charity of the people of
Tema for the supply of their needs. The following illustration of this
passage has been kindly furnished me by the Rev. Eli Smith, missionary
to Syria, showing that Isaiah, in mentioning "hospitality" as one of the
virtues of the inhabitants of Tema, drew from the life. 'Even in Hebrew
prophecy hospitality is distinctly recognized as a trait in the Arab
character. Isaiah says, "the inhabitants of Tema," etc. Tema is known as
an oasis in the heart of Arabia, between Syria and Mecca. And among the
scraps of ante-Mahometan poetry that have reached us, is one by
Samaciel, a prince of this same Tema. In extolling the virtues of his
tribe he says -

"No fire of ours was ever extinguished at night without a guest, and of
our guests never did one disparage us."

'In the passage quoted from Isaiah, it is to the thirsty and hungry in
flight, that the inhabitants of Tema are represented as bringing water
and bread, as if hastening to afford them protection. The extent to
which this protection is sometimes carried, is finely illustrated by a
traditionary anecdote in the life of Samaciel, the prince and poet of
Tema just mentioned. In some feud among the tribes in his neighborhood,
a prince (Amru el-Keis) fled to Samaciel, left with him his treasures,
and was conducted by him beyond the reach of his enemies. They assembled
their forces, and marched upon Tema. On their way Samaciel's son fell
into their hands. Presenting the young man before his castle, they
proposed to the father the dreadful alternative, of delivering up to
them what his guest had left, or seeing his son massacred. Samaciel's
sense of honor dictated the reply -

"He honored me, and I'll honor him ... Treachery is a chain to the neck
that never wears out." So he defended the rights of his guest, and his
son was slain.'

They prevented - Our word 'prevent' usually means at present, to hinder,
to obstruct. But in the Scriptures, and in the Old English sense of the
word, it means to anticipate, to go before. That is the sense of the
word קדמוּ qidemû here. They "anticipated" their needs by bread; that
is, they supplied them. This was an ancient and an honorable rite of
hospitality. Thus Melchizedek [Gen
14:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#017.md) is said to have come out and
met Abraham, when returning victorious from the slaughter of
Chedorlaomer, with bread and wine.

Him that fled - The inhabitant of the land of Arabia that fled before
the invader, perhaps the inhabitants of Kedar [Isa
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md), or of some other part of
Arabia. It is not meant that the "whole" land of Arabia would be
desolate, but that the invasion would come upon certain parts of it; and
the inhabitants of other portions - as of Tema - would supply the needs
of the fugitives.

[Isaiah 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 21:15</span></span>

For they fled - The inhabitants of one part of the land.

The grievousness of war - Hebrew, כבד kobed - "the weight, the
heaviness, the oppression" of war; probably from the calamities that
would result from the march of the Assyrian through their land, either
on his way to Judea or to Egypt.

[Isaiah 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 21:16</span></span>

Within a year - What has been said before was figurative. Here the
prophet speaks without a metaphor, and fixes the time when this should
be accomplished. It is not usual for the prophets to designate the exact
"time" of the fulfillment of their prophecies in this manner.

According to the years of an hireling - Exactly; observing the precise
time specified [Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md). See the
phrase explained on [Isa 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md).

All the glory - The beauty, pride, strength, wealth, etc.

Of Kedar - Kedar was a son of Ishmael [Gen
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015.md). He was the father of the
Kedareneans or "Cedrai," mentioned by Pithy ("Nat. Hist." v. 11). They
dwelt in the neighborhood of the Nabatheans, in Arabia Deserta. These
people lived in tents, and were a wandering tribe, and it is not
possible to fix the precise place of their habitation. They resided, it
is supposed, in the south part of Arabia Deserts, and the north part of
Arabia Petrea. The name 'Kedar' seems to be used sometimes to denote
Arabia in general, or Arabia Deserts particularly (see [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md); [Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005.md); [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md); [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007.md); [Jer
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010.md); [Jer
49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md); [Eze
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#021).md).

Shall fail - Shall be consumed, destroyed (כלה kâlâh).

[Isaiah 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 21:17</span></span>

And the residue of the number - That is, those who shall be left in the
invasion. Or perhaps it may be read, 'There shall be a renmant of the
number of bowmen; the mighty people of Kedar shall be diminished.'

Of archers - Hebrew, 'Of the bow;' that is, of those who use bows in
war. The bow was the common instrument in hunting and in war among the
ancients.

Shall be diminished - Hebrew, 'Shall be made small;' they shall be
reduced to a very small number. We cannot indeed determine the precise
historical event to which this refers, but the whole connection and
circumstances seem to make it probable that it referred to the invasion
by the Assyrian when he went up against Judah, or when he was on his way
to Egypt.
