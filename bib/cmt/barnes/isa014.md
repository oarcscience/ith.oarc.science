### [Isaiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 14:0</span></span>

This chapter Isa. 14 is a continuation of the prophecy respecting
Babylon, which was commenced in the previous chapter. The prophecy is
concluded at [Isa 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027.md). A
considerable portion of the chapter is a poem of unequalled beauty and
sublimity. It is to be remembered that this prophecy was uttered at
least 174 years before they were carried into captivity; and the design
of the prophet is, to declare the certainty of their release after they
should be subjected to this bondage. He, doubtless, intended that this
prophecy should be borne with them, in memory at least, to Babylon, and
that it should comfort and sustain them when there (see the Introduction
to Isa. 13). He, therefore, opens the vision by a summary statement of
the certainty of their deliverance [Isa
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md). This general declaration
respecting the deliverance of the Jews, is followed by a triumphant song
on that subject, that is singularly beautiful in its imagery, and
sublime in its conception. 'It moves in lengthened elegiac measure, like
a song of lamentation for the dead, and is full of lofty scorn and
contumely from beginning to the end.' - (Herder's "Spirit of Hebrew
Poetry," by Marsh, vol. ii. p. 206.) It may be called the triumphal song
of the Jews when delivered from their long and oppressive bondage. The
parts and design of this poem may be thus expressed:

I. A chorus of Jews is introduced, expressing their surprise at the
sudden and entire downfall of Babylon, and the complete destruction of
the proud and haughty city. The whole earth is full of joy and rejoicing
that the city, so long distinguished for oppressions and arrogance, is
laid low; and even "the cedars" of Lebanon are introduced as uttering a
most severe taunt over the fallen tyrant, and expressing their security
now that he is no more [Isa 14:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md).

II\. The scene is immediately changed from earth to hell. Hades, or the
region of the dead, is represented as moved at the descent of the
haughty king of Babylon to those abodes. Departed monarchs rise from
their thrones, and insult him on being reduced from his pride and
magnificence to the same low state as themselves [Isa
14:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md). This portion of the ode is
one of the boldest personifications ever attempted in poetry: and is
executed with remarkable brevity and force - so much so that we almost
seem to "see" the illustrious shades of the dead rise from their couches
to meet the descending king of Babylon.

III\. The Jews now resume the speech [Isa
14:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md). They address the king of
Babylon as fallen from heaven - like the bright star of the morning.
They speak of him as the most magnificent and proud of the monarchs of
the earth. They introduce him as expressing the most extravagant
purposes of ambition; as designing to ascend to heaven, and to make his
throne above the stars; and as aiming at equality with God. They then
speak of him as cast down to hell, and as the object of reproach by all
those who shall behold him.

IV\. The scene is again changed. Certain persons are introduced who are
represented as seeing the fallen king of Babylon - as looking narrowly
upon him, to make themselves sure that it was he - and as taunting him
with his proud designs and his purposes to make the world a wilderness
[Isa 14:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015.md). They see him cast out
and naked; lying among the undistinguished dead, and trodden under feet;
and contrast his condition with that of monarchs who are usually
deposited in a splendid mausoleum. But the once haughty king of Babylon
is represented as denied even a common burial, and as lying
undistinguished in the streets.

V. The whole scene of the poem is closed by introducing God as purposing
the certain ruin of Babylon; as designing to cut off the whole of the
royal family, and to convert the whole city into pools of water, and a
habitation for the bittern [Isa
14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md). This is declared to be the
purpose of Yahweh; and a solemn declaration is made, that when "he"
makes a purpose none can disannul it.

VI\. A confirmation of this is added [Isa
14:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024.md) in a fragment respecting the
destruction of the army of the Assyrian under Sennacherib, by which the
exiles in Babylon would be comforted with the assurance, that he who had
destroyed the Assyrian host with such ease could also effect his
purposes respecting Babylon (see the remarks introductory to [Isa
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024).md).

'I believe it may be affirmed,' says Lowth, that there is no poem of its
kind extant in any language, in which the subject is so well laid out,
and so happily conducted, with such a richness of invention, with such a
variety of images, persons, and distinct actions, with such rapidity and
ease of transition in so small a compass, as in this ode of Isaiah. For
beauty of disposition, strength of coloring, greatness of sentiment,
brevity, perspicuity, and force of expression, it stands, among all the
monuments of antiquity, unrivaled.'

The king of Babylon, who was the subject of this prediction, and who
reigned when Babylon was taken, was Belshazzar (see Dan. 5; and the
notes at [Isa 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 14:1</span></span>

For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob - That is, he will pity the
captive Jews in Babylon. He will not abandon them, but will remember
them, and restore them to their own land.

And will yet choose Israel - Will show that he regards them as still his
chosen people; or will again "choose" them by recovering them from their
bondage, and by restoring them to their country as his people. The names
'Jacob' and 'Israel' here simply denote the Jews. They do not imply that
all of those who were to be carried captive would return, but that as a
people they would be restored.

And set them ... - Hebrew, 'Will cause them to rest in their own
country;' that is, will give them peace, quietness, and security there.

And the stranger shall be joined to them - The 'stranger,' here,
probably refers to those foreigners who would become proselytes to their
religion, while they were in Babylon. Those proselytes would be firmly
united with them, and would return with them to their own land. Their
captivity would be attended with this advantage, that many even of those
who led them away, would be brought to embrace their religion, and to
return with them to their own country. If it is asked what "evidence"
there is that any considerable number of the people of Chaldea became
Jewish proselytes, I answer, that it is expressly stated in [Est
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#017.md) : 'And many of the people of the
land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them. Ezra, indeed,
has not mentioned the fact, that many of the people of Babylonia became
proselytes to the religion of the Jews, but it is in accordance with all
that we know of their history, and their influence on the nations with
which, from time to time, they were connected, that many should have
been thus joined to them. We know that in subsequent times many of other
nations became proselytes, and that multitudes of the Egyptians, the
Macedonians, the Romans, and the inhabitants of Asia Minor, embraced the
Jewish religion, or became what were called 'proselytes of the gate.'
They were circumcised, and were regarded as entitled to a part of the
privileges of the Jewish people (see [Act
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md); compare [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004.md), [Act
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#017).md). Tacitus, speaking of his time,
says, that every abandoned man, despising the religion of his country,
bears tribute and revenue to Jerusalem, whence it happens that the
number of the Jews is greatly increased.' - ("Hist." v. 5.) That the
Jews, therefore, who were in Babylon should induce many of the Chaldeans
during their long captivity to become proselytes, is in accordance with
all their history.

[Isaiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 14:2</span></span>

And the people shall take them - That is, the people in Babylon.

And bring them to their place - That is, they shall attend them to the
land of Judea, and aid in restoring them to their own country. There is
reference here, doubtless, to the fact that Cyrus would assist them
(compare [Ezr 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md), and that many
of the inhabitants of Chaldea who would become proselytes, would be
willing to accompany them to their own land.

And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord - Not
in a foreign land, and among strangers and foes, but in their own land,
and among the institutions of their own religion. They would be willing
to return with them, and occupy a humble place among them, as servants,
for the sake of enjoying the privileges of the true religion. It was a
matter of course among the Hebrews, that proselytes would be regarded as
occupying a less elevated place in society than native-born Jews.

And they shall take them captive ... - That is, they shall induce them
to become proselytes; to be willing to accompany them to their own
homes, and to become their servants there. It does not mean that they
would subdue them by force; but they would be able, by their influence
there, to disarm their opposition; and to induce them to become the
friends of their religion.

And they shall rule over their oppressors - This is one instance where
the people of God would show that they could disarm their oppressors by
a mild and winning demeanour, and in which they would be able to induce
others to join with them. Such would be the force of their example and
conduct, of their conversation and of their deportment, even in the
midst of proud and haughty Babylon, that their oppressors would be won
to embrace the religion of their captives. If, in proud and haughty
Babylon, those who loved the Lord could thus do good; if, when they were
"captives," they could have such an influence over their haughty
masters, where is there a place in which the friends of God may not be
useful by their example, their conversation, and their prayers?

[Isaiah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 14:3</span></span>

And it shall come to pass - That is, then thou shalt take up a taunting
song against the king of Babylon [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md).

That the Lord shall give thee rest - (compare [Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012).md). The nature of this predicted
rest, is more fully described in [Eze
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025.md).

From thy sorrow - The long pain of thy captivity in Babylon.

And from thy fear - Hebrew, 'Trembling.' That is, the apprehension of
the ills to which they were continually exposed. Trembling is usually
one effect of fear.

And from thy hard bondage - The severe and galling servitude of seventy
years.

[Isaiah 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 14:4</span></span>

That thou shalt take up - Thou shalt utter, declare, or commence. The
word 'take up,' is used in the sense of utter, speak, or declare, in
[Exo 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md); [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md); [Psa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md).

This proverb - (המשׁל hamâshâl). Vulgate, 'Parable.' Septuagint Τὸν
ρῆνον ton thrēnon - 'Lamentation.' The Hebrew word משׁל mâshâl, usually
rendered "proverb," is also rendered "a parable," or "a by-word." It
properly denotes "a metaphor, a comparison, a similitude;" and is
applied usually to a brief and pungent sentiment or maxim, where wisdom
is embodied in few words. In these the ancients abounded. They had few
books; and hence arose the necessity of condensing as much as possible
the sentiments of wisdom, that they might be easily remembered, and
transmitted to future times. These maxims were commonly expressed in
figurative language, or by a brief comparison, or short parable, as they
are with us. The word also means, figurative discourse generally; and
hence, a song or poem [Num 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md), [Num
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018.md); [Job
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md); [Job
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#001.md); [Psa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md). It is also used to denote a
satire, or a song of triumph over enemies [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md); [Heb
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#006.md); [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017.md). It is evidently used in this
sense here - to denote a taunting speech, a song of triumph over the
prostrate king of Babylon. In this beautiful song, there are all the
elements of the most pungent satire, and all the beauties of the highest
poetry.

Against the king of Babylon - Over the king of Babylon, or in regard to
him. It is not certain that any particular king of Babylon is here
intended. If there was, it was probably Belshazzar, in whose reign the
city was taken (see the notes at [Isa
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022).md). It may, however, be designed
to denote the Babylonian empire - the kingdom that had oppressed the
Jews; and thus the king may be referred to as the head of the nation,
and as the representative of the whole people.

How hath the oppressor ceased! - The word 'oppressor' (נגשׂ nogēs')
denotes, properly, the "exactor of tribute," and refers here to the fact
that Babylon had oppressed its dependent provinces, by exacting large
revenues from them, and thus cruelly oppressing them.

Ceased - Ceased to exact tribute; or (Hebrew) 'is at rest.' It is now at
rest, and no more puts forth its power in oppressing its dependent
provinces.

The golden city - Babylon. The word used here (מדהבה madehēbâh) occurs
nowhere else in the Bible. According to the Jewish Commentators, it
means "an exactress of gold," as if derived from דהב dehab, used for זהב
zehab, gold. Gesenius and Michaelis prefer another reading (מרהבה
marehēbâh), from (רהב râhab), and suppose that it means oppression. The
Vulgate renders it "tribute" - 'The tribute hath ceased.' The Septuagint
Ἐπισπουδαστής Epispoudastēs - 'Solicitor, or exactor (of gold).'
Vitringa supposes that the word means "gold," and that it refers to the
golden scepter of its kings that had now ceased to be swayed over the
prostrate nations. The most probable sense is, that it means the
exactress of gold, or of tribute. This best expresses the force of the
word, and best agrees with the parallelism. In this sense it does not
refer to the magnificence of the city, but to its oppressive acts in
demanding tribute of gold from its dependent provinces.

[Isaiah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 14:5</span></span>

The Lord hath broken - Yahweh, by the hand of Cyrus.

The staff of the wicked - That is, the scepter of the king of Babylon.
The word rendered 'staff' (מטה maṭēh) may mean either a bough, stick,
staff, rod, or a scepter. The scepter was the symbol of supreme power.
It was in the form of a staff, and was made of wood, ivory, or gold. It
here means that Yahweh had taken away the power from Babylon, and
destroyed his dominion.

[Isaiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 14:6</span></span>

He who smote - This may either refer to the king of Babylon, or to the
rod or scepter which he had used, and which was now broken. Herder
refers it to the scepter, 'that which smote the nations.' (On the
meaning of the word "smote," see the notes at [Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020).md)

The people - The nations that were subject to his authority.

With a continual stroke - Margin, 'A stroke without removing.' Vulgate,
Plaga insanabili - 'With an incurable plague.' - Septuagint the same -
Πληγῇ ἀνιάτῳ Plēgē aniatō. The Hebrew is, as in the margin, 'A smiting
without removing,' or without cessation. There was no relaxation in its
oppressions, it was always engaged in acts of tyranny.

He that ruled the nations - Babylon was the capital of a vast empire,
and that empire was composed of many dependent nations.

Is persecuted - By those that make war upon it. Its turn had come to be
oppressed, and overthrown.

And none hindereth - No nation opposes the invader. None of the
dependent kingdoms of Babylon have any real attachment to it, but all
rejoice at its downfall. The most mighty kingdom of the earth is
helpless and ruined. What a change was this! How sudden and striking the
revolution! And what a warning to proud and guilty cities!

[Isaiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 14:7</span></span>

The whole earth is at rest - The kingdom of Babylonia, or Chaldea,
extended nearly over the whole pagan world. Now that Babylon was fallen,
and that those oppressions would cease, the world is represented as in
peace and quietness.

They break forth into singing - That is, the inhabitants of all the
nations that were subject to Babylon now rejoice that they are released
from its galling and oppressive yoke.

[Isaiah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 14:8</span></span>

Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee - They join with the inhabitants of
the nations in rejoicing at thy downfall - for they now, like those
inhabitants, are suffered to remain undisturbed. (On the word rendered
"fir trees," see the notes at [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029)..md) It is evident that a species of
evergreen is meant; and probably some species that grew in Syria or
Palestine. The idea is plain. The very forest is represented as
rejoicing. It would be safe from the king of Babylon. He could no longer
cut it down to build his palaces, or to construct his implements of war.
This figure of representing the hills and groves, the trees, the
mountains, and the earth, as exulting, or as breaking forth into joy, is
common in the Scriptures:

Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;

Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein:

Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice

Before the Lord.

[Psa 96:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md).

Let the floods clap their hands.

Let the hills be joyful together

Before the Lord.

[Psa 98:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md).

Praise the Lord from the earth,

Ye dragons and all deeps;

Fire and hail; snow and vapor;

Stormy wind fulfilling his word:

Mountains and all hills;

Fruitful trees and all cedars.

[Psa 148:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md).

(Compare [Ch1 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#031.md); [Hab
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010)..md)

The cedars of Lebanon - (note, [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md). The cedars of Lebanon were
much celebrated for building; and it is not impossible that the king of
Babylon had obtained timber from that mountain with which to construct
his palaces at Babylon. They are now represented as rejoicing that he is
fallen, since they would be safe and undisturbed. A similar figure of
speech occurs in Virgil, "Ecl." v. 68:

Peace, peace, mild Daphnis loves; with joyous cry.

The untill'd mountains strike the echoing sky;

And rocks and towers the triumph spread abroad -

'A god! Menalcas! Daphnis is a god!'

Wrangham

It is a beautiful figure; and is a fine specimen of the poetry of the
Hebrews, where everything is animated, and full of life.

Since thou art laid down - Since thou art dead.

No feller - No one to cut us down. Jowett ("Chris. Res.") makes the
following remarks on this passage on his visit to Lebanon: 'As we passed
through the extensive forest of fir trees situated between Deir-el-Karat
and Ainep, we had already heard, at some distance, the stroke of one
solitary axe, resounding from hill to hill. On reaching the spot, we
found a peasant, whose labor had been so far successful, that he had
felled his tree and lopped his branches. He was now hewing it in the
middle, so as to balance the two halves upon his camel, which stood
patiently by him waiting for his load. In the days of Hiram, king of
Tyre, and subsequently under the kings of Babylon, this romantic
solitude was not so peaceful; that most poetic image in Isaiah, who
makes these very trees vocal, exulting in the downfall of the destroyer
of nations, seems now to be almost realized anew - "Yea, the fir trees
rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid
down, no feller is come up against us."'

[Isaiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 14:9</span></span>

Hell from beneath - The scene is now changed. The prophet had
represented the people of all the subject nations as rejoicing that the
king of Babylon had fallen, and had introduced even the trees of the
forest as breaking forth into joy at this event. He now transfers the
scene to the mournful regions of the dead; follows the spirit of the
departed king of Babylon - the man who once gloried in the magnificence
of his kingdom and his court, and who was more distinguished for pride
and arrogance than all other monarchs - down to the land of darkness,
and describes his reception there. This portion of the ode is signally
sublime, and is managed with great power and skill. It is unequalled,
perhaps, by any writings for boldness, majesty, and, at the same time,
for its severe sarcasm. The word 'hell' here (שׁאול she'ôl) is rendered
by the Vulgate, "infernus;" and by the Septuagint, ὁ ᾅδης ho Hadēs,
"Hades."

It properly means the grave, and then the dark regions of the lower
world - the region of ghosts and shades a place where thick darkness
reigns. The verb from which it is derived means, properly, "to ask, to
demand, to require, to seek;" and this name (שׁאול she'ôl) is supposed
to have been given to the grave, and to the regions of departed spirits,
from the insatiable demand which they are constantly making of the
living (see the note at [Isa 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md),
where the word is explained). The word denotes, says Taylor ("Heb.
Con."), 'The underground parts of the earth, otherwise called the
nether, or lower parts of the earth; the earth beneath in opposition to
the earth above, where people and other animals live. In "sheol" are the
foundations of the mountains [Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md). In "sheol "men penetrate by
digging into the earth [Amo 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md). Into
"sheol" the roots of trees do strike down [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md).

Into "sheol," Korah, Dathan, and Abiram went down alive [Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md), [Num
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033.md). In "sheol" the body is
corrupted and consumed by worms [Job
17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013.md); [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md); [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md). They that rest together in the
dust are said "to go down to the bars, or strong gates of sheol" [Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016.md). In "sheol" there is no
knowledge, nor can any praise God or give thanks there [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md); [Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010.md); [Isa
38:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md). "Sheol" and the pit, death
and corruption, are synonymous [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md); [Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md); [Pro
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#012.md); [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md); [Eze
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md). A grave is one particular
cavity purposely digged for the interment of a dead person; "sheol" is a
collective name for all the graves. He that is in the grave is in
"sheol;" but he that is in "sheol" may not be in a grave, but in any
pit, or in the sea. In short, it is the region of the dead; which is
figuratively considered as a city or large habitation with gates and
bars in which there are many chambers [Pro
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#027.md).' "Sheol" is never full, but is
always asking or craving more [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md); [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md). Here it means, not a place of
punishment, but the region of the dead, where the ghosts of the departed
are considered as residing together.

From beneath - From beneath the earth. "Sheol" was always represented as
being "in" or "under" the ground, and the grave was the avenue or door
that led to it (see the note at [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014)..md)

Is moved for thee - Is roused to meet thee; is surprised that a monarch
once so proud and magnificent is descending to it. The image here is
taken from the custom of the ancients in burying, especially of burying
princes and kings. This was usually done in caves or sepulchres
excavated from a rock (see the notes and illustrations on [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004).md). Mr. Stephens, in his "Travels
in Egypt, Arabia Petrea, and the Holy land," has given an account of the
manner in which he passed a night in Petra, which may serve to
illustrate this passage: 'We ascended the valley, and rising to the
summit of the rocky rampart, of Petra, it was almost dark when we found
ourselves opposite a range of tombs in the suburbs of the city. Here we
dismounted; and selecting from among them one which, from its finish and
dimensions, must have been the last abode of some wealthy Edomite, we
prepared to pass the night within its walls.

In the front part of it was a large chamber, about twenty-five feet
square, and ten feet high; and behind this was another of smaller
dimensions, furnished with receptacles of the dead, not arranged after
the manner of shelves along the wall, as in the catacombs I had seen in
Italy and Egypt, but cut lengthwise in the rock, like ovens, so as to
admit the insertion of the body with the feet foremost. My plans for the
morrow being all arranged, the Bedouins stretched themselves out in the
outer chamber, while I went within; and seeking out a tomb as far back
as I could find, I crawled in feet first, and found myself very much in
the condition of a man buried alive. I had just room enough to turn
round; and the worthy old Edomite for whom the tomb was made, never
slept in it more quietly than I did.' (Vol. ii. pp. 82, 83, 86.) To
understand the passage before us, we are to form the idea of an immense
and gloomy cavern, all around which are niches or cells made to receive
the bodies of the dead. In this vast vault monarchs repose in grandeur
suitable to their former rank, each on his couch, 'in glory,' with their
arms beside them (see [Isa 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018).md).
These mighty shades - these departed monarchs - are represented as
rising from their couches to meet the descending king of Babylon, and
receive him with insults on his fall. The Hebrew word for "moved"
denotes more than our translation conveys. It means that they were
"agitated" - they "trembled" - they advanced toward the descending
monarch with trepidation. The idea of the shades of the mighty dead thus
being troubled, and rising to meet the king of Babylon, is one that is
exceedingly sublime.

It stireth up - "Sheol" stirreth up; that is, they are stirred up or
excited. So the Septuagint renders it 'All the giants who rule the earth
rise up to thee.'

The dead - Hebrew, רפאים repā'ı̂ym. The Septuagint renders this, Ὁι
γίγαντες hoi gigantes 'giants.' So the Vulgate and the Chaldee, The
meaning of this word has been a subject of great difference of opinion
among lexicographers. It is sometimes found as a gentile noun to denote
the sons of Raphah, called "Rephaim" [Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md), [Sa2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018.md), a Canaanite race of giants that
lived beyond Jordan [Gen 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md); [Gen
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#020.md), from whom Og the son of Bashan
was descended [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md). It is
sometimes used to denote all the giant tribes of Canaan [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011.md), [Deu
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md); and is particularly applied to
people of extraordinary strength among the Philistines [Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md), [Sa2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018.md). Vitringa supposes that the term
was given to the spirits of the dead on account of the fact that they
appeared to be "larqer" than life; that they in their form and stature
resembled giants. But a more probable opinion is, that it is applied to
the shades of the dead as being weak, feeble, or without power or
sensation, from the word רפא râpâ', weak, feeble, powerless. This
interpretation is strongly confirmed by the place before us [Isa
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md), 'Art thou become weak as we?'
The word is rendered 'giants' in the following places: [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011.md), [Deu
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020.md); [Deu
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013.md); [Jos
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004.md); [Jos
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md); [Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md); [Jos
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016.md); [Sa2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md), [Sa2
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018.md), [Sa2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#020.md), [Sa2
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#022.md); [Ch1
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005.md), [Ch1
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#008.md). It is rendered 'Rephaims,' [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md); [Gen
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#020.md); [Sa2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018.md), [Sa2
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md); [Sa2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013.md). It is rendered 'the dead' [Job
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md); [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md); [Pro
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md); [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md); [Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016.md); Isa. 26:29; and once it is
rendered 'deceased,' [Isa 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md). It
here means the departed spirits of the dead - the inhabitants of that
dark and dismal region, conceived by the Hebrews to be situated beneath
the ground, where dwell the departed dead before their final destiny is
fixed - called "sheol" or "hades." It is not the residence of the wicked
only - the place of punishment - but the place where all the dead are
supposed to be congregated before their final doom is pronounced.

(The author entertains unique views of the state of knowledge among the
Hebrews regarding the future world - views which will be found fully
canvassed in the preface to the volumes on Job. As to the alleged notion
of all the dead dwelling in some dismal region before their final doom
is pronounced, we have there taken pains to show that the righteous in
ancient times entertained no such gloomy expectations. The opinions of
the ancient Hebrews on this subject, must be taken from passages in
which they expressly treat of it, and intimate plainly what their belief
is, and not from passages confessedly full of poetical imagery. Nor are
we to construe popular and poetical phraseology so strictly and
literally as to form a theological creed out of it, in contradiction to
the actual belief of those who daily used that phraseology. Because
Englishmen speak of the dead "indiscriminately" as having "gone to the
grave," and "to the land of spirits," must we, out of this, construct a
Popish purgatory as the national belief?

Yet this would be just as reasonable in the case of the English, as in
the case of the Jews. The reader will appreciate the following
observations of Professor Alexander on the place: 'Two expressions have
been faithfully transcribed by interpreters, from one another, in
relation to this passage, with a very equivocal effect upon its
exposition. The one is, that it is full of biting sarcasm - an
unfortunate suggestion of Calvin's, which puts the reader on the scent
for irony, and even wit, instead of opening his mind to impressions of
sublimity and tragic grandeur. The other, for which Calvin is in no
degree responsible, is, that we have before us not a mere prosopopeia,
or poetical creation of the highest order, but a chapter from the
popular belief of the Jews, as to the locality, contents, and
transactions of the unseen world. Thus Gesenius, in his Lexicon and
Commentary, gives a minute topographical description of "Sheol," as the
Hebrews believed it to exist.

With equal truth, a diligent compiler might construct a map of hell, as
conceived of by the English Puritans, from the descriptive portions of
the Paradise Lost. The infidel interpreters of Germany regard the
scriptural and Classical mythology precisely in the same light. But when
Christian writers copy their expressions or ideas, they should take
pains to explain whether the popular belief of which they speak was true
or false, and, if false, how it could lie countenanced and sanctioned by
inspired writers. This kind of exposition is, moreover, chargeable with
a rhetorical incongruity, in landing the creative genius of the poet,
and yet making all his grand creations commonplace articles of popular
belief. The true view of the matter, as determined both by piety and
taste, appears to be, that the passage now before ns comprehends two
elements, and only two religious verities or certain facts, and poetical
embellishments. The admission of a "tertium quid," in the shape of
superstitious fables, is as false in rhetoric as in theology.')

The chief ones of the earth. - Margin, 'Leaders,' or 'great goats.' The
Hebrew word means properly "great goats," or goats that are leaders of
the flock. Perhaps there is intended to be a slight degree of sarcasm in
applying this word to princes and monarchs. It is nowhere else applied
to princes, though the word is often used or applied to rams, or to the
chief goats of a flock.

From their thrones - In "hades," or "sheol." They are there represented
as occupying an eminence similar to that which distinguished them on
earth.

[Isaiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 14:10</span></span>

All they shall speak ... - Language of astonishment that one so proud,
and who apparently never expected to die, should be brought down to that
humiliating condition. It is a severe taunt at the great change which
had taken place in a haughty monarch.

[Isaiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 14:11</span></span>

Thy pomp - Thy magnificence (see the note at [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md).

The noise of thy viols - Instruments of music were often used in their
feasts; and the meaning here is, that instead of being surrounded with
splendor, and the instruments of music, the monarch was now brought down
to the corruption and stillness of the grave. The instrument referred to
by the word 'viol' (נבל nēbel, plur. נבלים nebalı̂ym, Greek νάβλα nabla,
Latin nablium), was a stringed instrument usually with twelve strings,
and played by the pecten or by the hand (see the notes and illustrations
on [Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012).md). Additional force is
given by all these expressions if they are read, as Lowth reads them, as
questions asked in suprise, and in a taunting manner, over the haughty
king of Babylon - 'Is thy pride then brought down to the grave?' etc.

The worm - This word, in Hebrew (רמה rimmâh), denotes a worm that is
found in putrid substances [Exo 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#025.md);
[Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md); [Job
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026.md).

Is spread under thee - Is become thy couch - instead of the gorgeous
couch on which thou wert accustomed to repose.

And the worm - (תולעה tôlê‛âh) - the same word which occurs in [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md), and rendered there as "crimson"
(see the note on that verse). This word is usually applied to the insect
from which the crimson dye was obtained; but it is also applied to the
worm which preys upon the dead [Exo
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#020.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md).

Cover thee - Instead of the splendid covering which was over thee when
reposing on thy couch in thy palace. What could be more humiliating than
this language? How striking the contrast between his present situation
and that in which he reposed in Babylon! And yet this language is as
applicable to all others as to that prond and haughty king. It is
equally true of the great and mighty everywhere; of the rich, the
frivolous, the beautiful, and the proud who lie on beds of down, that
they will soon lie where worms shall be their couch and their covering.
How ought this reflection to humble our pride! How should it lead us to
be prepared for that hour when the grave shall be our bed; and when far
away from the sound of the viol and the harp; from the sweet voice of
friendship and the noise of revelry, we shall mingle with our native
dust!

[Isaiah 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 14:12</span></span>

How art thou fallen from heaven - A new image is presented here. It is
that of the bright morning star; and a comparison of the once
magnificent monarch with that beautiful star. He is now exhibited as
having fallen from his place in the east to the earth. His glory is
dimmed; his brightness quenched. Nothing can be more poetic and
beautiful than a comparison of a magnificent monarch with the bright
morning star! Nothing more striking in representing his death, than the
idea of that star falling to the earth!

Lucifer - Margin, 'Day-star' (הילל hēylēl, from הלל hâlal, "to shine").
The word in Hebrew occurs as a noun nowhere else. In two other places
[Eze 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012.md); [Zac
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#002.md), it is used as a verb in the
imperative mood of Hiphil, and is translated 'howl' from the verb ילל
yālal, "to howl" or "cry." Gesenius and Rosenmuller suppose that it
should be so rendered here. So Noyes renders it, 'Howl, son of the
morning!' But the common translation seems to be preferable. The
Septuagint renders it, Ἑωσφόρος Heōsphoros, and the Vulgate, 'Lucifer,
the morning star.' The Chaldee, 'How art thou fallen from high, who wert
splendid among the sons of men.' There can be no doubt that the object
in the eve of the prophet was the bright morning star; and his design
was to compare this magnificent oriental monarch with that. The
comparison of a monarch with the sun, or the other heavenly bodies, is
common in the Scriptures.

Son of the morning - This is a Hebraism (see the note at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).md), and signifies that that bright
star is, as it were, the production, or the offspring of morning; or
that it belongs to the morning. The word 'son' often thus denotes
possession, or that one thing belongs to another. The same star in one
place represents the Son of God himself; [Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016.md) : 'I am - the bright and morning
star.'

Which didst weaken the nations - By thy oppressions and exactions,
rendering once mighty nations feeble.

[Isaiah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 14:13</span></span>

For thou hast said in thine heart - It was thy purpose or design.

I will ascend into heaven - Nothing could more strikingly show the
arrogance of the monarch of Babylon than this impious design. The
meaning is, that he intended to set himself up as supreme; he designed
that all should pay homage to him; be did not intend to acknowledge the
authority of God. It is not to be understood literally; but it means
that he intended "not" to acknowledge any superior either in heaven or
earth, but designed that himself and his laws should be regarded as
supreme.

Above the stars of God - The stars which God has made. This expression
is equivalent to the former that he would ascend into heaven.

I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation - The word rendered
'congregation' מועד mô‛êd from יעד yâ‛ad "to fix, appoint"), properly
means a fixed or definite time; then an "appointed" place of meeting;
then a meeting itself; an assembly, a congregation. What is referred to
here it is difficult to determine. The Septuagint renders it, 'On a high
mountain, on the lofty regions which lie to the north.' The Chaldee, 'I
will sit in the mount of covenant, in the regions of the north.' Grotius
supposes that when the king of Babylon said he would ascend into heaven,
he meant the land of Judea, which was called heaven because it was
dedicated to God; that when he said be would ascend above the stars, he
meant to denote those 'who were learned in the law;' that by the 'mount
of the congregation,' he meant mount Moriah where was the temple; and
that by the 'side of the north,' he meant mount Zion, which, he says,
was on the north of Jerusalem. It is remarkable that the usually
accurate Grotius should have fallen into this error, as mount Zion was
not on the north of Jerusalem, but was south of mount Moriah. Vitringa
defends the same interpretation in the main, but supposes that by the
'mount of the congregation' is meant mount Zion, and by 'the sides of
the north;' is meant mount Moriah lying north of Zion. He supposes that
mount Zion is called 'the mount of the congregation,' not because the
congregation of Israel assembled there, but because it was the
"appointed place" where God met his people, or where he manifested
himself to them, and appeals to the following places where the word
which is here lrcndered 'congregation' is applied, in various forms, to
the manifestation which God thus made [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md); [Exo
29:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042.md); [Psa
74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md). So Lowth supposes that it refers
to the place where God promised to meet with his people [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md); [Exo
29:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042.md), and to commune with them,
and translates it 'the mount of the divine presence.' But to this
interpretation there are great objections:

\(1\) The terms here employed 'the mount of the congregation,' 'the
sides of the north,' are not elsewhere applied to mount Zion, and to
mount Moriah.

\(2\) It does not correspond with the evident design of the king of
Babylon. His object was not to make himself master of Zion and Moriah,
but it was to exalt himself above the stars; to be elevated above all
inferior beings; and to be above the gods.

\(3\) It is a most forced and unnatural interpretation to call the land
of Judea 'heaven,' to speak of it as being 'above the stars of God,' or
as 'above the heights of the clouds;' and it is clear that the king of
Babylon had a much higher ambition, and much more arrogant pretensions,
than the conquest of what to him would be the comparatively limited
province of Judea.

However important that land appeared to the Jews as their country and
their home; or however important it was as the place of the solemnities
of the true religion, yet we are to remember that it had no such
consequence in the eyes of the king of Babylon. He had no belief in the
truth of the Jewish religion, and all Judea compared with his other vast
domains would appear to be a very unimportant province. It is evident,
therefore, I think, that the king of Babylon did not refer here to
Judea, or to Zion. The leading idea of his heart, which ought to guide
our interpretation, was, that he designed "to ascend in authority over
all inferior beings, and to be like the Most High." We are to remember
that Babylon was a city of idolatry; and it is most probable that by
'the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north,' there is
reference to a belief prevalent in Babylon that the gods had their
residence on some mountain of the north.

This was a common opinion among the ancients. The Hindus call that
mountain "Meru;" the Persians, who are followers of Zoroaster, "Al
Bordsch;" the Arabs, "Kafe;" and the Greeks, "Olympus." The common
opinion was that this mountain was in the center of the world, but the
Hindoos speak of it as to the north of themselves in the Himalaya
regions; the followers of Zoroaster in the mountains of Caucasus, lying
to the north of their country; and the Greeks speak of Olympus, the
highest mountain north of them in Thessaly. The Hindoo belief is thus
referred to by Ward: 'In the book of Karma-Vipaka, it is said that the
heavenly Vishnu, Brahma, and Siva, are upon the three peaks of the
mountain Su-Meru, and that at the foot of this mountain are the heavens
of twenty-one other gods.' ("View of the History, Literature, and
Religion of the Hindoos," vol. i. p. 13.) So Wilford, in a Treatise on
the mountain Caucasus, in the "Asiatic Researches," vol. vi. p. 488,
says, 'The Hindoos regard the mountain Meru as the dwelling-place of the
gods.

In the Puranas it is said, that upon the mountain Meru there is eternal
day, for a space of fourteen degrees around the mountain Su-Meru, and
consequently eternal night for the same space on the opposite side; so
the Hindoos are constrained to admit that Su-Meru is directly upon the
top of the shadow of the earth, and that from the earth to that peak
there is a vast cone-formed hill, dense as other earthly bodies, but
invisible, impalpable, and impassable by mortals. On the side of this
hill are various abodes, which, the higher one ascends, become the more
beautiful, and which are made the dwellings of the blessed, according to
the degrees of their desert. God and the most exalted of the divine
beings have their abodes on the sides of the north, and on the top of
this mountain.' According to the Zendavesta, the Al Bordsch is the
oldest and the highest of the mountains; upon that is the throne of
Ormuzd, and the assemblage of the heavenly spirits (Feruer; see
Rosenmuller, "Alterthumskunde," vol. i. pp. 154-157).

Thus in Babylon, some of the mountains north in Armenia may have been
supposed to be the special dwelling-place of the gods. Such a mountain
would "appear" to be under the north pole, and the constellations would
seem to revolve around it. It is not improbable that the Aurora
Borealis, playing often as it does in the north with special
magnificence, might have contributed to the belief that this was the
special abode of the gods. Unable to account - as indeed all moderns are
- for these special and magnificent lights in the north, it accorded
with the poetic and mythological fancy of the ancients to suppose that
they were designed to play around, and to adorn the habitation of the
gods. This disposition to make the mountains of the north the seat of
the gods, may have arisen also in part from the fact that the country on
the north of Babylon was a volcanic region, and that the light emitted
from volcanoes was an appropriate manifestation of the glory of superior
invisible beings. 'On the borders of the Caspian (Sea), in the country
around the Bakir, there is a tract called The Field of Fire, which
continually emits inflammable gas, while springs of naphtha and
petroleum occur in the same vicinity, as also mud volcanoes.

In the chain of Elburs, to the south of this sea, is a lofty mountain,
which, according to Morier, sometimes emits smoke, and at the base of
which there are several craters where sulphur and saltpetre are procured
in sufficient abundance to be used in commerce.' (Lyell's Geology, vol.
i. p. 297.) We find some trades of these ideas in the Scriptures. The
north is often mentioned as the seat of the whirlwind, the storm, and
especially as the residence of the cherubim. Thus in Ezekiel's vision of
the cherubim, the whole magnificent scene is represented as coming from
the north - as if the appropriate abode of the cherubim:

'I looked, and lo! a whirlwind from the north

Came sweeping onward, a vast cloud that rolled

In volumes, charged with gleaming fire, along,

And east its splendors all around.

Brow from within shone forth, what seemed the glow

Of gold and silver molten in the flame,

And in the midst thereof the form expressed,

As of a fourfold living thing - a shape

That yet contained the semblance of a man.'

[Eze 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md), trans. in Marsh's Herder.

Thus, in [Eze 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014.md), Tyre is said to
be 'the anointed cherub that covereth,' and to have been 'upon the holy
mountain of God,' or "the gods" - evidently meaning, not Zion, but some
mountain in the vicinity of Eden (see [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md). Thus also, in [Zac
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001.md), four chariots are represented
as coming out of the mountains, the first chariot with red horses, the
second with black horses, the third with white horses, and the fourth
with bay horses. The horses that have gone through the earth are [Isa
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008.md) represented as going to the
"north" as their place of rest. These passages, particularly the one
from Ezekiel, show that the northern regions were regarded as the seat
of striking and special manifestations of the divine glory (compare [Job
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009.md), note; [Job
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022), note.md). And it is probable that,
in the view of the Babylonians, the northern mountains of Armenia, that
seemed to be near the north pole, around which the constellations
revolved, and that appeared to be surmounted and encompassed by the
splendid light of the Aurora Borealis, were regarded as the special
place where the gods held their assemblies, and from where their power
went forth through the nations. Over all their power it was the
intention of the king of Babylon to ascend, and even to rise above the
stars that performed their revolutions around the seats of the gods in
the north; to be "supreme" in that assembly of the gods, and to be
regarded there as the supreme and incontrollable director of even all
the gods. It is probable, says Mitford ("Life of Milton," vol. i. p.
73), that from this scarcely intelligible hint Milton threw up his
palace for his fallen angels: thus:

At length into the limits of the north

They came, and Satan to his royal seat,

High on a hill, far blazing as a mount

Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers,

From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold.

The palace of great Lucifer, so call

That structure in the dialect of men

Interpreted; which not long after he

Affecting an equality with God,

In imitation of that mount, whereon

Messiah was declared in sight of heaven,

The mountain of the congregation called, etc.

[Isaiah 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 14:14</span></span>

I will be like the Most High - There is a remarkable resemblance between
this language and that used in [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md), in regard to antichrist: 'He, as
God, sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.' And
this similarity is the more remarkable, because antichrist is
represented, in [Rev 17:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md), as seated
in babylon - the spiritual seat of arrogance, oppression, and pride.
Probably Paul had the passage in Isaiah in his eye when he penned the
description of antichrist.

[Isaiah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 14:15</span></span>

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell - Hebrew, 'To sheol' (compare
[Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md).

To the sides of the pit - The word 'pit,' here, is evidently synonymous
with "hell" or "hades," represented as a deep, dark region under ground.
The dead were often buried in caves, and the descent was often dark and
dreary, to the vaults where they reposed. Hence, it is always
represented as going down; or, as the "inferior" regions. The 'sides of
the pit' here stand opposed to the 'sides of the north.' He had sought
to "ascend" to the one; he should be "brought down" to the other. The
reference here is, doubtless, to the land of shades; to the dark and
dismal regions where the departed dead are supposed to dwell - to
"sheol." So the parallelism proves. But the image or figure is taken
from the custom of burying, where, in a deep natural cavern, or a
sepulchre excavated from a rock, the dead were ranged around the "sides"
of the cavern in niches or recesses excavated for that purpose (see the
note at [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 14:16</span></span>

They that see thee - That is, after thou art dead. The scene here
changes, and the prophet introduces those who would contemplate the body
of the king of Babylon after he should be slain - the passers-by
arrested with astonishment, that one so proud and haughty was at last
slain, and cast out among the common dead [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md).

Shall narrowly look upon thee - To be certain that they were not
deceived. This denotes great astonishment, as if they could scarcely
credit the testimony of their senses. It also expresses insult and
contempt. They ask whether it is possible that one who so recently shook
the kingdoms of the earth should now lie east out as unworthy of a
burial.

That made the earth to tremble - That agitated the world by his
ambition.

[Isaiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 14:17</span></span>

That made the world as a wilderness - That made cities and kingdoms
desolate.

That opened not the house of his prisoners - This is a description of
his oppression and cruelty. Of course many prisoners would be taken in
war. Instead of giving them liberty, he threw them into prison and kept
them there. This may be rendered, 'his prisoners he did not release that
they might return home' (see the Margin). The Chaldee renders it, 'To
his prisoners he did not open the door.' The sense is substantially the
same. The idea is, that he was cruel and oppressive. He threw his
captives into dungeons, and found pleasure in retaining them there.

[Isaiah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 14:18</span></span>

All the kings of the nations - That is, this is the common way in which
the kings are buried.

Lie in glory - They lie in a magnificent mausoleum; they are surrounded
with splendor even in their tombs. It is well known that vast sums of
money were expended to rear magnificent mausoleums as the burial place
of kings. With this design, probably, the pyramids of Egypt were reared;
and the temple of Bel in Babylon, we are told, was employed for this
purpose. Josephus says that vast quantities of money were buried in the
sepulchre of David. The kings of Israel were buried in a royal burying
place on Mount Zion [Ch2 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md); [Ch2
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md); [Neh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016.md). For a description of the
sepulchre of David, and of sepulchres in general, "see" Calmet's "Dict."
Art. "Sepulchre" (compare Ezek. 32.)

Every one in his own house - In a sepulchre constructed for himself. It
was usual for kings to have a splendid tomb constructed for themselves.

[Isaiah 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 14:19</span></span>

But thou art cast out of thy grave - Thou art not buried like other
kings in a magnificent sepulchre, but art cast out like the common dead.
This was a mark of the highest infamy (see [Isa
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003.md); [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md); [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019).md). Nothing was considered more
disgraceful than to be denied the privileges of an honorable burial (see
the note at [Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md). On the
fulfillment of this prophecy, see the note at [Isa
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#020.md).

As an abominable branch - (נתעב כנצר kenêtser nı̂te'āb). The Septuagint
renders this, 'And thou shalt be cast upon the mountains as a dead body
that is abominable, with many dead that are slain by the sword,
descending to Hades.' The Chaldee, 'And thou shalt be cast out of thy
sepulchre as a branch that is hid.' Lowth supposes that by 'abominable
branch' there is allusion to a tree on which a malefactor was hanged,
that was regarded as detestable, and cursed. But there are obvious
objections to this interpretation. One is, that the word "branch
(netser)" is never applied to a tree. It means "a shoot, a slip, a
scion" (note, [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md). Another
objection is, that there seems here to be no necessary allusion to such
a tree; or to anything that would lead to it. Jerome says, that the word
"netser" denotes a shoot or sucker that starts up at the root of a plant
or tree, and that is useless to the farmer, and which he therefore cuts
off. So, says he, the king of Babylon shall be cast off - as the farmer
throws away the useless sucker. This is probably the correct idea. The
word "abominable" means, therefore, not only that which is "useless,"
but indicates that the shoot or sucker is "troublesome" to the farmer.
It is an object that he "hates," and which he gets clear of as soon as
possible. So the king of Babylon would be cast out as useless, hateful,
abominable; to be thrown away, as the noxious shoot is, as unfit for
use, and unworthy to be preserved.

As the raiment of those that are slain - As a garment that is all
defiled with gore, and that is cast away and left to rot. The garments
of those slain in battle, covered with blood and dirt, would be cast
away as polluted and worthless, and so would be the king of Babylon.
Among the Hebrews such garments were regarded with special abhorrence
(Rosenmuller); perhaps from the dread which they had of touching a dead
body, and of course of anything that was found on a dead body.

Thrust through with a sword - That is, the slain thrust through. The
effect of this was to pollute the garment with blood, and to render it
useless.

That go down to the stones of the pit - The 'pit' here means the grave
or sepulchre [Isa 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015.md). The phrase
'stones of the pit,' conveys the idea that the grave or sepulchre was
usually either excavated from the solid rock, or constructed of stones.
The idea is simply, that those who were slain with the sword were buried
in the usual manner, though their bloody garments defiled were cast
away. But the king of Babylon should not have even the honor of such a
burial as was given to those who fell in battle.

As a carcase trodden under foot - Unburied; as the body of a brute that
is exposed to the air, and denied the honor of a sepulchre.

[Isaiah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 14:20</span></span>

Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial - That is, even with those
who are slain with the sword in battle, and to whom is granted the
privilege of a decent burial.

Hast destroyed thy land - Hast been a cruel, harsh, and oppressive
prince.

The seed of evil-doers - The posterity of the wicked.

Shall never be renowned - Hebrew, 'Shall never be called,' or 'named'
(לא־יקרא lo'-yı̂qārē'); that is, shall never be distinguished,
celebrated, or honored. This is a general proposition; but the prophet
here possibly designs to apply it to the king of which he is speaking,
as having been descended from ancestors that were wicked; or more
probably it is a new circumstance, more fully explained in the following
verse, that his posterity should be cut off from the honor of succeeding
him on the throne, and that they, as well as he, should be loaded with
disgrace. The design is to affirm the fact that the Babylonian dynasty
would end with him; and that his posterity would be reduced from the
honors which they had hoped to have inherited. At the same time, the
general proposition is applicable not only to the posterity of the king
of Babylon, but to all. It is a great truth pertaining to the divine
administration, that the descendants of wicked people shall be
dishonored. So it is with the posterity of a traitor, a pirate, a
drunkard, a man of profligacy. They are involved in disgrace, poverty,
and calamity, as the result of the sin of their ancestor.

[Isaiah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 14:21</span></span>

Prepare slaughter for his children - That is, cut them off not only from
inheriting the honor of their father, but from life. This command seems
to be directed to the Medes and Persians, and denotes that they would
thus cut off his children.

For the iniquity of their fathers - On account of the crimes of their
ancestors - the pride, haughtiness, and oppression of the kings of
Babylon. This is the statement of a general principle of the divine
administration, that the consequences of crime often pass over from the
perpetrator, and impinge on his descendants (see [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md).

That they do not rise - That they do not rise to occupy the places of
their fathers; that they be degraded and reduced from their elevation
and honored.

Nor fill the face of the world with cities - The Septuagint renders
this, 'And fill the land with wars.' The Chaldee, 'And fill the face of
the world with "enemies."' The Syriac, 'And fill the face of the earth
with war.' These versions evidently took the word ערים ‛ārı̂ym to mean
"enemies" or "wars" - a sense which the word sometimes may have. But the
common interpretation is to be preferred. The apprehension was, that
they would fill the land, if they lived, with such cities of pride,
magnificence, and wickedness, as "Babylon" was, and that thus crimes
would be multiplied and prolonged; and hence, the purpose of God was not
only to cut off Babylon - the "model" of all cities of arrogance and
pride - but also to cut off those who would be disposed to rear similar
cities, and to fill the land again with crime.

[Isaiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 14:22</span></span>

For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts - That is,
against the family of, the king of Babylon.

And cut off from Babylon the name - That is, all the "males" of the
royal family, so that the name of the monarch shall become extinct
(compare [Rut 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md); [Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005).md).

And remnant - All that is left of them; so that the family shall cease
to exist.

The son and nephew - Everyone of the family who could claim to be an
heir of the throne. The dynasty shall cease; and the proud and haughty
family shall become wholly extinct. This is the solemn purpose in regard
to the "family" of the monarch of Babylon. It only remains to inquire
when and how it was fulfilled.

The circumstances which it was said would exist in regard to the king of
Babylon here spoken of, are the following:

\(1\) That he would be a proud, haughty, and oppressive prince ([Isa
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#017), and throughout the prophecy.md).

\(2\) That when he died he would be east out with the common dead, and
denied the common honors of the sepulchre - especially the honors which
all other monarchs have in their burial [Isa
14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018.md).

\(3\) That his posterity would be cut off, and that he would have no one
to succeed him on his throne; or that the dynasty and the kingdom would
terminate in him [Isa 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md).

In regard to the application and the fulfillment of this prophecy there
have been three opinions.

I. That it does not refer to an "individual" sovereign, but to the kings
of Babylon in general; that the description is designed to be applicable
to the succession or the dynasty, as signally haughty, proud, and
oppressive; and that the prophet means to say that that haughty and
wicked reign of kings should cease. To this, the objections are obvious
-

\(1\) The whole aspect and course of the prophet seems to have reference
to an "individual." Such an individual the prophet seems to have
constantly in his eye. He descends to "sheol" [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md); he is proud, ambitious,
oppressive, cast out; all of which circumstances refer naturally to an
individual, and not to a "succession" or dynasty.

\(2\) The main circumstance mentioned in the prophecy is applicable only
to an individual - that he should be "unburied" [Isa
14:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018.md). It was not true of all the
kings of Babylon that they were unburied, and how could it be said
respecting a "succession" or a dynasty at all that it should be east out
of the grave as an abominable branch; and that it should not be joined
with others in burial? All the circumstances, therefore, lead us to
suppose that the prophet refers to an individual.

II\. The Jews, in general, suppose that it refers to Nebuchadnezzar. But
to this interpretation, the objections are equally obvious:

\(1\) It was not true that Nebuchadnezzar had no one to succeed him on
the throne; or that his family was totally cut off, as it was foretold
of this king of Babylon that his would be [Isa
14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#021.md).

\(2\) It was not true that he was denied the privileges of a burial
which kings commonly enjoy. To meet this difficulty, the Jews have
invented the following story Thev say that when Nebuchadnezzar was
driven from society during his derangement Dan. 4, and when he was with
the beasts of the field seven years, the people made his son,
Evil-Merodach, king; but that when Nebuchadnezzar was restored to his
right mind and to his throne, he threw Evil-Merodach into prison, where
he lay until he died. At the death of Nebuchadnezzar, the people
released him to make him king, but he refused because he did not believe
that his father was dead, and said that if his father should find him he
would kill him; and that in order to convince him that his father was
dead he was taken out of the grave. But this is manifestly a fiction.
Besides, the prophecy was not that the king should be taken out of the
grave, but that he should not be buried. Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded in
the kingdom by his son Evil-Merodach, and he by Belshazzar, in whom the
line of kings ended.

III\. The only other interpretation of which this is susceptible, is
that which refers it to Belshazzar, in whose reign the city of Babylon
was taken. This king, called in Scripture Belshazzar Dan. 5, was the son
of Evil-Merodach, and the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. His name, as it
occurs in pagan writers, was "Nabonadius." In him the circumstances of
the prophecy agree:

\(1\) He was an impious prince (Xen. Cyr. vii. Dan. 5).

\(2\) In his reign the city and the kingdom came to an end, as it was
foretold.

\(3\) Every circumstance of the taking of Babylon would lead us to
suppose that he was denied the privilege of a magnificent sepulture.

\(a\) He was slain in the night [Dan
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md).

\(b\) It was in the confusion of the capture of the city - amidst the
tumult caused by the sudden and unexpected invasion of Cyrus. It is
therefore altogether improbable that he had a regular and an honored
burial. Like the common dead, he would lie in the palace where he fell,
or in the street.

\(c\) There is no evidence that Cyrus gave him an honorable sepulchre.

\(4\) none of his posterity occupied the throne to give honor to the
memory of their father.

\(5\) in him the dynasty and the kingdom ended. Immediately the kingdom
on his death was given to the Medes and Persians [Dan
5:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#028.md). None of the names of his
posterity, if he had any, are known; and God cut off from him 'the name
and remnant, the son and nephew,' as was predicted (see Prideaux's
"Connection," i. 2. 257-271, Ed. 1815).

[Isaiah 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 14:23</span></span>

I will also make it a possession for the bittern - The word 'bittern,'
in English, means a bird with long legs and neck, that stalks among
reeds and sedge, feeding upon fish. The Hebrew word (קפד qı̂ppod), occurs
but five times [Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md). According to Bochart and
Gesenius, it means the hedgehog. It has been variously rendered. Some
have supposed it to be a land animal; some an aquatic animal; and most
have regarded it as a fowl. Bochart has proved that the hedgehog or
porcupine is found on the shores of the Euphrates. He translates this
place, 'I will place Babylon for an habitation of the porcupine, even
the pools of water;' that is, the pools that are round about Babylon
shall become so dry that porcupines may dwell there (see Bochart,
"Hieroz." iii. 36. pp. 1036-1042).

And pools of water - Bochart supposes this means, even the pools of
water shall become dry. But the common interpretation is to be
preferred, that Babylon itself should become filled with pools of water.
This was done by Cyrus' directing the waters of the Euphrates from their
channel when the city was taken, and by the fact that the waters never
returned again to their natural bed, so that the region was overflowed
with water (see the notes at Isa. 13.)

And I will sweep it with the besom of destruction - A besom is a broom;
and the sense here is, that God would entirely destroy Babylon, and
render it wholly uninbabitable.

[Isaiah 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 14:24</span></span>

The Lord of hosts - (see the note at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md). It is evident that this verse
and the three following, is not directly connected with that which goes
before, respecting Babylon. This pertains to the Assyrian; that had
relation to Babylon. Vitringa says that this is attached to the prophecy
respecting Babylon, and is a unique yet not altogether foreign argument,
and is a sort of epilogue to the prophecy respecting Babylon. The
design, he says, is this. As the events which had been foretold
respecting Babylon seemed so great and wonderful as to be almost
incredible, the prophet, in order to show the Jews how easily it could
be accomplished, refers them to the case of Sennacherib, and the ease
with which he and his army had been destroyed. Lowth supposes that the
Assyrians and Babylonians here are one people. Rosenmuller supposes that
this prophecy respecting Sennacherib has been "displaced" by the
collector of the prophecies of Isaiah, and that it should have been
attached to the prophecy respecting the Assyrian monarch (see Isa. 10.)
The probable sense of the passage is that which makes it refer to the
predicted destruction of Sennacherib Isa. 10; and the design of the
prophet in referring to that here is, to assure the Jews of the certain
destruction of Babylon, and to comfort them with the assurance that they
would be delivered from their captivity there.

The prophecy respecting Babylon was uttered "before" the destruction of
Sennacherib; but it is to be remembered that its design was to comfort
the Jews "in" Babylon. The prophet therefore throws himself "beyond" the
period of their captivity - though it was to occur many years "after"
the prophecy respecting Babylon was uttered; and with this view he
introduces the subject of the Assyrian. At that future time, Sennacherib
would have been destroyed. And as God would have fulfilled the prophecy
respecting the proud and self-confident Assyrian, so they might have the
assurance that he "would" fulfill his predictions respecting the no less
proud and self-confident king of Babylon; and as he would have delivered
his people from the invasion of the Assyrian, even when he was at the
gates of Jerusalem, so he would deliver them in their captivity in
Babylon.

Hath sworn - (see [Gen 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md); [Exo
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005.md), [Exo
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011.md); [Exo
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md); [Num
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#010.md); [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md); [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md). Yahweh is often represented as
making use of an oath to denote the strong confirmation, the absolute
certainty of what he utters. The oath here was designed to comfort the
Jews, when they should be in Babylon, with the assurance that what he
had thus solemnly promised would assuredly come to pass.

As I have thought - As I have designed, or intended. God's promises
never fail; his purposes shall all be accomplished (compare [Isa
46:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010).md). This passage is full proof
that God does not "change:" that whatever his purposes are, they are
inflexible. Change supposes imperfection; and it is often affirmed that
God is immutable [Sa1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md).

[Isaiah 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 14:25</span></span>

That I will break - That I will break his power; that I will discomfit
and destroy his army.

The Assyrian - Sennacherib (see Isa. 10.)

In my land - That is, in the land of Canaan. This is often called his
land; and this expression shows that the passage does not and cannot
refer to the king of Babylon, for he was destroyed in his own city Dan.
5)

And upon my mountains - That is, upon the mountains of Palestine. The
army of Sennacherib was destroyed on the mountains that were near to
Jerusalem (see the notes at [Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033).md).

Then shall his yoke - The yoke of the Assyrian (see the note at [Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 14:26</span></span>

This is the purpose - This is the sum of the whole design - a design
that embraces the destruction both of the king of Assyria, and of
Babylon.

Upon the whole earth - The successive kingdoms of Assyria and Babylonia
embraced the whole earth, and to destroy them would in fact affect all
the nations.

[Isaiah 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 14:27</span></span>

For the Lord of hosts - (see the note at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md).

Who shall disannul it? - Who has power to defeat his purposes? Difficult
as they may be in appearance, and incredible as their fulfillment may
seem, yet his purposes are formed in full view of all the circumstances;
and there is no power to resist his arm, or to turn him aside from the
execution of his designs. By this assurance God designed to comfort his
people when they should be in Babylon in a long and dreary captivity
(compare [Psa 137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001)..md) And by the
same consideration his people may be comforted at all times. His plans
shall stand. None can disannul them. No arm has power to resist him.
None of the schemes formed against him shall ever prosper. Whatever
ills, therefore, may befall his people; however thick, and gloomy, and
sad their calamities may be; and however dark his dispensations may
appear, yet they may bare the assurance that all his plans are wise, and
that they all shall stand. No matter how many, or how mighty may be the
foes of the church; no matter how strong their cities, or their
ramparts; no matter how numerous their armies, or how self-confident may
be their leaders, they have no power to resist God. If their plans are
in his way they will be thrown down; if revolutions are necessary among
human beings to accomplish His purposes, they will be brought about; if
cities and armies need to be destroyed in order that "his" plans may
succeed, and his church be safe, they will be demolished, just as the
army of Sennacherib was laid pale in death, and as Babylon - the
haughtiest of cities - was overthrown. Who can stand against God? and
who can resist the execution of his will?

[Isaiah 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 14:28</span></span>

In the year that king Ahaz died - This is the caption or title to the
following prophecy, which occupies the remainder of this chapter. This
prophecy has no connection with the preceding; and should have been
separated from it in the division into chapters. It relates solely to
Philistia; and the design is to comfort the Jews with the assurance that
they had nothing to apprehend from them. It is not to call the
Philistines to lamentation and alarm, for there is no evidence that the
prophecy was promulgated among them (Vitringa); but it is to assure the
Jews that they would be in no danger from their invasion under the reign
of the successor of Ahaz, and that God would more signally overthrow and
subdue them than had been done in his time. It is not improbable that at
the death of Ahaz, and with the prospect of a change in the government
on the accession of his successor, the Philistines, the natural enemies
of Judah, had meditated the invasion of the Jews. The Philistines had
been subdued in the time of Azariah [Kg2
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md), or Uzziah, as he is called in
[Ch2 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md), who was the son and
successor of Amaziah. He broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of
Gabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and effectually subdued and humbled them
[Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md). In the time of Ahaz, and
while he was engaged in his unhappy controversies with Syria and
Ephraim, the Philistines took advantage of the enfeebled state of Judah,
and made successful war on it, and took several of the towns [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md); and at his death they had hope
of being able to resist Judah, perhaps the more so as they apprehended
that the reign of Hezekiah would be mild, peaceable, and unwarlike.
Isaiah, in the prophecy before us, warns them not to entertain any such
fallacious expectations, and assures them that his reign would be quite
as disastrous to them as had been the reign of his predecessors.

Was this burden - See the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 14:29</span></span>

Rejoice not thou - Rejoice not at the death of Ahaz, king of Judah. It
shall be no advantage to thee. It shall not be the means of making an
invasion on Judah more practicable.

Whole Palestina - We apply the name "Palestine" to the whole land of
Canaan. Formerly, the name referred only to Philistia, from which we
have derived the name Palestine. The word פלשׁת peleshet means properly
the land of sojourners or strangers, from פלשׁ pālash, "to rove about,
to wander, to migrate." The Septuagint renders it, Ἀλλοφυλοι Allophuloi
- 'strangers,' or 'foreigners,' and Γῆ ἀλλοφύλων Gē allophulōn - 'land
of strangers.' Philistia was situated on the southwestern side of the
land of Canaan, extending along the Mediterranean Sea from Gaza on the
south, to Lydda on the north. The Philistines were a powerful people,
and had often been engaged in wars with Judah. They had made a
successful attack on it in the time of Ahaz; and amidst the feebleness
and distractions which they supposed might succeed on the change of the
government of Judah, and the administration of an inexperienced prince
like Hezekiah, they hoped to be still more successful, and would
naturally rejoice at the death of Ahaz. When the prophet says '" whole"
Palestina,' he means to say that no part of Philistia would have
occasion to rejoice at the succession of Hezekiah (see [Isa
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031).md).

Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken - It was not true that
they had been smitten during the reign of Ahaz, but it had been done by
his predecessor Uzziah. Perhaps the prophet refers to that prince, and
to his death. He had smitten and subdued them. At his death they would
rejoice; and their joy had been continued during the reigns of Jotham
and Ahaz. They would now rejoice the more that a young and inexperienced
prince was to ascend the throne. Their joy had been that "Uzziah" had
died, and that joy had been augmenting since his death. But the prophet
now tells them that they will have no further occasion for such joy.

For out of the serpent's root - That is, there shall spring forth from
the serpent, or shall succeed the serpent, as a shoot or sprout springs
from the root of a decayed tree (see the note at [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md). By the serpent here, is
undoutedly intended king Uzziah, who had so severely chastised the
Philistines. The word 'serpent' נחשׁ nāchâsh denotes a serpent of any
kind, and usually one far less venomous than that which is meant by the
word translated cockatrice. Probably the prophet does not give this name
"serpent" to Uzziah or to Ahaz, or the name "cockatrice" to Hezekiah,
because he regarded the names as properly descriptive of their
character, but because they were so regarded by the Philistines. They
were as odious and offensive to them, and as destructive of their plans,
as venomous reptiles would be.

Shall come forth a cockatrice - (see the note at [Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005).md). A basilisk, or adder, a serpent
of most venomous nature (see the note at [Isa
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008).md). That is, though Uzziah is dead,
yet there shall spring up from him one far more destructive to you than
he was; one who shall carry the desolations of war much further, and who
shall more effectually subdue you. Most commentators have concurred in
supposing that Hezekiah is here referred to, who 'smote the Philistines
even unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen
to the fenced city' [Kg2 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md). This
is, doubtless, the correct interpretation. The Chaldee renders it,
however, 'Because there shall proceed from the descendants of Jesse the
Messiah, and his works shall be among you as a flying serpent.' This
interpretation Rosenmuller supposes is correct; but it is evidently
foreign to the scope of the passage.

[Isaiah 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 14:30</span></span>

And the first-born of the poor shall feed - That is, there shall be
safety to those parts of Judah which have long been exposed to the
invasions of the Philistines. Philistia bordered on Judea, and was
constantly making wars upon it, so that there was no safety felt. Isaiah
now says, that Hezekiah would so effectually and completely subdue them
that there should be no danger from their invasion. The phrase 'the
first-born of the poor' is an Hebraism, a strong, emphatic expression,
denoting those who are the most poor; the most abject sons of poverty;
those who have an eminence or a double portion of need, as the
first-born among the Hebrews were entitled to special distinctions and
privileges. The idea is, that even the most poor and defenseless would
be safe.

Shall feed - That is, they shall be supplied with food; they shall feed
safely as a flock does that is guarded from wild beasts. They shall be
no longer alarmed, but shall dwell in security, peace, and plenty.

And I will kill thy root - The word rendered 'root' denotes properly the
root of a plant, which being dried up or killed, the plant of course
withers and dies. So God says that he would effectually and entirely
destroy the power of the Philistines.

Slay thy remnant - That is, shall slay all that pertains to thee. Or, he
shall dry up the root, and the branches shall wither and die also. The
whole power of the nation shall be withered and destroyed.

[Isaiah 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 14:31</span></span>

Howl, O gate - That is, ye who throng the gate. The gates of a city were
the chief places of concourse.

Cry, O city - The prophet here fixes the attention upon some principal
city of Philistia, and calls upon it to be alarmed in view of the
judgments that were about to come upon the whole land.

Art dissolved - The word 'dissolved' (מוג mûg) is applied to that which
melts, or which wastes away gradually, and then to that which faints or
disappears. It means here that the kingdom of Philistia would disappear,
or be destroyed. It probably conveys the idea of its fainting, or
becoming feeble from fear or apprehension.

From the north a smoke - From the regions of Judah, which lay north and
east of Philistia. The 'smoke' here probably refers to a cloud of dust
that would be seen to rise in that direction made by an invading army.

And none shall be alone in his appointed times - There has been a great
variety of interpretation in regard to this passage. Lowth renders it,
'And there shall not be a straggler among his levies.' The Hebrew is, as
in the margin, 'And not solitary in his assemblies.' The Septuagint
renders it, Καί οὐκ ἔσται τοῦ εῖναι Kai ouk estai tou einai - 'And it is
not to be endured.' The Chaldee, 'And there shall be none who shall
retard him in his times.' The Arabic, 'Neither is there anyone who can
stand in his footsteps.' The Vulgate, 'Neither is there anyone who can
escape his army.' Aben Ezra renders it, 'No one of the Philistines shall
dare to remain in their palaces, as when a smoke comes into a house all
are driven out.' Probably the correct idea is given by Lowth; and the
same interpretation is given by Gesenius, Rosenmuller, Dathe, and
Michaelis. No one of the invading army of Hezekiah shall come by
himself; no one shall be weary or be a straggler; the army shall advance
in close military array, and in dense columns; and this is represented
as the cause of the cloud or smoke that the prophet saw rising, the
cloud of dust that was made by the close ranks of the invading host
(compare [Isa 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">isa 14:32</span></span>

What shall one then answer - The design of this verse is obvious. It is
to show that Judea would be safe from the invasions of the Philistines,
and that God was the protector of Zion. For this purpose the prophet
refers to messengers or ambassadors who should be sent for any purpose
to Jerusalem, either to congratulate Hezekiah, or to form an alliance
with the Jews. The prophet asks what answer or information should be
given to such messengers when they came respecting their state? The
reply is, that Yahweh had evinced his purpose to protect his people.

Of the nation - Of any nation whose ambassadors should be sent into
Judea.

That the Lord hath founded Zion - That he is its original founder, and
that he has now shown his regard for it by protecting it from the
Philistines. It would be safe from their attacks, and Yahweh would thus
show that he had it under his own protection. The Septuagint renders
this, 'And what shall the kings of the Gentiles then answer? That the
Lord hath founded Zion.' The scope of the passage is the assurance that
Zion would be safe, being founded and preserved by Yahweh; and that the
Philistines had no cause of triumph at the death of Ahaz, since God
would still be the protector of his people. The doctrine established by
this passage is, that in all the changes which take place by the death
of kings, princes, magistrates, and ministers; and in all the
revolutions which occur in kingdoms, the enemies of the people of God
have no cause for rejoicing. God is the protector of his church; and he
will show that he has founded Zion, and that his people are safe, No
weapon that is formed against his people shall prosper, and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against his church.

Shall trust in it - In Zion. It was a strongly fortified city, God was
its protector, and in times of calamity his people could betake
themselves there in safety. In this strong place the most weak and
defenseless - the poorest of the people, would be safe. In the church of
God, the poor are the objects of as deep regard as the rich; the humble,
the meek, the weak, the feeble, are there safe, and no power of an enemy
can reach or affect them. God is their defender and their friend; and in
his arms they are secure.
