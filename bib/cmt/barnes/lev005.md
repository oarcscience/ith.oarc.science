### [Leviticus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)

[Leviticus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 5:1</span></span>

Special occasions are mentioned on which sin-offerings are to be made
with a particular confession of the offence for which atonement is
sought [Lev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005).

[Lev 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)

Swearing - Adjuration. The case appears to be that of one who has been
put upon his oath as a witness by a magistrate, and fails to utter all
he has seen and heard (compare the marginal references. and [Pro
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024); [Num
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021)).

[Lev 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002)

Hid from him - Either through forgetfulness or indifference, so that
purification had been neglected. In such a case there had been a guilty
negligence, and a sin-offering was required. On the essential connection
between impurity and the sin-offering, see [Lev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001).

[Lev 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004)

Pronouncing - Idly speaking [Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033). The reference is to an oath to
do something uttered in recklessness or passion and forgotten as soon as
uttered.

[Lev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006)

His trespass offering - Rather, as his forfeit, that is, whatever is due
for his offence. The term "trespass-offering" is out of place here,
since it has become the current designation for a distinct kind of
sin-offering mentioned in the next section (see [Lev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014) note).

A lamb or a kid of the goats - A sheep [Lev
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032) or a shaggy she-goat [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023).

[Lev 5:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007)

See [Lev 1:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014); [Lev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008). In the larger offerings of the
ox and the sheep, the fat which was burned upon the altar represented,
like the burnt-offering, the dedication of the worshipper; in this case,
the same meaning was conveyed by one of the birds being treated as a
distinct burnt-offering.

[Lev 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007)

A lamb - One of the flock, either a sheep or a goat.

For his trespass, which he hath committed - As his forfeit for the sin
he hath committed.

[Lev 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011)

tenth part of an ephah i. e. - "the tenth deal;" probably less than half
a gallon. See [Lev 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036) note. This
sin-offering of meal was distinguished from the ordinary מנחה mı̂nchāh
[Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001) by the absence of oil and
frankincense.

[Leviticus 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 5:14</span></span>

(This comment exends through [Lev
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#007)). The trespass-offerings as they
are described in this section and in [Lev
7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), are clearly distinguished from
the ordinary sin-offerings in these particulars:

\(1\) They were offered on account of offences which involved an injury
to some person (it might be the Lord Himself) in respect to property.
See [Lev 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016); [Lev
6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004).

\(2\) they were always accompanied by a pecuniary fine equal to the
value of the injury done, with the addition of one-fifth. Compare [Num
5:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#005).

\(3\) the treatment of the blood was more simple. Compare [Lev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005).

\(4\) the victim was a ram, instead of a female sheep or goat.

\(5\) there was no such graduation of offerings to suit the rank or
circumstances of the worshipper as is set forth in [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003), [Lev
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032), etc.

[Leviticus 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 5:15</span></span>

Commit a trespass - Rather, here and in [Lev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002), perpetrate a wrong. The word is
different from that rendered trespass elsewhere in these chapters.

Through ignorance - Through inadvertence. See [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002) note.

In the holy things of the Lord - The reference is to a failure in the
payment of firstfruits, tithes or fees of any kind connected with the
public service of religion by which the sanctuary suffered loss; compare
[Num 5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#006).

Shekel of the sanctuary - See [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note.

[Leviticus 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 5:17</span></span>

Though he wist it not - Ignorance of the Law, or even of the
consequences of the act at the time that it was committed, was not to
excuse him from the obligation to offer the sacrifice.
