### [2 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 19:0</span></span>

This chapter is entirely additional to Kings, and of great interest. It
deals with three matters only,

\(1\) The rebuke addressed to Jehoshaphat by the prophet Jehu [Ch2
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md),

\(2\) Jehoshaphat's religious reformation [Ch2
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004.md), and

\(3\) his reform of the judicial system [Ch2
19:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005.md).

[2 Chronicles 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 19:1</span></span>

Jehoshaphat ... returned to his house in peace - With the battle of
Ramoth-Gilead, and the death of Ahab, the war came to an end. The
combined attack of the two kings having failed, their troops had been
withdrawn, and the enterprise in which they had joined relinquished. The
Syrians, satisfied with their victory, did not press on the retreating
foe, or carry the war into their enemies' country.

[2 Chronicles 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 19:2</span></span>

Jehu ... went out to meet him - Compare [Ch2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002.md). The monarch was therefore
rebuked at the earliest possible moment, and in the most effective way,
as he was entering his capital at the head of his returning army. Jehu,
35 years previously, had worked in the northern kingdom, and prophesied
against Baasha [Kg1 16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md), but had
now come to Jerusalem, as prophet and historian (compare [Ch2
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034).md).

Shouldest thou help ... - As a matter of mere human policy, the conduct
of Jehoshaphat in joining Ahab against the Syrians was not only
justifiable but wise and prudent. And the reasonings upon which such a
policy was founded would have been unexceptionable but for one
circumstance. Ahab was an idolater, and had introduced into his kingdom
a false religion of a new and most degraded type. This should have led
Jehoshaphat to reject his alliance. Military success could only come
from the blessing and protection of Yahweh, which such an alliance, if
persisted in, was sure to forfeit.

[2 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 19:4</span></span>

Jehoshaphat, while declining to renounce the alliance with Israel
(compare the [Kg2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#007) note.md), was
careful to show that he had no sympathy with idolatry, and was
determined to keep his people, so far as he possibly could, free from
it. He therefore personally set about a second reformation, passing
through the whole land, from the extreme south to the extreme north [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md).

[2 Chronicles 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 19:5</span></span>

What exact change Jehoshaphat made in the judicial system of Judah [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md); [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md), it is impossible to determine.
Probably he found corruption widely spread [Ch2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md), and the magistrates in some
places tainted with the prevailing idolatry. He therefore made a fresh
appointment of judges throughout the whole country; concentrating
judicial authority in the hands of a few, or creating superior courts in
the chief towns ("fenced cities"), with a right of appeal to such courts
from the village judge.

[2 Chronicles 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 19:8</span></span>

The "fathers of Israel" are the heads of families; the chief of the
fathers" are the great patriarchal chiefs, the admitted heads of great
houses or clans. They were now admitted to share in the judicial office
which seems in David's time to have been confined to the Levites [Ch1
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md).

For the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies - By the former are
meant disputed cases concerning the performance of religious
obligations. In "controversies" are included all the ordinary causes,
whether criminal or civil.

When they returned to Jerusalem - Rather, "and they returned to
Jerusalem," a clause which if detached from the previous words and
attached to [Ch2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#009.md), gives a
satisfactory sense.

[2 Chronicles 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 19:10</span></span>

The Jews who "dwelt in the cities," if dissatisfied with the decision
given by the provincial judges, might therefore remove the cause to
Jerusalem, as to a court of appeal.

[2 Chronicles 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 19:11</span></span>

In religious causes, Amariah, the high priest, was to preside over the
court; in civil or criminal causes, Zebadiah was to be president. And to
Levites, other than the judges, he assigned the subordinate offices
about the court.
