### [Exodus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 3:0</span></span>

This chapter marks the commencement of the series of events which
immediately preceded the Exodus. Hitherto, the narrative has been
studiously brief, stating only what was necessary to be known as
preparatory to those events; but from this point Moses dwells minutely
on the details, and enables us to realize the circumstances of the
catastrophe which in its immediate and remote consequences stands alone
in the world's history.

[Exodus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 3:1</span></span>

Jethro his father-in-law - Or "brother-in-law." The word in the Hebrew
is a word signifying relative by marriage. When Moses arrived in Midian,
Reuel was an elderly man [Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016.md); 40
years later ([Exo 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023) note.md), Reuel's
son, Jethro, had probably succeeded him.

The backside - i. e. "to the west of the district." Among the Hebrews
the East is before a man, the west behind him, the south and north on
the right and left hand.

Desert - Or wilderness, not a barren waste, but a district supplying
pasturage. The district near Sherm, on the west of the gulf of Akabah,
where Jethro may have resided, is described as barren and parched; on
the west and east are rocky tracts, but to the northwest lies the
district of Sinai, where the pasturage is good and water abundant. The
Bedouins drive their flocks there from the lowlands at the approach of
summer. From this it may be inferred that the events here recorded took
place at that season.

To Horeb - More exactly, toward Horeb. Moses came to the mountain of
God, i. e. Sinai, on his way toward Horeb, a name given to the northern
part of the Sinaitic range. Moses calls Sinai "mountain of God" by
anticipation, with reference to the manifestation of God. There is no
authority for assuming that the spot was previously held sacred (see
[Exo 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#005).md); but it has been lately
shown that the whole Peninsula was regarded by the Egyptians as
specially consecrated to the gods from a very early time.

[Exodus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 3:2</span></span>

The angel of the Lord - See the note at [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md). What Moses saw was the flame of
fire in the bush; what he recognized therein was an intimation of the
presence of God, who maketh a flame of fire His angel. Compare [Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md). The words which Moses heard
were those of God Himself, as all ancient and most modern divines have
held, manifested in the Person of the Son.

Of a bush - Literally, of the bush or "seneh," a word which ought
perhaps to be retained as the proper name of a thorny shrub common in
that district, a species of acacia.

[Exodus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 3:4</span></span>

The Lord saw - The interchange of the two divine names is to be
observed; "Jehovah" (Yahweh) saw, "God" called.

[Exodus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 3:5</span></span>

Put off thy shoes - The reverence due to holy places thus rests upon
God's own command. The custom itself is well known from the observances
of the temple, it was almost universally adopted by the ancients, and is
retained in the East.

Holy ground - This passage is almost conclusive against the assumption
that the place was previously a sanctuary. Moses knew nothing of its
holiness after some 40 years spent on the Peninsula. It became holy by
the presence of God.

[Exodus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 3:6</span></span>

Our Saviour adduces this passage as a proof that the doctrine of the
Resurrection was taught in the Old Testament [Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md), and He calls this book "the
Book of Moses" [Mar 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026.md), two points
to be borne in mind by readers of the Pentateuch.

[Exodus 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 3:7</span></span>

Taskmasters - Oppressors. A different word from that in [Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md).

I know - The expression implies personal feeling, tenderness, and
compassion (compare [Exo 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025) margin.md).

[Exodus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 3:8</span></span>

The natural richness of Palestine, the variety and excellence of its
productions, are attested by sacred (compare [Jer
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#022.md); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006).md) and ancient writers, whose
descriptions are strongly in contrast with those of later travelers. The
expression "flowing with milk and honey" is used proverbially by Greek
poets.

The Canaanites ... - This is the first passage in this book where the
enumeration, so often repeated, of the nations then in possession of
Palestine, is given. Moses was to learn at once the extent of the
promise, and the greatness of the enterprise. In Egypt, the forces,
situation, and character of these nations were then well known. Aahmes I
had invaded the south of Palestine in his pursuit of the Shasous;
Tothmosis I had traversed the whole land on his campaign in Syria and
Mesopotamia; representations of Canaanites, and of the Cheta, identified
by most Egyptologers with the Hittites, are common on monuments of the
18th and 19th Dynasties, and give a strong impression of their
civilization, riches, and especially of their knowledge of the arts of
war. In this passage, the more general designations come first -
Canaanites probably includes all the races; the Hittites, who had great
numbers of chariots (892 were taken from them by Tothmosis III in one
battle), occupied the plains; the Amorites were chiefly mountaineers,
and, in Egyptian inscriptions, gave their name to the whole country; the
name Perizzites probably denotes the dwellers in scattered villages, the
half-nomad population; the Hivites, a comparatively unwarlike but
influential people, held 4 cities in Palestine proper, but their main
body dwelt in the northwestern district, from Hermon to Hamath (see [Jos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md); [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003).md); the Jebusites at that time
appear to have occupied Jerusalem and the adjoining district. Soon after
their expulsion by Joshua, they seem to have recovered possession of
part of Jerusalem, probably Mount Zion, and to have retained it until
the time of David.

[Exodus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 3:11</span></span>

Who am I - These words indicate humility (compare [Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003).md), not fear. He feared failure,
owing to incompetency, especially in the power of expression.

[Exodus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 3:12</span></span>

A token unto thee - Or the sign. The word means a declaration or promise
of God, which rests absolutely on His word, and demands faith. The
promise that God would have the people serve Him in that place was an
assurance, if fully believed, that all intervening obstacles would be
removed by His power.

[Exodus 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 3:13</span></span>

What is his name - The meaning of this question is evidently: "By which
name shall I tell them that the promise is confirmed?" Each name of the
Deity represented some aspect or manifestation of His attributes
(compare the introduction to Genesis). What Moses needed was not a new
name, but direction to use that name which would bear in itself a pledge
of accomplishment. Moses was familiar with the Egyptian habit of
choosing from the names of the gods that which bore specially upon the
wants and circumstances of their worshippers, and this may have
suggested the question which would be the first his own people would
expect him to answer.

[Exodus 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 3:14</span></span>

I am that I am - That is, "I am what I am." The words express absolute,
and therefore unchanging and eternal Being. The name, which Moses was
thus commissioned to use, was at once new and old; old in its connection
with previous revelations; new in its full interpretation, and in its
bearing upon the covenant of which Moses was the destined mediator.

[Exodus 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 3:15</span></span>

The Lord God ... - Better, Jehovah יהוה yehovâh, God of your fathers,
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. It corresponds exactly
to the preceding verse, the words "I am" and "Jehovah" (Yahweh) being
equivalent. This name met all the requirements of Moses, involving a
two-fold pledge of accomplishment; the pledges of ancient benefits and
of a new manifestation.

Name ... memorial - The name signifies that by which God makes Himself
known, the memorial that by which His people worship Him.

[Exodus 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 3:18</span></span>

Three days' journey - i. e. a journey which would occupy three days in
going and returning. This was a demand quite in accordance with Egyptian
customs. The refusal of Pharaoh and the subsequent proceedings were
revealed to Moses at once; but it is important to observe that the first
request which Pharaoh rejected could have been granted without any
damage to Egypt, or any risk of the Israelites passing the
strongly-fortified frontier.

[Exodus 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 3:19</span></span>

No, not - See the marginal rendering. Others explain it to mean, Pharaoh
will not let the people go even when severely smitten.

[Exodus 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 3:22</span></span>

Shall borrow - shall ask. The Egyptians had made the people serve "with
rigor," and the Israelites when about to leave the country for ever were
to ask or claim the jewels as a just, though very inadequate,
remuneration for services which had made "their lives bitter." The
Egyptians would doubtless have refused had not their feelings toward
Moses (see [Exo 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003).md) and the people
been changed, under God's influence, by calamities in which they
recognized a divine interposition, which also they rightly attributed to
the obstinacy of their own king (see [Exo
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007).md). The Hebrew women were to make
the demand, and were to make it of women, who would of course be
especially moved to compliance by the loss of their children, the fear
of a recurrence of calamity, perhaps also by a sense of the fitness of
the request in connection with a religious festival.

Jewels - Chiefly, trinkets. These ornaments were actually applied to the
purpose for which they were probably demanded, being employed in making
the vessels of the sanctuary (compare [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022).md).

Sojourneth in her house - This indicates a degree of friendly and
neighborly contact, in accordance with several indirect notices, and was
a natural result of long and peaceable sojourn in the district. The
Egyptians did not all necessarily share the feelings of their new king.
