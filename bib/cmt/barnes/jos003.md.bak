### [Joshua Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 3:0</span></span>

The contents of this and the next chapter, which record the miraculous
passage of Israel over Jordan, are given in four sections:

\(1\) [Jos 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md), describing the
preliminary directions;

\(2\) [Jos 3:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007.md), the commencement of
the passage;

\(3\) [Jos 4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md), the accomplishment
of it;

\(4\) [Jos 4:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#015.md), the conclusion of
the passage and erection of a monument to commemorate it.

A certain completeness and finish is given to each division of the
narrative, and to effect this the writer more than once repeats himself,
anticipates the actual order of events, and distributes into parts
occurrences which in fact took place once for all.

[Joshua 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 3:1</span></span>

"The acacia groves" ([Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005) note.md)
of Shittim on both sides of Jordan line the upper terraces of the valley
(compare [Kg2 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#004).md). They would be in
this part at some six miles distance from the river itself.

[Joshua 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 3:2</span></span>

These days ([Jos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011) note.md) were no
doubt occupied in preparations of various kinds. The host consisted not
of armed men only, but of women and children also; and many arrangements
would be necessary before they actually advanced into a hostile country.

[Joshua 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 3:4</span></span>

The ark, which was since the making of the covenant the special shrine
and seat of God's presence, went before to show the people that God,
through its medium, was their leader. They were to follow at a distance
that they might the better observe and mark how the miracle was
accomplished. This they would do to the greatest advantage while coming
down the heights, the ark going on before them into the ravine.

[Joshua 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 3:6</span></span>

They took up - i. e. on the day following. The course of events is
anticipated.

[Joshua 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 3:7</span></span>

This day will I begin to magnify thee - One cause why the miracle now to
be narrated was performed is here suggested. As Moses was declared to he
sent immediately from God with an extraordinary commission by the
miracles which he worked, more especially that of dividing the Red Sea
in two parts, so was Joshua both sent and accredited in a like manner.
(Compare [Jos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md), and [Jos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#014)..md) Other reasons are given in [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md); [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 3:10</span></span>

The living God - Compare the marginal reference. The gods of the pagan
are "dead idols." On the names of the seven nations, see [Gen
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#016.md), etc., note.

[Joshua 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 3:15</span></span>

Jordan overfloweth all his banks - Rather "is full up to all his banks,"
i. e. "brim-full." This remark strikingly illustrates the suddenness and
completeness, not less than the greatness, of the marvel. The Jordan
River flows at the bottom of a deep valley, which descends to the
water's edge on either side in two, occasionally in three, terraces.
Within the lowest of these the stream, ordinarily less than 100 feet
wide in this lower part of its course, is confined. The margin is
overgrown with a jungle of tamarisks and willows, which in the spring is
reached by the rising waters (compare the figure in [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md); [Jer
50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044).md); and the river, occasionally at
least, fills the ravine which forms its proper bed to the brim. Its
highest rise takes place about the time when Joshua had to cross it. By
the middle of April the river cannot be forded; and, if passed at all,
can only be so by swimming. This, however, was a hazardous feat (compare
[Ch1 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#015).md); and though no doubt
performed by the two spies, was utterly out of the power of the mixed
multitude that followed Joshua. The mere fact that the whole vast host
crossed the stream of Jordan at this season, is no small proof of the
miracle here recorded. No human agency then known and available could
have transported them speedily and safely from bank to bank.

[Joshua 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 3:16</span></span>

The passage should run "rose up, an heap far away, by Adam, the city
which is beside Zarthan."

The city of Adam is not named elsewhere, and Zarthan (mentioned here and
in marginal references.) has also disappeared. It is, however, probably
connected with the modern Kurn Sartabeh (Horn of Sartabeh), the name
given to a lofty and isolated hill some 17 miles on the river above
Jericho.

[Joshua 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 3:17</span></span>

The miraculous passage to the holy land through Jordan is not less
pregnant with typical meaning than that through the Red Sea (compare
[Co1 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md). The solemn inauguration
of Joshua to his office, and his miraculous attestation, by the same
waters with which Jesus was baptized on entering on the public exercise
of His ministry (compare [Mat
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016).md); the choice of twelve men,
one from each tribe to be the bearers of the twelve stones, and the
builders of the monument erected therewith (compare [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014).md): these were divinely-ordered
occurrences, not without a further bearing than their more immediate one
upon Israel. Nor must in this point of view the name "Adam," the place
where the stream flowed to the people which cut them off from the
promises, and the failure for the time under the rule of Joshua of the
full and rapid flood which supplies the Dead Sea, be overlooked.
