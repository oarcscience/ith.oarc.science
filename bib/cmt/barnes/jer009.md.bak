### [Jeremiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 9:1</span></span>

This verse is joined in the Hebrew to the preceding chapter. But any
break at all here interrupts the meaning.

A fountain - Rather, "a reservoir," in which tears had been stored up,
so that the prophet might weep abundantly.

[Jeremiah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 9:2</span></span>

From their punishment the prophet now turns to their sins.

[Jer 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002.md)

The prophet utters the wish that he might be spared his daily striving,
and in some lone wilderness give way to his sorrow, without restraint.

A lodging place - It was usual to build in the desert, either by private
charity or at the public expense, caravanserais, to receive travelers
for a single night, who had however to bring their own supplies with
them.

An assembly - Or, a gang.

Treacherous - Faithless toward one another.

[Jer 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003.md)

Rather, "And they bend their tongue to be their bow of lies, i. e." just
as men before a battle get their bows ready, so they of set purpose make
ready to do mischief, only their arrows are lying words: "neither do
they rule faithfully in the land, i. e." Judaea.

[Jer 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004.md)

In a state of such utter lawlessness, the bonds of mutual confidence are
relaxed, and suspicion takes its place.

Utterly supplant - An allusion to the name of Jacob [Gen
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md). It might be rendered, "every
brother is a thorough Jacob."

Will walk with slanders - Or, slandereth.

[Jer 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#006.md)

A continuation of the warning given in [Jer
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004.md). "Trust no one: for thou dwellest
surrounded by deceit on every side." Their rejection of God is the
result of their want of honesty in their dealings with one another [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md).

[Jer 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md)

I will melt them, and try them - The punishment is corrective rather
than retributive. The terms used are those of the refiner of metals, the
first being the smelting to separate the pure metal from the ore; the
second the testing to see whether the metal is pure, or still mixed with
alloy. God will put the nation into the crucible of tribulation, that
whatever is evil being consumed in the fire, all there is in them of
good may be purified.

For how shall I do ... - Rather, "for how" else could I act with
reference to the "daughter of my people?"

[Jer 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#008.md)

An arrow shot out - Rather, "a murderous arrow."

In heart he layeth his wait - Rather, "inwardly he layeth his ambush."

[Jeremiah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 9:10</span></span>

The punishment described in general terms in the preceding three verses
is now detailed at great length.

[Jer 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md)

The habitations i. e - the temporary encampments of the shepherds (see
[Jer 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003).md).

So that none can ... - Or, "They are parched up, with no man to pass
through them; neither do they hear the voice of cattle; from the birds
of the heaven even to the beasts they "are fled, they are gone."

[Jer 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011.md)

Dragons - Rather, jackals.

[Jer 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012.md)

For what the land perisheth ... - This is the question proposed for
consideration. The prophet calls upon the wise man to explain his
question; that question being, Wherefore did the land perish? He follows
it by the assertion of a fact: "It is parched like the wilderness with
no man to pass through."

[Jer 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#013.md)

The cause of the chastisement about to fall upon Jerusalem, was their
desertion of the divine Law.

[Jer 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#014.md)

Imagination - Or, as in the margin.

Which their fathers taught them - It was not the sin of one generation
that brought upon them chastisement: it was a sin, which had been handed
down from father to son.

[Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md)

I will feed them ... - Rather, I am feeding them. The present participle
used here, followed by three verbs in the future, shows that the
judgment has beam, of which the successive stages are given in the next
clause.

Wormwood - See [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md), note, and
for "water of gall," [Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014.md), note.

[Jer 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016.md)

This verse is taken from [Lev 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md).
The fulfillment of what had been so long before appointed as the penalty
for the violation of Yahweh's covenant is one of the most remarkable
proofs that prophecy was something more than human foresight.

Till I have consumed them - See [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md) note. How is this "consuming"
consistent with the promise to the contrary there given? Because it is
limited by the terms of [Jer 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md).
Previously to Nebuchadnezzars destruction of Jerusalem God removed into
safety those in whom the nation should revive.

[Jer 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017.md)

The mourning women - Hired to attend at funerals, and by their skilled
wailings aid the real mourners in giving vent to their grief. Hence,
they are called "cunning," literally "wise" women, wisdom being
constantly used in Scripture for anything in which people are trained.

[Jer 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#018.md)

Take up a wailing for us - i. e., for the nation once God's chosen
people, but long spiritually dead.

[Jer 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#019.md)

Forsaken - Or, left: forced to abandon the land.

Because our dwellings ... - Rather, "because they have east down our
dwellings." The whole verse is a description of their sufferings. See
[Kg2 25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md).

[Jer 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020.md)

The command is addressed to the women because it was more especially
their part to express the general feelings of the nation. See [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md); [Sa2
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#024.md). The women utter now the
death-wail over the perishing nation. They are to teach their daughters
and neighbors the "lamentation, i. e., dirge," because the harvest of
death would be so large that the number of trained women would not
suffice.

[Jer 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021.md)

Death is come up ... - i. e., death steals silently like a thief upon
his victims, and makes such havoc that there are no children left to go
"without," nor young men to frequent the open spaces in the city.

[Jer 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md)

The "handful" means the little bundle of grain which the reaper gathers
on his arm with three or four strokes of his sickle, and then lays down.
Behind the reaper came one whose business it was to gather several of
these bundles, and bind them into a sheaf. Thus, death strews the ground
with corpses as thickly as these handfuls lie upon the reaped land, but
the corpses lie there unheeded.

[Jeremiah 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 9:23</span></span>

To the end of Jer. 10 the prophet urges upon the people the practical
conclusion to be drawn from God's righteous dealings with them. The
three things on which men most pride themselves are shown in this verse
to have proved vain.

[Jeremiah 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 9:24</span></span>

This is the prophet's remedy for the healing of the nation. It is the
true understanding and knowledge of God, of which the first means the
spiritual enlightenment of the mind [Co1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md), the other the training of the
heart unto obedience [Joh 8:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031.md).
This knowledge of God is further said to find in Him three chief
attributes,

\(1\) "lovingkindness," i. e., readiness to show grace and mercy;

\(2\) "judgment," a belief in which is declared in [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md) to be essential to faith;

\(3\) "righteousness," which is essential to religion absolutely.

Unless men believe that God's dealings with them in life and death are
right and just, they can neither love nor reverence him.

[Jeremiah 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 9:25</span></span>

All them which are circumcised ... - Rather, "all circumcised in
uncircumcision," i. e., all who though outwardly circumcised have no
corresponding inward purity.

[Jeremiah 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 9:26</span></span>

All that are in the utmost corners - Really, all who have the corners of
their hair shorn. The people meant are those Arabs who cut the hair
close upon the forehead and temples, but let it grow long behind. See
[Lev 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md).

For all these nations are uncircumcised - Or, "for all the pagan are
uncircumcised." circumcision probably prevailed partially in the pagan
mysteries as a sign of special sanctity, but to the Jews alone it
represented their covenant-relation to God.
