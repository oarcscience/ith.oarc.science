### [Numbers Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001)

[Numbers 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 6:1</span></span>

The law of the Nazarite is appropriately added to other enactments which
concern the sanctity of the holy nation. That sanctity found its highest
expression in the Nazarite vow, which was the voluntary adoption for a
time of obligations to high and strict modes of self-dedication
resembling, and indeed in some particulars exceeding, those under which
the priests were placed. The present enactments do not institute a new
kind of observance, but only regulate one already familiar to the
Israelites [Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002).

[Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002)

A Nazarite - Strictly, Nazirite. This term signifies "separated" i. e.,
as the words following show, "unto God." It became a technical term at
an early date; compare [Jdg 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005), [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007); [Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017).

[Num 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003)

Liquor of grapes - i. e. a drink made of grape-skins macerated in water.

[Num 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#004)

From the kernels even to the husk - A sour drink was made from the
stones of unripe grapes; and cakes were also made of the husks [Hos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001). This interdict figures that
separation from the general society of men to which the Nazarite for the
time was consecrated.

[Num 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005)

Among the Jews the abundance of the hair was considered to betoken
physical strength and perfection (compare [Sa2
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#025)), and baldness was regarded
as a grave blemish (compare [Lev 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#020)
note, [Lev 13:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#040) ff; [Kg2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023); [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024)). Thus, the free growth of the
hair on the head of the Nazarite represented the dedication of the man
with all his strength and powers to the service of God.

[Num 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007)

The consecration of his God - i. e. the unshorn locks: compare [Lev
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005) note, where the vine, left during
the Sabbatical year untouched by the hand of man, either for pruning or
for vintage, is called simply a "Nazarite."

The third rule of the Nazarite interdicted him from contracting any
ceremonial defilement even under circumstances which excused such
defilement in others: compare [Lev
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001).

[Num 6:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009)

Prescriptions to meet the case of a sudden death taking place "by him"
(i. e. in his presence). The days of the dedication of the Nazarite had
to be recommenced.

[Num 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#013)

When the days of his separation are fulfilled - Perpetual Nazariteship
was probably unknown in the days of Moses; but the examples of Samson,
Samuel, and John the Baptist, show that it was in later times undertaken
for life. Again, Moses does not expressly require that limits should be
assigned to the vow; but a rule was afterward imposed that no Nazarite
vow should be taken for less than thirty days. To permit the vow to be
taken for very short periods would diminish its solemnity and
estimation.

[Num 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014), [Num
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#015)

The sin-offering (compare the marginal references), though named second,
was in practice offered first, being intended to expiate involuntary
sins committed during the period of separation. The burnt-offering ([Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010) ff) denoted the self-surrender on
which alone all acceptableness in the Nazarite before God must rest; the
peace-offerings ([Lev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#012) ff)
expressed thankfulness to God by whose grace the vow had been fulfilled.
The offerings, both ordinary and additional, required on the completion
of the Nazarite vow involved considerable expense, and it was regarded
as a pious work to provide the poor with the means of making them
(compare [Act 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023) ff; 1 Macc. 3:49).

[Num 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018)

Shave the head - As the Nazarite had during his vow worn his hair
unshorn in honor of God, so when the time was complete it was natural
that the hair, the symbol of his vow, should be cut off, and offered to
God at the sanctuary. The burning of the hair "in the fire under the
sacrifice of the peace offering "represented the eucharistic communion
with God obtained by those who realised the ideal which the Nazarite set
forth (compare the marginal reference).

[Num 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#020)

The priest shall wave them - i. e. by placing his hands under those of
the Nazarite: compare [Lev 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030).

[Num 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#021)

Beside that that his hand shall get - The Nazarite, in addition to the
offerings prescribed above, was to present free-will offerings according
to his possessions or means.

[Numbers 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 6:22</span></span>

The priestly blessing (compare Ecclus. 36:17) is appointed as a solemn
form to be used by the priests exclusively, and in this function their
office as it were culminates (compare [Lev
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022) note). God Himself provides a
formula, through which from time to time, as His people by obedience
place themselves in true and right relationship to Him, the authorised
mediators may pronounce and communicate His special blessing to them. It
was a Jewish tradition that this blessing was given at the close of the
daily sacrifice.

The structure of the blessing is remarkable. It is rhythmical, consists
of three distinct parts, and mounts by gradual stages to that peace
which forms the last and most consummate gift which God can give His
people.

From a Christian point of view, and comparing the counterpart
benediction of [Co2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014), it is
impossible not to see shadowed forth the doctrine of the Holy Trinity
(compare [Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003); [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)). And the three several sets of
terms correspond fittingly to the office of the Three Persons in Their
gracious work for the redemption of man.

[Num 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024)

The Lord bless thee, and keep thee - The second clause here, as in the
other three verses, defines more closely the general tenor of the
preceding one. The singular number, which is observed throughout,
indicates that the blessing is conferred on Israel "collectively."

[Num 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025)

Make his face shine - This is an enhancement of the preceding
benediction. "The face of God" imports not merely God's good will in
general, but His active and special regard. With the "face" or "eye of
the Lord accordingly is connected alike the judicial visitation of the
wicked. [Psa 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016), and His mercies to
the righteous [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006).

[Num 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#026)

Lift up his countenance upon thee - i. e. especially direct His thought
and care toward thee: compare [Kg2
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#032), and similar phrases in [Gen
43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029); [Gen
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#021). Through such loving providence
alone could the peace of God in which the blessing closes be given.

[Num 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#027)

Put my name upon the children of Israel - i. e. pronounce My Sacred Name
over them in blessing them. God will give effect to the benediction
pronounced by the priests.
