### [Deuteronomy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 6:1</span></span>

Moses proceeds to set forth more particularly and to enforce the
cardinal and essential doctrines of the Decalogue, the nature and
attributes of God, and the fitting mode of honoring and worshipping Him.
Two objects are indicated [Deu 6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002.md),
the glory of God and the welfare of man, as the grand aims that he has
in view.

[Deuteronomy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 6:3</span></span>

In the land - Better: According as the Lord the God of thy fathers
promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey.

[Deuteronomy 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 6:4</span></span>

These words form the beginning of what is termed the "Shema" ("Hear") in
the Jewish Services, and belong to the daily morning and evening office.
They may be called "the creed of the Jews."

This weighty text contains far more than a mere declaration of the unity
of God as against polytheism; or of the sole authority of the revelation
that He had made to Israel as against other pretended manifestations of
His will and attributes. It asserts that the Lord God of Israel is
absolutely God, and none other. He, and He alone, is Jehovah (Yahweh)
the absolute, uncaused God; the One who had, by His election of them,
made Himself known to Israel.

[Deuteronomy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 6:5</span></span>

Since there is but One God, and that God is Israel's God, so Israel must
love God unreservedly and entirely. The "heart" is mentioned as the seat
of the understanding; the "soul" as the center of will and personality;
the "might" as representing the outgoings and energies of all the vital
powers.

The New Testament itself requires no more than this total self-surrender
of man's being to his maker [Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md). The Gospel differs from the Law
not so much in replacing an external and carnal service of God by an
inward and spiritual one, as in supplying new motives and special
assistances for the attainment of that divine love which was, from the
first and all along, enjoined as "the first and great commandment."

[Deuteronomy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 6:8</span></span>

By adopting and regulating customary usages (e. g. Egyptian) Moses
provides at once a check on superstition and a means of keeping the
Divine Law in memory. On the "frontlets," the "phylacteries" of the New
Test. [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md), see [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016.md). On [Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md); [Deu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020.md) is based the Jewish usage of the
mezuzah. This word denotes properly a door-post, as it is rendered here
and in [Exo 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007.md), [Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md); [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md) etc. Among the Jews however, it
is the name given to the square piece of parchment, inscribed with [Deu
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md); [Deu
11:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013.md), which is rolled up in a
small cylinder of wood or metal, and affixed to the right-hand post of
every door in a Jewish house. The pious Jew touches the mezuzah on each
occasion of passing, or kisses his finger, and speaks [Psa
121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008.md) in the Hebrew language.

[Deuteronomy 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 6:10</span></span>

The Israelites were at the point of quitting a normal, life for a fixed
and settled abode in the midst of other nations; they were exchanging a
condition of comparative poverty for great and goodly cities, houses and
vineyards. There was therefore before them a double danger;

\(1\) a God-forgetting worldliness, and

\(2\) a false tolerance of the idolatries practiced by those about to
become their neighbors.

The former error Moses strives to guard against in the verses before us;
the latter in [Deu 7:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md).

[Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md)

The command "to swear by His Name" is not inconsistent with the Lord's
injunction [Mat 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#034.md), "Swear not at
all." Moses refers to legal swearing, our Lord to swearing in common
conversation. It is not the purpose of Moses to encourage the practice
of taking oaths, but to forbid that, when taken, they should be taken in
any other name than that of Israel's God. The oath involves an
invocation of Deity, and so a solemn recognition of Him whose Name is
made use of in it. Hence, it comes especially within the scope of the
commandment Moses is enforcing.

[Deu 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md)

It shall be our righteousness - i. e., God will esteem us as righteous
and deal with us accordingly. From the very beginning made Moses the
whole righteousness of the Law to depend entirely on a right state of
the heart, in one word, upon faith.
