### [2 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 13:0</span></span>

This closing chapter [Co2 13:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md) of
the Epistle relates to the following subjects.

I. The assurance of Paul that he was about to come among them [Co2
13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md), and that he would certainly
inflict punishment on all who deserved His enemies had reproached him as
being timid and pusillanimous; see the notes on [Co2
10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), [Co2
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md). They had said that he was
powerful to threaten, but afraid to execute. It is probable that they
had become more bold in this from the fact that he had twice proposed to
go there and had failed. In reply to all this, he now in conclusion
solemnly assures them that he was coming, and that in all cases where an
offence was proved by two or three witnesses, punishment would be
inflicted; He assures them [Co2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md)
that he would not spare; and that since they sought a proof that Christ
had sent him they should witness that proof in the punishment which he
would inflict [Co2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003.md); for that
Christ was now clothed with power and was able to execute punishment,
though he had been crucified; [Co2
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004.md).

II\. Paul calls on them solemnly to examine themselves and to see
whether they had any true religion; [Co2
13:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md). In the state of things which
existed there; in the corruption which had abounded in the church, he
solemnly commands them to institute a faithful inquiry, to know whether
they had not been deceived; at the same time expressing the hope that it
would appear as the result of their examination that they were not
reprobates.

III\. He earnestly prays to God that they might do no evil; that they
might be found to be honest and pure, whatever might be thought of Paul
himself or whatever might become of him; [Co2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md). Their repentance would save.
Paul from exerting his miraculous power in their punishment, and might
thus prevent the proof of his apostolic authority which they desired,
and the consequence might be that they might esteem him to be a
reprobate, for he could not exert his miraculous power except in the
cause of truth; [Co2 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#008.md). Still he
was willing to be esteemed an impostor if they would do no evil.

IV\. He assures them that he earnestly wished their perfection, and that
the design of his writing to them severe as he had appeared, was their
edification; [Co2 13:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009.md).

V. Then he bids them an affectionate and tender farewell, and closes
with the usual salutations and benedictions; [Co2
13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md).

[2 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 13:1</span></span>

This is the third time ... - see the note on [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md). For an interesting view of this
passage, see Paley's Horae Paulinae on this Epistle, No. 11: It is
evident that Paul had been to Corinth but once before this, but he had
resolved to go before a second time, but had been disappointed.

In the mouth of two or three witnesses ... - This was what the Law of
Moses required; [Deu 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016.md); see the
note on [Joh 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017.md); compare [Mat
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md). But in regard to its
application here, commentators are not agreed. Some suppose that Paul
refers to his own epistles which he had sent to them as the two or three
witnesses by which his promise to them would be made certain; that he
had purposed it and promised it two or three times, and that as this was
all that was required by the Law, it would certainly be established.
This is the opinion of Bloomfield, Rosenmuller, Grotius, Hammond, Locke,
and some others. But, with all the respect due to such great names, it
seems to me that this would be trifling and childish in the extreme.
Lightfoot supposes that he refers to Stephanas, Fortunatus, and
Achaicus, who would be witnesses to them of his purpose; see [Co1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md). But the more probable opinion,
it seems to me, is that of Doddridge, Macknight, and others, that he
anticipated that there wound be necessity for the administration of
discipline there, but that he would feel himself under obligation in
administering it to adhere to the reasonable maxim of the Jewish Law. No
one should be condemned or punished where there was not at least two or
three witnesses to prove the offence. But where there were, discipline
would be administered according to the nature of the crime.

[2 Corinthians 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 13:2</span></span>

I told you before - That I would not spare offenders; that I would
certainly punish them. He had intimated this before in the First Epistle
[Co1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021.md); [Co1
5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md).

And foretell you - Now apprise you of my fixed determination to punish
every offender as he deserves.

As if I were present, the second time - The mention of the second time
here proves that Paul had been with them but once before. He had formed
the resolution to go to them, but had been disappointed. The time when
he had been with them is recorded in [Act
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md) ff. He now uses the same language
to them which he says he would use if he were with them, as he had
expected to be, the second time. See the remarks of Paley on this
passage, referred to above.

And being absent - see the note on [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md).

To them which have heretofore sinned - To all the offenders in the
church. They had supposed that he would not come to them [Co1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md), or that if he came he would not
dare to inflict punishment, 2 Cor. 9-11. They had, therefore, given
themselves greater liberty, and had pursued their own course, regardless
of his authority and commands.

I will not spare - I will punish them. They shall not escape.

[2 Corinthians 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 13:3</span></span>

Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me - see the notes on the
previous chapters. They had called in question his apostolic authority;
they had demanded the evidence of his divine commission. He says that he
would now furnish such evidence by inflicting just punishment on all
offenders, and they should have abundant proof that Christ spoke by him,
or that he was inspired.

Which to you-ward is not weak - Or who, that is, Christ, is not weak,
etc. Christ has manifested his power abundantly toward you, that is,
either by the miracles that had been performed in his name; or by the
diseases and calamities which they had suffered on account of their
disorders and offences (see the note on [Co1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030).md); or by the force and efficacy
of his doctrine. The connection, it seems to me, requires that we should
understand it of the calamities which had been inflicted by Christ on
them for their sins, and which Paul says would be inflicted again if
they did not repent. The idea is, that they had had ample demonstration
of the power of Christ to inflict punishment, and they had reason to
apprehend it again.

[2 Corinthians 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 13:4</span></span>

For though he was crucified through weakness - Various modes have been
adopted of explaining the phrase "through weakness." The most probable
explanation is that which refers it to the human nature which he had
assumed [Phi 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md), and to the appearance of
weakness which he manifested. He did not choose to exert his power. He
appeared to his enemies to be weak and feeble. This idea would be an
exact illustration of the point before the apostle. He is illustrating
his own conduct, and especially in the fact that he had not exerted his
miraculous powers among them in the punishment of offenders; and he does
it by the example of Christ, who though abundantly able to have exerted
his power and to have rescued himself from his enemies, yet was willing
to appear weak, and to be crucified. It is very clear:

\(1\) That the Lord Jesus seemed to his enemies to be weak and incapable
of resistance.

\(2\) that he did not put forth his power to protect his life. He in
fact offered no resistance, as if he had no power.

\(3\) he had a human nature that was especially sensitive, and sensible
to suffering; and that was borne down and crushed under the weight of
mighty woes; see my notes on [Isa
53:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). From all these causes he
seemed to be weak and feeble; and these appear to me to be the principal
ideas in this expression.

Yet he liveth - He is not now dead. Though he was crucified, yet he now
lives again, and is now capable of exerting his great power He furnishes
proof of his being alive, in the success which attends the gospel, and
in the miracles which are performed in his name and by his power. There
is a living Redeemer in heaven; a Redeemer who is able to exert all the
power which he ever exerted when on earth; a Redeemer, therefore, who is
able to save the soul; to raise the dead; to punish all his foes.

By the power of God - In raising him from the dead and placing him at
his own right hand; see [Eph 1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md).
Through the power of God he was brought from the tomb, and has a place
assigned him at the head of the universe.

For we also are weak in him - Margin, "with him." We his apostles, also,
are weak in virtue of our connection with him. We are subject to
infirmities and trials; we seem to have no power; we are exposed to
contempt; and we appear to our enemies to be destitute of strength. Our
enemies regard us as feeble; and they despise us.

But we shall live with him ... - That is, we shall show to you that we
are alive. By the aid of the power of God we shall show that we are not
as weak as our foes pretend; that we are invested with power; and that
we are able to inflict the punishment which we threaten. This is one of
the numerous instances in which Paul illustrated the case before him by
a reference to the example and character of Christ. The idea is, that
Christ did not exert his power, and appeared to be weak, and was put to
death. So Paul says that he had not exerted his power, and seemed to be
weak. But, says he, Christ lives, and is clothed with strength; and so
we, though we appear to be weak, shall exert among you, or toward you,
the power with which he has invested us, in inflicting punishment on our
foes.

[2 Corinthians 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 13:5</span></span>

Examine yourselves - see the note on [Co1
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#028.md). The particular reason why Paul
calls on them to examine themselves was, that there was occasion to fear
that many of them had been deceived. Such had been the irregularities
and disorders in the church at Corinth; so ignorant had many of them
shown themselves of the nature of the Christian religion, that it was
important, in the highest degree, for them to institute a strict and
impartial examination to ascertain whether they had not been altogether
deceived. This examination, however, is never unimportant or useless for
Christians; and an exhortation to do it is always in place. So important
are the interests at stake, and so liable are the best to deceive
themselves, that all Christians should be often induced to examine the
foundation of their hope of eternal salvation.

Whether ye be in the faith - Whether you are true Christians. Whether
you have any true faith in the gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ, and in the
promises of God through him, is one of the distinguishing
characteristics of a true Christian; and to ascertain whether we have
any true faith, therefore, is to ascertain whether we are sincere
Christians. For some reasons for such an examination, and some remarks
on the mode of doing it; see the note on [Co1
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#028.md).

Prove your own selves - The word used here (δοκιμάζετε dokimazete) is
stronger than that before used, and rendered "examine" (πειράζετε
peirazete). This word, prove, refers to assaying or trying metals by the
powerful action of heat; and the idea here is, that they should make the
most thorough trial of their religion, to see whether it would stand the
test; see the note on [Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md). The
proof of their piety was to be arrived at by a faithful examination of
their own hearts and lives; by a diligent comparison of their views and
feelings with the word of God; and especially by making trial of it in
life. The best way to prove our piety is to subject it to actual trial
in the various duties and responsibilites of life. A man who wishes to
prove an axe to see whether it is good or not, does not sit down and
look at it, or read all the treatises which he can find on axe-making,
and on the properties of iron and steel, valuable as such information
would be; but he shoulders his axe and goes into the woods, and puts it
to the trial there.

If it cuts well; if it does not break; if it is not soon made dull, he
understands the quality of his axe better than he could in any other
way. So if a man wishes to know what his religion is worth, let him try
it in the places where religion is of any value. Let him go into the
world with it. Let him go and try to do good; to endure affliction in a
proper manner; to combat the errors and follies of life; to admonish
sinners of the error of their ways; and to urge forward the great work
of the conversion of the world, and he will soon see there what his
religion is worth - as easily as a man can test the qualities of an axe.
Let him not merely sit down and think, and compare himself with the
Bible and look at his own heart - valuable as this may be in many
respects - but let him treat his religion as he would anything else -
let him subject it to actual experiment. That religion which will enable
a man to imitate the example of Paul or Howard, or the great Master
himself, in doing good, is genuine.

That religion which will enable a man to endure persecution for the name
of Jesus; to bear calamity without complaining; to submit to a long
series of disappointments and distresses for Christ's sake, is genuine.
That religion which will prompt a man unceasingly to a life of prayer
and self-denial; which will make him ever conscientious, industrious,
and honest; which will enable him to warn sinners of the errors of their
ways, and which will dispose him to seek the friendship of Christians,
and the salvation of the world, is pure and genuine. That will answer
the purpose. It is like the good axe with which a man can chop all day
long, in which there is no flaw, and which does not get dull, and which
answers all the purposes of an axe. Any other religion than this is
worthless.

Know ye not your own selves - That is, "Do you not know yourselves?"
This does not mean, as some may suppose, that they might know of
themselves, without the aid of others, what their character was; or that
they might themselves ascertain it; but it means that they might know
themselves, that is, their character, principles, conduct. This proves
that Christians may know their true character. If they are Christians,
they may know it with as undoubted certainty as they may know their
character on any other subject. Why should not a man be as able to
determine whether he loves God as whether he loves a child, a parent, or
a friend? What greater difficulty need there be in understanding the
character on the subject of religion than on any other subject; and why
should there be anymore reason for doubt on this than on any other point
of character? And yet it is remarkable, that while a child has no doubt
that he loves a parent, or a husband a wife, or a friend a friend,
almost all Christians are in very great doubt about their attachment to
the Redeemer and to the great principles of religion.

Such was not the case with the apostles and early Christians. "I know,"
says Paul," whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to
keep that which I have committed to him," etc.; [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). "We know.' says John, speaking
in the name of the body of Christians, "that we have passed from death
unto life;" [Jo1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md). "We know that
we are of the truth;" [Jo1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md). "We
know that he abideth in us;" [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md). "We know that we dwell in him;"
[Jo1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013.md); see also [Joh
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md), [Joh
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md). So Job said, "I know that my
Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand in the latter day upon the
earth," etc.; [Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md). Such is the
current language of scripture. Where, in the Bible, do the sacred
speakers and writers express doubts about their attachment to God and
the Redeemer? Where is such language to be found as we hear from almost
all professing Christians, expressing entire uncertainty about their
condition; absolute doubt whether they love God or hate him; whether
they are going to heaven or hell; whether they are influenced by good
motives or bad; and even making it a matter of merit to be in such
doubt, and thinking it wrong not to doubt?

What would be thought of a husband that should make it a matter of merit
to doubt whether he loved his wife; or of a child that should think it
wrong not to doubt whether he loved his father or mother? Such
attachments ought to be doubted - but they do not occur in the common
relations of life. On the subject of religion, people often act as they
do on no other subject; and if it is right for one to be satisfied of
the sincerity of his attachments to his best earthly friends, and to
speak of such attachment without wavering or misgiving, it cannot be
wrong to be satisfied with regard to our attachment to God, and to speak
of that attachment, as the apostles did, in language of undoubted
confidence.

How that Jesus Christ is in you - To be in Christ, or for Christ to be
in us, is a common mode in the Scriptures of expressing the idea that we
are Christians. It is language derived from the close union which
subsists between the Redeemer and his people: see the phrase explained
in the note on [Rom 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md).

Except ye be reprobates - see the note on [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md). The word rendered "reprobates"
(ἀδόκιμοι adokimoi) means properly not approved, rejected: that which
will not stand the trial. It is properly applicable to metals, as
denoting that they will not bear the tests to which they are subjected,
but are found to be base or adulterated. The sense here is, that they
might know that they were Christians, unless their religion was base,
false, adulterated; or such as would not bear the test. There is no
allusion here to the sense which is sometimes given to the word
"reprobate," of being cast off or abandoned by God, or doomed by him to
eternal ruin in accordance with an eternal purpose. Whatever may be the
truth on that subject, nothing is taught in regard to it here. The
simple idea is, that they might know that they were Christians, unless
their religion was such as would not stand the test, or was worthless.

[2 Corinthians 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 13:6</span></span>

But I trust ... - The sense of this verse is," Whatever may be the
result of your examination of yourselves, I trust (Greek I hope) you
will not find us false and to be rejected; that is, I trust you will
find in me evidence that I am commissioned by the Lord Jesus to be his
apostle." The idea is, that they would find when he was among them, that
he was endowed with all the qualifications needful to confer a claim to
the apostolic office.

[2 Corinthians 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 13:7</span></span>

Now I pray to God that ye do no evil - I earnestly desire that you may
do right, and only right; and I beseech God that it may be so, whatever
may be the result in regard to me, and whatever may be thought of my
claims to the apostolic office. This is designed to mitigate the
apparent severity of the sentiment in [Co2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006.md). There he had said that they
would find him fully endowed with the power of an apostle. They would
see that he was able abundantly to punish the disobedient. They would
have ample demonstration that he was endowed by Christ with all the
powers appropriate to an apostle, and that all that he had claimed had
been well founded, all that he threatened would be executed. But this
seemed to imply that he desired that there should be occasion for the
exercise of that power of administering discipline; and he, therefore,
in this verse, removes all suspicion that such was his wish, by saying
solemnly, that he prayed to God that they might never do wrong; that
they might never give him occasion for the exercise of his power in that
way, though as a consequence he would be regarded as a reprobate, or as
having no claims to the apostolic office. He would rather be regarded as
an impostor; rather lie under the reproach of his enemies that he had no
claims to the apostolic character, than that they, by doing wrong,
should give him occasion to show that he was not a deceiver.

Not that we should appear approved - My great object, and my main
desire, is not to urge my claims to the apostolic office and clear up my
own character; it is that you should lead honest lives, whatever may
become of me and my reputation.

Though we be as reprobates - I am willing to be regarded as rejected,
disapproved, worthless, like base metal, provided you lead honest and
holy lives. I prefer to be so esteemed, and to have you live as becomes
Christians, than that you should dishonor your Christian profession, and
thus afford me the opportunity of demonstrating, by inflicting
punishment, that I am commissioned by the Lord Jesus to be an apostle.
The sentiment is, that a minister of the gospel should desire that his
people should walk worthy of their high calling, whatever may be the
estimate in which he is held. He should never desire that they should do
wrong - how can he do it? - in order that he may take occasion from
their wrongdoing to vindicate, in any way, his own character, or to
establish a reputation for skill in administering discipline or in
governing a church. What a miserable condition it is - and as wicked as
it is miserable - for a man to wish to take advantage of a state of
disorder, or of the faults of others, in order to establish his own
character, or to obtain reputation. Paul spurned and detested such a
thought; yet it is to be feared it is sometimes done.

[2 Corinthians 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 13:8</span></span>

For we - That is, we the apostles.

Can do nothing against the truth ... - That is, we who are under the
influence of the Spirit of God; who have been commissioned by him as
apostles, can do nothing that shall be against the great system of truth
which we are appointed to promulgate and defend. You need, therefore,
apprehend no partial or severe discipline from us; no unjust
construction of your conduct. Our aim is to promote the truth, and to do
what is right; and we cannot, therefore, by any regard to our own
reputation, or to any personal advantage, do what is wrong, or
countenance, or desire what is wrong in others. We must wish that which
is right to be done by others, whatever may be the effect on us -
whether we are regarded as apostles or deceivers. I suppose, therefore,
that this verse is designed to qualify and confirm the sentiment in the
previous verse, that Paul meant to do only right; that he wished all
others to do right; and that whatever might be the effect on his own
reputation, or however he might be regarded, he could not go against the
great system of gospel truth which he preached, or even desire that
others should ever do wrong, though it might in any way be for his
advantage. It was a fixed principle with him to act only in accordance
with truth; to do what was right.

[2 Corinthians 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 13:9</span></span>

For we are glad when we are weak ... - We rejoice in your welfare, and
are willing to submit to self-denial and to infirmity if it may promote
your spiritual strength. In the connection in which this stands it seems
to mean, "I am content to appear weak, provided you do no wrong; I am
willing not to have occasion to exercise my power in punishing
offenders, and had rather lie under the reproach of being actually weak,
than to have occasion to exercise my power by punishing you for
wrongdoing; and provided you are strong in the faith and in the hope of
the gospel, I am very willing, nay, I rejoice that I am under this
necessity of appearing weak."

And this also we wish - I desire this in addition to your doing no evil.

Even your perfection - The word used here (κατάρτισις katartisis) occurs
nowhere else in the New Testament, though the verb from which it is
derived (καταρτίζω katartizō) occurs often; [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); [Mar
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#019.md); [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md); [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md); [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md); [Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md), et al.; see the note on [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md). On the meaning of the word see
[Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md). The idea of restoring,
putting in order, fitting, repairing, is involved in the word "always,"
and hence, the idea of making perfect; that is, of completely restoring
anything to its proper place. Here it evidently means that Paul wished
their entire reformation - so that there should be no occasion for
exercising discipline. Doddridge renders it, "perfect good order."
Macknight, "restoration." For this restoration of good order Paul had
diligently labored in these epistles; and this was an object near to his
heart.

[2 Corinthians 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 13:10</span></span>

Therefore I write these things ... - This is a kind of apology for what
he had said, and especially for the apparently harsh language which he
had felt himself constrained to use. He had reproved them; he had
admonished them of their faults; he had threatened punishment, all of
which was designed to prevent the necessity of severe measures when he
should be with them.

Lest being present I should use sharpness - In order that when I come I
may not have occasion to employ severity; see the sentiment explained in
the note on [Co2 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002.md).

According to the power ... - That I may not use the power with which
Christ has invested me for maintaining discipline in his church. The
same form of expression is found in [Co2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008.md); see the note on that place.

Finally, brethren - (λοιπὸν loipon). The remainder; all that remains is
for me to bid you an affectionate farewell. The word here rendered
"farewell" (χαίρετε chairete), means usually to joy and rejoice, or to
be glad; [Luk 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md); [Joh
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md), [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md); and it is often used in the
sense of "joy to you," "hail!" as a salutation; [Mat
26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049.md); [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029.md). It is also used as a salutation
at the beginning of an epistle, in the sense of greeting; [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md); [Act
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026.md); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md). It is generally agreed, however,
that it is here to be understood in the sense of farewell, as a parting
salutation, though it may be admitted that there is included in the word
an expression of a wish for their happiness. This was among the last
words which Cyrus, when dying, addressed to his friends.

Be perfect - See this word explained in the notes on [Co2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009.md), and [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md). It was a wish that every
disorder might be removed; that all that was out of joint might be
restored; that everything might be in its proper place; and that they
might be just what they ought to be: A command to be perfect, however,
does not prove that it has ever in fact been obeyed: and an earnest wish
on the part of an apostle that others might be perfect, does not
demonstrate that they were; and this passage should not be adduced to
prove that any have been free from sin. It may be adduced, however, to
prove that an obligation rests on Christians to be perfect, and that
there is no natural obstacle to their becoming such, since God never can
command us to do an impossibility. Whether anyone, but the Lord Jesus,
has been perfect, however, is a question on which different
denominations of Christians have been greatly divided. It is incumbent
on the advocates of the doctrine of sinless perfection to produce some
one instance of a perfectly sinless character. This has not yet been
done.

Be of good comfort - Be consoled by the promises and supports of the
gospel. Take comfort from the hopes which the gospel imparts. Or the
word may possibly have a reciprocal sense, and mean, comfort one
another; see Schleusner. Rosenmuller renders it, "receive admonition
from all with a grateful mind, that you may come to greater perfection."
It is, at any rate, the expression of an earnest wish on the part of the
apostle, that they might be happy.

Be of one mind - They had been greatly distracted, and divided into
different parties and factions. At the close of the Epistle he exhorts
them as he had repeatedly done before, to lay aside these strifes, and
to be united, and manifest the same spirit; see the notes on [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md); [Rom
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005.md), note; see the note also on [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md), note. The sense is, that Paul
desired that dissensions should cease, and that they should be united in
opinion and feeling as Christian brethren.

Live in peace - With each other. Let contentions and strifes cease. To
promote the restoration of peace had been the main design of these
epistles.

And the God of love and peace - The God who is all love, and who is the
Author of all peace. What a glorious appellation is this! There can be
no more beautiful expression, and it is as true as it is beautiful, that
God is a God of love and of peace. He is infinitely benevolent; He
delights in exhibiting His love; and He delights in the love which His
people evince for each other. At the same time, He is the Author of
peace, and He delights in peace among people. When Christians love each
other they have reason to expect that the God of love will be with them;
when they live in peace, they may expect the God of peace will take up
His abode with them. In contention and strife we have no reason to
expect His presence; and it is only when we are willing to lay aside all
animosity that we may expect the God of peace will fix his abode with
us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 13:12</span></span>

Greet - Salute; see the note, [Rom
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md).

With an holy kiss - note, [Rom 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 13:13</span></span>

All the saints salute you - That is, all who were with Paul, or in the
place where he was. The Epistle was written from Macedonia, probably
from Philippi. See the introduction, section 3.

[2 Corinthians 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 13:14</span></span>

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ - see the note, [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md). This verse contains what is
usually called the apostolic benediction - the form which has been so
long, and which is almost so universally used, in dismissing religious
assemblies. It is properly a prayer, and it is evident that the optative
εἴῃ eiē, "May the grace," etc., is to be supplied. It is the expression
of a desire that the favors here referred to may descend on all for whom
they are thus invoked.

And the love of God - May the love of God toward you be manifest. This
must refer especially to the Father, as the Son and the Holy Spirit are
mentioned in the other members of the sentence. The "love of God" here
referred to is the manifestation of his goodness and favor in the pardon
of sin, in the communication of his grace, in the comforts and
consolations which he imparts to his people, in all that constitutes an
expression of love. The love of God brings salvation; imparts comfort;
pardons sin; sanctifies the soul; fills the heart with joy and peace;
and Paul here prays that all the blessings which are the fruit of that
love may be with them.

And the communion of the Holy Ghost - compare note, [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md). The word "communion" (κοινωνία
koinōnia) means properly participation, fellowship, or having anything
in common; [Act 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md); [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md); [Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md); [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md); [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md). This is also a wish or prayer of
the apostle Paul; and the desire is either that they might partake of
the views and feelings of the Holy Spirit; that is, that they might have
fellowship with him; or that they might all in common partake of the
gifts and graces which the Spirit of God imparts. He gives love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md), as well as miraculous
endowments; and Paul prays that these things might be imparted freely to
all the church in common, that all might participate in them; all might
share them.

Amen - This word is missing, says Clarke, in almost every ms. of any
authority. It was however early affixed to the Epistle.

In regard to this closing verse of the Epistle, we may make the
following remarks:

\(1\) It is a prayer; and if it is a prayer addressed to God, it is no
less so to the Lord Jesus and to the Holy Spirit. If so, it is right to
offer worship to the Lord Jesus and to the Holy Spirit.

\(2\) there is a distinction in the divine nature; or there is the
existence of what is usually termed three persons in the Godhead. If
not. why are they mentioned in this manner? If the Lord Jesus is not
divine and equal with the Father, why is he mentioned in this
connection? How strange it would be for Paul, an inspired man, to pray
in the same breath, "the grace of a man or an angel" and "the love of
God" be with you! And if the "Holy Spirit" be merely an influence of God
or an attribute of God, how strange to pray that the "love of God" and
the participation or fellowship of an "influence of God," or an
"attribute of God" might be with them!

\(3\) the Holy Spirit is a person, or has a distinct personality. He is
not an attribute of God, nor a mere divine influence. How could prayer
be addressed to an attribute, or an influence? But here, nothing can be
plainer than that there were favors which the Holy Spirit, as an
intelligent and conscious agent, was expected to bestow. And nothing can
be plainer than that they were favors in some sense distinct from those
which were conferred by the Lord Jesus, and by the Father. Here is a
distinction of some kind as real as that between the Lord Jesus and the
Father; here are favors expected from him distinct from those conferred
by the Father and the Son; and there is, therefore, here all the proof
that there can be, that there is in some respects a distinction between
the persons here referred to and that the Holy Spirit is an intelligent,
conscious agent.

\(4\) the Lord Jesus is not inferior to the Father, that is, he has an
equality with God. If he were not equal, how could he be mentioned, as
he here is, as bestowing favors like God, and especially why is he
mentioned first? Would Paul, in invoking blessings, mention the name of
a mere man or an angel before that of the eternal God?

\(5\) the passage, therefore, furnishes a proof of the doctrine of the
Trinity that has not yet been answered, and, it is believed, cannot be.
On the supposition that there are three persons in the adorable Trinity,
united in essence and yet distinct in some respects, all is plain and
clear. But on the supposition that, the Lord Jesus is a mere man, an
angel, or an archangel, and that the Holy Spirit is an attribute, or an
influence from God, how unintelligible, confused, strange does all
become! That Paul, in the solemn close of the Epistle, should at the
same time invoke blessings from a mere creature, and from God, and from
an attribute, surpasses belief. But that he should invoke blessings from
him who was the equal with the Father, and from the Father himself, and
from the Sacred Spirit sustaining the same rank, and in like manner
imparting important blessings, is in accordance with all that we should
expect, and makes all harmonious and appropriate.

\(6\) nothing could be a more proper close of the Epistle; nothing is a
more appropriate close of public worship, than such an invocation. It is
a prayer to the ever-blessed God, that all the rich influences which he
gives as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, may be imparted; that all the
benefits which God confers in the interesting relations in which he
makes himself known to us may descend and bless us. What more
appropriate prayer can be offered at the close of public worship? How
seriously should it be pronounced, as a congregration is about to
separate, perhaps to come together no more! With what solemnity should
all join in it, and how devoutly should all pray, as they thus separate,
that these rich and inestimable blessings may rest upon them! With
hearts uplifted to God it should be pronounced and heard; and every
worshiper should leave the sanctuary deeply feeling that what he most
needs as he leaves the place of public worship; as he travels on the
journey of life; as he engages in its duties or meets its trials; as he
looks at the grave and eternity, is the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
the love of God, and the blessings which the Holy Spirit imparts in
renewing, and sanctifying, and comforting His people. What more
appropriate prayer than this for the writer and reader of these notes!
May that blessing rest alike upon us, though we may be strangers in the
flesh, and may those divine and heavenly influences guide us alike to
the same everlasting kingdom of glory.

In regard to the subscription at the end of this Epistle, it may be
observed, that it is missing in a great part of the most ancient mss.,
and is of no authority whatever; see the notes at the end of the Epistle
to the Romans, and 1 Corinthians. In this case, however, this
subscription is in the main correct, since there is evidence that it was
written from Macedonia, and not improbably from Philippi. See the
introduction to this Epistle.
