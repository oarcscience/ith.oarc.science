### [Mark Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

See this passage explained in the notes at Mat. 26:1-16.

[Mar 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

And of unleavened bread - So called because at that feast no other bread
was used but that which had been made without leaven or yeast.

By craft - By subtlety (Matthew); that is, by some secret plan that
would secure possession of him without exciting the opposition of the
people.

[Mar 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003.md)

Ointment - This word does not convey quite the proper meaning. This was
a perfume. It was used only to give a pleasant odor, and was liquid.

Of spikenard - The "nard," from which this perfume was made, is a plant
of the East Indies, with a small, slender stalk, and a heavy, thick
root. The best perfume is obtained from the root, though the stalk and
fruit are used for that purpose.

And she brake the box - This may mean no more than that she broke the
"seal" of the box, so that it could be poured out. Boxes of perfumes are
often sealed or made fast with wax, to prevent the perfume from
escaping. It was not likely that she would break the box itself when it
was unnecessary, and when the unguent, being liquid, would have been
wasted; nor from a broken box or vial could she easily have "poured it"
on his head.

[Mar 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005.md)

Three hundred pence - About forty dollars (or 9 British pounds). See the
notes at [Mat 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007.md).

[Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008.md)

She hath done what she could - She has showed the highest attachment in
her power; and it was, as it is now, a sufficient argument against there
being any "real" waste, that it was done for the honor of Christ. See
this passage explained in the notes at Mat. 26:1-16.

[Mark 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 14:12</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md).

[Mar 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md)

They killed the passover - The "paschal lamb," which was slain in
keeping the Passover.

Go and prepare - Go and provide a lamb, have it roasted, and properly
prepared with the usual things to eat with it.

[Mar 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013.md)

The city - The city of Jerusalem. They were now in Bethany, about 2
miles from the city.

A man bearing a pitcher of water - This could have been known only by
the infinite knowledge of Christ. Such a thing could not have been
conjectured, nor was there any concert between him and the man that "at
that time" he should be in a particular place to meet them, for the
disciples themselves proposed the inquiry. If Jesus knew a circumstance
like that, then he in the same way must have known all things; then he
sees "all" the actions of men - hears every word, and marks every
thought; then the righteous are under his care, and the wicked, much as
they may wish to be unseen, cannot escape the notice of his eye.

[Mar 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014.md)

The goodman of the house - This signifies simply the "master" of the
house. The original word expresses nothing respecting his character,
whether it was good or bad.

The guest-chamber - A chamber for guests or friends - an unoccupied
room.

[Mar 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015.md)

A large upper room - The word used here denotes the upper room devoted
to purposes of prayer, repose, and often of eating. See the notes at
[Mat 9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md).

Furnished and prepared - Literally, "spread" and "ready." Spread with a
carpet, or with "couches" such as were used in eating. See the notes at
[Mat 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md).

[Mark 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 14:17</span></span>

See this passage explained in the notes at Mat. 26:20-35.

[Mar 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#031.md)

More vehemently - More earnestly, more confidently.

[Mark 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 14:32</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md).

[Mar 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036.md)

Ἀββα Abba This word denotes "father." It is a Syriac word, and is used
by the Saviour as a word denoting filial affection and tenderness.
Compare [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md).

[Mar 14:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#040.md)

Neither wist they ... - Neither "knew" they. They were so conscious of
the impropriety of sleeping at that time, that they could not find any
answer to give to the inquiry why they had done it.

[Mar 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#041.md)

It is enough - There has been much difficulty in determining the meaning
of this phrase. Campbell translates it, "all is over" - that is, the
time when you could have been of service to me is gone by. They might
have aided him by watching for him when they were sleeping, but now the
time was past, and he was already, as it were, in the hands of his
enemies. It is not improbable, however, that after his agony some time
elapsed before Judas came. He had required them to watch - that is, to
keep awake during that season of agony. After that they might have been
suffered to sleep, while Jesus watched alone. As he saw Judas approach
he probably roused them, saying, It is sufficient - as much repose has
been taken as is allowable - the enemy is near, and the Son of man is
about to be betrayed.

[Mark 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 14:43</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 26:47-57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md).

[Mar 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#045.md)

Master, Master - As if expressing great joy that he had found him again.

[Mar 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051.md)

A certain young man - Who this was we have no means of determining, but
it seems not improbable that he may have been the owner of the garden,
and that he may have had an understanding with Jesus that he should
visit it for retirement when he withdrew from the city. That he was not
one of the apostles is clear. It is probable that be was roused from
sleep by the noise made by the rabble, and came to render any aid in his
power in quelling the disturbance. It is not known why this circumstance
is recorded by Mark. It is omitted by all the other evangelists. It may
have been recorded to show that the conspirators had instructions to
take the "apostles" as well as Jesus, and supposing him to be one of
them, they laid hold of him to take him before the high priest; or it
"may" have been recorded in order to place his conduct in strong and
honorable contrast with the timidity and fear of the disciples, who had
all fled. Compare the notes at [Mat
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056.md).

A linen cloth cast about his naked body - He was roused from sleep, and
probably threw around him, in his haste, what was most convenient. It
was common to sleep in linen bed-clothes, and he seized a part of the
clothes and hastily threw it round him.

The young men - The Roman soldiers. They were called "young men" because
they were made up chiefly of youth. This was a Jewish mode of speaking.
See [Gen 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md); [Sa2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014.md); [Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018.md).

Laid hold on him - Supposing him to be one of the apostles.

[Mark 14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 14:53</span></span>

See this fully explained in the notes at Mat. 26:57-75.
