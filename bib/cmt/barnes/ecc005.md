### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 5:0</span></span>

The Preacher now begins to address his hearer in the second person. The
soliloquy, hitherto unbroken, is henceforth interrupted by personal
addresses, which are repeated with increasing frequency from this place
to the end of the book. They who divide the whole book into two parts
(the first theoretical, the second practical) begin the second division
here.

There is a striking resemblance between the line of thought pursued in
this book and that of Asaph in Ps. 73. As the Psalmist, so the Preacher,
after setting forth iris view of human life, takes his hearer into the
house of God for an explanation and directions. If the expression "goest
to the house of God" [Ecc 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001) has also
the spiritual sense of entering into communion with God, Solomon here
admonishes generally that reverence is due to God, and particularly that
the "vanity" which is mingled with the "portion" that God assigns to
every man, ought to be treated as a divine mystery, not to be made an
occasion of idle thought, hasty words, and rash resolutions, but to be
considered in the fear of God [Ecc
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001); that the spectacle of unjust
oppression is to be patiently referred to God's supreme judgment [Ecc
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008); that mere riches are
unsatisfying, bring care with them, and if hoarded are transitory [Ecc
5:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010); and that a man's enjoyment of
his portion in life, including both labor and riches, is the gift of God
[Ecc 5:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018).

[Ecclesiastes 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 5:1</span></span>

Keep thy foot - i. e., Give thy mind to what thou art going to do.

The house of God - It has been said that here an ordinary devout Hebrew
writer might have been expected to call it "the house of Yahweh;" but to
those who accept this book as the work of Solomon after his fall into
idolatry, it will appear a natural sign of the writer's
self-humiliation, an acknowledgment of his unworthiness of the
privileges of a son of the covenant, that he avoids the name of the Lord
of the covenant (see [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013) note).

Be more ready to hear - Perhaps in the sense that, "to draw near for the
purpose of hearing (and obeying) is better than etc."

[Ecclesiastes 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 5:6</span></span>

Suffer not thy mouth ... - i. e., Do not make rash vows which may
hereafter be the cause of evasion and prevarication, and remain
unfulfilled.

Before the angel - The Septuagint and some other versions render "before
the face of God," meaning a spiritual being representing the presence of
God, a minister of divine justice [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021), such a one as inflicted
judgment upon David [Sa2 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017).
Others, with less probability, understand the angel to be a priest, and
refer to [Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).

[Ecclesiastes 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 5:7</span></span>

For ... vanities - Or, For so it happens through many dreams and
vanities and many words.

[Ecclesiastes 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 5:8</span></span>

Matter - Rather, purpose (as in the margin, and [Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)), referring either to the will of
God or to the edict of an oppressive ruler.

For he ... they - literally, for high watches over high and the highest
over them, i. e., the king in the capital watches over the judge or
governor in the province, and God over both. This seems more in harmony
with the preceding verses, and more agreeable to the scope of this
passage than to understand the passage only of earthly rulers.

[Ecclesiastes 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 5:9</span></span>

The king himself is served by the field - Rather, the king is subject to
the field, i. e., is dependent on its cultivation. The higher ranks, if
they oppress the lower, lose thereby their own means of subsistence.

[Ecclesiastes 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 5:11</span></span>

They ... that eat them - i. e., The laborers employed, and the household
servants.

[Ecclesiastes 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 5:12</span></span>

Labouring man - Not a slave (Septuagint), but everyone who, according to
the divine direction, earns his bread in the sweat of his brow.

[Ecclesiastes 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 5:14</span></span>

Evil travail - Adverse accident, or unsuccessful employment (compare
[Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013); [Ecc
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#008)).

[Ecclesiastes 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 5:17</span></span>

Hath much sorrow ... - Rather, is very sad and hath pain and vexation.

[Ecclesiastes 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 5:18</span></span>

Rather, Behold what I have seen to be good, it is pleasant for a man to
eat. Such thankful enjoyment is inculcated by the Law [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018).

[Ecclesiastes 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 5:20</span></span>

The days will pass smoothly and pleasantly, while he lives in the
consciousness of God's favor.

Answereth him - i. e., grants his prayers.
