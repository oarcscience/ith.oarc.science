### [1 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 7:2</span></span>

Whose number was in the days of David ... - The writer would seem by
this passage to have had access to the statistics of the tribes
collected by David, when he sinfully "numbered the people" (marginal
reference). The numbers given in [Ch1
7:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004.md) probably came from the same
source.

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

Three - In Genesis, ten "sons" of Benjamin are mentioned; in Numbers,
five (marginal references). Neither list, however, contains Jediael who
was perhaps a later chieftain. If so, "son" as applied to him means only
"descendant."

It is conjectured that Becher has disappeared from the lists in 1 Chr. 8
and in Numbers, because he, or his heir, married an Ephraimite heiress,
and that his house thus passed over in a certain sense into the tribe of
Ephraim, in which the "Bachrites" are placed in Numbers [Num
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md). He retains, however, his place
here, because, by right of blood, he really belonged to Benjamin.

[1 Chronicles 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 7:7</span></span>

The lists here are remarkably different from those in marginal
references Probably the persons here mentioned were not literally
"sons," but were among the later descendants of the founders, being the
chief men of the family at the time of David's census.

[1 Chronicles 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 7:17</span></span>

These were the sons of Gilead - i. e. these descendants of Machir were
reckoned to the family of Gilead. The name "Gilead" prevailed above all
others in the line of Manasseh, the term "Gileadite" almost taking the
place of "Manassite."

[1 Chronicles 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 7:18</span></span>

Abiezer - His descendants formed one of the most important branches of
the Manassites. They furnished to Israel the greatest of the Judges,
Gideon [Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md), [Jdg
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024.md), [Jdg
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md), and were regarded as the leading
family among the so-called "sons of Gilead.

[1 Chronicles 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 7:20</span></span>

The sons of Ephraim - The genealogy is difficult. It is perhaps best to
consider Ezer and Elead [Ch1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md) as
not sons of Zabad and brothers of the second Shuthelah, but natural sons
of Ephraim. The passage would then run thusly:

"And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah (and Bered was his son, and Tahath
his son and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son, and Zabad his son, and
Shuthelah his son) and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath slew" (i. e.
the settled inhabitants, as contrasted with the nomadic Hebrews,
Amalekites, etc.).

[1 Chronicles 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 7:24</span></span>

Sherah could scarcely herself have built the Palestinian cities here
mentioned, which must belong to a time not earlier than Joshua. By "she
built" we must understand "her descendants built."

[1 Chronicles 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 7:34</span></span>

Shamer; Ahi, and Rohgah - Translate as: "The sons of Shamer [Ch1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#032.md), his brother, Rohgah, etc."
