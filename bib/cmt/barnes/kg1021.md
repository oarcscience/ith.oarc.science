### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 21:1</span></span>

A vineyard ... in Jezreel - The name Jezreel is applied in Scripture,
not merely to the town [Kg1 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046.md), but
also to the valley or plain which lies below it, between Mount Gilboa
and Little Hermon ([Sa2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009.md); [Kg2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010.md); [Hos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#005); etc..md).

The palace of Ahab at Jezreel was on the eastern side of the city,
looking toward the Jordan down the valley above described. It abutted on
the town wall [Kg2 9:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md).
Immediately below it was a dry moat. Beyond, in the valley, either
adjoining the moat, or at any rate at no great distance, was the plot of
ground belonging to Naboth [Kg2 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 21:2</span></span>

I will give thee the worth of it in money - literally, "I will give thee
silver, the worth of it." Money, in our sense of the word, that is to
say, coins of definite values, did not yet exist. The first coin known
to the Jews was the Persian daric, with which they became acquainted
during the captivity. ([Ch1 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md)
note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 21:3</span></span>

The Lord forbid it me - Or, "Yahweh forbid it me." Naboth, as a
worshipper of Yahweh, not of Baal, considers it would be wrong for him
to comply with the king's request, as contrary to the Law (margin). His
was not a mere refusal arising out of a spirit of sturdy independence,
or one based upon the sentiment which attaches men to ancestral estates.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 21:4</span></span>

Upon his bed - That is, "upon his couch." The Jews, like other
Orientals, reclined upon couches at their meals ([Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md); [Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041), etc..md). Ahab turns his face
toward the back of the couch, rejecting all converse with others, and so
remains, after the banquet is served, refusing to partake of it. Such an
open manifestation of ill temper is thoroughly characteristic of an
Oriental king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 21:7</span></span>

The meaning is, "Art thou king, and yet sufferest thyself to be thwarted
in this way by a mere subject? I, the queen, the weak woman, will give
thee the vineyard, if thou, the king, the strong man, wilt do nothing."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 21:8</span></span>

Seal - The seal is a very ancient invention. Judah's signet and
Pharaoh's signet-ring are mentioned in Genesis [Gen
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#018.md); [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md). Signets of Egyptian kings have
been found which are referred to about 2000 B.C. Sennacherib's signet,
and an impression of Sargon's, are still extant. There can be no doubt
that in the East, from a very remote antiquity, kings had seals and
appended them to all documents which they set forth under their
authority. (Compare also [Est 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012.md);
[Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008.md); [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017).md). The Hebrew mode of sealing
seems to have been by attaching a lump of clay to the document, and
impressing the seal thereupon [Job
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014.md).

His city - i. e., Jezreel [Kg1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md).
The mode in which it is spoken of here, and in [Kg1
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#011.md), seems to imply that it was not
the city from which Jezebel wrote. The court was evidently at this time
residing at Samaria [Kg1 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#043.md); and
Ahab may either have met Naboth there, or have gone down (compare [Kg1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#016).md) to Jezreel to make his request,
and then, on being refused, have returned to Samaria. The distance is
not more than seven miles.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 21:9</span></span>

The object of this fast was at once to raise a prejudice against Naboth,
who was assumed by the elders to have disgraced the town; and at the
same time to give an air of religion to the proceedings, which might
blind persons to their real injustice.

Set Naboth on high among his people - This was not an order to do Naboth
any, even apparent, honor; but simply a command to bring him forward
before a court or assembly, where he might be seen by all, tried, and
condemned.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 21:10</span></span>

Sons of Belial - i. e., "worthless persons" ([Deu
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013) note.md). Witnesses must be two in
number according to the Law [Num
35:30](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#030.md); [Deu
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md); [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md).

The word rendered "blaspheme" is that which commonly means "bless." The
opposite sense of "cursing," seems, however, to be required here and in
[Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md), [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md); [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md). Perhaps the best explanation of
the bad sense of the original word is to be found in the practice of
blessing by way of salutation, not only on meeting, but also on taking
leave [Gen 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#007.md), [Gen
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#010.md). From the latter custom the word
came to mean "bidding farewell to," and so "renouncing," "casting off,"
"cursing."

Carry him out and stone him - Naboth's offence would be twofold, and in
both cases capital; blasphemy against God being punishable with death by
the Law (marginal reference), and blasphemy against the king being a
capital offence by custom [Kg1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md);
[Sa2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#009.md); [Sa2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#021.md). The punishment would be
stoning, since the greater crime would absorb the lesser, and the Law
made stoning the punishment for blasphemy against God. As stoning always
took place outside the city (see [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058).md), Jezebel told the elders to
"carry Naboth out."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 21:11</span></span>

The ready submission of the elders and nobles implies a deep moral
degradation among the Israelites, the fruit of their lapse into
idolatry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 21:13</span></span>

Naboth had sons who were also put to death at this time (marginal
reference). It is not improbable that they were stoned together with
their parent (compare [Jos 7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024).md).
In the East, a parent's guilt constantly involves the punishment of his
children. Contrast [Kg2 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 21:16</span></span>

To take possession of it - The goods of traitors appear to have been
forfeited to the crown by the Jewish law as they still are almost
universally throughout the East. Compare [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 21:19</span></span>

Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? - These words rebuke
especially Ahab's indecent haste. He went to Jezreel the very day after
Naboth's execution [Kg2 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026.md).

The prophecy following had a double fulfillment. The main fulfillment
was by the casting of the dead body of Jehoram into Naboth's plot of
ground at Jezreel, where, like Naboth's, it was left for the dogs to eat
[Kg2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md). This spot, which was just
outside the city wall, and close to a gate [Kg2
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#031.md), was probably the actual scene of
Naboth's execution. Here did dogs lick Ahab's blood, that is, his son's
blood, the execution of the full retaliatory sentence having been
deferred to the days of his son, formally and explicitly, on Ahab's
repentance [Kg1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md). But, besides
this, there was a secondary fulfillment of the prophecy, when, not at
Jezreel but at Samaria (marginal reference), the actual blood of Ahab
himself, was licked by dogs, only in a way that implied no disgrace.
These two fulfillments are complementary to each other.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 21:20</span></span>

The words "O mine enemy," may refer partly to the old antagonism
(marginal reference; [Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md); [Kg1
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002).md); but the feeling which it
expresses is rather that of present oppositions - the opposition between
good and evil, light and darkness [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

Thou hast sold thyself to work evil - Compare the marginal references.
The metaphor is taken from the practice of men's selling themselves into
slavery, and so giving themselves wholly up to work the will of their
master. This was a widespread custom in the ancient world.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 21:21</span></span>

The prophet changes, without warning, from speaking in his own person to
speaking in the person of God. The transition is abrupt, probably
because the compiler follows his materials closely, compressing by
omission. One fragment omitted here is preserved in [Kg2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 21:23</span></span>

And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying - These are not the words of
Elijah, but of the writer, who notes a special prophecy against Jezebel,
whose guilt was at least equal to her husband's.

Wall - The marginal rendering "ditch," is preferable. There is always in
Oriental towns a space outside the walls which lies uncultivated, and
which is naturally used for the deposit of refuse of every kind. Here
the dogs prowl, and the kites and vultures find many a feast.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 21:25</span></span>

whom Jezebel stirred up - The history of Ahab's reign throughout
exhibits him as completely governed by his imperious wife. Instances of
her influence are seen in [Kg1 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007.md),
[Kg1 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#015.md), marginal reference, [Kg1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md); [Kg1
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 21:26</span></span>

The Amorites appear here as representatives of the old Canaanite nations
([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016) note.md). It seems to be
implied here that their idolatries were in the main identical with those
of the Phoenicians which Ahab had adopted.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 21:27</span></span>

The repentance of Ahab resembles that of the Ninevites [Jon
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005.md). It has the same outward signs -
fasting and sackcloth - and it has much the same inward character. It
springs, not from love, nor from hatred of sin, but from fear of the
consequences of sin. It is thus, although sincere and real while it
lasts, shallow and exceedingly short-lived. God, however, to mark His
readiness to receive the sinner who turns to Him, accepted the imperfect
offering (as He likewise accepted the penitence of the Ninevites), and
allowed it to delay the execution of the sentence [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md). So the penitence of the
Ninevites put off the fall of Nineveh for a century.

And lay in sackcloth - In this particular he seems to have gone beyond
the usual practice. We do not read elsewhere of mourners passing the
night in sackcloth.

And went softly - "As if he had no heart to go about any business"
(Patrick).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 21:29</span></span>

The evil - i. e., the main evil. See [Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md) note; and compare [Kg1
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#038.md) with marginal reference.
