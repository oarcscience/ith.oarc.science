### [Psalms Chapter 79](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 79:0</span></span>

This psalm, also, purports to be a psalm of Asaph; that is, it was
either composed by him or for him; or it was the composition of one of
his descendants who presided over the music in the sanctuary, and to
whom was given the general family name, Asaph. The psalm pertains to the
same general subject as Ps. 74, and was composed evidently in view of
the same calamities. Rudinger, DeWette, and some others, suppose that
the reference in the psalm is to the persecutions under Antiochus
Epiphanes. To this opinion, also, Rosenmuller inclines. The most common,
and the most probable supposition, however, is that it refers to the
destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans.

The contents of the psalm are as follows:

I. A statement of the calamity which had come upon the nation. The pagan
had come into the heritage of God; they had defiled the sanctuary; they
had made Jerusalem desolate; they had murdered the inhabitants; and the
nation had become a reproach before the world, [Psa
79:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md).

II\. A prayer for the divine interposition, [Psa
79:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md).

III\. Reasons for that prayer, or reasons why God should interpose in
the case, [Psa 79:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md). These reasons
are,

\(a\) that they had devoured Jacob, [Psa
79:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md);

\(b\) that the people, on account of their sins, had been brought very
low, [Psa 79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md);

\(c\) that the divine glory was at stake, [Psa
79:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md);

\(d\) that they were in a suffering and pitiable condition, many being
held as captives, and many ready to die, [Psa
79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md) :

\(e\) that justice demanded this, [Psa
79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md); and

\(f\) that this interposition would lay the foundation for praise to
God, [Psa 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 79:1</span></span>

O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance - The nations; a
foreign people. See [Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), note;
[Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); note; [Psa
78:55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#055.md), note. The term is one that
would be applicable to the Chaldeans, or Babylonians, and the probable
allusion here is to their invasion of the holy land under
Nebuchadnezzar. [Ch2 36:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md).

Thy holy temple have they defiled - They have polluted it. By entering
it; by removing the sacred furniture; by cutting down the carved work;
by making it desolate. See [Ch2
36:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md). Compare the notes at [Psa
74:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005.md).

They have laid Jerusalem on heaps - See [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md) : "And they burnt the house of
God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces
thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof."

[Psalms 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 79:2</span></span>

The dead bodies of thy servants ... - They have slain them, and left
them unburied. See [Ch2 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md). This is
a description of widespread carnage and slaughter, such as we know
occurred at the time when Jerusalem was taken by the Chaldeans. At such
a time, it is not probable that the Chaldeans would pause to bury the
slain, nor is it probable that they would give opportunity to the
captive Hebrews to remain to bury them. That would occur, therefore,
which often occurs in war, that the slain would be left on the field to
be devoured by wild animals and by the fowls of heaven.

[Psalms 79:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 79:3</span></span>

Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem - They have
poured it out in such quantities that it seems to flow like water - not
an uncommon occurrence in war. There was no event in the history of the
Hebrews to which this description would be more applicable than to the
Babylonian invasion. The language might indeed be applicable to the
desolation of the city by Antiochus Epiphanes, and also to its
destruction by the Romans; but, of course, it cannot refer to the
latter, and there is no necessity for supposing that it refers to the
former. All the conditions of a proper interpretation are fulfilled by
supposing that it refers to the time of the Chaldean invasion.

And there was none to bury them - The Chaldeans would not do it, and
they would not suffer the Hebrew people to do it.

[Psalms 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 79:4</span></span>

We are become a reproach to our neighbours - See the language in this
verse explained in the notes at [Psa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md). The words in the Hebrew are the
same, and the one seems to have been copied from the other.

[Psalms 79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 79:5</span></span>

How long, Lord? - See [Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md), note;
[Psa 74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010.md), note; and [Psa
77:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#007.md), notes. This is the language,
not of impatience, but of anxiety; not of complaining, but of wonder. It
is language such as the people of God are often constrained to employ
under heavy trials - trials which continue so long that it seems as if
they would never end.

Shall thy jealousy, burn like fire? - That is, Shall it continue to burn
like fire? Shall it utterly consume us? On the word jealousy, see the
notes at [Psa 78:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058.md).

[Psalms 79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 79:6</span></span>

Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen - Punish, as they deserve, the
nations that have risen up against thy people, and that have brought;
desolation upon the land. The word rendered here pour out is used with
reference to a cup or vial, as containing a mixture for the people to
drink - of intoxication, or of poison. See the notes at [Rev
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md); notes at [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md); notes at [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); compare [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md), [Jer
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md); [Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md); [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md), [Mat
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#042.md).

That have not known thee - Who are strangers to thee; who are thy
enemies. The prayer that the wrath of God might be poured upon them was
not because they were ignorant of him, but on account of their wicked
conduct toward the people of God. The phrase "that have not known thee"
is used merely to designate them, or to describe their character. The
prayer is not necessarily a prayer for vengeance, or in the spirit of
revenge; it is simply a prayer that justice might be done to them, and
is such a prayer as any man may offer who is anxious that justice may be
done in the world. See remarks on the imprecations in the Psalms.
General Introduction Section 6. It is not proper, however, to use this
as a proof-text that God will punish the "pagan," or will consign them
to destruction. The passage obviously has no reference to such a
doctrine, whether that doctrine be true or false.

And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name - The people
that do not worship thee; referring here particularly to those who had
invaded the land, and made it desolate.

[Psalms 79:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 79:7</span></span>

For they have devoured Jacob - literally, "They have eaten." That is,
they have eaten up what the land produced.

And laid waste his dwelling-place - His home; his habitation; the
residence of Jacob, or of the people of Israel.

[Psalms 79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 79:8</span></span>

O remember not against us forrmer iniquities - Margin, The iniquities of
them that were before us. The Hebrew may mean either former times, or
former generations. The allusion, however, is substantially the same. It
is not their own iniquities which are particularly referred to, but the
iniquity of the nation as committed in former times; and the prayer is,
that God would not visit them with the results of the sins of former
generations, though their own ancestors. The language is derived from
the idea so constantly affirmed in the Scripture, and so often
illustrated in fact, that the effects of sin pass over from one
generation to the next, and involve it in calamity. See [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md); [Lev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#005.md); [Lev
26:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md); [Num
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#018.md), [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md); compare the notes at [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md), et seg.

Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us - literally, "Hasten; let thy
tender mercies anticipate us." The word prevent here, as elsewhere in
the Scriptures, does not mean to hinder, as with us, but to go before;
to anticipate. See [Job 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012.md), note;
[Psa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md), note; [Psa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md), note; [Isa
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014.md), note; [Mat
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025.md), note; [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md), note. The prayer here is, that
God, in his tender mercy or compassion, would anticipate their ruin;
would interpose before matters had gone so far as to make their
destruction inevitable.

For we are brought very low - The idea in the original word is that of
being pendulous, or hanging down - as vines do, or as anything does that
is wilted, or withered, or as the hands do when one is weak, faint, or
sick. Then it refers to a failure or exhaustion of strength; and the
idea here is that their strength as a nation was exhausted.

[Psalms 79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 79:9</span></span>

Help us, O God of our salvation - On whom our salvation depends; who
alone can save us.

For the glory of thy name - That thy name may be honored. We are thy
professed people; we have been redeemed by thee; and thine honor will be
affected by the question whether we are saved or destroyed, It is the
highest and purest ground for prayer, that the glory or honor of God may
be promoted. See the notes at [Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md), notes at [Mat
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md); notes at [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028.md); notes at [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md).

And deliver us - From our enemies.

And purge away our sins - Forgive our sins, or cleanse us from them. The
original word is that which is commonly used to denote an atonement.
Compare in the Hebrew, [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md),;
[Eze 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md); [Exo
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015.md); [Exo
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md); [Lev
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020.md); 5:26; [Lev
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006.md), [Lev
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#011.md), [Lev
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#024.md).

For thy name's sake - See the notes at [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md).

[Psalms 79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 79:10</span></span>

Wherefore should the heathen say Where is their God? - The nations. Why
should such a course of forbearance toward them be pursued as to lead
them to ask the question whether God is able to punish them, or to come
to the conclusion that he is not the God of those who profess to worship
him. See [Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md), note; [Psa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010.md), note.

Let him be known among the heathen - Let him so manifest himself among
them that they cannot but see that he is God; that he is a just God;
that he is the Friend and Protector of his people.

In our sight - So that we may see it; or, so that it may be seen that he
is our Friend and Protector.

By the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed - Margin,
vengeance. The true idea is, "Let the avenging of the blood of thy
servants - the blood poured out, or shed, be known among the nations in
our sight." The prayer is that God would so interpose that there could
be no doubt that it was on account of the blood of his people which had
been shed by their enemies. It is a prayer that just punishment might be
executed - a prayer which may be offered at anytime.

[Psalms 79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 79:11</span></span>

Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee - The sighing of him
who is bound. The allusion here is, doubtless, to those among the
Hebrews who had been taken captives, and who "sighed" not only on
account of the sufferings which they endured in their bondage, but
because they had been taken from their country and home. The meaning is,
"Hear those sighs, and come for the deliverance of those who are thus
held in captivity."

According to the greatness of thy power - Margin, as in Hebrew, thine
arm. The arm is the symbol of power. It is implied here that great power
was needful to deliver those who were held in captivity, power such as
God only could exert - power which could be wielded only by an
Omnipotent Being. It was the power of God only which could rescue them,
as it is only by the power of God that sinners can be saved.

Preserve thou those that are appointed to die - Margin, Reserve the
children of death. The literal meaning is, "Let remain the sons of
death;" that is, Preserve those who are in such circumstances that death
is impending, and who may be called the sons of death. This might apply
to those who were condemned to death; or, to those who were sick and in
danger of death; or to those who were prisoners and captives, and who
were, by their sufferings, exposed to death. The prayer is that such
might be suffered to remain on the earth; that is, that they might be
kept alive.

[Psalms 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 79:12</span></span>

And render unto our neighbors - That is, the neighbors who had
reproached them; the surrounding people who had seen these calamities
come upon them, and who had regarded these calamities as proof that
their God was unable to protect them, or that they were suffering under
his displeasure. See the notes at [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md). "Sevenfold." Seven times the
amount of reproach which they have heaped upon us. The word seven is
often used to denote many, as seven was one of the perfect numbers. The
idea is that of complete or full vengeance. Compare [Gen
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015.md), [Gen
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024.md); [Pro
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031.md); [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md); [Mat
18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021.md); [Luk
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#004.md).

Into their bosom ... - Perhaps the allusion here is to the custom of
carrying things in the bosom of the flowing dress as it was girded
around the loins. "Let them be made to carry with them seven times the
amount of reproach which they have endeavored to heap on us."

[Psalms 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 79:13</span></span>

So we thy people, and sheep of thy pasture - See the notes at [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md).

Will give thee thanks for ever - Will praise thee always; will
acknowledge thee as our God, and will evermore render thee thanksgiving.

We will shew forth thy praise to all generations - Margin, as in Hebrew,
to generation and generation. That is, We will make arrangements that
the memory of these gracious acts shall be transmitted to future times;
to distant generations. This was done by the permanent record, made in
the Scriptures, of these gracious interpositions of God, and by their
being carefully preserved by each generation to whom they came. No work
has been more faithfully done than that by which the records of God's
ancient dealings with his people have been preserved from age to age -
that by which the sacred Scriptures have been guarded against error, and
handed down from one generation to another.
