### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 34:0</span></span>

The ordinary view of this prophecy Jer. 34, that it is a more full
account of the narrative given in [Jer
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md), is not so probable as that
which takes it in connection with [Jer
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md). Jeremiah had then informed
Zedekiah by his messengers that Jerusalem would certainly be captured:
but he was still in a condition to obtain good terms, and the prophet
goes to him and lays before him the alternative. Zedekiah with all the
obstinacy of a weak man chose to continue the war, and lost kingdom,
eyesight, and liberty.

[Jeremiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 34:1</span></span>

People - Peoples, i. e., tribes, races, under the rule of one man.

[Jeremiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 34:5</span></span>

In peace - See [Jer 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012.md) note.

Burn odors - "Make a burning." The burning was probably that of piles of
wood, and spices were added only as an special honor. It was not a
Jewish custom to burn the dead. As these burnings depended upon the
estimation in which the dead king was held, the verse implies a
prosperous reign, such as Zedekiah might have had as an obedient vassal
to BabyIon.

I have pronounced the word - I have spoken the word.

[Jeremiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 34:7</span></span>

This marks the exact time, that it was early in the campaign, while the
outlying fortresses still occupied the attention of Nebuchadnezzars
army. Lachish and Azekah were strong cities in the plain toward Egypt
and must be taken before the Chaldseans could march upon Jerusalem:
otherwise the Egyptians might collect there and fall upon them.

[Jeremiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 34:8</span></span>

It is usual with commentators to say that, the laws dealing with the
emancipation of the Hebrew slaves, as also that of the land resting
during the sabbatical year, were not observed. The narrative teaches us
the exact contrary. The manumission of the slaves on the present
occasion was the spontaneous act of Zedekiah and the people. They knew
of the law, and acknowledged its obligation. The observance of it was,
no doubt, lax: the majority let their own selfish interests prevail; but
the minority made might give way to right, and Zedekiah supported their
efforts though only in a weak way.

Early in January, in the ninth year of Zedekiah, the Chaldaean army
approached Jerusalem. The people made a covenant with the king, who
appears as the abettor of the measure, to let their slaves go free.
Possibly patriotism had its share in this: and as Jerusalem was strongly
fortified, all classes possibly hoped that if the slaves were
manumitted, they too would labor with a more hearty good-will in
resisting the enemy. In the summer of the same year the Egyptians
advanced to the rescue, and Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to meet their
attack. The Jews with a strange levity, which sets them before us in a
most despicable light, at once forced the manumitted slaves back into
bondage. With noble indignation Jeremiah rebukes them for their
treachery, assures them that the Chaldaean army will return, and warns
them of the certainty of the punishment which they so richly merited.

[Jer 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md)

As the Chaldaean army swept over the country the wealthier classes would
all flee to Jerusalem, taking with them their households. And as the
Mosaic Law was probably more carefully kept there than in the country,
the presence in these families of slaves who had grown grey in service
may have given offence to the stricter classes at the capital.

To proclaim liberty unto them - The words are those of the proclamation
of the year of jubile to the people, whereupon it became their duty to
set their slaves free.

[Jer 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009.md)

Should serve himself of them - Should make them serve him (see [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014).md).

[Jer 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011.md)

They turned, and caused ... to return - But afterward they again made
the slaves return.

[Jer 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#013.md)

The house of bondmen - The miserable prison in which, after being worked
in the fields all day in gangs, the slaves were shut up at night.

[Jer 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016.md)

At their pleasure - literally, for themselves.

[Jer 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017.md)

I will make you to be removed into - "I will cause you to be a terror
unto." Men would shudder at them.

[Jer 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md)

The words ... - The Jews spoke of "cutting" a covenant, because the
contracting parties cut a calf in twain and passed between the pieces.
Thus cutting a covenant and cutting a calf in twain, meant the same
thing.

[Jer 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md)

Which are gone up from you - i. e., which have departed for the present,
and have raised the siege.
