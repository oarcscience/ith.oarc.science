### [Deuteronomy Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 7:1</span></span>

See [Deu 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010.md) note.

[Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005.md)

Their groves - Render, their idols of wood: the reference is to the
wooden trunk used as a representation of Ashtaroth; see [Deu
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013.md) and [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md) note.

[Deu 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007.md)

The fewest of all people - God chose for Himself Israel, when as yet but
a single family, or rather a single person, Abraham; though there were
already numerous nations and powerful kingdoms in the earth. Increase
[Deu 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#010.md); [Deu
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022.md) had taken place because of the
very blessing of God spoken of in [Deu
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008.md).

[Deu 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010.md)

Repayeth them that hate him to their face - i. e., punishes His enemies
in their own proper persons.

[Deuteronomy 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 7:13</span></span>

Flocks of thy sheep - Render it instead: "the ewes of thy sheep." The
phrase is unique to Deuteronomy. The Hebrew word for "ewes" is the
plural form of Ashtoreth, the well-known name of the "goddess of the
Zidonians" [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md). This goddess,
called by the Classical writers "Astarte," and identified with "Venus,"
represented the fruitfulness of nature.

[Deuteronomy 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 7:15</span></span>

There seems to be here not so much as a reference to the plagues
inflicted miraculously by God on Egypt (compare [Exo
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026).md), as to the terrible diseases
with which, above other countries, Egypt was infested. Compare [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), [Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035.md). It is not without significance
that Egypt, which represents in Scripture the world as contrasted with
the Church, should thus above other lands lie under the power of disease
and death.

[Deuteronomy 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 7:25</span></span>

The silver or gold that is on them - The silver and gold with which the
statues of the gods were overlaid. Paul is probably alluding to this
command in [Rom 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022.md); and his
accusation of the Jew thus shows that the prohibition of the text was
very necessary.

Lest thou be snared - As by the rich ephod made by Gideon: compare the
marginal reference.
