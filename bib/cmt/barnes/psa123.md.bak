### [Psalms Chapter 123](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 123:0</span></span>

This psalm is entitled simply "Song of Degrees." See the notes at the
title of [Psa 120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md). Nothing is
intimated in regard to the authorship of the psalm, or to the occasion
on which it was composed. The only circumstance which throws any light
on its origin is the statement in [Psa
123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md), that the author and his friends
- the people of God referred to in the psalm - were exposed to derision
and contempt for their attachment to religion, especially the contempt
and reproach of those who were in circumstances of ease and affluence,
or who were in the more elevated ranks of life. This might accord well
with the condition of the exiles returning from Babylon, or with the
condition of the returned captives when rebuilding the walls of the
city, and when they met with scorn and contempt from the Samaritans and
the Ammonites; from Sanballat and Tobiah; from the Arabians and the
Ashdodites [Neh 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md); but there is no
certain evidence that the psalm was composed on that occasion. The pious
Hebrews of antiquity - David and others - and the people of God at all
times have been too much exposed to this kind of treatment to make the
mere applicability of the psalm to that particular time a reason for
concluding that it must have been composed then; and it is now
impossible to determine by whom, or on what occasion it was composed. It
refers to what may occur in any age of the world; and it expresses the
proper feelings of piety at all times when we are, on account of our
religion, exposed to "the scorning of those that are at ease, and to the
contempt of the proud."

[Psalms 123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 123:1</span></span>

Unto thee - To God.

Lift I up mine eyes - In supplication and prayer. Nature prompts us to
look up when we address God, as if he dwelt above us. It is the natural
prompting of the heart that he must be the most exalted of all beings,
dwelling above all. See [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md).

O thou that dwellest in the heavens - Whose home - whose special home -
is in heaven - above the sky. This is in accordance with the common
feelings of people, and the common description of God in the Bible,
though it is true also that God is everywhere. Compare [Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md); [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 123:2</span></span>

Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters ...
- Or, are to the hands of their masters; or, regard the hands of their
masters. That is, we look to God with the same spirit of deference,
dependence, and readiness to mark the will of God, which is evinced by
servants in regard to their masters, and by maidens in regard to the
will of a mistress. There has been some difference of view in regard to
the meaning of this comparison. Some have supposed that the allusion is
to the fact that servants, when in danger, look to their masters for
protection; others, that they look to them for the supply of their
needs; others, that when they have been guilty of an offence they look
to them alone for pardon. See Rosenmuller, in loc. The true idea,
however, seems to be, that they look to them with deference and respect;
that they attentively mark every expression of their will; that they are
ready to obey their commands on the slightest intimation of their wishes
- standing in a waiting posture, with no will of their own - their own
wills absorbed in the will of the master or the mistress.

The following extracts from Oriental travelers may illustrate the idea
here: Maundrell (Reise von Aleppo nach Jerusalem, s. 13), speaking of an
interview with the Pasha at Tripoli, says, "The servants all stood in
great numbers with the utmost respect, and in profoundest silence, and
served the guests with the utmost attention and respect." Pococke
remarks that in Egypt the slaves stand in the profoundest silence at the
end of the table, their hands laid cross-wise over one another, and that
they mark with the deepest attention the slightest movement of their
master, who conveys his wishes to them through signs and winks. Savary,
in his Letters from Egypt (p. 135), says, "The slaves stand with their
hands laid cross-wise over their breasts, silent, at the end of the
hall. "Their eyes are directed to the master," and they are attentive to
the slightest indication of his will." See other illustrations in
Rosenmuller, Morgenland, ii. 109, 110. It is to such a custom as this
that the psalmist refers; and the idea is, that his eyes were directed
to God, in his troubles, in profound silence, and with deep attention,
resembling that of servants waiting in stillness on their master, and
catching the slightest intimation of his will - a movement of the head
or hand - or anything which would indicate his pleasure.

Until that he have mercy upon us - We have nothing to do but wait. We
have no other resource. We can do nothing if we turn away from him. Our
only hope and expectation is there, and if we ever find relief, it must
be there. The surest - the only - hope of relief is to wait on God; and
it is the purpose of our souls to do this until we find help and
deliverance. This is the attitude in which the earnest prayer in the
next verse is offered.

[Psalms 123:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 123:3</span></span>

Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us - The language of earnest
pleading, repeating with emphasis the object of the prayer. The
supplicants are represented as standing and urging this petition,
feeling that help could come only from God; looking only to him; and
watching his countenance, as servants do their master's.

For we are exceedingly filled - The Hebrew word used here means to be
saturated; to have the appetite fully satisfied - as applied to one who
is hungry or thirsty. Then it comes to mean to be entirely full, and the
idea here is, that as much contempt had been thrown upon them as could
be; they could experience no more.

With contempt - Contempt has been shown us in every possible way. We are
thoroughly despised.

[Psalms 123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 123:4</span></span>

Our soul is exceedingly filled - Thoroughly sated. This verse states the
nature and the source of the contempt which they were called to bear.

With the scorning of those that are at ease - According to one view of
these "Psalms of Degrees" (see the Introduction to [Psa
120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001).md) this would be an instance of
an "ascent" in the sense, or of the going up of the thought, where in
[Psa 123:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003.md) there was mention made in
general of "contempt," and in this verse the thought is carried onward
and upward, or there is an additional idea which gives intensity to it.
It is the scorn proceeding from those who are at ease; that is, the
frivolous, the affluent, the proud. The word scorning means derision,
mockery. The idea in the Hebrew is derived from stammering, which the
word properly means; and then, mockery, as repeating over the words of
another, or imitating the voice of one in derision. Compare [Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md); [Job
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019.md). The phrase "those that are at
ease" properly refers to those who are tranquil or quiet, [Job
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005.md); [Isa
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018.md); [Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020.md); and then it is used of those
who are living at ease; those who are living in self-indulgence and
luxury, [Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md); [Isa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md), [Isa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011.md). Here it would seem to refer to
those who, in our language, are "in easy circumstances;" the affluent;
those who are not compelled to toil: then, the frivolous, the
fashionable, those in the upper walks of life. The contempt was
aggravated by the fact that it came from that quarter; not from the low,
the ignorant, the common, but from those who claimed to be refined, and
who were distinguished in the world of gaiety, of rank, and of fashion.
This, even for good people (such is human nature), is much more hard to
bear than contempt is when it comes from those who are in the lower
walks of life. In the latter case, perhaps, we feel that we can meet
contempt with contempt; in the former we cannot. We disregard the
opinions of those who are beneath us; there are few who are not affected
by the opinions entertained of them by those who are above them.

And with the contempt of the proud - Those who are lifted up; either in
rank, in condition, or in feeling. The essential idea is, that it was
the contempt of those to whom mankind look up. Religious people have
always had much of this to encounter, and often it is in fact a more
severe test of the reality and power of religion than the loss of goods,
or than bodily pains and penalties. We can bear much if we have the
respect - the praise - of those above us; it is a very certain test of
the reality and the power of our religion when we can bear the scorn of
the great, the noble, the scientific, the frivolous, and the
fashionable. Piety is more frequently checked and obscured by this than
it is by persecution. It is more rare that piety shines brightly when
the frivolous and the fashionable flown upon it than when princes
attempt to crush it by power. The church has performed its duty better
in the furnace of persecution than it has in the "happy" scenes of the
world.
