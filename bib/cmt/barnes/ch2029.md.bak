### [2 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 29:1</span></span>

The treatment of Hezekiah's reign by the author of Chronicles is in
marked contrast with that followed in the Book of Kings. The writer of
Kings describes mainly civil affairs; the author of Chronicles gives a
full account of Hezekiah's religious reformation. 2 Chr. 29-31 contain
matter, therefore, which is almost wholly new.

[2 Chronicles 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 29:3</span></span>

By "the first month" is meant (compare [Ch2
30:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002).md) the month of Nisan, the first
of the Jewish sacred year, not necessarily the first month of Hezekiah's
reign.

[2 Chronicles 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 29:4</span></span>

The east street - Rather, some open space before the eastern gate of the
outer temple court is intended.

[2 Chronicles 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 29:5</span></span>

Sanctify now yourselves - Compare the marginal reference. Hezekiah
follows David's example, knowing, probably, that the priests had in the
preceding time of idolatry contracted many defilements.

The "filthiness," or "uncleanness" [Ch2
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016.md), might consist, in part, of mere
dust and dirt, in part, of idolatrous objects introduced by Ahaz before
he finally shut up the temple [Kg2
16:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 29:8</span></span>

He hath delivered them to ... hissing - See [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md) note. It was an expression which
Hezekiah might naturally use, for it had occurred in a prophecy of Micah
[Mic 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md), his contemporary and
monitor [Jer 26:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md), which was
probably uttered toward the close of the reign of Ahaz. In Jeremiah the
phrase becomes common (marginal references).

[2 Chronicles 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 29:12</span></span>

On the triple division of the Levites, see [Ch1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006.md); and on the musical Levites, see
[Ch1 25:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md).

[Ch2 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013.md)

The descendants of Elizaphan - a grandson of Kohath [Exo
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022.md), and chief of the Kohathites at
the time of the census in the wilderness [Num
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#030.md) - appear at all times to have
formed a distinct branch of the Kohathites with special privileges [Ch1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#008.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 29:15</span></span>

By the words of the Lord - Rather, as suggested in the margin,
"According to the commandment of the king in the business (or matters)
of the Lord."

[2 Chronicles 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 29:16</span></span>

The "inner part" means here, not the holy of holies in particular, but
the interior generally. The priests alone might enter the temple
building. The Levites might penetrate no further than the inner court.

[2 Chronicles 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 29:21</span></span>

Hezekiah commenced his restoration of the Yahweh-worship with an
unusually comprehensive sin-offering, embracing the four chief kinds of
sacrificial animals, and seven animals of each kind: he intended to
atone for the sins, both conscious and unconscious, of the king, the
priests, the people of Judah, and the people of Israel. After the
completion of these expiatory rites, he proceeded to the offering of the
burnt-offering [Ch2 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 29:23</span></span>

The he goats for the sin offering - Rather, "the he goats of the sin
offering" - that portion of the Sin offering which had been reserved to
the last.

[2 Chronicles 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 29:24</span></span>

All lsrael - Hezekiah aimed at reuniting once more the whole people of
Israel, if not into a single state, yet, at any rate, into a single
religious communion. The northern kingdom was in a condition approaching
to anarchy. The end was evidently approaching. Hoshea, the king
contemporary with Hezekiah [Kg2 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md),
ruled, not as an independent monarch, but as an Assyrian feudatory [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md). Under these circumstances
Hezekiah designed to invite the revolted tribes to return, if not to
their old temporal, at least to their old spiritual, allegiance [Ch2
30:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005.md). In order, therefore, to
prepare the way for this return, he included "all Israel" in the
expiatory sacrifice, by which he prefaced his restoration of the old
worship.

[2 Chronicles 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 29:27</span></span>

All had hitherto been preparatory. Now Hezekiah gave orders that "the
burnt offering" - i. e. the daily morning sacrifice - should be offered
upon the brass altar in front of the porch, thus restoring and
reinstituting the regular temple-service. A burst of music gave notice
to the people of the moment when the old worship recommenced.

[2 Chronicles 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 29:31</span></span>

Hezekiah addresses, not the priests, but the congregation: "Now that by
the atoning sacrifice which has been offered for you, you are
consecrated once more to be a holy people to the Lord, approach with
confidence and offer your free-will offerings as of old."

Burnt offerings - The term thus translated is applied especially to
those victims which were to be wholly consumed upon the altar. In the
"sacrifices," or peace offerings generally, and the "thank offerings" -
a particular kind of peace offering [Lev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012).md) - the greater part of the victim
belonged to, and was consumed by, the worshipper. Hence, to offer "burnt
offerings," was indicative of a "free heart."

[2 Chronicles 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 29:34</span></span>

The Levites were more upright etc - See the marginal reference. Urijah,
the high priest, had participated to some extent in the impieties of
Ahaz [Kg2 16:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). He and many of the
priests may, therefore, have looked coldly on the reforming zeal of
Hezekiah.
