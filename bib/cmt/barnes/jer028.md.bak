### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

In the beginning ... Zedekiah - Probably a gloss put into the margin to
explain "the same year," from where it has crept into the text.

Gibeon - A city of priests [Jos 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md).
Hananiah was probably a priest as well as a prophet. He chose either a
Sabbath or a new moon, that he might confront Jeremiah not only in the
presence of the priests, but also of all the people. He used [Jer
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md) the solemn formula which claims
direct inspiration.

[Jeremiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 28:3</span></span>

Within two full years - literally, In yet two years even days. Hananiah
probably was induced to fix this date by the expectation that the
confederacy then on foot would defeat Nebuchadnezzar.

[Jeremiah 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 28:4</span></span>

Jeconiah - Zedekiah not being popular, the people would have preferred
the young king, who had not reigned long enough to make enemies.
Probably also Zedekiah had started for Babylon [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md).

[Jeremiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 28:6</span></span>

Jeremiah's own wishes concurred with Hananiah's prediction, but asserts
that that prediction was at variance with the language of the older
prophets.

[Jer 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009.md)

Then shall the prophet ... - Or, "shall be known as the prophet whom the
Lord hath truly sent."

[Jeremiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 28:10</span></span>

The multitude would see in Hananiah's act a symbol of deliverance.

[Jeremiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 28:16</span></span>

I will cast thee - Rather, I send thee away. God had not sent Hananiah
to prophesy, but He does now send him away to die.

Taught rebellion - As Nebuchadnezzar was Yahweh's servant, to teach
rebellion against him was to teach rebellion against his Master.
