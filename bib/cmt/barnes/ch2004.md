Heritage

### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 4:1</span></span>

The supplementary character of Chronicles is here once more apparent.
The author of Kings had omitted to record the dimensions of the brass
altar. It stood in the great court [Ch2
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#012.md).

[2 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 4:3</span></span>

For "oxen" we find in [Kg1 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024.md),
"knops" or "gourds." An early copyist, not comprehending the
comparatively rare word here used for "gourd," and expecting to hear of
oxen, as soon as the molten sea was mentioned, changed the reading.

[2 Chronicles 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 4:5</span></span>

Three thousand baths - See [Kg1 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md)
note. It is quite possible that either here or in Kings the text may
have been accidentally corrupted.

[2 Chronicles 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 4:7</span></span>

According to their form - Rather, "after their manner" (compare [Ch2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#020).md). There is no allusion to the
shape of the candlesticks, which were made, no doubt, after the pattern
of the original candlestick of Moses.

[2 Chronicles 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 4:8</span></span>

The number of the tables (see [Ch2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019).md) and of the basins, is additional
to the information contained in Kings.

[2 Chronicles 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 4:16</span></span>

Huram his father - Or, "Huram his master-workman" ([Ch2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013) note.md).

[2 Chronicles 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 4:17</span></span>

Zeredathah - Or, Zarthan (marginal reference). The writer of Chronicles
probably uses the name which the place bore in his own day.

[2 Chronicles 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 4:19</span></span>

The tables - A single table only is mentioned in [Kg1
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048.md); [Ch2
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#018.md). It is supposed that Solomon
made ten similar tables, any one of which might be used for the
showbread; but that the bread was never placed on more than one table at
a time.

[2 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 4:22</span></span>

The entry of the house - The text is, by some, corrected by [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md), "the hinges" of the doors of the
house, etc.
