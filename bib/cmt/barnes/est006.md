### [Esther Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md)

[Esther 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003.md)

It was a settled principle of the Persian government that "Royal
Benefactors" were to receive an adequate reward. The names of such
persons were placed on a special roll, and care was taken that they
should be properly recompensed, though they sometimes waited for months
or years before they were rewarded.

[Esther 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008.md)

The honors here proposed by Haman were such as Persian monarchs rarely
allowed to subjects. Each act would have been a capital offence if done
without permission. Still, we find Persian monarchs allowing their
subjects in these or similar acts under certain circumstances.

[Esther 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012.md)

It is quite consonant with Oriental notions that Mordecai, after
receiving the extraordinary honors assigned him, should return to the
palace and resume his former humble employment.
