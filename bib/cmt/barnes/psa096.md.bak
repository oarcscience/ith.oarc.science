### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 96:0</span></span>

This psalm is similar in structure and design to [Psa
95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md). It is an exhortation to
universal praise, and was doubtless designed to be used in public
worship - in the service of the sanctuary.

The psalm has no title in the Hebrew, and its authorship cannot with any
certainty be determined. There is, however, a very marked similarity
between this psalm and a portion of that which was composed and sung at
the removal of the ark by David, as recorded in 1 Chr. 16, and of which
it is said [Ch1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007.md), "Then on that
day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord, into the hand of
Asaph and his brethren." Of the original psalm, therefore, David was
undoubtedly the author. [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)
is merely an abridgment of that one, or more properly an extract from
it, since it is essentially similar to one portion of it, and is taken
from it with very slight variations, [Ch1
16:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md). But by whom the extract and
the slight alterations were made, and on what occasion this was done, we
have no certain means of ascertaining. The title in the Septuagint is,
"When the house was built after the captivity. An ode by David." The
same is the title in the Latin Vulgate. According to this, it is
supposed that on the dedication of the temple, when it was rebuilt after
the Babylonian captivity, a portion of a psalm composed by David was
selected and arranged for that purpose.

Hence, it might be properly called "A Psalm of David;" though not, of
course, composed by him for that particular occasion. This seems to me
to be a very probable account of the origin of the psalm, and of the
reason why it has its present form. In the original psalm 1 Chr. 16
there were things which would not be particularly appropriate to the
dedication of the temple, while the portion which is extracted is
eminently suited for such a service. DeWette doubts the genuineness of
the psalm in 1 Chr. 16; and Hengstenberg supposes that that psalm was
made up of parts taken from psalms which were then in common use. But it
seems to me that the suggestion above is the most natural, and
sufficiently explains the origin of this psalm. It would be very
appropriate to the re-dedication of the temple; and it is appropriate to
be used in similar services at all times.

The structure of the psalm is very simple, and it does not admit of any
particular analysis.

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

O sing unto the Lord a new song - See the notes at [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md). This is the only addition made
to the original form of the psalm. The word new here implies that there
was some fresh occasion for celebrating the praises of God; that some
event had occurred, or that some truth relating to the divine character
had now been made known, which could not well be expressed in any psalm
or hymn then in use. It is a call on all to celebrate the praises of the
Lord in a "new" song - new, particularly, as it calls on "all the earth"
to join in it; and possibly this was designed to suggest the idea that
while that temple stood, a dispensation would commence, under which the
distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles would be broken down, and
all mankind would unite in the praise of God.

Sing unto the Lord, all the earth - All nations. All people had occasion
to bless his name; to praise him. What he had done, what he was still
doing, was of interest to all lands, and made an appeal to all people to
praise him. The psalm is constructed on this supposition, that the
occasion for praise referred to was one in which all people were
interested; or, in other words, that Yahweh was the true God over all
the nations, and that all people should acknowledge him.

[Psalms 96:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 96:2</span></span>

Sing unto the Lord, bless his name - This verse is substantially the
same as [Ch1 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#023.md); "Sing unto the
Lord, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation."

Show forth his salvation - His interposition; the fact that he has saved
or delivered us. This may have referred originally in particular to what
he had done to save the people in time of danger, but the language is
such also as to express salvation in a higher sense - salvation from sin
and death. As such it may be employed to express what God has done for
mankind - for all people, Jews and Gentiles - in providing a way of
salvation, and making it possible that they should reach heaven. For
this all people have occasion for praise.

From day to day - Continually; always. It is a fit subject for unceasing
praise. Every man should praise God every day - on each returning
morning, and on every evening - for the assurance that there is a way of
salvation provided for him, and "that he may be happy forever." If we
had right feelings, this would be the first thought which would burst
upon the mind each morning, irradiating, as with sunbeams, all around
us; and it would be the last thought which would linger in the soul as
we lie down at night, and close our eyes in slumber - making us
grateful, calm, happy, as we sink to rest, for whether we wake or not in
this world we may be forever happy.

[Psalms 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 96:3</span></span>

Declare his glory among the heathen - Among the nations; the people who
are not Hebrews. The meaning is, Let it be proclaimed in all lands,
among all people. Let it not be confined to those who are professedly
his people, but let it be announced everywhere. This is copied literally
from [Ch1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#024.md).

His wonders among all people - His "marvelous works;" those things which
are suited to produce astonishment in the mind. The reference is to
those works and doings of God which lie so far beyond the power of any
created being, and which by their vastness, their wisdom, and their
benevolence, are suited to produce a deep impression on the human mind.

[Psalms 96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 96:4</span></span>

For the Lord is great - Yahweh is great. See the notes at [Psa
77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013.md). This verse is taken literally
from [Ch1 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#025.md).

And greatly to be praised - Worthy of exalted praise and adoration.

He is to be feared above all gods - He is to be reverenced and adored
above all that are called gods. Higher honor is to be given him; more
lofty praise is to be ascribed to him. He is Ruler over all the earth,
and has a claim to universal praise. Even if it were admitted that they
were real gods, yet it would still be true that they were local and
inferior divinities; that they ruled only over the particular countries
where they were worshipped and acknowledged as gods, and that they had
no claim to "universal" adoration as Yahweh has.

[Psalms 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 96:5</span></span>

For all the gods of the nations are idols - All the gods worshipped by
the people of other lands are mere "idols." None of them can claim to
have a real existence as gods. The word here rendered "idols" is
translated by the Septuagint, δαιμόνια daimonia, "demons." So the Latin
Vulgate "daemonia." The Hebrew word - אליל 'ĕlı̂yl - means properly "of
nothing, nought, empty, vain." See [Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md). The meaning here is, that they
were mere nothings; they had no real existence; they were the creations
of the imagination; they could not in any sense be regarded as what it
was pretended they were; they had no claim to reverence and worship as
gods. Of most of them it was a fact that they had no existence at all,
but were mere creatures of fancy. Of those that did really exist, as the
sun, moon, stars, animals, or the spirits of departed people, though it
was true that they had an actual existence, yet it was also true that
they had no existence "as gods," or as entitled to worship; and hence,
it was also true that the worship offered to them was as vain as that
which was offered to mere beings of the imagination. This verse is
extracted literally from [Ch1 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#026.md).
The Hebrew is the same.

But the Lord made the heavens - Yahweh created the heavenly hosts, and
therefore he is the true God, and is entitled to worship. The power of
"creation" - of causing anything to exist where there was nothing before
- must pertain to God alone, and is the highest act of Divinity. No
pretended pagan god has that power; no man has that power. The true God
has reserved the exercise of that power to himself, and has never, in
any instance, imparted it to a created being.

[Psalms 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 96:6</span></span>

Honour and majesty are before him - This part of the verse is taken
literally from [Ch1 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027.md). The meaning
is, that that which constitutes honor, glory, majesty, is in his
presence, or wherever he is. Whereever he manifests himself, there are
the exhibitions of honor and majesty. They are always the accompaniments
of his presence.

Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary - This is slightly varied from
the parallel passage in [Ch1 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027.md).
The word rendered "strength" is in both places the same. The word
rendered "beauty" here - תפארת tiph'ereth - is in [Ch1
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027.md) חדוה chedvâh - "joy or
gladness." The word here rendered "sanctuary" - מקדשׁ miqdâsh - is in
[Ch1 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#027.md) - מקום mâqôm - "place."
These variations are such as to show that the psalm is not a mere
extract, but that it was altered of design, and adapted to the occasion
on which it was to be employed - confirming the supposition that it may
have been used in the re-dedication of the temple after the return from
the captivity. The word "sanctuary" refers to the holy place where God
dwells; his sacred abode, whether his residence in heaven, or the temple
on earth as the place of his earthly habitation. When it is said that
"strength" is there, it means that the dwelling-place of God is the
source of "power," or that power emanates from thence; that is, from God
himself. When it is said that "beauty" is there, the meaning is, that
whatever is suited to charm by loveliness; whatever is a real ornament;
whatever makes the world attractive; whatever beautifies and adorns
creation, has its home in God; it proceeds from him. It may be added
that whatever there is of "power" to reform the world, and convert
sinners; whatever there is to turn people from their vicious and
abandoned course of life; whatever there is to make the world better and
happier, proceeds from the "sanctuary" - the church of God. Whatever
there is that truly adorns society, and makes it more lovely and
attractive; whatever there is that diffuses a charm over domestic and
social life; whatever there is that makes the world more lovely or more
desirable to live in - more courteous, more gentle, more humane, more
kind, more forgiving - has its home in the "sanctuary," or emanates from
the church of God.

[Psalms 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 96:7</span></span>

Give unto the Lord - Ascribe unto the Lord - to Yahweh. This is
extracted literally from [Ch1 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#028.md).

O ye kindreds of the people - Hebrew, "Families" of the people: people,
as united by family ties. The idea is that of worship not merely as
individuals, nor as a mere "aggregate" of individuals united by no
common bonds, but as those united by strong ties; bound by blood and
affection; constituted into communities. It is a call on such to worship
God in their capacity as thus bound together; to come as families and to
worship God. In other words, it is a call on families "as such" to
acknowledge God. A family is a proper place where to honor God. When the
same joy pervades all hearts in prosperity, and when all are alike made
sorrowful in adversity, there is an evident fitness that all should
unite in the same worship of God; and that, as in all other things they
have common interests, sympathies, and affections, so they should have
in religion - in the service of their Creator.

Give unto the Lord glory and strength - That is, Proclaim that these
belong to God; or, worship him as a God of glory and power.

[Psalms 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 96:8</span></span>

Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name - This also is literally
taken from 1 Chr. 16: [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)
:28. The margin here is, as in Hebrew, of "his name:" the honor of his
name. The idea is that which is expressed in our translation. Bring to
God what is due to him; or, render such an acknowledgment as he deserves
and claims. Acknowledge him as God, and acknowledge him to be such a God
as he is. Let the honor due to God as such be given him; and let the
honor due to him, for the character which he actually has, be ascribed
to him.

Bring an offering - This is language taken from the temple-worship, and
means that God is to be worshipped, in the manner which he has
prescribed, as a suitable expression of his majesty. The word here
rendered "offering" - מנחה minchāh - is that which is commonly used to
denote a "bloodless" offering - a thank-offering. See the notes at [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md).

And come into his courts - The courts or areas around the tabernacle and
the temple, where sacrifices were made, and where the people worshipped.
See the notes at [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md).

[Psalms 96:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 96:9</span></span>

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness - This verse is literally
taken from [Ch1 16:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#029.md). The margin
here is, "in the glorious sanctuary." The Septuagint, ἐν αὐλῇ ἁγίᾳ en
aulē hagia - "in his holy court." So the Latin Vulgate. On the meanings
of the expression, see the notes at [Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md).

Fear before him, all the earth - All lands; all people. The word
rendered "fear" means properly to writhe, to twist, to be in pain; and
then, to tremble, to quake, to be afraid. The word "tremble" would
perhaps best express the idea here. It is that solemn awe produced by
the sense of the divine presence and majesty which causes trembling. It
denotes profound reverence for God.

[Psalms 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 96:10</span></span>

Say among the heathen - Among the nations; all nations. Make this
proclamation everywhere. This is changed from the parallel passage in 1
Chr. 16. The language there is, "Fear before him, all the earth; the
world also shall be stable, that it be not moved: let the heavens be
glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let people say among the nations,
The Lord reigneth." The sense is, however, essentially the same. The
idea here is, "Make universal proclamation that Yahweh is King."

That the Lord reigneth - See the notes at [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md).

The world also shall be established ... - Under the reign of God. The
meaning is, that the world is fixed or immovable. It has its place, and
it cannot be moved out of it. The government of God is fixed and stable.
It is not temporary, changing, vacillating, like the dynasties of the
earth, but is stedfast and abiding, and is well represented by the earth
- so fixed and firm that nothing can move it from its place.

He shall judge the people righteously - The people of all lands; the
nations of the earth. See the notes at [Psa
67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 96:11</span></span>

Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad - Let all worlds be
full of joy, as they are all interested in the fact here stated. The
universe is one. It has been made by the same hand; it is under the
control of the same mind; it is governed by the same laws. The God who
reigns on earth reigns in heaven; and what affects one part of the
universe affects all. Hence, in all the manifestation of the character
of God, whether made in heaven or in the earth, it is proper to call on
all the universe to partake in the general joy.

Let the sea roar - In praise to God. It is not uncommon in the
Scriptures to call on inanimate things to praise God. Compare [Psa
148:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md). The same thing is common in
all poetry.

And the fulness thereof - Its abundance. That which fills it. All that
it contains. That is, Let all that dwell in the seas praise God. His
reign is an occasion for universal gladness. All in the inanimate world;
all among the irrational tribes of being; all in the air, in the waters,
or on the earth, have occasion for praise, and would render praise if
they could appreciate the wisdom and goodness evinced in their creation.
Though unconscious, the lower creatures seem to celebrate his praise;
but man only can give an intelligent utterance to thanksgiving.

[Psalms 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 96:12</span></span>

Let the field be joyful ... - This is taken - with the change of a
single letter, not affecting the sense - from [Ch1
16:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#032.md). It is a call on the fields -
the cultivated portions of the earth - to rejoice in the reign of God.
As if conscious of the beauty with which he clothes them, and of the
happiness which they confer on man in their beauty and in the abundance
of their productions, they are called on to praise God.

Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice - The forests - the oaks,
the cedars, the pines, that wave with so much majesty. If they were
conscious of their own magnificence and beauty - if they could see how
much wisdom and goodness God has lavished on them, in their forms, their
branches, their leaves, their flowers, their fruit - if they could know
how much they are made to accomplish in rendering the world beautiful,
and in contributing to the happiness of man - if they understood what a
bare, bleak, cold, desert world this would be but for them, they, too,
would have abundant occasion for praise and joy.

[Psalms 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 96:13</span></span>

Before the Lord - This is altered from 1 Chr. 16. The language there is
simply, "Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
the Lord, because he cometh to judge the earth." The meaning here is,
that all these things have occasion to praise the Lord whenever he
appears; to rejoice in the presence of Him who has made them what they
are.

For he cometh - That is, he will come. He will manifest himself as a
righteous judge. He will come to reign over the world, and there will be
in his reign universal occasion for joy. The allusion would seem to be
to some future time when God would come to reign among people; to
dispense justice; to vindicate his people, and to establish truth. The
"language" is such as would properly refer to the anticipated reign of
the Messiah, as a reign of righteousness, and is such language as is
frequently employed in the Old Testament to denote the character of his
reign. There is no reason to doubt that this psalm may be "designed" to
describe the reign of the Messiah, and that the psalmist in this
language may have looked forward to that future kingdom of righteousness
and peace.

For he cometh to judge the earth ... - See this language explained in
the notes at [Psa 72:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md); and the
notes at [Isa 11:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md). What is here
stated occurs now, wherever the gospel reigns in the hearts of people;
it will be fully accomplished when the Lord Jesus shall come again and
judge the world.
