### [Joshua Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 18:1</span></span>

After all overt resistance was overcome, the tabernacle with its sacred
contents was removed from its place of safety at Gilgal, in a corner of
the land near the Jordan, to a central place, Shiloh, the modern Scilun,
which is two or three miles east of the main road, and rather more than
half way between Jerusalem and Nablous. Its choice as the national
sanctuary may indeed have been determined by Joshua, no doubt under
divine direction [Deu 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), because
of its insignificance, in order to avoid local jealousies, as well as
because of its position in the very center of the whole land, and
perhaps also because of its seclusion. Its very name ("rest") was
probably bestowed at this juncture when God had given the people rest
from their enemies. The tabernacle with its contents continued at Shiloh
during the whole period of the Judges, until its capture by the
Philistines. Shiloh [Sa1 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003.md) seems
to have fallen into desolation at an early date [Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md); [Jer
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006.md).

[Joshua 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 18:2</span></span>

Two tribes and a half had already received their portions on the east of
Jordan; Judah, Ephraim, and the remaining half of Manasseh had also been
provided for Josh. 15-17. Thus there remained still seven tribes out of
the twelve to be settled in their homes.

[Joshua 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 18:3</span></span>

This backwardness probably arose from the indisposition of the people to
abandon the nomad life in which they had been born and bred, and to
settle in fixed abodes, and perhaps also from a dislike of the
exterminating warfare incidental to a complete dispossessing of the
Canaanites.

[Joshua 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 18:4</span></span>

Three men for each tribe - i. e. 21 in all. Their duty would be to
describe the land, especially with reference to the cities it contained
[Jos 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#009.md), that Joshua might have the
means of making a first apportionment among the tribes according to
their varying numbers.

[Joshua 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 18:10</span></span>

Cast lots - See the [Jos 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#002.md) note.

[Joshua 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 18:11</span></span>

See the marginal references. There are many indications found in this
and the next chapter that the text is in great disorder, and many of the
places are still unknown.

[Jos 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014.md)

And compassed the corner ... - Render "and turned on the west side
southward." The meaning is, that at lower Beth-horon the northern
boundary-line of Benjamin curved round and ran southward - Beth-horon
being its extreme westerly point.

[Jos 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021.md)

The "Valley of Keziz," or "Emek-Keziz," is perhaps the "Wady el Kaziz,"
at no great distance east of Jerusalem.

[Jos 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022.md)

Zemaraim, i. e. "two wooded hills," is supposed to be the ruins called
"Es-Sumrah," on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho.

[Jos 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023.md)

Ophrah ([Jos 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009) note.md), to be
distinguished here and in [Sa1 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md)
from the Ophrah of [Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md), is
probably the Ephrain of [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md),
and the Ephraim of [Joh 11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054.md). It is
conjecturally identified with "Et-Taiyibeh," on the road from Jerusalem
to Bethel.

[Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024.md)

Gaba - This name, like Gibeah, Gibeon, etc. [Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md), indicates a town placed on a
hill, and occurs repeatedly in various forms in the topography of
Palestine. Gaba is the Gibeah (if [Sa1
13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md); [Sa1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#005.md), where the Hebrew has גבע Geba‛,
which is undoubtedly the correct reading throughout. The city was one of
those assigned to the Levites [Jos
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md), and lay on the northern border
of Judah. It is identified with the modern "Jeba," lying on the side of
a deep ravine opposite to Michmash ("Mukhmas"). The famous "Gibeah of
Saul," or "Giheah of Benjamin" (the Gibeath of [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md) lay at no great distance
southwest of Geba, on the high road from Jerusalem to Bethel, and is
probably to be looked for in the lofty and isolated "Tulcil-el-Ful."

[Jos 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025.md)

Ramah - i. e. "lofty;" probably the native town and abode of Samuel [Sa1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019.md); [Sa1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001.md). Its exact site is uncertain.

[Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026.md)

Mizpeh - See [Jos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md). Not the Mizpeh
of [Jos 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#038.md), but the place where
Samuel judged the people and called them together for the election of a
king [Sa1 7:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005.md); [Sa1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017.md). In the Chaldaean times it was
the residence of Gedaliah [Kg2 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md);
[Jer 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014.md). Its site is identified
with "Neby Samwil," about five miles northwest of Jerusalem.
