### [Deuteronomy Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 34:1</span></span>

Dan - This can hardly be the Dan (Dan-Laish) of [Jdg
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027) ff, which was not in Gilead. It
is probably a town of this name which stood in the north of Peraea;
perhaps the same as Dan-jaan, [Sa2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#006); and the Dan of [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014).

[Deuteronomy 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 34:3</span></span>

Unto Zoar - Compare [Gen 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022).

[Deuteronomy 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 34:4</span></span>

I have caused thee to see it - The sight thus afforded to Moses, like
that of "all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time" [Luk
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#005), was no doubt supernatural.

[Deuteronomy 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 34:5</span></span>

According to the word of the Lord - It denotes that Moses died, not
because his vital powers were exhausted, but by the sentence of God, and
as a punishment for his sin. Compare [Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051).

[Deuteronomy 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 34:6</span></span>

No man knoweth of his sepulchre - Hardly, lest the grave of Moses should
become an object of superstitious honor, because the Jews were not prone
to this particular fore of error. Bearing in mind the appearance of
Moses at the Transfiguration [Mat
17:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), and what is said by Jude [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009), we may conjecture that Moses
after death passed into the same state with Enoch and Elijah; and that
his grave could not be found because he was shortly translated
(transported) from it.

[Deuteronomy 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 34:9</span></span>

Spirit of wisdom - The practical wisdom of the ruler is especially
meant.

[Deuteronomy 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 34:10</span></span>

There arose not a prophet since in Israel - Words like these can only
have been written some time, but not necessarily a long time, after the
death of Moses. They refer more particularly to the wonders performed by
the hand of Moses at the exodus and in the desert; and do but re-echo
the declaration of God Himself ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006) ff). They may naturally enough be
attributed to one of Moses' successors, writing perhaps soon after the
settlement of the people in Canaan.
