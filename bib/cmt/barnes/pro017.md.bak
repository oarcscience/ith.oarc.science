### [Proverbs Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 17:1</span></span>

Sacrifices - The feast accompanied the offerings [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md). Part of the victims were burned
upon the altar, the rest was consumed by the worshipper and his friends.
The "house full of sacrifices" was therefore one abounding in sumptuous
feasts.

[Proverbs 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 17:2</span></span>

The "servant," it must be remembered, was a slave, but (as in such cases
as [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); [Sa2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004).md) might succeed to the
inheritance.

[Proverbs 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 17:3</span></span>

Wonderful as is the separation of the pure metal from the dross with
which it has mingled, there is something yet more wonderful in the
divine discipline which purifies the good that lies hid, like a grain of
gold, even in rough and common natures, and frees it from all admixture
of evil. Compare [Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

[Proverbs 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 17:4</span></span>

The two clauses describe two phases of the mutual affinities of evil.
The evil-doer delights in lies, the liar in bad words.

[Proverbs 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 17:5</span></span>

He that is glad at calamities - A temper common at all times as the most
hateful form of evil; the Greek ἐπιχαιρεκακία epichairekakia. The sins
spoken of in both clauses occur also in Job's vindication of his
integrity [Pro 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md), [Pro
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#029.md).

[Proverbs 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 17:6</span></span>

The reciprocity of good in sustained family relationships. A long line
of children's children is the glory of old age, a long line of ancestors
the glory of their descendants.

[Proverbs 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 17:7</span></span>

The margin renderings are more literal and give greater emphasis. What
is pointed out is not the unfitness of lying lips for the
princely-hearted, but the necessity of harmony, in each case, between
character and speech.

[Proverbs 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 17:8</span></span>

A half-satirical description of the power of bribery in palaces and
among judges. The precious stone (literally as in the margin) is
probably a gem, thought of as a talisman, which, "wherever it turns,"
will ensure "prosperity" to him who, being the possessor, has the power
to give it.

[Proverbs 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 17:9</span></span>

Seeketh love - i. e., Takes the course which leads to his gaining it.

He that repeateth a matter - The warning is directed against that which
leads a man to dwell with irritating iteration on a past offence instead
of burying it in oblivion.

Separateth very friends - Better, alienateth his chief friend. The
tale-bearer works injury to himself.

[Proverbs 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 17:11</span></span>

The proverb expresses the reverence of the East for the supreme
authority of the king. The "cruel messenger" is probably the king's
officer despatched to subdue and punish. The Septuagint renders it: "The
Lord will send a pitiless Angel."

[Proverbs 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 17:12</span></span>

The large brown bear of Syria, in her rage at the loss of her whelps,
was to the Israelites the strongest type of brute ferocity. Compare [Sa2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008.md); [Kg2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#024.md).

[Proverbs 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 17:14</span></span>

The figure is taken from the great tank or reservoir upon which Eastern
cities often depended for their supply of water. The beginning of strife
is compared to the first crack in the mound of such a reservoir. At
first a few drops ooze out, but after a time the whole mass of waters
pour themselves forth with fury, and it is hard to set limits to the
destruction which they cause.

Before it be meddled with - literally, "before it rolls, or rushes
forward."

[Proverbs 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 17:15</span></span>

People need to be warned against an unjust acquittal, no less than
against unjust condemnation. The word "justifieth" has its forensic
sense, "to declare righteous," to acquit.

[Proverbs 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 17:16</span></span>

More literally: Why is there a price in the hand of a fool? Is it to get
wisdom when he has no heart for it? No money will avail without the
understanding heart.

[Proverbs 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 17:17</span></span>

Some take the proverb to describe (as in [Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024).md) the "friend that sticketh
closer than a brother:" and render: At all times, a friend loveth, but
in adversity he is born (i. e., becomes) a brother.

[Proverbs 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 17:18</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Since nothing is nobler than the
self-sacrifice of the true friend [Pro
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md), so nothing is more contemptible
than the weakness which allows itself to be sacrificed for the sake of
worthless associates.

In the presence of his friend - i. e., "On behalf of" or "to his friend
for some third person."

[Proverbs 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 17:19</span></span>

He that exalteth his gate - i. e., Builds a stately house, indulges in
arrogant ostentation.

[Proverbs 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 17:22</span></span>

Doeth good like a medicine - Better, worketh a good healing. Omit
"like."

[Proverbs 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 17:23</span></span>

The words "out of the bosom," from the fold of the garment, rather than
from the bag or girdle in which money was usually carried, possibly
point to the stealthiness with which the "gift" (or, bribe) is offered
to the judge.

[Proverbs 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 17:24</span></span>

Before him - Set straight before his eyes as the mark to which they
look. Others, following the Septuagint and Vulgate, interpret the verse,
Wisdom is seen in the clear, stedfast look of the wise man as contrasted
with the wandering gaze of the fool.

[Proverbs 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 17:25</span></span>

Compare [Pro 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md). Here is added a
reference to the sorrow which the folly of a child brings especially to
the mother.

[Proverbs 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 17:26</span></span>

Nor to strike ... - Better, and to strike the noble (in character rather
than in rank) is against right. Compare [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md).

[Proverbs 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 17:27</span></span>

Better, A man of calm (or noble) spirit is a man of understanding.

[Proverbs 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 17:28</span></span>

Is esteemed - Or, "is" (simply). The maxim would imply that silence is
in any case good.
