### [Isaiah Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 62:0</span></span>

The same general subject is pursued in this chapter which has been
presented in the chapters which have gone before. The scope of the
chapter is consolatory, and the design is to furnish such assurances of
the divine favor toward the afflicted people of God, as would uphold and
comfort them in their trials. The language is such as would be addressed
to the exiles in Babylon, but the main reference is undoubtedly to the
times of the Messiah. The chapter may be conveniently regarded as
comprising the following portions:

I. A speaker is introduced saying that he would have no rest until Zion
should rise and obtain restoration from her degradation [Isa
62:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md). This portion contains
assurances of the divine favor, and a promise of the future restoration
and glory of Jerusalem. Who this speaker is, will be considered in [Isa
62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md). The following are the assurances
of the speaker.

1\. He would give himself no peace until splendor and glory should
spread over Zion [Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md).

2\. The Gentiles would partake of the blessings conferred on Zion, and
kings would come and unite with her [Isa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002.md).

3\. Zion would be as beautiful and glorious as a royal crown in the hand
of Yahweh [Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md).

4\. She would be no more desolate and forsaken [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md).

5\. Yahweh would delight in Zion as a young married man delights in his
bride [Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md).

II\. The speaker says that he had set watchmen on the walls of Zion, and
they are commanded to give him no rest - to be urgent and importunate in
prayer, until Jerusalem should be made glorious in the earth [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md).

III\. The solemn assurance that Yahweh had sworn that there would be
peace and security from the invasions of enemies [Isa
62:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md). The land would be no more
subjected to plunder from abroad, but there would be that kind of safety
and security which exists when a man sows and reaps without annoyance.

IV\. The people are directed to prepare the way for the coming of Yahweh
[Isa 62:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md). A crier proclaims his
approach, and directs that all obstructions should be removed.

[Isaiah 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 62:1</span></span>

For Zion's sake - (See the notes at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). On account of Zion; that is, on
account of the people of God.

I will not hold my peace - There have been very various opinions in
regard to the person referred to here by the word 'I.' Calvin and
Gesenius suppose that the speaker here is the prophet, and that the
sense is, he would not intermit his labors and prayers until Zion should
be restored, and its glory spread through all the earth. The Chaldee
Paraphrast supposes that it is God who is the speaker, and this opinion
is adopted by Grotius. Vitringa regards it as the declaration of a
prophetic choir speaking in the name of the officers of the church, and
expressing the duty of making continual intercession for the extension
of the Redeemer's kingdom. Estius supposes it to be the petition of the
Jewish people praying to God for their restoration. Amidst such a
variety of interpretation it is not easy to determine the true sense. If
it is the language of God, it is a solemn declaration that he was intent
on the deliverance of his people, and that he would never cease his
endeavors until the work should be accomplished.

If it is the language of the prophet, it implies that he would
persevere, notwithstanding all opposition, in rebuking the nation for
its sins, and in the general work of the prophetic office, until Zion
should arise in its glory. If the former, it is the solemn assurance of
Yahweh that the church would be the object of his unceasing watchfulness
and care, until its glory should fill the earth. If the latter, it
expresses the feelings of earnest and devoted piety; the purpose to
persevere in prayer and in active efforts to extend the cause of God
until it should triumph. I see nothing in the passage by which it can be
determined with certainty which is the meaning; and when this is the
case it must be a matter of mere conjecture. The only circumstance which
is of weight in the case is, that the language, 'I will not be silent,'
is rather that which is adapted to a prophet accustomed to pray and
speak in the name of God than to God himself; and if this circumstance
be allowed to have any weight, then the opinion will incline to the
interpretation which supposes it to refer to the prophet. The same thing
is commanded the watchman on the walls of Zion in [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md); and if this be the correct
interpretation, then it expresses the appropriate solemn resolution of
one engaged in proclaiming the truth of God not to intermit his prayers
and his public labors until the true religion should be spread around
the world.

I will not rest - While I live, I will give myself to unabated toil in
the promotion of this great object (see the notes at [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007).md).

Until the righteousness thereof - The word here is equivalent to
salvation, and the idea is, that the deliverance of his people would
break forth as a shining light.

Go forth as brightness - The word used here is commonly employed to
denote the splendor, or the bright shining of the sun, the moon, or of
fire (see [Isa 60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md); compare [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004.md); [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md). The meaning is, that the
salvation of people would resemble the clear shining light of the
morning, spreading over hill and vale, and illuminating all the world.

As a lamp that burneth - A blazing torch - giving light all around and
shining afar.

[Isaiah 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 62:2</span></span>

And the Gentiles shall see - (see [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md) : come a up I father me say [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md), [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016).md).

And all kings thy glory - (See the notes at [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md), [Isa
60:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010.md), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016).md).

And thou shalt be called by a new name - A name which shall be
significant and expressive of a greatly improved and favored condition
(see [Isa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004).md). The idea is, that
they would not be in a condition in which a name denoting humiliation,
poverty, and oppression would be appropriate, but in circumstances where
a name expressive of prosperity would be adapted to express their
condition. On the custom of giving significant names, see the notes at
[Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md); [Isa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md).

Which the mouth of the Lord shall name - Which shall be the more
valuable because Yahweh himself shall confer it, and which must
therefore be appropriate (see the notes at [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md), [Isa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012)..md)

[Isaiah 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 62:3</span></span>

Thou shalt also be a crown of glory - On the application of the word
'crown' to a place, see the notes at [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), where it is applied to Samaria.
Some difficulty has been felt by expositors in explaining this, from the
fact that a crown or diadem was worn on the head and not held in the
hand, and some have supposed that the word 'crown' here is equivalent to
any ornament which might be either horne in the hand or worn on the
head; others have supposed that the reference is to the custom of
carrying a chaplet or garland in the hand on festival occasions. But
probably the sense is this, 'Thou shalt I be so beautiful and prosperous
as to be appropriately regarded as a splendid crown or diadem. God shall
keep thee as a beautiful diadem - the crown of beauty among the cities
of the earth, and as that which is most comely and valuable in his
sight.' This is the sense expressed by Gataker and Rosenmuller.

And a royal diadem - Hebrew, 'A diadem of a kingdom.' The diadem is the
wreath or chaplet, usually set with diamonds, which is "encircled" (צניף
tsânı̂yph from צנף tsânaph) to roll or wind around, to encircle) around
the head. It here means such as was usually worn by monarchs; and the
sense is, that Jerusalem would become exceedingly beautiful in the sight
of God.

[Isaiah 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 62:4</span></span>

Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken - That is, thou shalt be no more
so forsaken as to make such an I appellation proper. This refers to the
new name which the prophet says [Isa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002.md) will be conferred on her.

Neither shall thy land - Thy country shall no more be so wasted that the
term desolation (שׁממה shemâmâh, Greek ἔρημος erēmos) shall be properly
applied to it.

But thou shalt be called Hepzi-bah - Margin, as Hebrew, 'My delight is
in her.' The idea is, that Yahweh would show her such favor, and he
would have so much pleasure in his people, that this name of endearment
would be appropriately given to her. The Septuagint renders this, Θέλημα
ἐμὸν Thelēma emon - 'My will,' or my delight. The sense is, that
Jerusalem would be eminently the object of his delight.

And thy land Beulah - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Married;' or rather, 'thou art
married.' The Septuagint renders it, Οἰκουμένη Oikoumenē - 'Inhabited.'
Lowth renders it, 'The wedded matron.' The figure is taken from a female
who had been divorced, and whose appropriate name was Forsaken.' God
says here that the appropriate name henceforward would not be the
Forsaken, but the married one - the one favored and blessed of God (see
the notes at Isa. 1. 1). Language like this is common in the East. 'A
sovereign is spoken of as married to his dominions; they mutually depend
on each other. When a king takes possessions from another, he is said to
be married to them' - (Roberts).

Thy land shall be married - See the notes at [Isa
54:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md), where this figure is extended
to greater length. By a similar figure the church is represented as the
beautiful bride of the Lamb of God [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md).

[Isaiah 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 62:5</span></span>

For as a young man marrieth a virgin - Roberts remarks on this, 'In
general no youth marries a widow. Such a thing I scarcely ever heard of
(in India), nor will it ever be except under some very extraordinary
circumstances, as in the case of a queen, princess, or great heiress.
Even widowers also, if possible, always marry virgins.' The idea here
is, that Yahweh would have delight in his people, which would be
properly represented by the affection which a young man has for his
bride.

So shall thy sons marry thee - Lowth renders this, 'So shall thy
restorer wed thee.' He supposes that the word rendered in our common
version, 'thy sons' (בניך bânâyı̂k), should be pointed בניך bonayı̂k, as a
participle from בנה bânâh, 'to build,' rather than from בן bên, 'a son.'
The parallelism requires some such construction as this; and the unusual
form of expression, 'thy sons shall be wedded to thee,' seems also to
demand it. The Septuagint renders it, 'As a young man cohabits (συνοικῶν
sunoikōn) with a virgin (bride, παρθένῳ parthenō), so shall thy, sons
dwell with thee (κατοικήσουσιν οἱ υἱοί σου katoikēsousin hoi huioi sou).
So the Chaldee. the conjecture of Lowth has been adopted by Koppe and
Doderlin. Rosenmuller supposes that there is here a mingling or
confusion of figures, and that the idea is, that her sons should possess
her - an idea which is frequently conveyed by the word בעל Ba‛al, which
is used here. To me it seems that there is much force in the conjecture
of Lowth, and that the reference is to God as the 'builder,' or the
restorer of Jerusalem, and that the sense is that he would be 'married,'
or tenderly and indissolubly united to her. If it be objected that the
word is in the 'plural (בניך bonayı̂k) it may be observed thai the word
commonly applied to God (אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym) is also plural, and that an
expression remarkably similar to the one before us occurs in [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md), 'For thy Maker is thy husband'
(Hebrew, בעליך bo‛ălayk, 'Thy husbands.') It is not uncommon to use a
plural noun when speaking of God. It should be remembered that the
points in the Hebrew are of no authority, and that all the change
demanded here is in them.

And as the bridegroom - Margin, as in Hebrew,' With the joy of the
bridegroom.'

Over the bride - In the possession of the bride - probably the most
tender joy which results from the exercise of the social affections.

[Isaiah 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 62:6</span></span>

I have set watchmen upon thy walls - (See the notes at [Isa
21:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006).md). The speaker here is
undoubtedly Yahweh; and by watchmen he means those whom he had appointed
to be the instructors of his people - the ministers of religion. The
name 'watchmen' is often given to them ([Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md); [Eze
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#007.md); see the notes at [Isa
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md); [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010).md).

Which shall never hold their peace - The watches in the East are to this
day performed by a loud cry as they go their rounds. This is done
frequently in order to mark the time, and also to show that they are
awake to their duty. "The watchmen in the camp of the caravans go their
rounds, crying one after another, 'God is one; He is merciful'; and
often add, 'Take heed to yourselves'" - (Tavernier). The truth here
taught is, that they who are appointed to be the ministers of religion
should be ever watchful and unceasing in the discharge of their duty.

Ye that make mention of the Lord - Margin, 'That are the Lord's
remembrancers.' These are evidently the words of the prophet addressing
those who are watchmen, and urging them to do their duty, as he had said
[Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md) he was resolved to do his,
Lowth renders this, 'O ye that proclaim the name of Yahweh.' Noyes, 'O
ye that praise Yahweh.' But this does not express the sense of the
original as well as the common version. The Hebrew word המזכירים
hamazekiyriym, from זכר zâkar, "to remember") means properly those
bringing to remembrance, or causing to remember. It is a word frequently
applied to the praise of God, or to the celebration of his worship [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md); [Psa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md); [Psa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#017.md); [Psa
70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md); [Psa
102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md). In such instances the word
does not mean that they who are engaged in his service cause Yahweh to
remember, or bring things to his recollection which otherwise he would
forget; but it means that they would keep up his remembrance among the
people, or that they proclaimed his name in order that he might not be
forgotten. This is the idea here. It is not merely that they were
engaged in the worship of God; but it is, that they did this in order to
keep up the remembrance of Yahweh among people. In this sense the
ministers of religion are 'the remembrancers' of the Lord.

Keep not silence - Hebrew, 'Let there be no silence to you.' That is, be
constantly employed in public prayer and praise.

[Isaiah 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 62:7</span></span>

And give him no rest - Margin, 'Silence.' In Hebrew the same word (דמי
dŏmiy) as in [Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md). The idea is,
'Keep not silence yourselves, nor let him rest in silence. Pray without
ceasing; and do not intermit your efforts until the desires of your
hearts shall be granted, and Zion shall be established, and the world
saved.'

Till he establish - Until he shall establish Jerusalem, and restore it
to its former rank and privileges.

Till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth - That it may be the
subject of universal commendation and rejoicing, instead of being an
object of reproach and scorn. The truth taught here is, that it is the
privilege and duty of the ministers of God to pray unceasingly for the
extension of his kingdom. Day and night the voice of prayer is to be
urged, and urged as if they would give Yahweh no rest until the desires
of their hearts should be granted (compare [Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001) ff.md).

[Isaiah 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 62:8</span></span>

The Lord hath sworn by his right hand - An oath was taken in various
forms among the ancients. It was usually done by lifting up the hand
toward beaten and appealing to God. As God could swear by no greater
[Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md), he is represented as
swearing by himself (see the notes at [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023).md). Here he is represented as
swearing by his right hand and by his arm - the strong instrument by
which he would accomplish his purposes to defend and save his people.
The sense is, that he solemnly pledged the strength of his arm to
deliver them, and restore them to their own land.

Surely I will no more give - Margin, as in Hebrew, 'If I give.' That is,
I will not give.

Thy corn to be meat - The word 'corn' in the Scriptures means all kinds
of grain - especially wheat, barley, etc. The word 'meat' was formerly
used to denote all kinds of food, and was not restricted as it is now
usually to animal food. The meaning is, that they should not be
subjected to the evils of foreign invasion and conquest.

And the sons of the stranger - Foreigners, [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010.md).

Shall not drink thy wine - The productions of your toil shall be safe,
and you shall enjoy them yourselves. All this denotes a state of safety
and prosperity, such as there would be if they were allowed to cultivate
the soil without interruption, and were permitted to enjoy the fruit of
their labors.

[Isaiah 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 62:9</span></span>

But they that have gathered it shall eat it - There shall be a state of
security, so that every man may enjoy the avails of his own labor.
Nothing is a more certain indication of liberty and prosperity than this
- that every man may securely enjoy the avails of his own labor. Nothing
more certainly marks the advance of civilization, and nothing so much
tends to encourage industry and to promote prosperity. When a man has no
security that what he sows shall be reaped by himself; when there is
danger that it will be destroyed or consumed by foreign invaders; or,
when it is liable to be taken by arbitrary power to minister to the
needs and luxuries of the great, there will be no industry, no
incitement to labor. Such is the condition always in war. Such is the
condition now in the Turkish dominions; and such is the state in savage
life, and in all uncivilized communities. And as the tendency of true
religion is to repress wars, to establish order, and to diffuse just
views of the rights of man, it everywhere promotes prosperity by
furnishing security that a man shall enjoy the avails of his own
productive industry. Wherever the Christian religion prevails in its
purity, there is seen the fulfillment of this prophecy; and the
extension of that religion everywhere would promote universal industry,
order, and law.

And praise the Lord - They shall not consume it on their lusts, nor
shall they partake of it without gratitude. God shall be acknowledged as
the bountiful giver, and they shall render him appropriate thanksgiving.

And they that have brought it together - They who have gathered in the
vintage.

Shall drink it in the courts of my holiness - It would be drank with
gratitude to God in the feasts which were celebrated at the temple (see
[Lev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md); [Deu
12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md); [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023).md). The idea is, that the effect
of true religion would be to produce security and liberty, and to make
people feel that all their blessings came from God; to partake of them
with gratitude, and to make them the occasion of praise and
thanksgiving.

[Isaiah 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 62:10</span></span>

Go through, go through the gates - The connection of this with what goes
before is not very apparent, and there has been a great diversity of
opinion in regard to it among interpreters. Grotius supposes that it
refers to the priests and Levites who are referred to also in the
previous verses, and that it is a command for them to enter into the
temple. Calvin supposes that it refers to the Christian church, and that
the idea is, that the gates of it should be continually open for the
return of penitent sinners. Rosenmuller supposes that it is an address
to the cities lying between Babylon and Jerusalem, and that the idea is,
that their gates would be thrown open for the return of the exiles, and
that all obstacles would be taken out of the way. Others suppose that it
refers to the Jews, and that the command is to them to go through the
gates of Babylon, and an immediate order is added to the people to
prepare the way for them. This last seems to me to be the sense of the
passage. It is a direction to the exiles in Babylon to go forth and
return to their own land. The gates so long closed against their return
would be thrown open, and they would now have liberty to depart for
their own country. Thus explained, the connection is apparent. The
watchmen were commanded to pray until this was done [Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007.md); the prophet had said that he
would not rest until it was done [Isa
62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md); Yahweh had promised this in a
most solemn manner [Isa 62:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md); and
now those prayers are heard, and that promise is about to be fulfilled,
and they are commanded to leave the city and enter upon their journey to
their own land (compare the notes at [Isa
52:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010).md).

Prepare ye the way of the people - (Compare the notes at [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md).

Cast up, cast up the highway - (See the notes at [Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014).md).

Gather out the stones - Clear it from the stones - in other words, make
a smooth path on which they can travel with ease. The word which is used
here (סקל sāqal) commonly denotes to stone, or to pelt with stones, a
species of capital punishment among the Hebrews [Sa2
16:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#006.md). Hence, it means to pile up
stones in a heap; and it has also the signification of removing stones
from a field [Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), and here of
removing them from the way when they are an obstruction to the traveler.
Harmer supposes that the word here means to pile up stones at proper
distances, as a kind of landmark in the deserts, in order to mark the
way for travelers - a practice which, he says, is quite common in
Arabia. But the more correct interpretation is, that they were to remove
the stones from the way, in order that the journey might be made with
ease.

Lift up a standard - As when an army is about to march. They were about
to be collected from their dispersions and restored to their own land,
and the command is given, that the banner might be reared that they
might rally around it (see the notes at [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018.md); [Isa
59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md); [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 62:11</span></span>

Behold the Lord hath proclaimed - Proclamation is made to all nations
that Yahweh is about to come and rescue his people.

Say ye to the daughter of Zion - To Jerusalem (see the notes at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md).

Thy salvation cometh - Lowth renders this, 'Lo!, thy Saviour cometh.' So
the Vulgate, the Septuagint, the Chaldee, and the Syriac. The Hebrew
word properly means salvation, but the reference is to God as the
Deliverer or Saviour. The immediate allusion is probably to the return
from Babylon, but the remote and more important reference is to the
coming of the Redeemer (see the notes at [Isa
40:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md).

Behold, his reward is with him - See these words explained in the notes
at [Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md).

[Isaiah 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 62:12</span></span>

And they shall call them - It shall be the honorable and just name by
which they shall be known, that they are a holy people, and that they
are the redeemed of Yahweh. No name is so honorable as that; no one
conveys so much that is elevated and ennobling as to say of one, 'he is
one whom Yahweh has redeemed from sin and death and hell by atoning
blood.' He who has a just sense of the import of this name, will desire
no Other record to be made of his life - no other inscription on his
tomb - than that he is one who has been redeemed by Yahweh.

And thou shalt be called - (See the notes at [Isa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002).md).

Sought out - The city much sought after, or much desired - to wit, by
converts who shall come from afar; by foreigners who shall come to do
thee honor (see [Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); [Isa
40:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005.md), [Isa
40:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md); [Isa
49:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018).md). Or it may mean that
Jerusalem would be a city sought out and desired by Yahweh; that is, no
more forsaken by him. So Gesenius understands it.

A city not forsaken - No longer given up to the invasions of a foreign
enemy, and abandoned to long desolation. The idea is, that the church
and people of God would be the object of his kind protecting care
henceforward, and would enjoy his continued smiles.
