### [Matthew Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 19:0</span></span>

[Mat 19:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md). See also [Mar
10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 19:1</span></span>

Coasts of Judea beyond Jordan - The narrative here refers to the last
journey of the Saviour from Galilee to Jerusalem, to attend the last
Passover which he celebrated.

A considerable lapse of time occurred between his last discourse in the
preceding chapter and what is recorded here, and several important
events have been recorded by Luke and John which occurred in the
interval, as the sending out of the seventy disciples Luke 10:1-16; the
Saviour's going up to the feast of Tabernacles, and his final departure
from Galilee, passing through Samaria [Luk
9:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md); [Joh
7:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md); the healing of the ten lepers
[Luk 17:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011.md); the public teaching of
Jesus at the feast of Tabernacles John 7:11-53; the account of the woman
taken in adultery [Joh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001.md); the
reproof of the unbelieving Jews, and the escape of the Saviour from
their hands John 8:12-59; the instruction of the lawyer, and the parable
of the good Samaritan [Luk 10:28-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md);
the incidents in the house of Martha and Mary [Luk
10:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038.md); the return of the seventy
[Luk 10:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md); the healing of the
blind man on the Sabbath John 9:1-41; the festival of the Dedication
John 10:22-42; the raising of Lazarus John 11:1-46; and the counsel of
Caiaphas against Jesus, and the retiring of Jesus from Jerusalem [Joh
11:47-54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047.md). See Robinson's Harmony.
Matthew and Mark now resume the narrative by relating that after Jesus
had left Galilee he approached Jerusalem by passing through the country
beyond Jordan. The country was, in general, called Perea, and
appertained to Judea, being the region formerly occupied by the tribes
of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. The word "coasts" means regions or parts.
See the notes at [Mat 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016.md).

[Matthew 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 19:3</span></span>

The Pharisees came - See the notes at [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

Tempting him - This means, to get him, if possible, to express an
opinion that should involve him in difficulty.

Is it lawful ... - There was the more art in the captious question which
they proposed, as at that time the people were very much divided on the
subject. A part, following the opinions of Hillel, said that a man might
divorce his wife for any offence, or any dislike he might have of her.
See the notes at [Mat 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md). Others, of
the school of Shammai, maintained that divorce was unlawful except in
case of adultery. Whatever opinion, therefore, Christ expressed, they
expected that he would involve himself in difficulty with one of their
parties.

[Matthew 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 19:4</span></span>

And he answered and said ... - Instead of referring to the opinions of
either party, Jesus called their attention to the original design of
marriage, to the authority of Moses an authority acknowledged by them
both.

Have ye not read? - [Gen 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027.md); [Gen
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md). "And said, For this cause,"
etc., [Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md). That is, God, at the
beginning, made but one man and one woman: their posterity should learn
that the original intention of marriage was that a man should have but
one wife.

Shall leave his father and mother - This means, shall bind himself more
strongly to his wife than he was to his father or mother. The marriage
connection is the most tender and endearing of all human relations more
tender than even that bond which unites us to a parent.

And shall cleave unto his wife - The word "cleave" denotes a union of
the firmest kind. It is in the original taken from gluing, and means so
firmly to adhere together that nothing can separate them.

They twain shall be one flesh - That is, they two, or they that were
two, shall be united as one - one in law, in feeling, in interest, in
affection. They shall no longer have separate interests, but shall act
in all things as if they were one - animated by one soul and one wish.
The argument of Jesus here is, that since they are so intimately united
as to be one, and since in the beginning God made but one woman for one
man, it follows that they cannot be separated but by the authority of
God. Man may not put away his wife for every cause. What God has joined
together man may not put asunder. In this decision he really decided in
favor of one of the parties; and it shows that when it was proper, Jesus
answered questions without regard to consequences, from whatever cause
they might have been proposed, and however much difficulty it might
involve him in. Our Lord, in this, also showed consummate wisdom. He
answered the question, not from Hillel or Shammai, their teachers, but
from Moses, and thus defeated their malice.

[Matthew 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 19:7</span></span>

Why did Moses ... - To this they objected that Moses had allowed such
divorces [Deu 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md); and if he had
allowed them, they inferred that they could not be unlawful. See the
notes at [Mat 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md).

[Matthew 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 19:8</span></span>

He saith unto them ... - Jesus admits that this was allowed, but still
he contends that this was not the original design of marriage. It was
only a temporary expedient growing out of a special state of things, and
not designed to be perpetual. It was on account of the hardness of their
hearts. Moses found the custom in use. He found a hard-hearted and
rebellious people. In this state of things he did not deem it prudent to
forbid a practice so universal; but it might be regulated; and, instead
of suffering the husband to divorce his wife in a passion, he required
him, in order that he might take time to consider the matter, and thus
make it probable that divorces would be less frequent, to give her a
writing; to sit down deliberately to look at the matter, and probably,
also, to bring the case before some scribe or learned man, to write a
divorce in the legal form. Thus doing, there might be an opportunity for
the matter to be reconciled, and the man to be persuaded not to divorce
his wife. This, says our Saviour, was a permission growing out of a
particular state of things, and designed to remedy a prevailing evil;
but at first it was not so. God intended that marriage should be between
one man and one woman, and that they were only to be separated, in the
case specified, by him who had formed the union.

Hardness of your hearts - He speaks here of his hearers as a part of the
nation. The hardness of you Jews; as when we say, we fought with England
and gained our independence; that is, we, the American people, though it
was done by our fathers. He does not mean to say, therefore, that this
was done on account of the people whom he addressed, but of the national
hardness of heart - the stubbornness of the Jewish people as a people.

[Matthew 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 19:9</span></span>

And I say unto you - Emphasis should be laid here on the word "I." This
was the opinion of Jesus - this he proclaimed to be the law of his
kingdom this the command of God ever afterward. Indulgence had been
given by the laws of Moses; but that indulgence was to cease, and the
marriage relation to be brought back to its original intention. Only one
offence was to make divorce lawful. This is the law of God; and by the
same law, all marriages which take place after divorce, where adultery
is not the cause of divorce, are adulterous. Legislatures have no right
to say that people may put away their wives for any other cause; and
where they do, and where there is marriage afterward, by the law of God
such marriages are adulterous!

[Matthew 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 19:10</span></span>

His disciples say ... - The disciples were full of Jewish notions. They
thought that the privilege of divorcing a wife when there was a
quarrelsome disposition, or anything else that rendered the marriage
unhappy, was a great privilege; and that in such cases to be always
bound to live with a wife was a great calamity. They said, therefore,
that if such was the case - such the condition on which people married -
it was better not to marry.

[Matthew 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 19:11</span></span>

All men cannot receive this saying - The minds of people are not
prepared for this. This saying evidently means what the disciples had
just said that it was good for a man not to marry. It might be good in
certain circumstances - in times of persecution and trial, or for the
sake of laboring in the cause of religion without the care and burden of
a family. It might be good for many to live, as some of the apostles
did, without marriage, but it was not given to all people, [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md), [Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md),[Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md). To be married, or unmarried,
might be lawful, according to circumstances, [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 19:12</span></span>

For there are some eunuchs ... - Jesus proceeds to state that there were
some who were able to receive that saying and to remain in an unmarried
state. Some were so born; some were made such by the cruelty of men; and
there were some who voluntarily abstained from marriage for the kingdom
of heaven's sake - that is, that they might devote themselves entirely
to the proper business of religion. Perhaps he refers here to the
Essenes, a sect of the Jews (see the notes at [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007).md), who held that marriage was
unsuitable to their condition; who had no children of their own, but
perpetuated their sect by adopting the poor children of others. Eunuchs
were employed chiefly in attending on the females or in the harem. They
rose often to distinction, and held important offices in the state.
Hence, the word is sometimes used with reference to such an officer of
state, [Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md).

[Matthew 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 19:13</span></span>

Then were brought little children - See also [Mar
10:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013.md); [Luk
18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015.md). Probably these were brought
by some of his followers, who desired not only to devote themselves to
Jesus, but all that they had - their children as well as themselves. All
the Jews were accustomed to devote their children to God by
circumcision. It was natural, therefore, under the new dispensation,
that it should be done. Luke says they were infants. They were
undoubtedly those who were not old enough to come by choice, but their
coming was an act of the parents.

Put his hands on them and pray - It was customary among the Jews, when
blessings were sought for others in prayer, to lay the hands on the head
of the person prayed for, implying a kind of consecration to God. See
[Gen 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014.md); [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md). They had also much confidence in
the prayers of pious men, believing that those blessed by a saint or a
prophet would be happy. See [Num 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006.md);
[Luk 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#028.md).

The disciples rebuked them - That is, reproved them, or told them it was
improper. This they did, probably, either:

1\. because they thought that they were too young; or,

2\. because they thought that they would be troublesome to their Master.

[Matthew 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 19:14</span></span>

Jesus said, Suffer little children, ... - Mark adds, he was much
displeased at what the disciples said. It was a thing highly gratifying
to him, and which he earnestly sought, that children should be brought
to him, and a case where it was very improper that they should
interfere.

Of such is the kingdom of heaven - The kingdom of heaven evidently means
here the church. See the notes at [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). In Mark and Luke it is said he
immediately added, "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
little child shall not enter therein." Whosoever shall not be humble,
unambitious, and docile, shall not be a true follower of Christ or a
member of his kingdom. Of such as these - that is, of persons with such
tempers as these - is the church to be composed. He does not say of
those infants, but of such persons as resemble them, or are like them in
temper, is the kingdom of heaven made up. As emblematic, therefore, of
what his own followers were to be, and as having traits of character so
strongly resembling what he required in his followers, it was proper
that they should be brought to him. At the same time, it was proper on
their own account that they should be brought to him, and that his
blessing should be sought on them.

All are fallen; all have, a tendency to sin, and none but Jesus can save
them. Little children, too, are in a world of sickness and death, and in
the beginning of life it is proper to invoke on them the blessing of the
Saviour. They are to live forever beyond the grave; and as they have
just entered on a career of existence which can never terminate, it is
an appropriate act to seek the blessing of that Saviour who only can
make them happy forever, as they enter on their career of existence. No
act, therefore, can be more proper than that by which parents, in a
solemn ordinance of religion, give them up to God in baptism,
consecrating them to his service, and seeking for them the blessing of
the Saviour. It is probable - it is greatly to be hoped - that all
infants will be saved. No contrary doctrine is taught in the sacred
Scriptures. But it does not appear to be the design of this passage to
teach that all infants will be saved. It means simply that they should
be suffered to be brought to Christ as amiable, lovely, and uncorrupted
by the world; as having traits of mind resembling those among real
Christians; and as themselves needing his blessing.

[Matthew 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 19:15</span></span>

He laid his hands on them - Mark says he blessed them. That is, he
pronounced or sought a blessing on them.

[Matthew 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 19:16</span></span>

This account is found also in [Mar
10:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017.md); Luke 18:18-39.

[Mat 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md)

One came - This was a young man, [Mat
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020). He was a ruler (Luke.md); probably
a ruler in a synagogue, or of the great council of the nation; a place
to which he was chosen on account of his unblemished character and
promising talents. He came running (Mark); evincing great earnestness
and anxiety, He fell upon his knees (Mark); not to worship him, but to
pay the customary respectful salutation; exhibiting the highest regard
for Jesus as an extraordinary religious teacher.

Good Master - The word "good" here means, doubtless, most excellent;
referring not so much to the moral character of Jesus as to his
character as a religious teacher. It was probably a title which the Jews
were in the habit of applying to their religious teachers. The word
"Master" here means teacher.

What good thing shall I do? - He had attempted to keep all the
commandments. He had been taught by his Jewish teachers that people were
to be saved by doing something - that is, by their works; and he
supposed that this was to be the way under every system of religion. He
had lived externally a blameless life, but yet he was not at peace: he
was anxious, and he came to ascertain what, in the view of Jesus, was to
be done, that his righteousness might be complete. To "have eternal
life" means to be saved. The happiness of heaven is called "life," in
opposition to the pains of hell, called "death," or an eternal dying,
[Rev 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md); [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md). The one is real life, answering
the purposes of living - living to the honor of God and in eternal
happiness; the other is a failure of the great ends of existence -
prolonged, eternal suffering, of which temporal death is but the feeble
image.

[Mat 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md)

Why callest thou me good? - Why do you give to me a title that belongs
only to God? You suppose me to be only a man, yet you give me an
appellation that belongs only to God.

It is improper to use titles in this manner. As you Jews use them they
are unmeaning; and though the title may apply to me, yet, you did not
intend to use it in the sense in which it is proper, as denoting
infinite perfection or divinity; but you intended to use it as a
complimentary or a flattering title, applied to me as if I were a mere
man - a title which belongs only to God. The intentions, the habit of
using mere titles, and applying as a compliment terms belonging only to
God, is wrong. Christ did not intend here to disclaim divinity, or to
say anything about his own character, but simply to reprove the
intention and habit of the young man - a most severe reproof of a
foolish habit of compliment and flattery, and seeking pompous titles.

Keep the commandments - That is, do what God has commanded. He in the
next verses informs him what he meant by the commandments. Jesus said
this, doubtless, to try him, and to convince him that he had by no means
kept the commandments, and that in supposing he had he was altogether
deceived. The young man thought he had kept them, and was relying on
them for salvation. It was of great importance, therefore, to convince
him that he was, after all, a sinner. Christ did not mean to say that
any man would be saved by the works of the law, for the Bible teaches
plainly that such will not be the case, [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md), [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md); [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016.md); [Eph
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md). At the same time, however, it is
true that if a man perfectly complied with the requirements of the law
he would be saved, for there would be no reason why he should be
condemned. Jesus, therefore, since he saw he was depending on his works,
told him that if he would enter into life that is, into heaven - he must
keep the commandments; if he was depending on them he must keep them
perfectly, and if this was done he would be saved. The reasons why
Christ gave him this direction were, probably:

1\. because it was his duty to keep them.

2\. because the young man depended on them, and he ought to understand
what was required if he did - that they should be kept perfectly, or
that they were not kept at all.

3\. because he wanted to test him, to show him that he did not keep
them, and thus to show him his need of a Saviour.

[Mat 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#018.md), [Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019.md)

He saith unto him, Which? - In reply to the inquiry of the young man,
Jesus directed him to the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and fifth [Exo
20:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md), as containing the substance
of the whole - as containing particularly what he intended to show him
that he had not kept. See notes at [Mat
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md), [Mat
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md).

Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder - See the notes at [Mat
5:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md).

Thou shalt not commit adultery - See the notes at [Mat
5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md).

Thou shalt not steal - To steal is to take the property of another
without his knowledge or consent.

Thou shalt not bear false witness - Give testimony contrary to truth.
This may be done in a court of justice, or by private or public slander.
It means to say things of another which are not true.

Honour thy father ... - That is,

1\. Obey them, keep their commands, [Col
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020.md); [Eph
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md).

2\. Respect them, show them reverence.

3\. Treat their opinions with respect - do not despise them or ridicule
them.

4\. Treat their habits with respect. Those habits may be different from
ours; they may be antiquated, and to us strange, odd, or whimsical; but
they are the habits of a parent, and they are not to be ridiculed.

5\. Provide for them when sick, weary, old, and infirm. Bear with their
weakness, comply with their wishes, speak to them kindly, and deny
yourselves of rest, and sleep, and ease, to promote their welfare.

To this he added another - the duty of loving our neighbor, [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md). This Christ declared to be the
second great commandment of the law, [Mat
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md). A neighbor means:

1\. any person who lives near to us.

2\. any person with whom we have dealings.

3\. a friend or relative, [Mat 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md).

4\. any person - friend, relative, countryman, or foe, [Mar
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031.md).

5\. any person who does us good or confers a favor on us, [Luk
10:27-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md),

This commandment means, evidently:

1\. that we should not injure our neighbor in his person, property, or
character.

2\. that we should not be selfish, but should seek to do him good.

3\. that in a case of debt, difference, or debate, we should do what is
right, regarding his interest as much as our own.

4\. that we should treat his character, property, etc., as we do our
own, according to what is right.

5\. that, in order to benefit him, we should practice self-denial, or do
as we would wish him to do to us, [Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md).

It does not mean:

1\. that the love of ourselves, according to what we are, or according
to truth, is improper. The happiness of myself is of as much importance
as that of any other man, and it is as proper that it should be sought.

2\. It does not mean that I am to neglect my own business to take care
of my neighbor's. My happiness, salvation, health, and family are
committed especially to myself; and, provided I do not interfere with my
neighbor's rights or violate my obligations to him, it is my duty to
seek the welfare of my own as my first duty, [Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md), [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md). Mark adds to these commandments,
"Defraud not;" by which he meant, doubtless, to express the substance of
this to love our neighbor as ourselves. It means, literally, to take
away the property of another by violence or by deceiving him, thus
showing that he is not loved as we love ourselves.

[Mat 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020.md)

All these things have I kept from my youth up - I have made them the
rule of my life.

I have endeavored to obey them. Is there anything that I lack - are
there any new commandments to be kept? Do you, the Messiah, teach any
command besides those which I have learned from the law and from the
Jewish teachers, which it is necessary for me to obey in order to be
saved?

[Mat 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md)

If thou wilt be perfect - The word "perfect" means complete in all its
parts, finished, having no part wanting.

Thus a watch is perfect or complete when it has all its proper wheels,
and hands, and casements in order. Job was said to be perfect (see the
notes at [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001).md), not that he was
sinless, for he is afterward reproved by God himself Job 38; 39; [Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004.md); but because his piety was
properly proportioned, or had a completeness of parts. He was a pious
father, a pious magistrate, a pious neighbor, a pious citizen. His
religion was not confined to one thing, but it extended to all. Perfect
means, sometimes, the filling up, or the carrying out, or the expression
of a principle of action. Thus, [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md); "Whoso keepeth his word, in him
verily is the love of God perfected." That is, the keeping of the
commandments of God is the proper expression, carrying out, or
completion of the love of God. This is its meaning here. If thou wilt be
perfect, complete, finished - if thou writ show the proper expression of
this keeping of the commandments, go, etc. Make the obedience complete.
Mark says [Mar 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021.md), Jesus, beholding
him, loved him. He was pleased with his amiableness, his correct
character, his frankness, his ingenuousness. Jesus, as a man, was
capable of all the emotions of most tender friendship. As a man, we may
suppose that his disposition was tender and affectionate, mild and calm.
Hence, he loved with special affection the disciple John, eminently
endowed with these qualities; and hence he was pleased with the same
traits in this young man. Still, with all this amiableness, there is
reason to think he was not a Christian, and that the love of mere
amiable qualities was all the affection that was ever bestowed on him by
the Saviour.

"One thing," adds Mark, "thou lackest." There is one thing missing. You
are not complete. This done, you would show that your obedience lacked
no essential part, but was complete, finished, proportionate, perfect.

Go and sell that thou hast ... - The young man declared that he had kept
the law. That law required, among other things, that he should love his
neighbor as himself. It required, also, that he should love the Lord his
God supremely; that is, more than all other objects. If he had that true
love to God and man - if he loved his Maker and fellow-creatures more
than he did his property, he would be willing to give up his wealth to
the service of God and of man. Jesus commanded him to do this,
therefore, to test his character, and to show him that he had not kept
the law as he pretended, and thus to show him that he needed a better
righteousness than his own.

Treasure in heaven - See the notes at [Mat
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md).

Follow me - To follow Jesus then meant to be a personal attendant on his
ministry; to go about with him from place to place, as well as to
imitate and obey him. Now it means:

1\. to obey his commandments.

2\. to imitate his example, and to live like him.

[Mat 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022.md)

He had great possessions - He was very rich.

He made an idol of his wealth. He loved it more than God. He had not
kept the commandments from his youth up, nor had he kept them at all;
and rather than do good with his treasures, and seek his salvation by
obeying God, he chose to turn away from the Saviour and give over his
inquiry about eternal life. He probably returned no more. Alas, how many
lovely and amiable young persons follow his example!

[Mat 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#023.md)

A rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven - Shall with
difficulty be saved.

He has much to struggle with, and it will require the greatest of human
efforts to break away from his temptations and idols. and to secure his
salvation. Compare the notes at [Ti1
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md).

[Mat 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#024.md)

It is easier for a camel ... - This was a proverb in common use among
the Jews, and is still common among the Arabians.

To denote that a thing was impossible or exceedingly difficult, they
said that a camel or an elephant might as soon walk through a needle's
eye. In the use of such proverbs it is not necessary to understand them
literally. They merely denote the extreme difficulty of the case.

A camel - A beast of burden much used in Eastern countries. It is about
the size of the largest ox, with one or two bunches on his back, with
long neck and legs, no horns, and with feet adapted to the hot and dry
sand. They are capable of carrying heavy burdens, will travel sometimes
faster than the fleetest horse, and are provided with a stomach which
they fill with water, by means of which I they can live four or five
days without drink. They are very mild and tame, and kneel down to
receive and unload their burden. They are chiefly used in deserts and
hot climates, where other beasts of burden are with difficulty kept
alive.

A rich man - This rather means one who loves his riches and makes an
idol of them, or one who supremely desires to be rich. Mark says [Mar
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024.md) "How hard is it for them that
trust in riches." While a man has this feeling - relying on his wealth
alone - it is literally impossible that he should be a Christian; for
religion is a love of God rather than the world - the love of Jesus and
his cause more than gold. Still a man may have much property, and not
have this feeling. He may have great wealth, and love God more; as a
poor man may have little, and love that little more than God. The
difficulties in the way of the salvation of a rich man are:

1\. that riches engross the affections.

2\. that people consider wealth as the chief good, and when this is
obtained they think they have gained all.

3\. that they are proud of their wealth, and unwilling to be numbered
with the poor and despised followers of Jesus.

4\. that riches engross the time, and fill the mind with cares and
anxieties, and leave little for God.

5\. that they often produce luxury, dissipation, and vice. that it is
difficult to obtain wealth without sin, without avarice, without
covetousness, fraud, and oppression, [Ti1
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md); [Jam
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md); [Luk
12:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md); [Luk
16:19-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

Still, Jesus says [Mat 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026.md), all
these may be overcome. God can give grace to do it. Though to people it
may appear impossible, yet it is easy for God.

[Mat 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027.md)

We have forsaken all - Probably nothing but their fishing-nets, small
boats, and cottages.

But they were their all - their living, their home; and, forsaking them,
they had as really shown their sincerity as though they had possessed
the gold of Ophir and lived in the palaces of kings.

What shall we have, therefore? - We have done as thou didst command this
young man to do. What reward may we expect for it?

[Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md)

Verily I say unto you - Jesus in this verse declares the reward which
they would have.

They were not to look for it now, but in a future period.

That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration - This word occurs
but once elsewhere in the New Testament, [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). It literally means a new birth,
or being born again. Applied to man, it denotes the great change when
the heart is renewed, or when the sinner begins to be a Christian. This
is its meaning, clearly, in the passage referred to in Titus; but this
meaning cannot be applied here. Christ was not born again, and in no
proper sense could it be said that they had followed him in the new
birth; but the word also means any great change, or a restoration of
things to a former state or to a better state. In this sense it is
probably used here. It refers to that great revolution - that
restoration of order in the universe - that universal new birth which
will occur when the dead shall rise, and all human things shall be
changed, and a new order of things shall start up out of the ruins of
the old, when the Son of man shall come to judgment. The passage, then,
should be read, "Ye which have followed me shall, as a reward in the
great day of the resurrection of the dead, and of forming the new and
eternal order of things - the day of judgment, the regeneration - be
signally honored and blessed.

When the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory - That is, to
judge the world. "Throne of glory" means glorious throne or a splendid
throne. It is not to be taken literally, but is used to denote his
character as a king and judge, and to signify the great dignity and
majesty which will be displayed by him. See [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md); [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011.md); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md).

Sit upon twelve thrones - This is figurative. To sit on a throne denotes
power and honor, and means here that they would be distinguished above
others, and be more highly honored and rewarded.

Judging the twelve tribes of Israel - Jesus will be the Judge of quick
and dead. He only is qualified for it, and the Father hath given all
judgment to the Son, [Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md). To be
a judge denotes rank, authority, power. The ancient judges of Israel
were people of distinguished courage, patriotism, honor, and valor.
Hence, the word comes to denote not so much an actual exercise of the
power of passing judgment, as the honor attached to the office; and as
earthly kings have those around them dignified with honors and office -
counselors and judges, so Christ says that his apostles will occupy the
same relative station in the great day. They will be honored by him, and
by all, as apostles, as having, in the face of persecution, left all; as
having laid the foundations of his church, and endured all the
persecutions of the world.

The twelve tribes of Israel - This was the number of the ancient tribes.
By this name the people of God were denoted. By this name Jesus here
denotes his redeemed people. See also [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md), where Christians are called the
twelve tribes. Here it means also, not the Jews, not the world, not the
wicked, not that the apostles are to pronounce sentence on the enemies
of God, but the people of God, the redeemed. Among them Jesus says his
apostles will be honored in the day of judgment, as earthly kings place
in posts of office and honor those who have signally served them.
Compare the notes at [Co1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md).

[Mat 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md)

And every one that hath forsaken houses ... - In the days of Jesus,
those who followed him were obliged, generally, to forsake houses and
home, and to attend him.

In our time it is not often required that we should literally leave
them, except when the life is devoted to him among the pagan; but it is
always required that we love them less than we do him, that we give up
all that is inconsistent with religion, and that we be ready to give up
all when he demands it.

For my name's sake - From attachment to me. Mark adds, "and for the
gospel's;" that is, from obedience to the requirements of the gospel,
and love for the service of the gospel.

Shall receive a hundred-fold - Mark says "a hundred-fold now in this
time, houses, and brethren, and sisters," etc. A hundred-fold means a
hundred times as much. This is not to be understood literally, but that
he will give what will be worth 100 times as much in the peace, and joy,
and rewards of religion. It is also literally true that no man's
temporal interest is injured by the love of God. Mark adds, "with
persecutions." These are not promised as a part of the reward; but amid
their trials and persecutions they should find reward and peace.

[Mat 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030.md)

This verse should have been connected with the following chapter

The parable there spoken is expressly to illustrate this sentiment. See
it explained in the notes at [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md).

Remarks On Matthew 19

1\. We should not throw ourselves unnecessarily in the way of the
enemies of religion, [Mat 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md). Jesus,
to avoid the dangers to which he was exposed, left Jerusalem, and passed
over to the other side of the Jordan. If duty calls us to remain in the
presence of our enemies and the enemies of religion, we should do it. If
we can do them good, we should do it. If our presence will only provoke
them to anger and bitterness, then we should turn aside. Compare the
notes at [Mat 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023.md).

2\. People will seek every occasion to ensnare Christians, [Mat
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md). Questions will be proposed with
great art, and with an appearance of sincerity, only for the purpose of
leading them into difficulty. Cunning men know well how to propose such
questions, and triumph much when they have perplexed believers. This is
often the boast of people of some standing, who think they accomplish
the great purposes of their existence if they can confound other people,
and think it signal triumph if they can make others as miserable as
themselves.

3\. We should not refuse to answer such persons with mildness, when the
Bible has settled the question, [Mat
19:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md). Jesus answered a captious
question, proposed on purpose to ensnare him. We may often do much to
confound the enemies of religion, and to recommend it, when without
passion we hear their inquiries, and deliberately inform them that the
question has been settled by God. We had better, however, far better,
say nothing in reply, than to answer in anger or to show that we are
irritated. All the object of the enemy is gained if he can make us
angry.

4\. People will search and pervert the Bible for authority to indulge
their sins and to perplex Christians, [Mat
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md). No device is more common than to
produce a passage of Scripture known to be misquoted or perverted, yet
plausible, for the purpose of perplexing Christians. In such cases, the
best way, often, is to say nothing. If unanswered, people will be
ashamed of it; if answered, they gain their point, and are ready for
debate and abuse.

5\. We learn from this chapter that there is no union so intimate as the
marriage connection, [Mat 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md).
Nothing is so tender and endearing as this union appointed by God for
the welfare of man.

6\. This union should not be entered into slightly or rashly. It
involves all the happiness of this life and much of that to come. The
union demands:

\(1\) congeniality of feeling and disposition;

\(2\) of rank or standing in life;

\(3\) of temper;

\(4\) similarity of acquirements;

\(5\) of age;

\(6\) of talent;

\(7\) intimate acquaintance.

It should also be a union on religious feelings and opinions:

\(1\) because religion is more important than anything else;

\(2\) because it will give more happiness in the married life than
anything else;

\(3\) because where one only is pious, there is danger that the religion
of the other will be obscured and blighted;

\(4\) because no prospect is so painful as that of eternal separation;

\(5\) because it is paganish, brutal, and mad, to partake the gifts of
God in a family and offer no thanksgiving; inexpressibly wicked to live
from day to day as if there were no God, no heaven, no hell;

\(6\) because death is near, and nothing will soothe the pangs of
parting but the hope of meeting in the resurrection of the just.

7\. No human legislature has a right to declare divorces except in one
single case, [Mat 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md). If they do,
they are accessories to the crime that may follow, and presume to
legislate where God has legislated before them.

8\. Those thus divorced, or pretended to be divorced, and marrying
again, are, by the declaration of Jesus Christ, living in adultery, [Mat
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md). It is no excuse to say that the
law of the land divorced them. The law had no such right. If all the
legislatures of the world were to say that it was lawful for a man to
steal or to commit murder, it would not make it so, and, in spite of
human permission, God would hold a man answerable for theft and murder.
So, also, of adultery.

9\. The marriage union demands kindness and love, [Mat
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md). The husband and the wife are
one. Love to each other is love to a second self. Hatred, and anger, and
quarrels are against ourselves. The evils and quarrels in married life
will descend on ourselves, and be gall and wormwood in our own cup.

10\. Infants may be brought to Jesus to receive his blessing, [Mat
19:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md). While on earth, he admitted
them to his presence and blessed them with his prayers. If they might be
brought then, they may be brought now. Their souls are as precious;
their dangers are as great; their salvation is as important. A parent
should require the most indubitable evidence that Jesus will not receive
his offspring, and will be displeased if the offering is made, to deter
him from this inestimable privilege.

11\. If children may be brought, they should be brought. It is the
solemn duty of a parent to seize upon all possible means of benefiting
his children, and of presenting them to God to implore his blessing. In
family prayer, in the sanctuary, and in the ordinance of baptism, the
blessing of the Redeemer should be sought early and constantly on their
precious and immortal souls.

12\. Earnestness and deep anxiety are proper in seeking salvation, [Mat
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md). The young man came running; he
kneeled. It was not form and ceremony; it was life and reality. Religion
is a great subject. Salvation is important beyond the power of language
to express. Eternity is near, and damnation thunders along the path of
the guilty. The sinner must be saved soon, or die forever. He cannot be
too earnest. He cannot press with too great haste to Jesus. He should
come running, and kneeling, and humbled, and lifting the agonizing cry,
"What must I do to be saved?"

13\. We should come young, [Mat 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020.md).
No one can come too young. God has the first claim on our affections. He
made us, he keeps us, he provides for us, and it is right that we should
give our first affections to him. No one who has become a Christian ever
yet felt that he had become one too young. No young person that has
given his heart to the Redeemer ever yet regretted it. They may give up
the frivolous world to do it; they may leave the circles of the dance
and the song; they may be exposed to contempt and persecution, but no
matter. He who becomes a true Christian, no matter of what age or rank,
blesses God that he was inclined to do it, and the time never can come
when for one moment he will regret it. Why, then, will not the young
give their hearts to the Saviour, and do that which they know they never
can for one moment regret?

14\. It is no dishonor for those who hold offices, and who are people of
rank, to inquire on the subject of religion, [Luk
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018.md). Men of rank often suppose that
it is only the weak, the credulous, and the ignorant that ever feel any
anxiety about religion. Never was a greater mistake. It has been only
profligate, and weak, and ignorant people that have been thoughtless.
Two-thirds of all the profound investigations of the world have been on
this very subject. The wisest and best of the pagans have devoted their
lives to inquire about God and their own destiny. So in Christian lands.
Were Bacon, Newton, Locke, Milton, Hale, and Boerhaave men of weak
minds? Yet their deepest thoughts and most anxious inquiries were on
this very subject. So in our own land. Were Washington, Ames, Henry,
Jay, and Rush men of weak minds? Yet they were professed believers in
revelation. And yet young men of rank, and wealth, and learning often
think that they show great independence in refusing to think of what
occupied the profound attention of these men, and fancy they are great
only by refusing to tread in their steps. Never was a greater or more
foolish mistake. If anything demands attention, it is, surely, the
inquiry whether we are to be happy forever, or wretched; whether there
is a God and Saviour; or whether we are "in a forsaken and fatherless
world."

15\. It is as important for the rich to seek religion as the poor, [Mat
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022.md). They will as certainly die;
they as much need religion. Without it they cannot be happy. Riches will
drive away no pain on a death-bed - will not go with us when we die -
will not save us.

16\. It is of special importance that wealthy young persons should be
Christians. They are exposed to many dangers. The world - the "happy"
and flattering world - will lead them astray. Fond of fashion, dress,
and amusement, as many of them are, they are exposed to a thousand
follies and dangers, from which nothing but religion can secrete them.
Besides, they may do much good; and God will hold them answerable for
all the good they might have done with their wealth.

17\. The amiable, the lovely, the moral, need also an interest in
Christ, [Mar 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021.md). If amiable, we
should suppose they would be ready to embrace the Saviour. None was ever
so moral, so lovely, so pure as he. If we really loved amiableness, then
we should come to him - we should love him. But, alas! how many amiable
young persons turn away from him, and refuse to follow him! Can they be
really lovers of that which is pure and lovely? If so, then why turn
away from the Lamb of God?

18\. The amiable and the lovely need a better righteousness than their
own. With all this, they may make an idol of the world; they may be
proud, sensual, selfish, prayerless, and thoughtless about dying.
Externally they appear lovely; but oh, how far is the heart from God!

19\. Inquirers about religion usually depend on their own works, [Mat
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md). They are not willing to trust
to Jesus for salvation, and they ask what they shall do; and it is only
when they find that they can do nothing - that they are poor, and
helpless, and wretched that they east themselves on the mercy of God and
find peace.

20\. Compliments and flattering titles are evil, [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md). They ascribe something to
others which we know they do not possess. Often beauty is praised where
we know there is no beauty - accomplishment where there is no
accomplishment - talent where there is no talent. Such praises are
falsehood. We know them to be such. We intend to deceive by them, and we
know that they will produce pride and vanity. Often they are used for
the purpose of destruction. If a man praises us too much, we should look
to our purse or our virtue. We should feel that we are in danger, and
the next thing will be a dreadful blow - the heavier for all this
flattery. They that use compliments much, expect them from others; are
galled and vexed when they are not obtained; and are in danger when they
are.

21\. If we are to be saved, we must do just what God commands us. [Mat
19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md). This is all we have to do.
We are not to invent anything of our own. God has marked out the course,
and we must follow it.

22\. We are easily deceived about keeping the law, [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md). We often think we observe it,
when it is only the outward form that we have kept. The law is
spiritual, and God requires the heart.

23\. Riches are a blessing if used aright; if not, they are deceitful,
dangerous, ruinous, [Mat 19:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#023.md).
Thousands have lost their souls by the love of riches. None have ever
been saved by it.

24\. It is our duty to forsake all for Christ, [Mat
19:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027.md). Be it little or much, it is
all the same to him. It is the heart that he looks at; and we may as
really show our love by giving up a fishing-boat and net, as by giving
up a palace or a crown. If done in either case, it will be accepted.

25\. Religion has its own rewards, [Mat
19:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). It gives more than it takes.
It more than compensates for all that we surrender. It gives peace, joy,
comfort in trial and in death, and heaven beyond. This is the testimony
of all Christians of all denominations of all that have lived, and of
all that do live that they never knew true peace until they found it in
the gospel. The testimony of so many must be true. They have tried the
world in all its forms of gaiety, folly, and vice, and they come and say
with one voice, Here only is true peace. On any other subject they would
be believed. Their testimony here must be true.

26\. Those eminent for usefulness here will be received to distinguished
honors and rewards in heaven, [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). They that turn many to
righteousness shall shine as stars in the firmament forever. See the
notes at [Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md).
