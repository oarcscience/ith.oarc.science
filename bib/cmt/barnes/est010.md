### [Esther Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md)

[Esther 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 10:1</span></span>

A tribute - Perhaps an allusion to some fresh arrangement of the tribute
likely to have followed on the return of Xerxes from Greece.

Upon the isles of the sea - Cyprus, Aradus, the island of Tyre, Platea,
etc., remained in the hands of the Persians after the victories of the
Greeks, and may be the "isles" here intended.

[Esther 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 10:2</span></span>

Power and ... might - In the later years of Xerxes his "power and might"
were chiefly shown in the erection of magnificent buildings, more
especially at Persepolis. He abstained from military expeditions.

Kings of Media and Persia - Media takes precedence of Persia because the
kingdom of Media had preceded that of Persia, and in the "book of the
Chronicles" its history came first.

[Esther 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 10:3</span></span>

Mordecai ... was next unto king Ahasuerus - See [Est
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md) note. Artabanus ([Est
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014) note.md) was favorite toward the end
of Xerxes' reign, i. e. in his 20th and 21st years.
