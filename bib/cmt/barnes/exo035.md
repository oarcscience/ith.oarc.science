### [Exodus Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)

[Exodus 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 35:1</span></span>

The narrative of what relates to the construction of the sanctuary is
now resumed from [Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018).

[Exodus 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 35:2</span></span>

See [Exo 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012).

[Exodus 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 35:3</span></span>

This prohibition is here first distinctly expressed, but it is implied
[Exo 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#023).

[Exodus 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 35:11</span></span>

See Exo. 26:1-37. It has been already observed [Exo
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010) that in the instructions for
making the sanctuary, the ark of the covenant, as the principal thing
belonging to it, is mentioned first; but in the practical order of the
work, as it is here arranged, the tabernacle with its tent and covering
come first.

[Exodus 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 35:12</span></span>

The covering - This is not the same as the covering of [Exo
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011), which denotes the covering of
the tent (see [Exo 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014)): the word is
used here for the entrance curtains (see [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036); [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016)).

[Exodus 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 35:18</span></span>

The word "tabernacle" משׁכן mı̂shkān is here used for the full name, the
tabernacle of the tent of meeting. It denotes the entire structure.

[Exodus 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 35:19</span></span>

The cloths of service to do service in the holy place - Rather; the
garments of office to do service in the sanctuary, etc. See [Exo
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010).

[Exodus 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 35:22</span></span>

Bracelets - Rather, brooches.

Earrings - The Hebrew word signifies a ring, either for the nose (see
[Gen 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022)) or for the ear [Exo
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002); [Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004). That ear-rings, not nose-rings,
are here meant is confirmed by what we know of early Hebrew and Egyptian
customs.

Rings - Signet rings.

Tablets - More probably, armlets. It is most likely that all the
articles mentioned in this verse were of gold. The indulgence of private
luxury was thus given up for the honor of the Lord. Compare [Exo
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018) note.

[Exodus 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 35:27</span></span>

The precious stones [Exo 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#009) and
spices were contributed by the rulers, who were more wealthy than the
other Israelites.

[Exodus 35:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 35:32</span></span>

Curious works, cunning work - Works of skill. Compare [Exo
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#004).

[Exodus 35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 35:35</span></span>

The engraver - The artificer, literally "one who cuts": a general name
for the workman, to which was added the name of the material in which he
worked; thus the artificer in wood, or carpenter; the artificer in iron,
or smith, etc. [Exo 35:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#032); [Exo
31:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#004) enumerate the branches of work
committed to Bezaleel. What was under the charge of Aholiab is here for
the first time clearly distinguished into the work of the skilled
weaver, that of the embroiderer, and that of the weaver.

The cunning workman - The skilled weaver, literally, "the reckoner". He
might have been so called because he had nicely to count and calculate
the threads in weaving figures after the manner of tapestry or carpet.
His work was chiefly used in the curtains and veil of the tabernacle, in
the ephod and the breastplate ([Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001), [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031); [Exo
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006), [Exo
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015), etc.).

The embroiderer - He worked with a needle, either shaping his design in
stitches of colored thread, or in pieces of colored cloth sewn upon the
groundwork. His work was employed in the entrance curtains of the tent
and the court, and in the girdle of the high priest [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036); [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016); [Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039).

The weaver - He appears to have worked in the loom in the ordinary way
with materials of only a single color. The tissues made by him were used
for the robe of the ephod and its binding, and for the coats of the
priests [Exo 28:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#032); [Exo
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022), [Exo
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027).

These three classes of workers were men, while the spinners and dyers
were women [Exo 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#025).
