### [Isaiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 23:0</span></span>

This prophecy respects Tyre, and extends only to the end of this
chapter. It is made up of a succession of "apostrophes" directed either
to Tyre itself, or to the nations with which it was accustomed to trade.
The first part of the prophecy [Isa
23:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md) is occupied with the account
of the "judicial sentence" which God had passed upon Tyre. This is not
done in a direct and formal manner, but by addresses to the various
people with whom the Tyrians had commercial contact, and who would be
particularly affected by its destruction. Thus [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md) the prophet calls on the ships of
Tarshish to 'howl' because their advantageous commerce with Tyre must
cease. This intelligence respecting the calamities that had come upon
Tyre, he says would be brought to them 'from the land of Chittim' [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), that is, from the islands and
coasts of the Mediterranean. In [Isa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md), the calamity is described as
coming directly on the island on which Tyre was built. In the subsequent
verses, the prophet describes the sources of the wealth of Tyre [Isa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md), and declares that her great
luxury and splendor would be destroyed [Isa
23:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005.md). In [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md), the prophet says that this
would be done by the 'Chaldeans;' and this verse serves to fix the time
of the fulfillment to the siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. In this all
commentators probably (except Grotius, who supposes that it refers to
Aexander the Great) are agreed. Indeed, it seems to be past all doubt,
that the events here referred to pertain to the siege of Tyre by
Nebuchadnezzar. In the remainder of the prophecy ([Isa
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014) to the end of the chapter.md), the
prophet declares the "time" during which this calamity would continue.
He declares that it would be only for seventy years [Isa
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014.md), and that after that, Tyre would
be restored to her former splendor, magnificence, and successful
commerce [Isa 23:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md); and that then
her wealth would be consecrated to the service of Yahweh [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md).

The "design" of the prophecy is, therefore, to foretell the calamities
that would come upon a rich, proud, and luxurious city; and tries to
show that God was Governor and Ruler over the nations of the earth. Tyre
became distinguished for pride, luxury, and consequent dissipation; and
the destruction that was to come upon it was to be a demonstration that
wicked nations and cities wound incur the displeasure of God, and would
be destroyed.

Tyre, the subject of the prophecies, particularly of Isaiah and Ezekiel,
who both predicted its overthrow Isa. 23; Ezek. 26-29, was a celebrated
city of Phenicia, and is usually mentioned in connection with Sidon [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md), [Mat
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022.md); [Mat
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md); [Mar
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md); [Mar
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md), [Mar
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md); [Luk
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md). It was on the coast of the
Mediterranean, about lat. 33 degrees 20' N., and was about twenty miles
south of Sidon. It was one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Asher
[Jos 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md), but it is probable that
the ancient inhabitants were never driven out by the Israelites. It
seems to have been occupied by the Canaanites, and is always mentioned
as inhabited by a distinct people from the Jews [Sa2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#007.md); [Kg1
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md); [Kg1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#012.md); [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md); [Neh
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#016.md); [Psa
83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007.md); [Psa
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md). It was probably built by a
colony from Sidon: since Isaiah [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md) calls it the 'daughter of
Zidon,' and it is said [Isa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md) to
have been replenished by Sidon. That Sidon was the most ancient city
there can be no doubt. "Sidon" was the oldest son of Canaan [Gen
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015.md), and the city of Sidon is
mentioned by the patriarch Jacob [Gen
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md), and in the time of Joshua it is
called 'Great Sidon' [Jos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md). Strabo
affirms that "after Sidon," Tyre was the most celebrated city of the
Phenicians. Justin (xviii. 1, 5), expressly declares that the Sidonians,
being besieged by the king of Ascalon, went in ships and built Tyre. But
though Tyre was the 'daughter' of Sidon, yet it soon rivaled in
importance, and in commercial enterprise.

Among the ancient writers, Tyre is mentioned as Palaeo-Tyrus (Παλαίτυρος
Palaituros) or ancient Tyre, and as Insular Tyre. The former was built
on the "coast," and was doubtless built first, though there is -
evidence that the latter was early used as a place for anchorage, or a
harbor. In Old Tyre, or Tyre on the coast, undoubtedly also the most
magnificent edifices would be built, and the principal business would
there be at first transacted. Probably Insular Tyre was built either
because it furnished a better harbor, or because, being inaccessible to
an invading army, it was more secure. Insular Tyre, as the name imports,
was built on an island, or a "rock," about three quarters of a mile from
the coast, or from Old Tyre. Probably the passage from one to the other
was formerly by a ferry, or in boats only, until Alexander the Great, in
his siege of the city, built a mole from the ruins of the old city to
the new. This mole, or embankment, was not less than 200 feet in
breadth, and constituted a permanent connection between Tyre and the
mainland. Insular Tyre was remarkably safe from the danger of invasion.
It commanded the sea, and of course had nothing to dread from that
quarter; and the only mode in which it could become accessible to
Alexander, was to build this gigantic causeway from the mainland.

Tyre was distinguished for its enterprise, its commercial importance,
its luxury, and its magnificence. Few, perhaps none, of the cities of
antiquity, were more favorably situated for commerce. It was the natural
seaport of Palestine and Syria, and it was favorably situated for
commerce with all the cities and states bordering on the Mediterranean,
and, indeed, with all the known world. The luxuries of the East passed
through Tyre (see Ezek. 27, where there is an extended description of
the various nations that trafficked with and enriched it), and the
productions of distant climes from the West were introduced to the East
through this sea-port. It rose, therefore, to great opulence, and to
consequent luxury and sin.

It was also a place of great strength. Old Tyre was defended by a wall,
which was regarded as impregnable, and which is said to have resisted
the attacks of Nebuchadnezzar for thirteen years. New, or Insular Tyre,
was inaccessible, until Alexander constructed the immense mole by which
he connected it with the mainland, and as they had the command of the
sea, the city was regarded unapproachable. Alexander could not hare
taken it had he not possessed resources, and patience, and power, which
perhaps no other ancient conqueror possessed; and had he not engaged in
an enterprise which perhaps all others would have regarded as
impracticable and hopeless. Josephus, indeed, states, that Shalmaneser,
king of Assyria, made war against the Tyrians, with a fleet of sixty
ships, manned by 800 rowers. The Tyrians had but twelve ships, yet they
obtained the victory, and dispersed the Assyrian fleet, taking 500
prisoners. Shalmaneser then besieged the city for five years, but was
unable to take it. This was in the time of Hezekiah, A.M. 3287, or about
717 b.c.

Nebuchadnezzar took the city after a siege of thirteen years, during the
time of the Jewish captivity, about 573 years before Christ. This was in
accordance with the prophecy in this chapter (see the note at [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md), and according to the
predictions also of Ezekiel. The desolation was entire. The city was
destroyed, and the inhabitants driven into foreign lands (see [Isa
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007.md), note; [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012), note.md). The city lay desolate
for seventy years (see [Isa 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md),
note; [Isa 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017), note.md), and Old Tyre
was in ruins in the time of the invasion of Alexander the Great. A new
city had risen, however, on the island, called New Tyre, and this city
was taken by Alexander, after a siege of eight months. Near the shore
the water is said to have been shallow, but near the new city it was
three fathoms, or nineteen feet in depth. The city of Tyre was taken by
Alexander 332 b.c. and 241 years after its destruction by
Nebuchadnezzar, and consequently about 170 years after it had been
rebuilt.

It was not, however, entirely destroyed by Alexander, and became an
object of contention to his successors. It was successively invested by
Antigonas and Ptolemy, and fell into the hands of the latter. In the
apostolic age it seems to have regained somewhat of its ancient
splendor. There were some Christians here [Act
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md). At present it belongs to
Syria. It was often an object of contention during the crusades, and was
distinguished as the first archbishopric under the patriarchate of
Jerusalem. It gradually sunk into decay, lost its importance, and became
a place of utter ruin. Volney noticed there, in 1784, the choir of the
ancient church, the remains of the walls of the city which can still be
traced, and some columns of red granite, a species unknown in Syria. In
the time when it was visited by Volhey and Maundrell, it was a miserable
village, where the inhabitants subsisted chiefly by fishing.

Its exports consist only of a few sacks of corn and cotton; and the only
merchant of which it could boast in the time when Volney was there, was
a solitary Greek, who could hardly gain a livelihood. At present, Tyre,
or, as it is called, "Sur," is nothing more than a market town, a small
seaport, hardly deserving the name of a city. Its chief export is the
tobacco raised on the neighboring hills; with some cotton, and also
charcoal and wood from the more distant mountains. The houses are for
the most part mere hovels, very few being more than one story high, with
flat roofs. The streets are narrow lanes, crooked, and filthy. Yet the
many scattered palm trees throw over the place an oriental charm; and
the numerous Pride of India trees interspersed among the houses and
gardens, with their beautiful foliage, give it a pleasing aspect. It has
a population of less than three thousand souls. In 1837, an earthquake
was felt here to a very considerable extent. A large part of the eastern
wall was thrown down, and the southern wall was greatly shattered, and
several houses were destroyed (see Robinson's "Bib. Researches," vol.
iii. p. 400; Robinson's Calmet; "Edin. Ency.;" Newton, "On the
Prophecies," vol. xi.; Keith, "On the Prophecies;" and the "Travels" of
Volney and Maundrell. On the ancient commercial importance of Tyre,
also, and its present situation, and the "cause" of its decline, the
reader may consult an article in the "Amos Bib. Rep." for October 1840).

[Isaiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 23:1</span></span>

The burden of Tyre - (see the note at [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md)

Howl - This is a highly poetic description of the destruction that was
coming on Tyre. The ships of Tarshish traded there; and the prophet now
addresses the ships, and calls upon them to lament because the commerce
by which they had been enriched was to be destroyed, and they were to be
thrown out of employ.

Ye ships of Tarshish - (see the note at [Isa
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016).md). The 'Tarshish' here referred
to, was doubtless a city or country in Spain (Ταρτησσὸς Tartēssos), and
was the most celebrated emporium to which the Phenicians traded. It is
mentioned by Diod. Sic., v. 35-38; Strabo, iii. 148; Pliny, "Nat. Hist."
iii. 3. According to [Jer 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009.md), it
exported silver; according to [Eze
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012.md), [Eze
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#025.md), it exported silver, iron, tin,
and lead, to the Tyrian market. In this chapter [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md), [Isa
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010.md), it is represented as an
important Phenician or Tyrian colony. All the circumstances agree with
the supposition that "Tartessus" in Spain is the place "here" referred
to. The name 'Tartessus' (Ταρτησσὸς Tartēssos) is derived from the
Hebrew תרשׁישׁ tarshiysh by a change simply in the pronunciation (see
Bochart, "Geo. Sacra," iii. 7, and John D. Michaelis, "Spicileg. Geo.
Heb." i. 82-103).

For it is laid waste - Tyre is laid waste; that is, in vision it was
made to pass before the mind of the prophet as laid waste, or as it
"would" be (see the notes at [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md).

So that there is no house - It would be completely destroyed. This was
the case with old Tyre after the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, and it
remained so. See the analysis of the chapter.

No entering in - No harbor; no port; where the ships could remain, and
with which they could continue to trade. Tyre was once better situated
for commerce, and had greater natural advantages, than any port in the
Mediterranean. Those advantages have, however, to a great extent passed
away, and natural causes combine to confirm the truth of the divine
predictions that it should cease to be a place of commerce. The
merchandise of India, which was once conveyed overland through Babylon
and Palmyra, and which found its natural outlet at Tyre, is now carried
around the Cape of Good Hope, and will never again be restored to its
old channel. Besides, Tyre itself, which once had so fine a harbor, has
ceased to be a safe haven for large vessels. Robinson (George) says of
its harbor, in 1830, 'It is a small circular basin, now quite filled up
with sand and broken columns, leaving scarcely space enough for small
boats to enter.

The few fishing boats that belong to the place are sheltered by some
rocks to the westward of the island.' ("Travels in Syria and Palestine,"
vol. i. p. 269). Shaw, who visited Tyre in 1738, says of the harbor, 'I
visited several creeks and inlets, in order to discover what provision
there might have been formerly made for the security of their vessels.
Yet, notwithstanding that Tyre was the chief maritime power of this
country, I could not discover the least token of either "cothon" or
harbor that could have been of extraordinary capacity. The coasting
ships, indeed, still and a tolerably good shelter from the northern
winds, under the southern shore, but are obliged immediately to return
when the winds change to the west or south; so that there must have been
some better station than this for their security and reception. In the
N. N. E. part, likewise, of the city, we see the traces of a safe and
commodious basin, lying within the walls; but which, at the same time,
is very small, scarce forty yards in diameter.

Yet even this port, small as it is at present, is, notwithstanding, so
choked up with sand and rubbish, that the boats of those poor fishermen
who now and then visit this renowned emporium, can, with great
difficulty, only be admitted' ("Travels," pp. 330, 331. Ed. fol. Oxon.
1738). Dr. Robin son says of the port of Tyre, 'The inner port Dr basin
on the north was formerly enclosed by a wall, running from the north end
of the island in a curve toward the main land. Various pieces and
fragments of this wall yet remain, sufficient to mark its course; but
the port itself is continually filling up more and more with sand, and
now-a-days boats only can enter it. Indeed, our host informed us, that
even within his own recollection, the water covered the open place
before his own house, which at present is ten or twelve rods from the
sea, and is surrounded with buildings; while older people remember, that
vessels formerly anchored where the shore now is' ("Bib. Researches,"
vol. iii. p. 397).

From the land of Chittim - This means, probably, from the islands and
coasts of the Mediterranean. In regard to the meaning of the word
"Chittim," the following is the note of Gesenius on this verse: 'Among
the three different opinions of ancient and modern interpreters,
according to which they sought for the land of Chittim in Italy,
Macedonia, and Cyprus, I decidely prefer the latter, which is also the
opinion of Josephus ("Ant." i. 6, 1). According to this, Chittim is the
island Cyprus, so called from the Phoenician colony, Kition, (Citium),
in the southern part of the island, but still in such a sense, that this
name Chittim was, at a later period, employed also in a wider sense, to
designate other islands and countries adjacent to the coasts of the
Mediterranean, as, e. g., Macedonia ([Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030); 1 Macc. 1:1; 8:5.md). This is also
mentioned by Josephus. That Κίτιον Kition (Citium) was sometimes used
for the whole island of Cyprus, and also in a wider sense for other
islands, is expressly asserted by Epiphanius, who himself lived in
Cyprus, as a well-known fact ("Adv. Haeres." xxx. 25); where he says,
"it is manifest to all that the island of Cyprus is called Κίτιον Kition
(Citium), for the Cyprians and "Rhodians" (Ῥόδιοι Rodioi) are called
"Kitians" Κίτιοι Kitioi."

It could also be used of the Macedonians, because they were descended
from the Cyprians and Rhodians. That most of the cities of Cyprus were
Phenician colonies, is expressly affirmed by Diodorus (ii. 114; compare
Herod. vii. 90), and the proximity of the island to Phenicia, together
with its abundant supply of productions, especially such as were
essential in shipbuilding, would lead us to expect nothing else. One of
the few passages of the Bible which give a more definite hint in regard
to Chittim is [Eze 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#006.md), which agrees
very well with Cyprus: "Of the oaks of Bashan do they make them oars;
thy ships' benches do they make of ivory, encased with cedar from the
isles of Chittim." The sense of this passage is, that the fleets coming
from Tarshish (Tartessus) to Tyre, would, on their way, learn from the
inhabitants of Cyprus the news of the downfall of Tyre.'

It is revealed to them - If we understand "Chittim" to denote the
islands and coasts of the Mediterranean, it means that the navigators in
the ships of Tarshish would learn the intelligence of the destruction of
Tyre from those coasts or islands where they might stop on their way.
Tyre was of so much commercial importance that the news of its fall
would spread into all the islands of the Mediterranean.

[Isaiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 23:2</span></span>

Be still - This is the description of a city which is destroyed, where
the din of commerce, and the sound of revelry is no longer heard. It is
an address of the prophet to Tyre, indicating that it would be soon
still, and destroyed.

Ye inhabitants of the isle - (of Tyre). The word 'isle' (אי 'iy) is
sometimes used to denote a "coast or maritime region" (see the note at
[Isa 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006).md), but there seems no reason
to doubt that here it means the island on which New Tyre was erected.
This may have been occupied even before Old Tyre was destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar, though the main city was on the crest.

Thou whom the merchants of Zidon - Tyre was a colony from Sidon; and the
merchants of Sidon would trade to Tyre as well as to Sidon.

Have replenished - Hebrew, 'have filled,' that is, with merchandise, and
with wealth. Thus, in [Eze 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#008.md), Tyre
is represented as having derived its seamen from Sidon: 'Theinhabitants
of Sidon and of Arvad were thy mariners.' And in [Eze
27:9-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md), Tyre is represented as having
been filled with shipbuilders, merchants, mariners, soldiers, etc., from
Gebal, Persia, Lud, Phut, Tarshish, Jayvan, Tubal, Mesheck, Dedan,
Syria, Damascus, Arabia, etc.

[Isaiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 23:3</span></span>

And by great waters - That is, by the abundant-waters, or the
overflowing of the Nile. Tyre was the mart to which the superabundant
productions of Egypt were borne (see Ezek. 27)

The seed of Sihor - There can be no doubt that by 'Sihor' here is meant
the river Nile in Egypt (see [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md); [Ch1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md); [Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018).md). The word שׁחר shichor is
derived from שׁחר shachar, "to be black" [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md), and is given to the Nile from
its color when it brings down the slime or mud by which Egypt is
rendered so fertile. The Greeks gave to the river the name Μέλας Melas
("black"), and the Latins call it "Melo" - (Serv. ad Virg. "Geor." iv.
291. It was called "Siris" by the Ethiopians; perhaps the same as Sihor.
The upper branches of the Nile in Abyssinia all receive their names from
the "color" of the water, and are called the White River, the Blue
River, etc.

The harvest of the river - The productions caused by the overflowing of
the river. Egypt was celebrated for producing grain, and Rome and Greece
derived no small part of their supplies from that fertile country. It is
also evident that the inhabitants of Palestine were early accustomed to
go to Egypt in time of scarcity for supplies of grain (see [Gen
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md), [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028.md), and the history of Joseph, Gen.
41-43) That the "Tyrians" traded with Egypt is also well known.
Herodotus (ii. 112) mentions one entire quarter of the city of Memphis
that was inhabited by the Tyrians.

Is her revenue - Her resources are brought from thence.

She is a mart of nations - How true this was, see Ezek. 27. No place was
more favorably situated for commerce; and she had engrossed the trade
nearly of all the world.

[Isaiah 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 23:4</span></span>

Be thou ashamed, O Zidon - Tyre was a colony of Sidon. Sidon is here
addressed as the mother of Tyre, and is called on to lament over her
daughter that was destroyed. In [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md), Tyre is called the 'daughter of
Sidon;' and such appellations were commonly given to cities (see the
note at [Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). Sidon is here
represented as ashamed, or grieved - as a mother is who is bereft of all
her children.

The sea hath spoken - New Tyre was on a rock at some distance from the
land, and seemed to rise out of the sea, somewhat as Venice does It is
described here as a production of the sea, and the sea is represented as
speaking by her.

Even the strength of the sea - The fortress, or strong place (מעוז
mā‛ôz) of the sea. Tyre, on a rock, might be regarded as the strong
place, or the defense of the Mediterranean. Thus Zechariah [Zac
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#003.md) says of it. 'And Tyrus did build
herself a stronghold' (מצור mâtsôr).

Saying, I travail not - The expresssions which follow are to be regarded
as the language of Tyre - the founder of colonies and cities. The sense
is, 'My wealth and resources are gone. My commerce is annihilated. I
cease to plant cities and colonies, and to nourish and foster them, as I
once did, by my trade.' The idea of the whole verse is, that the city
which had been the mistress of the commercial world, and distinguished
for founding other cities and colonies, was about to lose her
importance, and to cease to extend her colonies and her influence over
other countries. Over this fact, Sidon, the mother and founder of Tyre
herself, would be humbled and grieved that her daughter, so proud, so
rich, and so magnificent, was brought so low.

[Isaiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 23:5</span></span>

As at the report concerning Egypt - According to our translation, this
verse would seem to mean that the Sidonians and other nations had been
pained or grieved at the report of the calamities that had come upon
Egypt, and that they would be similarly affected at the report
concerning Tyre. In accordance with this, some (as Jarchi) have
understood it of the plagues of Egypt, and suppose that the prophet
means to say, that as the nations were astonished at that, so they would
be at the report of the calamities that would come upon Tyre. Others
refer it to the calamities that. would come upon Egypt referred to in
Isa. 19, and suppose that the prophet means to say, that as the nations
would be amazed at the report of these calamities, so they would be at
the report of the overthrow of Tyre. So Vitringa. But the sense of the
Hebrew may be expressed thus: 'As the report, or tidings of the
destruction of Tyre shall reach Egypt, they shall be pained at the
tidings respecting Tyre.' So Lowth, Noyes, Rosenmuller, Grotius, Calvin.
They would be grieved, either

\(1\) because the destruction of Tyre would injure the commerce of
Egypt; or

\(2\) because the Egyptians might fear that the army of Nebuchadnezzar
would come upon them, and that they would share the fate of Tyre.

Sorely pained - The word used here (יחילוּ yâchı̂ylû) is commonly applied
to the severe pain of parturition.

[Isaiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 23:6</span></span>

Pass ye over - That is, ye inhabitants of tyre. This is an address to
Tyre, in view of her approaching destruction; and is designed to signify
that when the city was destroyed, its inhabitants would flee to its
colonies, and seek refuge and safety there. As Tarshish was one of its
principal colonies, and as the ships employed by Tyre would naturally
sail to Tarshish, the inhabitants are represented as fleeing there on
the attack of Nebucbadnezzar. That the inhabitants of Tyre did fire in
this manner, is expressly asserted by Jerome upon the authority of
Assyrian histories which are now lost. 'We have read,' says he, 'in the
histories of the Assyrians, that when the Tyrians were besieged, after
they saw no hope of escaping, they went on board their ships, and fled
to Cartilage, or to some islands of the Ionian and AEgean Sea' (Jerome
in loc.) And again (on Ezek. 29) he says, 'When the Tyrians saw that the
works for carrying on the siege were perfected, and the foundations of
the walls were shaken by the battering rams, whatever precious things in
gold, silver, clothes, and various kinds of furniture the nobility had,
they put them on board their ships, and carried to the islands. So that
the city being taken, Nebuchadnezzar found nothing worthy of his labor.'
Diodorus (xvii. 41) relates the same thing of the Tyrians during the
siege of Alexander the Great, where he says that they took their wives
and children to Carthage.

Howl - Deep grief among the Orientals was usually expressed by a loud,
long, and most dismal howl or shriek (see the note at [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md).

Ye inhabitants of the isle - Of Tyre. The word 'isle,' however, may be
taken as in [Isa 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006.md) (see the note on
that place), in, the sense of coast, or maritime country in general, and
possibly may be intended to denote Old Tyre, or the coast of Phenicia in
general, though most naturally it applies to the city built on the
island.

[Isaiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 23:7</span></span>

Is this your joyous city - Is this the city that was just now so full of
happiness, of revelry, of business, of gaiety, of rejoicing? (see the
note at [Isa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002).md)

Whose antiquity is of ancient days - Strabo (xvi. 756) says, 'After
Sidon, Tyre, a splendid and most ancient city, is to be compared in
greatness, beauty, and antiquity, with Sidon.' Curtius (Hist. Alex. iv.
4) says, 'The city was taken, distinguished both by its antiquity, and
its great variety of fortune.' Arrian (ii. 16) says, that 'the Temple of
Hercules at Tyre was the most ancient of those which the memory of
people have preserved.' And Herodotus (ii. 44) says, that in a
conversation which he had with the priest of that temple, he informed
him that it had then existed for 2300 years. Josephus, indeed, says
(Ant. viii. 3. 1) that Tyre was built but 240 years before the temple
was built by Solomon - but this was probably a mistake. Justin (xviii.
3) says that Tyre was founded in the year of the destruction of Troy.
Its very high antiquity cannot be doubted.

Her own feet shall carry her afar off - Grotius supposes that by feet
here, the 'feet of ships' are intended, that is, their sails and oars.
But the expression is designed evidently to stand in contrast with [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md), and to denote that a part of the
inhabitants would go by land into captivity. Probably many of them were
taken prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar; and perhaps many of them, when the
city was besieged, found opportunity to escape and flee by land to a
distant place of safety.

[Isaiah 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 23:8</span></span>

Who hath taken this counsel? - To whom is this to be traced? Is this the
work of man, or is it the plan of God? - questions which would naturally
arise at the contemplation of the ruin of a city so ancient and so
magnificent. The object of this question is to trace it all to God; and
this perhaps indicates the scope of the prophecy - to show that God
reigns, and does all his pleasure ever cities and kingdoms.

The crowning city - The distributer of crowns; or the city from which
dependent towns, provinces, and kingdoms had arisen. Many colonies and
cities had been founded by Tyre. Tartessus in Spain, Citium in Cyprus,
Carthage in Africa, and probably many other places were Phenician
colonies, and derived their origin from Tyre, and were still its
tributaries and dependants (compare [Eze
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#033).md).

Whose merchants are princes - Princes trade with thee; and thus
acknowledge their dependence on thee. Or, thy merchants are splendid,
gorgeous, and magnificent like princes. The former, however, is probably
the meaning.

Whose traffickers - (כנעניה kı̂ne‛âneyhâ, Canaanites). As the ancient
inhabitants of Canaan were "traffickers or merchants," the word came to
denote merchants in general (see [Job
41:6](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#006.md); [Eze
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004.md); [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md); [Zep
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001) l.md). So the word Chaldean came to
mean astrologers, because they were celebrated for astrology.

[Isaiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 23:9</span></span>

The Lord of hosts hath purposed it - (see the note at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md). It is not by human counsel that
it has been done. Whoever is the instrument, yet the overthrow of
wicked, proud, and vicious cities and nations is to be traced to the God
who rules in the empires and kingdoms of the earth (see the notes at
[Isa 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

To stain, the pride of all glory - Margin, 'Pollute.' The Hebrew word
(חלל chalēl) means properly to bore, or pierce through; to open, make
common [Lev 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#029.md); then to profane,
defile, pollute, as, e. g., the sanctuary [Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md); [Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md), the Sabbath [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md), the name of God [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md); [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md). Here it means that the
destruction of Tyre would show that God could easily level it all with
the dust. The destruction of Tyre would show this in reference to all
human glory, because:

\(1\) it was one of the most ancient cities;

\(2\) it was one of the most magnificent;

\(3\) it was one: of the most strong, secure, and inaccessible;

\(4\) it was the one of most commercial importante, most distinguished
in the view of nations; and

\(5\) its example would be the most striking and impressive.

God often selects the most distinguished and important cities and people
to make them examples to others, and to show the ease with which he can
bring all down to the earth.

To bring into contempt ... - To bring their plans and purposes into
contempt, and to show how unimportant and how foolish are their schemes
in the sight of a holy God.

[Isaiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 23:10</span></span>

Pass through thy land as a river - This verse has been very variously
understood. Vitringa supposes that it means that all that held the city
together - its fortifications, walls, etc., would be laid waste, and
that as a river flows on without obstruction, so the inhabitants would
be scattered far and near. Everything, says he, would be leveled, and
the field would not be distinguishable from the city. Grotius thus
renders it: 'Pass to some one of thy colonies; as a river flows from the
fountain to the sea, so do you go to the ocean.' Lowth understands it
also as relating to the time of the destruction of Tyre, and to the
escape which the inhabitants would then make.

'Overflow thy land like a river,

O daughter of Tarshish; the mound (that kept in thy waters)

Is no more.'

The Septuagint renders it, 'Cultivate (Ἐργάζον Ergazon) thy land, for
the ships shall no more come from Carthage' (Καρχηδόνος Karchēdonos)
Probably the true meaning is that which refers it to the time of the
siege, and to the fact that the inhabitants would seek other places when
their defense was destroyed. That is, 'Pass through thy territories, thy
dependent cities, states, colonies, and seek a refuge there; or wander
there like a flowing stream.'

As a river - Perhaps the allusion is to the Nile, as the word יאר ye'or
is usually given to the Nile; or it may be to any river that flows on
with a mighty current when all obstructions are removed. The idea is,
that as waters flow on when the barriers are removed, so the inhabitants
of Tyre would pour forth from their city. The idea is not so much that
of rapidity, as it is they should go like a stream that has no dikes,
barriers, or obstacles now to confine its flowing waters.

O daughter of Tarshish - Tyre; so called either because it was in some
degree sustained and supplied by the commerce of Tarshish; or because
its inhabitants would become the inhabitants of Tarshish, and it is so
called by anticipation. The Vulgate renders this, "Filia marias" -
'Daughter of the sea. Juntos supposes that the prophet addresses those
who were then in the city who were natives of Tarshish, and exhorts them
to flee for safety to their own city.

There is no more strength - Margin, 'Girdle.' The word מזח mēzach means
properly a girdle Job 12:31. It is applied to that which binds or
secures the body; and may be applied here perhaps to that which secured
or bound the city of Tyre; that is, its fortifications, its walls, its
defenses. They would all be leveled; and nothing would secure the
inhabitants, as they would flow forth as waters that are pent up do,
when every barrier is removed.

[Isaiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 23:11</span></span>

He stretched out his hand - That is, Yahweh (see [Isa
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009).md). To stretch out the hand is
indicative of punishment (see the notes at [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md); [Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012).md), and means that God has resolved
to inflict exemplary punishment on Tyre and its dependent colonies.

Over the sea - That is, over the sea coast of Phenicia; or over the
cities that were built on the coast. This alludes to the fact that
Nebuchadnezzar would lay siege to these cities, and would ravage the
maritime coast of Phenicia. It is not improbable also that, having taken
Tyre, he would extend his conquests to Citium, on the island of Cyprus,
and destroy as many of the dependent cities of Tyre as possible.

The Lord hath given a commandment - The control here asserted over
Nebuchadnezzar is similar to that which he asserted over the Assyrian
Sennacherib (see the note at [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

Against the merchant city - Hebrew, 'Against Canaan' (על־כנען
'el-kena‛an). The word 'Canaan' may here be used as in [Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md), to denote a place given to
merchandise or traffic, since this was the principal employment of the
inhabitants of this region; but it is rather to be taken in its obvious
and usual sense in the Scriptures, as denoting the land of Canaan, and
as denoting that Nebuchadnezzar would be sent against that, and
especially the maritime parts of it, to lay it waste.

To destroy the strongholds thereof - That is, the strongholds of Canaan;
as Tyre, Sidon, Accho, etc. Tyre, especially, was strongly fortified,
and was able long to resist the arms of the Chaldeans.

[Isaiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 23:12</span></span>

And he said - God said [Isa 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009.md).

Thou shalt no more rejoice - The sense is, that Tyre was soon to be
destroyed. It does not mean that it should never afterward exult or
rejoice, for the prophet says [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md), that after its destruction it
would be restored, and again be filled with exultation and joy.

O thou oppressed Virgin - Lowth renders this, 'O thou deflowered
virgin,' expressing the sense of the word המעשׁקה hame‛ushâqâh.

O daughter of Zidon - [Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md). "Pass
over to Chittim" (see the note at [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001).md). The idea is, that under the
siege the inhabitants of Tyre would seek refuge in her colonies, and the
cities that were dependent on her.

There also shalt thou have no rest - It is not improbable that
Nebuchadnezzar would carry his arms to Cyprus - on which the city of
Citium was - where the Tyrians would take refuge first. Megasthenes, who
lived about 300 years before Christ, says of Nebuchadnezzar that he
subdued a great part of Africa and Spain, and that he carried his arms
so far as the Pillars of Hercules (see Newton, On the Prophecies, xi.
11). But whether this refers to the oppressions which Nebuchadnezzar
would bring on them or not, it is certain that the colonies that sprung
from Phenicia were exposed to constant wars after this. Carthage was a
colony of Tyre, and it is well known that this city was engaged in
hostility with the Romans until it was utterly destroyed. Indeed all the
dependent colonies of ancient Tyre became interested and involved in the
agitations and commotions which were connected with the conquests of the
Roman empire.

[Isaiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 23:13</span></span>

Behold the land of the Chaldeans - This is a very important verse, as it
expresses the source from where these calamities were coming upon Tyre;
and as it states some historical facts of great interest respecting the
rise of Babylon. In the previous verses the prophet had foretold the
certain destruction of Tyre, and had said that whoever was the agent, it
was to be traced to the overruling providence of God. He here states
distinctly that the agent in accomplishing all this would be the
Chaldeans - a statement which fixes the time to the siege of
Nebuchadnezzar, and proves that it does not refer to the conquest by
Alexander the Great. A part of this verse should be read as a
parenthesis, and its general sense has been well expressed by Lowth, who
has followed Vitringa:

'Behold the land of the Chaldeans;

This people was of no account;

(The Assyrian founded it for the inhabitants of the desert;

They raised the watch towers, they set up the palaces thereof;)

This people hath reduced her to a ruin.'

Behold - Indicating that what he was about to say was something unusual,
remarkable, and not to be expected in the ordinary course of events.
That which was so remarkable was the fact that a people formerly so
little known, would rise to such power as to be able to overturn the
ancient and mighty city of Tyre.

The land of the Chaldeans - Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Chaldea or
Babylonia. The names Babylon and Chaldea are often interchanged as
denoting the same kingdom and people (see [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md), [Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md); [Jer
51:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024.md); [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013).md). The sense is, 'Lo! the power
of Chaldea shall be employed in your overthrow.'

This people - The people of Babylonia or Chaldea.

Was not - Was not known; had no government or power; was a rude,
nomadic, barbarous, feeble, and illiterate people. The same phrase
occurs in [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), where it also
means a people unknown, rude, barbarous, wandering. That this was
formerly the character of the Chaldeans is apparent from [Job
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017.md), where they are described as a
nomadic race, having no established place of abode, and living by
plunder.

Till the Assyrian - Babylon was probably founded by Nimrod (see the
notes at Isa. 13), but it was long before it rose to splendor. Belus or
Bel, the Assyrian, is said to have reigned at Babylon A.M. 2682, or 1322
b.c., in the time of Shamgar, judge of Israel. He was succeeded by Ninus
and Semiramis, who gave the principal celebrity and splendor to the city
and kingdom, and who may be said to have been its founders. They are
probably referred to here.

Founded it - Semiramis reclaimed it from the waste of waters; built
dikes to confine the Euphrates in the proper channel; and made it the
capital of the kingdom. This is the account given by Herodotus (Hist.
i.): 'She (Semiramis) built mounds worthy of admiration, where before
the river was accustomed to spread like a sea through the whole plain.'

For them that dwell in the wilderness - Hebrew, לציים letsiyiym - 'For
the tsiim.' This word (from צי tsiy or ציה tsiyah, a waste or desert)
denotes properly the inhabitants of the desert or waste places, and is
applied to people in [Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md); [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md); and to animals in [Isa
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021) (notes.md); [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md). Here it denotes, I suppose,
those who had been formerly inhabitants of the deserts around Babylon -
the wandering, rude, uncultivated, and predatory people, such as the
Chaldeans were [Job 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#017.md); and means
that the Assyrian who founded Babylon collected this rude and predatory
people, and made use of them in building the city. The same account
Arrian gives respecting Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander the
Great, who says, that 'Philip found them wandering and unsettled
(πλανήτας καὶ ἀπόρους planētas kai aporous), feeding small flocks of
sheep upon the mountains, that he gave them coats of mail instead of
their shepherd's dress, and led them from the mountain to the plain, and
gave them cities to dwell in, and established them with good and
wholesome laws.' (Hist. Alex vii.)

They set up the towers thereof - That is, the towers in Babylon, not in
Tyre (see the notes at Isa. 13) Herodotus expressly says that the
Assyrians built the towers and temples of Babylon (i. 84).

And he brought it to ruin - That is, the Babylonian or Chaldean brought
Tyre to ruin: to wit, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of a people formerly
unknown and rude, would be employed to destroy the ancient and
magnificent city of Tyre.

[Isaiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 23:14</span></span>

"Howl ... [Isa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md).

For your strength - That which has been your support and strength; to
wit, Tyre (compare [Eze 26:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 23:15</span></span>

Tyre shall be forgotten - Shall cease to be a place of importance in
commerce; shall be unheard of in those distant places to which ships
formerly sailed.

Seventy years, according to the days of one king - 'That is, of one
kingdom (see [Dan 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017.md); [Dan
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020)).' (Lowth.md) The word 'king' may
denote dynasty, or kingdom. The duration of the Babylonian monarchy was
properly but seventy years. Nebuchadnezzar began his conquest in the
first year of his reign, and from thence to the taking of Babylon by
Cyrus was seventy years. And at that time the nations that had been
conquered and subdued by the Babylonians would be restored to liberty.
Tyre was, indeed, taken toward the middle of that period, and its
subjugation referred to here was only for the remaining part of it. 'All
these nations,' says Jeremiah [Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md), 'shall serve the king of
Babylon seventy years.' Some of them were conquered sooner, and some
later; but the end of this period was the common time of deliverance to
them all. So Lowth, Newton, Vitringa, Aben Ezra, Rosenmuller, and
others, understand this. That 'the days at one king' may denote here
kingdom or dynasty, and be applied to the duration of the kingdom of
Babylon, is apparent from two considerations, namely,

\(1\) The word 'king' must be so understood in several places in the
Scriptures; [Dan 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017.md) : 'These great
beasts which are four, are four great kings which shall arise out of the
earth,' that is, dynasties, or succession of kings ([Dan
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020.md); so [Rev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012).md).

\(2\) The expression is especially applicable to the Babylonian
monarchy, because, during the entire seventy years which that kingdom
lasted, it was under the dominion of one family or dynasty.
Nebuchadnezzar founded the Babylonian empire, or raised it to so great
splendor, that he was regarded as its founder, and was succeeded in the
kingdom by his son Evil-Merodach, and his grandson Belshazzar, in whose
reign the kingdom terminated; compare [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md) : 'And all nations shall serve
him, and his son, and his son's son.' The period of seventy years is
several times mentioned, as a period during which the nations that were
subject to Babylon would be oppressed, and after that they should be set
at liberty (see [Jer 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md); compare [Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026).md).

Shall Tyre sing as an harlot - Margin, as the Hebrew, 'It shall be unto
Tyre as the song of an harlot.' That is, Tyre shall be restored to its
former state of prosperity and opulence; it shall be adorned with the
rich productions of other climes, and shall be happy and joyful again.
There are two ideas here; one that Tyre would be again prosperous, and
the other that she would sustain substantially the same character as
before. It was common to compare cities with females, whether virtuous
or otherwise (see the note at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). The same figure which is used
here occurs in Rev. 17:3-19 (compare [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md); [Nah
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md); [Rev
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md), [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 23:16</span></span>

Take an harp - This is a continuation of the figure commenced in the
previous verse, a direct command to Tyre as an harlot, to go about the
city with the usual expressions of rejoicing. Thus Donatus, in Terent.
Eunuch., iii. 2, 4, says:

'Fidicinam esse meretricum est;'

And thus Horace:

'Nec meretrix tibicina, cujus

Ad strepitum salias.'

1 Epis. xiv. 25.

Thou harlot that hast been forgotten - For seventy years thou hast lain
unknown, desolate, ruined.

Make sweet melody ... - Still the prophet keeps up the idea of the
harlot that had been forgotten, and that would now call her lovers again
to her dwelling. The sense is, that Tyre would rise to her former
splendor, and that the nations would be attracted by the proofs of
returning prosperity to renew their commercial contact with her.

[Isaiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 23:17</span></span>

The Lord will visit Tyre - He will restore her to her former wealth and
magnificence.

And she shall turn to her hire - The word 'hire' here denotes the wages
or reward that is given to an harlot; and the idea which was commenced
in the previous verses is here continued - of Tyre as an harlot -
frivolous, splendid, licentious, and holding intercourse with strangers
and foreigners. The gains of that commerce with other nations are here
represented as her hire.

And shall commit fornication ... - Shall again be the mart of commerce
[Isa 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md); shall have contact with all
the nations, and derive her support, splendor, luxury, from all. The
idea is, that she would be restored to her former commercial importance,
and perhaps, also, the prophet intends to intimate that she would
procure those gains by dishonest acts, and by fraudulent pretexts. After
the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar, it remained desolate until
the close of the Babyloian monarchy. Then a new city was built on the
island, that soon rivaled the former in magnificence. That new city was
besieged and taken by Alexander the Great, on his way to the conquests
of the East.

[Isaiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 23:18</span></span>

And her merchandise - The prophecy here does not mean that this would
take place immediately after her rebuilding, but that subsequent to the
seventy years of desolation this would occur.

Shall be holiness to the Lord - This undoubtedly means, that at some
future period, after the rebuilding of Tyre, the true religion would
prevail there, and her wealth would be devoted to his service. That the
true religion prevailed at Tyre subsequently to its restoration and
rebuilding there can be no doubt. The Christian religion was early
established at Tyre. It was visited by the Saviour [Mat
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md), and by Paul. Paul found several
disciples of Christ there when on his way to Jerusalem [Act
21:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md). It suffered much, says Lowth,
under the Diocletian persecution. Eusebius (Hist. x. 4.) says that 'when
the church of God was founded in Tyre, and in other places, much of its
wealth was consecrated to God, and was brought as an offering to the
church, and was presented for the support of the ministry agreeable to
the commandments of the Lord.' Jerome says, 'We have seen churches built
to the Lord in Tyre; we have beheld the wealth of all, which was not
treasured up nor hid, but which was given to those who dwelt before the
Lord.' It early became a Christian bishopric; and in the fourth century
of the Christian era, Jerome (Commentary in [Eze
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md); [Eze
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#002).md) speaks of Tyre as the most noble
and beautiful city of Phenicia, and as still trading with all the world.
Reland enumerates the following list of bishops as having been present
from Tyre at various councils; namely, Cassius, Paulinus, Zeno, Vitalis,
Uranius, Zeno, Photius, and Eusebius (see Reland's Palestine, pp.
1002-101l, in Ugolin vi.) Tyre continued Christian until it was taken by
the Saracens in 639 a.d.; but was recovered again by Christians in 1124.
In 1280, it was conquered by the Mamelukes, and was taken by the Turks
in 1516. It is now under the dominion of the Sultan as a part of Syria.

It shall not be treasured ... - It shall be regarded as consecrated to
the Lord, and freely expended in his service.

For them that dwell before the Lord - For the ministers of religion. The
language is taken from the custom of the Jews, when the priests dwelt at
Jerusalem. The meaning is, that the wealth of Tyre would be consecrated
to the service and support of religion.

For durable clothing - Wealth formerly consisted much in changes of
raiment; and the idea here is, that the wealth of Tyre would be devoted
to God, and that it would be furnished for the support of those who
ministered at the altar.
