### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 37:1</span></span>

It is evident that Zedekiah was well affected toward Jeremiah. In Jer.
37-38, dealing with events during the siege of Jerusalem, we have an
account of his relations with Jeremiah and of the prophet's personal
history up to the capture of the city.

[Jeremiah 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 37:3</span></span>

This embassy is not to be confounded with that [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001) which took place when
Nebuchadnezzar was just marching upon Jerusalem; this was in the brief
interval of hope occasioned by the approach of an Egyptian army to raise
the siege. The Jews were elated by this temporary relief, and miserably
abused it [Jer 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#011). Zedekiah seems
to some extent to have shared their hopes, and to have expected that the
prophet would intercede for the city as successfully as Isaiah had done
[Isa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006). Jehucal was a member of the
warlike party [Jer 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001), as also was
the deputy high priest Zephaniah, but otherwise he was well affected to
Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 37:5</span></span>

Then - And. Pharaoh-Hophra [Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030),
the Apries of Herodotus, probably withdrew without giving Nebuchadnezzar
battle. After a reign of 25 years, he was dethroned by Amasis, but
allowed to inhabit his palace at Sais, where finally he was strangled.

[Jeremiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 37:7</span></span>

Jeremiah's answer here is even more unfavorable than that which is given
in [Jer 21:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004). So hopeless is
resistance that the disabled men among the Chaldaeans would alone
suffice to capture the city and burn it to the ground.

[Jeremiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 37:11</span></span>

Was broken up for fear of - Or, "had got them up from the face of." It
was simply a strategic movement.

[Jeremiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 37:12</span></span>

To separate himself thence ... - To receive a share thence. When the
siege was temporarily raised, the first object would be food, and,
accordingly, Jeremiah accompanied by others, who, like himself, had a
right to share in the produce of the priests' lands at Anathoth, started
there to see whether any stores remained which might be available for
their common use.

[Jeremiah 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 37:13</span></span>

A captain of the ward - Captain of the watch, whose business was to
examine all who went in and out.

The gate of Benjamin - The northern gate, also called the gate of
Ephraim.

Thou fallest away ... - His well-known views made Jeremiah a suspected
person, though the charge was groundless.

[Jeremiah 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 37:14</span></span>

The princes - Not the noblemen trained in the days of Josiah and
Jeremiah's friends [Jer 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#016), but
those described in [Jer 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008). They
assumed that the accusation was true; they first scourged and then
imprisoned Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 37:15</span></span>

The house - Probably the official residence of the secretary of state.

[Jeremiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 37:16</span></span>

Dungeon - literally, house of a cistern or pit, and evidently
underground. In this cistern-like excavation were several cells or
arched vaults, in one of which with little light and less ventilation
Jeremiah remained a long time.

[Jeremiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 37:21</span></span>

The prison - the watch (marginal reference).

Piece - literally, a circle, i. e., a round cake.

The bakers' street - It is usual in oriental towns for each trade to
have a special place set apart for it. Compare [Act
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#006).
