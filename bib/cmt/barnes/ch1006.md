### [1 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 6:1</span></span>

The genealogy of the high priestly stem to the captivity.

[1 Chronicles 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 6:9</span></span>

Ahimaaz begat Azariah - It must, apparently, be this Azariah, and not
the son of Johanan [Ch1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010), who was
high priest at the dedication of Solomon's Temple. For Zadok, who lived
into the reign of Solomon [Kg1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004)
cannot have been succeeded by a great-great-grandson. The notice in [Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010), which is attached to the second
Azariah, must, beyond a doubt, belong properly to the first.

[1 Chronicles 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 6:11</span></span>

Ahitub - Between Amariah and Hilkiah [Ch1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013) this genealogy is most certainly
defective, as it gives three generations only for a period for which
nine generations are furnished by the list of the kings of Judah, and
which cannot be estimated as much short of 200 years. Further, no one of
the names in this part of the list occurs among the High priests of the
period, several of whom are mentioned both in the Second Book of
Chronicles and in Kings; the explanation of which seems to be that the
present is not a list of high priests, but the genealogy of Jozadak or
Jehozadak, whose line of descent partly coincided with the list of High
priests, partly differed from it. Where it coincided, all the names are
given; where it differed, some are omitted, in order (probably) to
render the entire list from Phinehas a multiple of seven. See the note
at [Ch1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020).

[1 Chronicles 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 6:15</span></span>

Jehozadak - The meaning of the name is "Jehovah is righteous." It has
been noted as remarkable that the heads of both the priestly and the
royal stock carried to Babylon should have had names (Zedekiah and
Jehozadak) composed of the same elements, and assertive of the "justice
of God," which their sufferings showed forth so signally.

[1 Chronicles 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 6:16</span></span>

A general account of the several branches of the tribe of Levi.

[1 Chronicles 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 6:20</span></span>

Of Gershom - The names in this list are curiously different from those
in [Ch1 6:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#041), which yet appear to
represent the same line reversed. Probably both lists are more or less
corrupted, and, as in many genealogies, omission is made, to reduce the
number of the names to seven. Compare e. g. [Ch1
6:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022) with [Ch1
6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033). Compare the other genealogy
ties of this chapter; and see also Matt. 1:1-17.

[1 Chronicles 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 6:28</span></span>

Vashni - The true name of Samuel's first-born, which was "Joel" (see the
margin and references), has here dropped out; and the word properly
meaning "and his second (son)" has been taken as the name of the first.

[1 Chronicles 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 6:31</span></span>

The genealogies of David's three chief singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan
or Jeduthun.

[Ch1 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032)

They waited on their office - On the establishment and continuance of
the choral service in the temple, see [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012), [Ch2
29:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#027); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015).

[Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033)

Heman - In general Asaph takes precedence of Heman and Jeduthun, but
here Heman is placed first, because his family, that of the Kohathites,
had the highest priestly rank, being the family which furnished the high
priests (see [Ch1 6:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002)).

Shemuel - i. e. "Samuel." Our translators have here given the Hebrew,
while elsewhere they give uniformlv the Greek, form of the name. We
learn by this genealogy that Heman was Samuel's grandson.

[Ch1 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039)

His brother Asaph - Not "brother" in the ordinary sense of the term,
since Asaph was the son of Berachiah, and a Gershonite, not a Kohathite.
"Brother" here may mean "fellow-craftsman" (compare [Ch1
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007)).

[Ch1 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044)

Ethan - Or Jeduthun (see the margin). Corruption will scarcely account
for the two forms of the name, since Ethan is used persistently up to a
certain point [Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019), after which
we have uniformly "Jeduthun." The case seems to be rather one in which a
new name was taken after a while, which thenceforth superseded the old.
Compare Abraham, Sarah, Joshua, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah, etc.

[1 Chronicles 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 6:50</span></span>

The sons of Aaron - This list, a mere repetition of that in [Ch1
6:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003), came, probably, from a
different source - a source belonging to the time of David, with whom
Ahimaaz (the last name on the list) was contemporary. The other list
[Ch1 6:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004) came, no doubt, from a
document belonging to the time of the captivity (see [Ch1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015)).

[1 Chronicles 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 6:54</span></span>

Their's was the lot - i. e. "the first lot." The Kohathites had the
first lot among the Levitical families, as being the family whereto the
high priesthood was attached (compare [Jos
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010)).

[1 Chronicles 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">ch1 6:56</span></span>

The writer evidently had before him Josh. 21, which he followed, as to
its matter, closely. In some cases he perhaps modernised the ancient
names ([Ch1 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#058), [Ch1
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060), [Ch1
6:72](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#072), etc.); in a few he substituted
for the old an entirely new name, the modern apellation, probably, of
the ancient site [Ch1 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070), [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077). At one time, it would seem, his
intention was to give the cities of the priests only, and to content
himself with stating the mere number of the rest. His account of the
matter was then brought to a conclusion, and summed up, in [Ch1
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#064). But, afterward, either he or a
later writer thought it best to add to the list of the priestly cities
the information contained in Judges as to those which were not priestly,
but merely Levitical. The passage 1 Chr. 6:65-81 was then added.

The entire account has suffered much from corruption. In the first list
two names, those of Juttah and Gideon, have dropped out. It is necessary
to restore them in order to complete the number of thirteen cities [Ch1
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060). In the second list [Ch1
6:67-70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#067) there is likewise an omission
of two cities, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, which are wanted to make up the
number ten [Ch1 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061). The third list
is complete, though some of the names are very different from these of
Joshua. In the fourth, two names are again wanting, those of Jokneam and
Kartah.

[Ch1 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061)

Unto the sons of Kohath which were left - i. e. to such of them as were
not priests.

Out of the half tribe ... ten cities - The half tribe furnished two
cities only ([Ch1 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070), and compare
[Jos 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025)). It is evident therefore
that something has fallen out. We may supply from Joshua the words "out
of Ephraim and out of Dan, and" before "out of the half tribe."

[Ch1 6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077)

Unto the rest of the children of Merari - Rather, "Unto the rest the
children of Merari" - that is to say, "unto the remainder of the
Levites, who were descendants of Merari": - the two other branches, the
Kohathites and the Gershomites, having been treated of previously.
