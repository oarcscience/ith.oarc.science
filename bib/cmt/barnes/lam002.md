### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 2:0</span></span>

This poem Lam. 2 also divides itself like Lam. 1 into two nearly equal
portions; in [Lam 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001), the prophet
describes the punishment which has fallen upon Zion; [Lam
2:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011) are a lamentation and a
prayer.

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

How ... - Or, "How" doth "אדני 'ădonāy cover." He hath east down etc. By
God's footstool seems to be meant the ark. See [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005) note.

[Lamentations 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 2:2</span></span>

Habitations - The dwellings of the shepherds in the pastures [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019). These are described as
swallowed up by an earthquake, while the storm itself throws down the
fortified cities of Judah.

Polluted - i. e. profaned it, made common or unclean what before was
holy.

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

Since the horn is the symbol of power, the cutting off of every horn
means the depriving Israel of all power of resistance. The drawing back
of God's right hand signifies the withdrawal of that special Providence
which used to protect the chosen people.

And he burned ... - Or, "and" he kindled a fire in Jacob: as the active
enemy of "Jacob," Himself applying the torch.

[Lamentations 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 2:4</span></span>

He stood with his right hand ... - i. e. that right hand so often
stretched out to help now grasped a weapon ready for Judah's
destruction.

Were pleasant - Or, was "pleasant." Put full stop after "eye." Begin the
third distich thus:

In the tabernacle - (or, tent) of the daughter of Zion.

[Lamentations 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 2:5</span></span>

Literally, אדני 'ădonāy has become "as an enemy."

[Lamentations 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 2:6</span></span>

tabernacle - Or, covert [Jer 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038), i.
e. such a tent of boughs as was put up at the Feast of Tabernacles. The
words mean, "the Lord hath (as) violently destroyed His booth. as a man
might tear down a shed in "a garden."" Compare [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).

His places of the assembly - Or, "His great festivals" ([Lam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015) note). It is the Word rendered
"solemn feasts" in the next clause, and rightly joined there with
"sabbaths," the weekly, as the other were the annual festivals. It is no
longer אדני 'ădonāy, but the Lord (Yahweh) who lets them pass into
oblivion. He had once instituted them for His own honor, now He lets
them lie forgotten.

Hath despised ... - Or, "hath rejected" king and priest. With the
destruction of the city the royal authority fell: with the ruined temple
and the cessation of the festivals the functions of the priest ceased.

[Lamentations 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 2:7</span></span>

sanctuary - The holy of holies; "the walls of her palaces" are those of
the sacred buildings.

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

A line - Compare [Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011). The
destruction is systematic and thorough.

[Lamentations 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 2:9</span></span>

Her gates are sunk into the ground - So completely destroyed, that one
might suppose they had been swallowed up in an abyss.

Her king - The prophet's lamentation, occupied before chiefly with the
buildings of the city and temple, now turns to the people, beginning
with their temporal rulers.

The law is no more - The Jewish Law, the Torah, came to an end when it
no longer had a local habitation. Its enactments were essentially those
not of a universal religion, but of a national religion, and the
restoration of the nation with a material temple was indispensable to
its continued existence. It was only when elevated to be a universal
religion, by being made spiritual, that it could do without ark, temple,
and a separate people.

Her prophets also find ... - With the Torah, the special gift of
prophecy also ceased, since both were unique to the theocracy; but it
was not until the establishment of Christianity that they were finally
merged in higher developments of grace.

[Lamentations 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 2:11</span></span>

Troubled - See the margin reference note.

Liver - As the heart was regarded by the Jews as the seat of the
intellect, so the liver (or bowels) was supposed to be the seat of the
emotions. The pouring out of the liver upon the ground meant that
feelings had entirely given way under the acuteness of sorrow, and he
could no longer restrain them.

[Lamentations 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 2:12</span></span>

They say - Or, "They keep saying:" it was an oft-repeated cry, even
while expiring upon their mother's bosom.

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

Equal - i. e. "compare." Zion's breach, i. e. her destruction, is
measureless, like the ocean.

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee - The Septuagint
and Vulgate give the true meaning, "stupidity" (see [Jer
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013) note).

To turn away thy captivity - The right sense is, "They have not
disclosed to thee thy sins, that so thou mightest repent, and I might
have turned away thy captivity."

Burdens - Applied contemptuously to predictions which proved "false" or
"empty," i. e. failed of accomplishment. On the deduction to be drawn
from this, see [Jer 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009).

Causes of banishment - The result of the teaching of the false prophets
would be that God would "drive out" the Jews from their land.

Some render the words "false ... banishment" by "oracles of falsehood
and seduction."

[Lamentations 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 2:15</span></span>

Compare the scene round the cross of the Redeemer [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039).

[Lamentations 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 2:16</span></span>

Seen it - Omit "it." The intensity of the enemy's exultation is shown by
the heaping up of unconnected words. We have found what we sought, have
seen what we looked for.

[Lamentations 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 2:17</span></span>

That which he had devised - Or, what he purposed. Zion's ruin was the
fulfillment of God's determination, of which they had been forwarned
from the days of old (see the margin reference).

Fulfilled - Or, finished.

[Lamentations 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 2:18</span></span>

Their heart - That of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The prophet bids the
wall, as the representative of the people who had dwelt secure under its
protection, shed floods of tears on their behalf. Broken up by the
enemy, it could be their guardian no longer, but by its ruins it might
still cry unto the Lord in their behalf.

A river - Or, a brook or torrent.

Rest - Properly, the torpor and numbness which follows upon excessive
grief.

Apple of thine eye - See [Psa 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)
note.

[Lamentations 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 2:19</span></span>

In - (or at) the beginning of the watches "At the beginning of each
night-watch" means all the night through. The Hebrews divided the night
into three watches.

[Lamentations 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 2:20</span></span>

The sense is: "See, Yahweh, and look! whom hast Thou treated thus? Shall
women eat their fruit - children whom they must still carry?" the
swaddled child being one still needing to be nursed and borne in their
arms.

[Lamentations 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 2:21</span></span>

Omit "them" and "and," which weaken the intensity of the passage.

[Lamentations 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 2:22</span></span>

Thou hast called as in a solemn day - i. e. "Thou" callest "like a feast
day," i. e. like the proclaiming of a festival.

My terrors round about - The prophet's watch-word ([Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025) note). God now proclaims what
Jeremiah had so often called out before, "Magor-missabib." On every side
were conquering Chaldaeans.
