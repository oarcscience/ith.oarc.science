### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md)

They brought it into the house of Dagon (see the marginal reference) in
order to enhance the triumph of the gods of the Philistines over the God
of Israel. (Compare [Sa1 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009.md); [Jdg
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023.md); [Isa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 5:5</span></span>

This custom still existed among the worshippers of Dagon so late as the
reign of Josiah (see the marginal reference).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 5:6</span></span>

Emerods - A corruption of "hemorrhoids." It is mentioned [Deu
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md) among the diseases with which
God threatened to punish the Israelites for disobedience.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 5:8</span></span>

The "lords" (see [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003).md) were very
unwilling to give up their triumph, and, with the common pagan
superstition, imagined that some local bad luck was against them at
Ashdod. The result was to bring the whole Philistine community under the
same calamity.
