### [Deuteronomy Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 8:3</span></span>

But by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord -
literally, "every outgoing of the mouth of the Lord." Compare [Deu
29:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md). The term "word" is inserted by
the King James Version after the Septuagint, which is followed by
Matthew and Luke (see the marginal references). On the means of
subsistence available to the people during the wandering, see [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md) note. The lesson was taught, that
it is not nature which nourishes man, but God the Creator by and through
nature: and generally that God is not tied to the particular channels
("bread only," i. e. the ordinary means of earthly sustenance) through
which He is usually pleased to work.

[Deuteronomy 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 8:4</span></span>

They had clothes, it would seem, in abundance (compare [Exo
12:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#034).md) at the beginning of the 40
years; and during those years they had many sheep and oxen, and so must
have had much material for clothing always at command. No doubt also
they carried on a traffic in these, as in other commodities, with the
Moabites and the nomadic tribes of the desert. Such ordinary supplies
must not be shut out of consideration, even if they were on occasions
supplemented by extraordinary providences of God, as was undoubtedly the
case with their food.

[Deuteronomy 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 8:7</span></span>

See [Exo 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md) note, and the contrast
expressed in [Deu 11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md), between
Palestine and Egypt.

The physical characteristics and advantages of a country like Palestine
must have been quite strange to Israel at the time Moses was speaking:
compare [Deu 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md) note. To have
praised the fertility and excellence of the promised land at an earlier
period would have increased the murmurings and impatience of the people
at being detained in the wilderness: whereas now it encouraged them to
encounter with more cheerfulness the opposition that they would meet
from the inhabitants of Canaan.

[Deu 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#008.md)

Vines - The abundance of wine in Syria and Palestine is dwelt upon in
the Egyptian records of the campaigns of Thotmosis III. Only a little
wine is produced in Egypt itself. The production of wine has in later
times gradually ceased in Palestine (circa 1880's).

[Deu 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009.md)

For brass read copper ([Gen 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#022.md)
note); and compare the description of mining operations in [Job
28:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md). Mining does not seem to have
been extensively carried on by the Jews, though it certainly was by the
Canaanite peoples displaced by them. Traces of iron and copper works
have been discovered by modern travelers in Lebanon and many parts of
the country; e. g., the district of Argob (see [Deu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004) notes.md) contains iron-stone in
abundance.

[Deuteronomy 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 8:15</span></span>

Render: "Who brought thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
the fiery serpent and the scorpion, and the dry land where are no
waters." On the fiery serpents see [Num
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006.md) note.

[Deuteronomy 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 8:16</span></span>

To do thee good at thy latter end - This is presented as the result of
God's dealings.
