### [Genesis Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

\- The Faith of Abram

1\. דבר dābār, "a word, a thing;" the word being the sign of the thing.

2\. אדני 'ǎdonāy, "Adonai, the Lord;" related: "bring down, lay down."
This is the name usually read in place of Yahweh; but when, as in the
present case, יהוה yehovâh and אדני 'ǎdonāy are in apposition, אלהים
'ĕlohı̂ym is read instead of the former. The Jews from a feeling of
reverence avoided the utterance of this sacred name except on the most
solemn occasions. This is said to have arisen from a stringent
interpretation of [Lev 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md).
According to some, this name was pronounced only once a year by the high
priest, on the day of atonement, in the Holy of Holies, and according to
others only in the solemn benedictions pronounced by the priests. At an
earlier period, however, the name must have been freely used by the
people, since it enters into the composition of proper names. Adon אדן
'ǎdôn in the singular and plural is used as a common name. משׁק mesheq,
"possession," בן־משׁק ben-mesheq, "possessor." This forms a paronomasia
with דמשׂק dameśeq, which is for דמשׂקי damaśqı̂y. אליעזר ‛elı̂y'ezer,
"Eliezer, God of help, or mighty to help."

19\. קיני qēynı̂y, Kenite, patronymic of קין qayı̂n, Kain. קנזי qenı̂zı̂y,
Kenizzite, patronymic of קנז qenaz, Kenaz, "hunter." קדמני qademonı̂y,
Kadmonite, "eastern, old."

The events recorded in the preceding chapter manifest the sway of the
new nature in Abram, and meet the approval of the Lord. This approval is
exhibited in a heavenly visit to the patriarch, in which the Lord
solemnly reiterates the promise of the seed and the land. Abram believes
in the Lord, who thereupon enters into covenant with him.

[Gen 15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

After these things, - - the victory, the blessing, and the self-denial
recorded in the previous chapter. "The word of the Lord," manifesting
himself by speech to his servant. "In the vision" the intelligent
observer passes from the merely sensible to the supersensible sphere of
reality. "Fear not, Abram." The patriarch had some reason to fear. The
formidable allies had indeed been defeated, and the fruits of their
marauding enterprise wrested from them. But they might resume their
purpose, and return with an overwhelming force. And Abram was still a
stranger in a foreign land, preoccupied by tribes of another race, who
would combine against him as soon as they suspected him of being an
intruder. But the Lord had stood by him and given him the victory, and
now speaks to him in the language of encouragement. "I am thy shield,
thy exceeding great reward." The word I is separately expressed, and,
therefore, emphatic in the original.

I, Jehovah (Yahweh), the Self-existent One, the Author of existence, the
Performer of promise, the Manifester of myself to man, and not any
creature however exalted. This was something beyond a seed, or a land,
or any temporal thing. The Creator infinitely transcends the creature.
The mind of Abram is here lifted up to the spiritual and the eternal.
(1) thy shield. (2) thy exceeding great reward. Abram has two fears -
the presence of evil, and the absence of good. Experience and conscience
had begun to teach him that both of these were justly his doom. But
Yahweh has chosen him, and here engages himself to stand between him and
all harm, and himself to be to him all good. With such a shield from all
evil, and such a source of all good, he need not be afraid. The Lord, we
see, begins, as usual, with the immediate and the tangible; but he
propounds a principle that reaches to the eternal and the spiritual. We
have here the opening germ of the great doctrine of "the Lord our
righteousness," redeeming us on the one hand from the sentence of death,
and on the other to a title to eternal life.

[Gen 15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md)

Notwithstanding the unbounded grandeur and preciousness of the promise,
or rather assurance, now given, Abram is still childless and landless;
and the Lord has made as yet no sign of action in regard to these
objects of special promise. "Lord Jehovah (Yahweh)." The name אדני
'ǎdonāy is here for the first time used in the divine records. It
denotes one who has authority; and, therefore, when applied to God, the
Supreme Lord. Abram hereby acknowledges Yahweh as Supreme Judge and
Governor, and therefore entitled to dispose of all matters concerning
his present or prospective welfare. "What wilt thou give me?" Of what
use will land or wealth be to me, the immediate reward specified by the
promise? Eliezer of Damascus is master of my house. "To me thou hast
given no seed." This was the present shield mentioned also in former
words of promise. There is something strikingly human in all this. Abram
is no enthusiast or fanatic. He fastens on the substantive blessings
which the Lord had expressly named.

[Gen 15:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#004.md)

The Lord reiterates the promise concerning the seed. As he had commanded
him to view the land, and see in its dust the emblem of the multitude
that would spring from him, so now, with a sublime simplicity of
practical illustration, he brings him forth to contemplate the stars,
and challenges him to tell their number, if he can; adding, "So shall
thy seed be." He that made all these out of nothing, by the word of his
power, is able to fulfill his promise, and multiply the seed of Abram
and Sarai. Here, we perceive, the vision does not interfere with the
notice of the sensible world, so far as is necessary [Dan
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#007.md); [Joh
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029.md).

[Gen 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)

And Abram believed in the Lord. - Thus, at length, after many throes of
labor, has come to the birth in the breast of Abram "faith in Yahweh,"
on his simple promise in the absence of all present performance, and in
the face of all sensible hinderance. The command to go to the land which
the Lord would show him, accompanied with the promise to make of him a
great nation, had awakened in him a certain expectation; which, however,
waited for some performance to ripen it into faith. But waiting in a
state of suspense is not faith, but doubt; and faith after performance
is not faith, but sight. The second and third renewal of the promise,
while performance was still unseen in the distance, was calculated to
slay the expectancy that still paused for realization, to give it the
vitality of a settled consent and acquiescence in the faithfulness of
God, and mature it into conviction and confession.

What was there now, then, to call forth Abram's faith more than at the
first promise? There was the reiteration of the promise. There was the
withholding of the performance, leaving room for the exercise of pure
faith. There was time to train the mind to this unaccustomed idea and
determination. And, lastly, there was the sublime assurance conveyed in
the sentence, "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward,"
transcending all the limits of time and place, comprehending alike the
present and the eternal, the earthly and the heavenly. This, coupled
with all the recorded and unrecorded dealings of the Lord, leads him to
conceive the nobler feeling of faith in the Promiser, antecedent to any
part of the execution, any unfolding of the plan, or any removal of the
obvious difficulty. The moment of deliverance draws nigh, when Abram at
length ventures to open his mouth and lay bare, in articulate utterance,
the utmost questionings of his soul before the Lord. And then, in due
time is effected the birth of faith; not by commencing the
accomplishment of the promise, but by the explicit reassertion of its
several parts, in the light of that grand assurance which covers it in
its narrowest and in its most expanded forms. Thus, faith springs solely
from the seed of promise. And from that moment there stands up and grows
within the breast of man the right frame of mind toward the God of mercy
- the germ of a mutual good understanding between God and man which will
spread its roots and branches through the whole soul, to the exclusion
of every noxious plant, and blossom forth unto the blessed fruit of all
holy feelings and doings.

And he counted it to him for righteousness. - First. From this
confessedly weighty sentence we learn, implicitly, that Abram had no
righteousness. And if he had not, no man had. We have seen enough of
Abram to know this on other grounds. And here the universal fact of
man's depravity comes out into incidental notice, as a thing usually
taken for granted, in the words of God. Second. Righteousness is here
imputed to Abram. Hence, mercy and grace are extended to him; mercy
taking effect in the pardon of his sin, and grace in bestowing the
rewards of righteousness. Third. That in him which is counted for
righteousness is faith in Yahweh promising mercy. In the absence of
righteousness, this is the only thing in the sinner that can be counted
for righteousness. First, it is not of the nature of righteousness. If
it were actual righteousness, it could not be counted as such. But
believing God, who promises blessing to the undeserving, is essentially
different from obeying God, who guarantees blessing to the deserving.
Hence, it has a negative fitness to be counted for what it is not.
Secondly, it is trust in him who engages to bless in a holy and lawful
way. Hence, it is that in the sinner which brings him into conformity
with the law through another who undertakes to satisfy its demands and
secure its rewards for him. Thus, it is the only thing in the sinner
which, while it is not righteousness, has yet a claim to be counted for
such, because it brings him into union with one who is just and having
salvation.

It is not material what the Almighty and All-gracious promises in the
first instance to him that believes in him, whether it be a land, or a
seed, or any other blessing. All other blessing, temporal or eternal,
will flow out of that express one, in a perpetual course of development,
as the believer advances in experience, in compass of intellect, and
capacity of enjoyment. Hence, it is that a land involves a better land,
a seed a nobler seed, a temporal an eternal good. The patriarchs were
children to us in the comprehension of the love of God: we are children
to those who will hereafter experience still grander manifestations of
what God has prepared for them that love him. The shield and exceeding
great reward await a yet inconceivable enlargement of meaning.

[Gen 15:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md)

The Lord next confirms and explains the promise of "the land" to Abram.
When God announces himself as Yahweh, who purposed to give him the land,
Abram asks, Whereby "shall I know that I shall possess it?" He appears
to expect some intimation as to the time and mode of entering upon
possession. The Lord now directs him to make ready the things requisite
for entering into a formal covenant regarding the land. These include
all the kinds of animals afterward used in sacrifice. The number three
is sacred, and denotes the perfection of the victim in point of
maturity. The division of the animals refers to the covenant between two
parties, who participate in the rights which it guarantees. The birds
are two without being divided. "Abram drove them away." As the animals
slain and divided represent the only mean and way through which the two
parties can meet in a covenant of peace, they must be preserved pure and
unmutilated for the end they have to serve.

[Gen 15:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md)

And the sun was about to set. - This visit of the Lord to Abram
continues for two nights, with the intervening day. In the former night
he led him forth to view the stars [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md). The second night sets in with
the consummation of the covenant [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md). The revelation comes to Abram
in a trance of deep sleep. The Lord releases the mind from attention to
the communications of sense in order to engage it with higher things.
And he who makes the loftier revelation can enable the recipient to
distinguish the voice of heaven from the play of fancy.

[Gen 15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md)

Know, know thou. - Know certainly. This responds to Abram's question,
Whereby shall I know? [Gen 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md). Four
hundred years are to elapse before the seed of Abram shall actually
proceed to take possession of the land. This interval can only commence
when the seed is born; that is, at the birth of Isaac, when Abram was a
hundred years of age and therefore thirty years after the call. During
this interval they are to be, "first, strangers in a land not theirs"
for one hundred and ninety years; and then for the remaining two hundred
and ten years in Egypt: at first, servants, with considerable privilege
and position; and at last, afflicted serfs, under a hard and cruel
bondage. At the end of this period Pharaoh and his nation were visited
with a succession of tremendous judgments, and Israel went out free from
bondage "with great wealth" Exo. 12-14. "Go to thy fathers." This
implies that the fathers, though dead, still exist. To go from one place
to another implies, not annihilation, but the continuance of existence.
The doctrine of the soul's perpetual existence is here intimated. Abram
died in peace and happiness, one hundred and fifteen years before the
descent into Egypt.

[Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)

In the fourth age. - An age here means the average period from the birth
to the death of one man. This use of the word is proved by [Num
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#013.md) - "He made them wander in the
wilderness for forty years, until all the generation that had done evil
in the sight of the Lord was consumed." This age or generation ran
parallel with the life of Moses, and therefore consisted of one hundred
and twenty years. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. Four such
generations amount to four hundred and eighty or four hundred and forty
years. From the birth of Isaac to the return to the land of promise was
an interval of four hundred and forty years. Isaac, Levi, Amram, and
Eleazar may represent the four ages.

For the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full. - From this simple
sentence we have much to learn. First. The Lord foreknows the moral
character of people. Second. In his providence he administers the
affairs of nations on the principle of moral rectitude. Third. Nations
are spared until their iniquity is full. Fourth. They are then cut off
in retributive justice. Fifth. The Amorite was to be the chief nation
extirpated for its iniquity on the return of the seed of Abram.
Accordingly, we find the Amorites occupying by conquest the country east
of the Jordan, from the Arnon to Mount Hermon, under their two kings,
Sihon and Og [Num 21:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md). On the
west of Jordan we have already met them at En-gedi and Hebron, and they
dwelt in the mountains of Judah and Ephraim [Num
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029.md), whence they seem to have
crossed the Jordan for conquest [Num
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026.md). Thus had they of all the tribes
that overspread the land by far the largest extent of territory. And
they seem to have been extinguished as a nation by the invasion of
Israel, as we hear no more of them in the subsequent history of the
country.

[Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md)

And the sun went down. - The light of day is gone. The covenant is now
formally concluded. Abram had risen to the height of faith in the God of
promise. He is come into the position of the father of the faithful. He
is therefore qualified for entering into this solemn compact. This
covenant has a uniqueness which distinguishes it from that with Noah. It
refers to a patriarch and his seed chosen out of a coexisting race. It
is not, however, subversive of the ancient and general covenant, but
only a special measure for overcoming the legal and moral difficulties
in the way, and ultimately bringing its comprehensive provisions into
effect. It refers to the land of promise, which is not only a reality,
but a type and an earnest of all analogous blessings.

The oven of smoke and lamp of flame symbolize the smoke of destruction
and the light of salvation. Their passing through the pieces of the
victims and probably consuming them as an accepted sacrifice are the
ratification of the covenant on the part of God, as the dividing and
presenting of them were on the part of Abram. The propitiatory
foundation of the covenant here comes into view, and connects Abram with
Habel and Noah, the primeval confessors of the necessity of an
atonement.

[Gen 15:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md)

In that instant the covenant was solemnly completed. Its primary form of
benefit is the grant of the promised land with the extensive boundaries
of the river of Egypt and the Euphrates. The former seems to be the Nile
with its banks which constitute Egypt, as the Phrat with its banks
describes the land of the East, with which countries the promised land
was conterminous.

[Gen 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md)

The ten principal nations inhabiting this area are here enumerated. Of
these five are Kenaanite, and the other five probably not. The first
three are new to us, and seem to occupy the extremities of the region
here defined. The Kenite dwelt in the country bordering on Egypt and
south of Palestine, in which the Amalekites also are found [Num
24:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020.md); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md). They dwelt among the Midianites,
as Hobab was both a Midianite and a Kenite [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md); [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md). They were friendly to the
Israelites, and hence some of them followed their fortunes and settled
in their land [Ch1 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055.md). The Kenizzite
dwelt apparently in the same region, having affinity with the Horites,
and subsequently with Edom and Israel [Gen
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011.md), [Gen
36:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md); [Jos
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#017.md); [Ch1
2:50-52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050.md). The Kadmonite seems to be the
Eastern, and, therefore, to hold the other extreme boundary of the
promised land, toward Tadmor and the Phrat. These three tribes were
probably related to Abram, and, therefore, descendants of Shem. The
other seven tribes have already come under our notice.
