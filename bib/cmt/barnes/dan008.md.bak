Analysis of the Chapter

This chapter contains an account of a vision seen by the prophet in the
third year of the reign of Belshazzar. The prophet either was, or
appeared to be, in the city of - afterward the capital of the Persian
empire, in the province of Elam. To that place - then an important town
- there is no improbability in supposing that he had gone, as he was
then unconnected with the government, or not employed by the government
Dan. 5, and as it is not unreasonable to suppose that he would be at
liberty to visit other parts of the empire than Babylon. Possibly there
may have been Jews at that place, and he may have gone on a visit to
them. Or perhaps the scene of the vision may have been laid in Shushan,
by the river Ulai, and that the prophet means to represent himself as if
he had been there, and the vision had seemed to pass there before his
mind. But there is no valid objection to the supposition that he was
actually there; and this seems to be affirmed in [Dan
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md).

While there, he saw a ram with two horns, one higher than the other,
pushing westward, and northward, and southward, so powerful that nothing
could oppose him. As he was looking on this, he saw a he-goat come from
the west, bounding along, and scarcely touching the ground, with a
single remarkable horn between his eyes. This he-goat attacked the ram,
broke his two horns, and overcame him entirely. The he-goat became very
strong, but at length the horn was broken, and there came up four in its
place. From one of these there sprang up a little horn that became
exceeding great and mighty, extending itself toward the south, and the
east, and the pleasant land - the land of Palestine. This horn became so
mighty that it seemed to attack "the host of heaven" - the stars; it
cast some of them down to the ground; it magnified itself against the
Prince of the host; it caused the daily sacrifice in the temple to
cease, and the sanctuary of the Prince of the host was cast down.

An earnest inquiry was made by one saint to another how long this was to
continue, and the answer was, unto two thousand and three hundred days,
and that then the sanctuary would be cleansed. Gabriel is then sent to
explain the vision to the prophet, and he announces that the ram with
the two horns represented the kings of Media and Persia; the goat, the
king of Greece; the great horn between his eyes, the first king; the
four horns that sprang up after that was broken, the four dynasties into
which the kingdom would be divided; and the little horn, a king of
fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, and that would
stand up against the Prince of princes, and that would ultimately be
destroyed. The effect of this was, that Daniel was overcome by the
vision for a certain time; afterward he revived, and attended to the
business of the king, but none understood the vision.

This is one of the few prophecies in the Scriptures that are explained
to the prophets themselves, and it becomes, therefore, important as a
key to explain other prophecies of a similar character. Of the reference
to the kingdom of Media and Persia, and to the kingdom of Greece, there
is an express statement. The application of a portion of the prophecy to
Alexander the Great, and to the four monarchies into which his kingdom
was divided at his death, is equally certain. And there can be as little
doubt of the application of the remainder to Antiochus Epiptianes, and
in this, nearly all expositors are agreed. Indeed, so striking and clear
is the application to this series of historical events, that Porphyry
maintained that this, as well as other portions of Daniel, were written
after the events occurred. One of two things, indeed, is certain -
either that this was written after the events here referred to occurred,
or that Daniel was inspired. No man by any natural sagacity could have
predicted these events with so much accuracy and particularity.

The portion of Daniel which follows is in pure Hebrew. The portion of
the book from the fourth verse of the second chapter to the end of the
seventh chapter was written in Chaldee. On this point, see Intro.
Section IV. III. (1).

[Daniel 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 8:1</span></span>

In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar - In regard to
Belshazzar, see Intro. to Dan. 5 Section II.

A vision appeared unto me - This vision appears to have occurred to him
when awake, or in an ecstasy; the former one occurred when he was
asleep, [Dan 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md). Compare [Dan
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md), where the prophet represents
himself as overpowered, and as falling down to the earth on account of
the vision. The representation would seem to have been made to pass
before his mind in open day, and when he was fully awake. Compare the
case of Balaam, [Num 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md) : "Which saw
the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes
open."

After what appeared unto me at the first - That occurred in the first
year of Belshazzar, [Dan 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md).

[Daniel 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 8:2</span></span>

And I saw in a vision - I looked as the vision appeared to me; or I saw
certain things represented to me in a vision. On the word vision, see
the notes at [Dan 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017.md). The meaning
here would seem to be that a vision appeared to Daniel, and that he
contemplated it with earnestness, to understand what it meant.

That I was at Shushan - As remarked in the introduction to this chapter,
this might mean that he seemed to be there, or that the vision was
represented to him as being there; but the most natural construction is
to suppose that Daniel was actually there himself. Why he was there he
has not informed us directly - whether he was on public business, or on
his own. From [Dan 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027.md), however -
"Afterward I rose up, and did the king's business" - it would seem most
probable that he was then in the service of the king. This supposition
will not conflict with the statement in [Dan
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#010.md), in which the queen-mother,
when the handwriting appeared on the wall of the palace informs
Belshazzar that there was "a man in his kingdom in whom was the spirit
of the holy gods, etc." - from which it might be objected that Daniel
was at that time unknown to the king, and could not have been in his
employ, for it might have been a fact that he was in the employ of the
king as an officer of the government, and yet it may have been forgotten
that he had this power of disclosing the meaning of visions.

He may have been employed in the public service, but his services to the
father of the king, and his extraordinary skill in interpreting dreams
and visions may not at once have occurred to the affrighted monarch and
his courtiers. Shushan, or Susa, the chief town of Susiana, was the
capital of Persia after the time of Cyrus, in which the kings of Persia
had their principal residence, [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Est
1:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002.md). It was situated on the Eulaeus
or Choaspes, probably on the spot now occupied by the village Shus. -
Rennel, Geog. of Herodotus; Kinneir, Mem. Pers. Emp.; K. Porter's
Travels, ii. 4, 11; Ritter, Erdkunde, Asien, 9: 294; Pict. Bib. in loc.
At Shus there are extensive ruins, stretching perhaps twelve miles from
one extremity to the other, and consisting, like the other ruins in that
country, of hillocks of earth, and rubbish, covered with broken, pieces
of brick and colored tile. At the foot of these mounds is the so-called
tomb of Daniel, a small building erected on the spot where the remains
of Daniel are believed in that region to rest.

It is apparently modern, but nothing but the belief that this was the
site of the prophet's sepulchre could have led to its being built in the
place where it stands - Malcolm, Hist. of Persia, i. 255, 256. The city
of Shus is now a gloomy wilderness, inhabited by lions, hyenas, and
other beasts of prey. - Kitto's Cyclo., art. "Shushan." Sir John Kinneir
says that the dread of these animals compelled Mr. Monteith and himself
to take shelter for the night within the walls that encompass Daniel's
tomb. Of that tomb Sir John Malcolm says, "It is a small building, but
sufficient to shelter some dervishes who watch the remains of the
prophet, and are supported by the alms of pious pilgrims, who visit the
holy sepulchre. The dervishes are now the only inhabitants of Susa; and
every species of wild beast roams at large over the spot on which some
of the proudest palaces ever raised by human art once stood." - Vol. i.
pp. 255, 256. For a description of the ruins of Susa, see Pict. Bib. in
loc. This city was about 450 Roman miles from Seleucia, and was built,
according to Pliny, 6; 27, in a square of about 120 stadia. It was the
summer residence of the Persian kings (Cyrop. 8, 6, 10), as they passed
the spring in Ecbatana, and the autumn and winter in Babylon. See
Lengerke, in loc. It was in this city that Alexander the Great married
Stateira, daughter of Darius Codomanus. The name means a lily, and was
probably given to it on account of its beauty - Lengerke. Rosenmuller
supposes that the vision here is represented to have appeared to Daniel
in this city because it would be the future capital of Persia, and
because so much of the vision pertained to Persia. See Maurer, in loc.

In the palace - This word (בירה bı̂yrâh) means a fortress, a castle, a
fortified palace. - Gesenius. See [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Est
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#005.md); [Est
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005.md); [Est
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014.md); [Est
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006.md), [Est
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#011.md). It would seem to have been
given to the city because it was a fortified place. The word applied not
only to the palace proper, a royal residence, but to the whole adjacent
city. It is not necessary to suppose that Daniel was in the palace
proper, but only that he was in the city to which the name was given.

Which is in the province of Elam - See the notes at [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md). This province was bounded on
the east by Persia Proper, on the west by Babylonia, on the north by
Media, and on the south by the Persian Gulf. It was about half as large
as Persia, and not quite as large as England. - Kitto's Cyclo. It was
probably conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, and in the time of Belshazzar was
subject to the Babylonian dominion, Shushan had been doubtless the
capital of the kingdom of Elam while it continued a separate kingdom,
and remained the capital of the province while it was under the
Babylonian yoke, and until it was subdued as a part of the empire by
Cyrus. It was then made one of the capitals of the united Medo-Persian
empire. It was when it was the capital of a province that it was visited
by Daniel, and that he saw the vision there. Possibly he may have dwelt
there subsequently, and died there.

And I was by the river of Ulai - This river flowed by the city of
Shushan, or Susa, and fell into the united stream of the Tigris and the
Euphrates. It is called by Pliny (Nat. Hist. vi. 81) Eulaeus; but it is
described by Greek writers generally under the name of Choaspes. -
Herod. v. 49; Strabo, xv. p. 728. It is now known by the name Kerah,
called by the Turks Karasu. It passes on the west of the ruins of Shus
(Susa), and enters the Shat-ul-Arab about twenty miles below Korna. -
Kinneir, Geog. Mem. of the Persian Empire, pp. 96, 97. See Kitto's
Cyclo., art. "Ulai"

[Daniel 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 8:3</span></span>

Then I lifted up mine eyes and saw - And saw in vision, or there seemed
to be before me.

There stood before the river - On the bank of the river.

A ram which had two horns - There can be no error in explaining the
design of this symbol, for in [Dan
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020.md) it is expressly said that it
denoted the two kings of Media and Persia. The united power of the
kingdom was denoted by the ram itself; the fact that there were two
powers or kingdoms combined, by the two horns of the ram.

And the two horns were high - Both indicating great power.

But one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last - The
higher horn springing up last denotes Persia, that became the more
mighty power of the two, so that the name Media became finally almost
dropped, and the united kingdom was known in Grecian history as the
Persian The Median or Assyrian power was the older, but the Persian
became the most mighty.

[Daniel 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 8:4</span></span>

I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward - Denoting
the conquests of the united kingdom. The east is not mentioned, for none
of the conquests of the Medo-Persian empire extended in that direction:
Yet nothing could better express the conquests actually made by the
Medo-Persian empire than this representation. On the west the conquests
embraced Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Asia Minor; on the north,
Colchis, Armenia, Iberia, and the regions around the Caspian Sea; and on
the south, Palestine, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Lybia. - Lengerke. This
Medo-Persian power is represented as coming from the east. [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md) : "who raised up the righteous
man from the east, etc." [Isa 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md) :
"calling a ravenous bird from the east, etc."

He did according to his will, and became great - This expresses well
also the character of the Medo-Persian empire. It extended over a great
part of the known world, subduing to itself a large portion of the
earth. In its early conquests it met with no successful opposition, nor
was it stayed until it was subdued by Greece - as at Leuctra and
Marathon, and then as it was finally overthrown by Alexander the Great.

[Daniel 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 8:5</span></span>

And as I was considering - As I was looking on this vision. It was a
vison which would naturally attract attention, and one which would not
be readily understood. It evidently denoted some combined power that was
attempting conquest, but we are not to suppose that Daniel would readily
understand what was meant by it. The whole scene was future - for the
Medo-Persian power was not yet consolidated in the time of Belshazzar,
and the conquests represented by the ram continued through many years,
and those denoted by the he-goat extended still much further into
futurity.

Behold, an he-goat came from the west - In [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md), this is called the "rough-goat,"
There can be no doubt as to the application of this, for in [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md) it is expressly said that it was
"the king of Grecia." The power represented is that of Greece when it
was consolidated under Alexander the Great, and when he went forth to
the subjugation of this vast Persian empire. It may serve to illustrate
this, and to show the propriety of representing the Macedonian power by
the symbol of a goat, to remark that this symbol is often found, in
various ways, in connection with Macedon, and that, for some reason, the
goat was used as emblematic of that power. A few facts, furnished to the
editor of Calmet's Dictionary, by Taylor Combe, Esq., will show the
propriety of this allusion to Macedonia under the emblem of a goat, and
that the allusion would be readily understood in after-times. They are
condensed here from his account in Taylor's Calmet, v. 410-412.

\(1\) Caranus, the first king of the Macedonians, commenced his reign
814 years before the Christian era. The circumstance of his being led by
goats to the city of Edessa, the name of which, when he established
there the seat of his kingdom, he converted into AEgae, is well worthy
of remark: Urbem Edessam, ob memoriam muneris AEgas populam AEgeadas. -
Justin, lib. vii. c. 1. The adoption of the goat as an emblem of Macedon
would have been early suggested by an important event in their history.

\(2\) bronze figures of a goat have been found as the symbol of Macedon.
Mr. Combe says, "I have lately had an opportunity of procuring an
ancient bronze figure of a goat with one horn, which was the old symbol
of Macedon. As figures representing the types of ancient countries are
extremely rare, and as neither a bronze nor marble symbol of Macedon has
been hitherto noticed, I beg leave to trouble you with the few following
observations, etc." He then says, "The goat which is sent for your
inspection was dug up in Asia Minor, and was brought, together with
other antiquities, into this country by a poor Turk." The annexed
engraving is a representation of this figure. The slightest inspection
of this figure will show the propriety of the representation before us.
Mr. Combe then says, "Not only many of the individual towns in Macedon
and Thrace employed this type, but the kingdom itself of Macedon, which
is the oldest in Europe of which we have any regular and connected
history, was represented also by a goat, with this peculiarity, that it
had but one horn."

\(3\) In the reign of Amyntas the First, nearly 300 years after Caranus,
and about 547 years before Christ, the Macedonians, upon being
threatened with an invasion, became tributary to the Persians. In one of
the pilasters of Persepolis, this very event seems to be recorded in a
manner that throws considerable light on this subject. A goat is
represented with an immense horn growing out of the middle of his
forehead, and a man in a Persian dress is seen by his side, holding the
horn with his left hand, by which is signified the subjection of
Macedon. The subjoined is the figure referred to, and it strikingly
shows how early this symbol was used.

\(4\) In the reign of Archelaus of Macedon, 413 b.c., there occurs on
the reverse of a coin of that king the head of a goat having only one
horn. Of this coin, so remarkable for the single horn, there are two
varieties, one (No. 1) engraved by Pellerin, and the oth. er (No. 2)
preserved in the cabinet of the late Dr. W. Hunter.

\(5\) "there is a gem," says Mr. Combe, "engraved in the Florentine
collection, which, as it confirms what has been already said, and has
not hitherto been understood, I think worthy of mention. It will be seen
by the drawing of this gem that nothing more or less is meant by the
ram's head with two horns, and the goat's head with one, than the
kingdoms of Persia and Macedon, represented under their appropriate
symbols. From the circumstance, however; of these characteristic types
being united, it is extremely probable that the gem was engraved after
the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great." These remarks and
illustrations will show the propriety of the symbol used here, and show
also how readily it would be understood in after-times. There is no
evidence that Daniel understood that this ever had been a symbol of
Mace-donia, or that, if he had, he could have conjectured, by any
natural sagacity, that a power represented by that symbol would have
become the conqueror of Media and Persia, and every circumstance,
therefore, connected with this only shows the more clearly that he was
under the influence of inspiration. It is affirmed by Josephus (Ant. b.
xi. ch. viii.) that when Alexander was at Jerusalem, the prophecies of
Daniel respecting him were shown to him by the high priest, and that
this fact was the means of his conferring important favors on the Jews.
If such an event occurred, the circumstances here alluded to show how
readily Alexander would recognize the reference to his own country, and
to himself, and how probable the account of Josephus is, that this was
the means of conciliating him toward the Jewish people. The credibilty
of the account, which has been called in question, is examined in Newton
on the Prophecies, pp. 241-246.

On the face of the whole earth - He seemed to move over the whole world
- well representing the movements of Alexander, who conquered the known
world, and who is said to have wept because there were no other worlds
to conquer.

And touched not the ground - Margin, none touched him in the earth. The
translation in the text, however, is more correct than that in the
margin. He seemed to bound along as if he did not touch the ground -
denoting the rapidity of his movements and conquests. A similar
description of great beauty occurs in Virgil, AEn. vii. 806, following
of Camillia:

"Cursu pedum pravertere ventos.

Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret

Gramina, nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas,

Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti

Ferretiter, celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas"

Nothing would better express the rapid conquests of Alexander the Great
than the language employed by Daniel. He died at the early age of
thirty-three, and having been chosen generalissimo of the Greeks against
the Persians at the age of twenty-one, the whole period occupied by him
in his conquests, and in his public life, was but twelve years; yet in
that time he brought the world in subjection to his arms. A single
glance at his rapid movements will show the propriety of the description
here. In the year 334 b.c., he invaded Persia, and defeated the Persians
in the battle of the Granicus; in the year 333, he again defeated them
at the battle of Issus, and conquered Parthia, Bactria, Hyrcania,
Sogdiana, and Asia Minor. In the year 332, he conquered Tyre and Egypt,
and built Alexandria. In the year 331, he defeated Darius Codomanus, and
in 330 completed the conquest of the Persian empire. In the year 328, he
defeated Porus, king of India, and pursued his march to the Ganges. In
these few years, therefore, he had overrun nearly all the then known
world, in conquests more rapid and more decisive than had ever before
been made.

And the goat had a notable horn between his eyes - The goat represented
the Macedonian power, and all this power was concentrated in the person
of Alexander - undoubtedly denoted by the single horn - as if all the
power of Greece was concentrated in him. The margin is, a horn of sight.
This corresponds with the Hebrew - the word rendered "notable" (חזוּת
châzût) meaning, properly, look, appearance, and then something
conspicuous or remarkable. The literal translation would be, a horn of
appearance; that is, conspicuous, large - Gesenius, Lexicon

[Daniel 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 8:6</span></span>

And he came to the ram ... - Representing the Medo-Persian power.

And ran unto him in the fury of his power - Representing the fierceness
and fury with which Alexander attacked the Persians at the Granicus, at
Issus, and at Arbela, with which he invaded and overthrew them in their
own country. Nothing would better express this than to say that it was
done in "the fury of power."

[Daniel 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 8:7</span></span>

And I saw him, come close unto the ram - The ram standing on the banks
of the Ulai, and in the very heart of the empire. This representation is
designed undoubtedly to denote that the Grecian power would attack the
Persian in its own dominions. Perhaps the vision was represented at the
place which would be the capital of the empire in order to denote this.

And he was moved with choler against him - (i. e., the ram)." With wrath
or anger. That is, he acted as if he were furiously enraged. This is not
an improper representation. Alexander, though spurred on by ambition as
his ruling motive, yet might be supposed without impropriety to
represent the concentrated wrath of all Greece on account of the
repeated Persian invasions. It is true the Persians had been defeated at
Leuctra, at Marathon, and at Salamis, that their hosts had been held in
check at Thermopylae, that they had never succeeded in subduing Greece,
and that the Grecians in defending their country had covered themselves
with glory. But it is true, also, that the wrongs inflicted or attempted
on the Greeks had never been forgotten, and it cannot be doubted that
the remembrance of these wrongs was a motive that influenced many a
Greek at the battle of the Granicus and Issus, and at Arbela. It would
be one of most powerful motives to which Alexander could appeal in
stimulating his army.

And brake his two horns - Completely prostrated his power - as Alexander
did when he overthrew Darius Codemenus, and subjugated to himself the
Medo-Persian empire. That empire ceased at that time, and was merged in
that of the son of Philp.

And there was no power in the ram to stand before him - To resist him.

But he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him - An act
strikingly expressive of the conduct of Alexander. The empire was
crushed beneath his power, and, as it were, trampled to the earth.

And there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand - No
auxiliaries that the Persian empire could call to its aid that could
save it from the Grecian conqueror.

[Daniel 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 8:8</span></span>

Therefore the he-goat waxed very great - The Macedonian power,
especially under the reign of Alexander.

And when he was strong, the great horn was broken - In the time, or at
the period of its greatest strength. Then an event occurred which broke
the horn in which was concentrated its power. It is easy to see the
application of this to the Macedonian power. At no time was the empire
so strong as at the death of Alexander. Its power did not pine away; it
was not enfeebled, as monarchies are often, by age, and luxury, and
corruption; it was most flourishing and prosperous just at the period
when broken by the death of Alexander. Never afterward did it recover
its vigour; never was it consolidated again. From that time this mighty
empire, broken into separate kingdoms, lost its influence in the world.

And for it came up four notable ones - In the place of this one horn in
which all the power was concentrated, there sprang up four others that
were distinguished and remarkable. On the word notable, see the notes at
[Dan 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md). This representation would
lead us to suppose that the power which had thus been concentrated in
one monarchy would be divided and distributed into four, and that
instead of that one power there would be four kingdoms that would fill
up about the same space in the world, occupy about the same territory,
and have about the same characteristics - so that they might be regarded
as the succession to the one dynasty. The same representation we have of
this one power in [Dan 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md) : "The
beast had also four heads." See also [Dan
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004.md) : "His kingdom shall be broken,
and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven." This accords with
the accounts in history of the effect of Alexander's death, for though
the kingdom was not by him divided into four parts, yet, from the
confusion and conflicts that arose, the power was ultimately
concentrated into four dynasties.

At his death, his brother Aridaeus was declared king in his stead, and
Perdiccas regent. But the unity of the Macedonian power was gone, and
disorder and confusion, and a struggle for empire, immediately
succeeded. The author of the books of Maccabees (1 Macc. 1:7-9) says:
"So Alexander reigned twelve years, and then died. And his servants bare
rule every one in his place. And after his death, they all put crowns
upon themselves; so did their sons after them many years; and evils were
multiplied in the earth." Alexander died 323 b.c.; Antipater succeeded
Perdiccas, 321 b.c.; Ptolemy Lagus the same year took possession of
Egypt; Cassander assumed the government of Macedon, 317 b.c.; Seleucus
Nicator took possession of Syria, 311 b.c.; in 305 b.c. the successors
of Alexander took the title of kings, and in 301 b.c. there occurred the
battle of Ipsus, in which Antigonus, who reigned in Asia Minor, was
killed, and then followed in that year a formal division of Alexander's
empire between the four victorious princes, Ptolemy, Seleucus,
Cassander, and Lysimachus. This great battle of Ipsus, a city of
Phrygia, was fought between Antigonus and his son Demetrius on the one
side, and the combined forces of these princes on the other.

Antigonus had aimed at universal sovereignty; he had taken and plundered
the island of Cyprus; had destroyed the fieet of Ptolemy Lagus, and had
assumed the crown. Against him and his usurpations, Ptolemy, Cassander,
and Lysimachus, combined their forces, and the result was his complete
overthrow at the battle of Ipsus. - Lengerke, in loc. In this battle,
Antigonus lost all his conquests and his life. In the division of the
empire, Seleucus Nicator obtained Syria, Babylonia, Media, and Susiana,
Armenia, a part of Cappadocia, Cilicia, and his kingdom, in name at
least, extended from the Hellespont to the Indies. The kingdom of
Lysimachus extended over a part of Thrace, Asia Minor, part of
Cappadocia, and the countries within the limits of Mount Taurus.
Cassander possessed Macedonia, Thessaly, and a part of Greece. Ptolemy
obtained Egypt, Cyprus, and Cyrene, and ultimately Ccelo-Syria,
Phoenicia, Judea, and a part of Asia Minor and Thrace - Lengerke, in
loc.

Toward the four winds of heaven - Toward the four quarters of the world.
Thus the dominions of Seleucus were in the east; these of Cassander in
the west; those of Ptolemy in the south, and those of Lysimachus in the
north.

[Daniel 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 8:9</span></span>

And out of one of them, came forth a little horn - Emblematic of new
power that should spring up. Compare the notes at [Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md). This little horn sprang, up out
of one of the others; it did not spring up in the midst of the others as
the little horn, in [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), did
among the ten others. This seemed to grow out of one of the four, and
the meaning cannot be misunderstood. From one of the four powers or
kingdoms into which the empire of Alexander would be divided, there
would spring up this ambitions and persecuting power.

Which waxed exceeding great - Which became exceedingly powerful. It was
comparatively small at first, but ultimately became mighty. There can be
no doubt that Antiochus Epiphanes is denoted here. All the circumstances
of the prediction find a fulfillment in him; and if it were supposed
that this was written after he had lived, and that it was the design of
the writer to describe him by this symbol, he could not have found a
symbol that would have been more striking or appropriate than this. The
Syriac version has inserted here, in the Syriae text, the words
"Antiochus Epiphanes," and almost without exception expositors have been
agreed in the opinion that he is referred to. For a general account of
him, see the notes at [Dan 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md),
following The author of the book of Maccabees, after noticing, in the
passage above quoted, the death of Alexander, and the distractions that
followed his death, says, "And there came out of them a wicked root,
Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a
hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh
year of the kingdom of the Greeks," 1 Macc. 1:10. A few expositors have
supposed that this passage refers to Antichrist - what will not
expositors of the Bible suppose? But the great body of interpreters have
understood it to refer to Antiochus. This prince was a successor of
Seleucus Nicator, who, in the division of the empire of Alexander,
obtained Syria, Babylonia, Media, etc. (see above the note at [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008).md), and whose capital was Antioch.
The succession of princes who reigned in Antioch, from Seleucus to
Antiochus Epiphanes, were as follows:

\(1\) Seleucus Nicator, 312-280 b.c.

\(2\) Antiochus Soter, his son, 280-261.

\(3\) Antiochus Theos, his son, 261-247.

\(4\) Seleucus Callinicus, his son, 247-226.

\(5\) (Alexander), or Seleucus Ceraunus, his son, 226-223.

\(6\) Antiochus the Great, his brother, 223-187.

\(7\) Seleucus Philopater, his son, 187-176.

\(8\) Antiochus Epiphanes, his brother, 176-164.

\- Clinton's Fasti Hellenici, vol. iii. Appendix, ch. iii.

The succession of the Syrian kings reigning in Antioch was continued
until Syria was reduced to the form of a Roman province by Pompey, 63
b.c. Seleucus Philopater, the immediate predecessor of Antiochus, having
been assassinated by one of his courtiers, his brother Antiochus
hastened to occupy the vacant throne, although the natural heir,
Demetrius, son of Seleucus, was yet alive, but a hostage at Rome.
Antiochus assumed the name of Epiphanes, or Illustrious. In [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md), it is intimated that he gained
the kingdom by flatteries; and there can be no doubt that bribery, and
the promise of reward to others, was made use of to secure his power.
See Kitto's Cyclo., i. 168-170. Of the acts of this prince there will be
occasion for a fuller detail in the notes on the remainder of this
chapter, and Dan. 11.

Toward the south - Toward the country of Egypt, etc. In the year 171
b.c., he declared war against Ptolemy Philometer, and in the year 170 he
conquered Egypt, and plundered Jerusalem. 1 Macc. 1:16-19: "Now when the
kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over
Egypt, that he might have the dominion of two realms. Wherefore he
entered Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and
horsemen, and a great navy. And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt:
but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to
death. Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt, and he took
the spoils thereof."

And toward the east - Toward Persia and the countries of the East. He
went there - these countries being nominally subject to him - according
to the author of the book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:21-37), in order to
replenish his exhausted treasury, that he might carry on his wars with
the Jews, and that he might keep up the splendor and liberality of his
court: "He saw that the money of his treasures failed, and that the
tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague
which he had brought upon the land, and he feared that he should not be
able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so
liberally as he did before; wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his
mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the
countries, and to gather much money. So the king departed from Antioch,
his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed
the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries."

And toward the pleasant land - The word used here (צבי tsebı̂y) means,
properly, splendor, beauty, [Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md);
[Isa 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md); [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), [Isa
28:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md). It is applied, in [Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md), to Babylon - "the glory of
kingdoms." Here it evidently denotes the land of the Israelites, or
Palestine - so often described as a land of beauty, as flowing with milk
and honey, etc. This is such language as a pious Hebrew would naturally
use of his own country, and especially if he was an exile from it, as
Daniel was. Nothing more would be necessary to designate the land so as
to be understood than such an appellation - as nothing more would be
necessary to designate his country to an exile from China than to speak
of "the flowery land." Antiochus, on his return from Egypt, turned aside
and invaded Judea, and ultimately robbed the temple, destroyed
Jerusalem, and spread desolation through the land. See 1 Macc. 1.

[Daniel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 8:10</span></span>

And it waxed great - It became very powerful. This was eminently true of
Antiochus, after having subdued Egypt, etc.

Even to the host of heaven - Margin, against. The Hebrew word (עד ‛ad)
means "to" or "unto," and the natural idea would seem to be that he
wished to place himself among the stars, or to exalt himself above all
that was earthly. Compare the notes at [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md) : "For thou hast said in thine
heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars
of God." Lengerke supposes that the meaning here is, that he not only
carried his conquests to Egypt and to the East, and to the holy land in
general, but that he made war on the holy army of God - the priests and
worshippers of Jehovah, here spoken of as the host of heaven. So Maurer
understands it. In 2 Macc. 9:10, Antiochus is described in this
language: "And the man that thought a little afore he could reach the
stars of heaven, etc." The connection, would seem to demand the
interpretation proposed by Lengerke and Maurer, for it is immediately
said that he cast down some of the host and the stars to the ground. And
such an interpretation accords with the language elsewhere used, of the
priests and rulers of the Hebrew people. Thus, in [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md), they are called "the host of
the high ones that are on high." See the note at that passage. This
language is by no means uncommon in the Scriptures. It is usual to
compare princes and rulers, and especially ecclesiastical rulers, with
the sun, moon, and stars. Undoubtedly it is the design here to describe
the pride and ambition of Antiochus, and to show that he did not think
anything too exalted for his aspiration. None were too high or too
sacred to be secure from his attempts to overthrow them, and even those
who, by their position and character, seemed to deserve to be spoken of
as suns and stars, as "the host of heaven," were not secure.

And it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground - The
horn seemed to grow up to the stars, and to wrest them from their
places, and to cast them to the earth. Antiochus, in the fulfillment of
this, east down and trampled on the princes, and rulers, and people, of
the holy host or army of God. All that is implied in this was abundantly
fulfilled in what he did to the Jewish people. Compare 1 Macc. 1, and 2
Macc. 8:2.

And stamped upon them - With indignation and contempt. Nothing could
better express the conduct of Antiochus toward the Jews.

[Daniel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 8:11</span></span>

Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host - Grotius,
Ephraem the Syrian, and others, understand this of Onias the high
priest, as the chief officer of the holy people. Lengerke supposes that
it means God himself. This interpretation is the more probable; and the
idea in the phrase "prince of the host" is, that as God is the ruler of
the host of heaven - leading on the constellations, and marshalling the
stars, so he may be regarded as the ruler of the holy army here below -
the ministers of religion, and his people. Against him as the Ruler and
Leader of his people Antiochus exalted himself, particularly by
attempting to change his laws, and to cause his worship to cease.

And by him - Margin, "from him." The meaning is, that the command or
authority to do this proceeded from him.

The daily sacrifice was taken away - The sacrifice that was offered
daily in the temple, morning and evening, was suspended. A full account
of this may be found in 1 Macc. 1:20-24, 29-32, 44-50. In the execution
of the purposes of Antiochus, he "entered the sanctuary, and took away
the golden altar, and the candlestick, and all the vessels thereof; and
the table of showbread, the pouring vessels, etc., and stripped the
temple of all the ornaments of gold." After two years he again visited
the city, and "smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel,
and when he had taken the spoils of the city he set it on fire, and
pulled down the walls thereof on every side." Everything in Jerusalem
was made desolate. Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her
feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach, her honor
into contempt." Subsequently, by a solemn edict, and by more decisive
acts, he put a period to the worship of God in the temple, and polluted
and defiled every part of it. "For the king had sent letters by
messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should
follow the strange laws of the land, and forbid burnt-offerings, and
sacrifices, and drink-offerings in the temple; and that they should
profane the sabbaths and festival days, and pollute the sanctuary and
holy people; set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and
sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts; that they should also leave
their children uncir. cumcised, and make their souls abominable with all
manner of uncleanness and profanation; to the end they might forget the
laws, and change all the ordinances," 1 Macc. 1:44-49.

It was undoubtedly to these acts of Antiochus that the passage before us
refers, and the event accords with the words of the prediction as
clearly as if what is a prediction had been written afterward, and had
been designed to represent what actually occurred as a matter of
historical record. The word which is rendered "daily sacrifice" - the
word "sacrifice" being supplied by the translators - תמיד tâmı̂yd -
means, properly, continuance, prepetuity, and then what is continuous or
constant - as a sacrifice or service daily occurring. The word sacrifice
is properly inserted here. - Gesenius, Lexicon The meaning of the word
rendered "was taken away" - הרם huram (Hophal from רום rûm - to exalt,
to lift up) - here is, that it was lifted up, and then was taken away;
that is, it was made to cease - as if it had been carried away. -
Gesenius.

And the place of his sanctuary - Of the sanctuary or holy place of the,
"Prince of the host," that is, of God. The reference is to the temple.

Was cast down - The temple was not entirely destroyed by Antiochus, but
it was robbed and rifled, and its holy vessels were carried away. The
walls indeed remained, but it was desolate, and the whole service then
was abandoned. See the passages quoted above from 1 Macc.

[Daniel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 8:12</span></span>

And a host was given him - The Vulgate renders this, "and strength -
robur - was given him, etc." Theodotion, "and sin was permitted - ἐδόθη
edothē - against the sacrifice; and this righteousness was cast on the
ground; so he acted and was prospered." Luther renders it, "and such
might (or power, macht) was given him." The Syriac renders it, "and
strength was given him, etc." Bertholdt renders it, Statt jenes stellte
man den Greuel auf, "instead of this (the temple) there was set up an
abomination." Dathe, "and the stars were delivered to him" - tradita ei
fuerunt astra, seu populus Judaicus. Maurer understands it also of the
Jewish people, and interprets it, "and an army - exercitus - the people
of the Jews was delivered to destruction, at the same time with the
perpetual sacrifice, on account of wickedness, that is, for a wicked
thing, or for impure sacrifices." Lengerke renders it, as in our
translation, "an host - ein Heer - was Wen up to him at the same time
with the daily offering, on account of evil." The word "host" (צבא
tsâbâ') is doubtless to be taken here in the same sense as in [Dan
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md), where it is connected with
heaven - "the host of heaven." If it refers there to the Jewish people,
it doubtless does here, and the appellation is such a one as would not
unnaturally be used. It is equivalent to saying "the army of the Lord,"
or "the people of the Lord," and it should have been rendered here "and
the host was given up to him;" that is, the people of God, or the holy
people were given into his hands.

Against the daily sacrifice - This does not convey any clear idea.
Lengerke renders it, sammt den bestandigen opfer - "at the same time
with the permanent sacrifice." He remarks that the preposition על ‛al
(rendered in our version against), like the Greek ἐπὶ epi, may denote a
connection with anything, or a being with a thing - Zusammenseyn - and
thus it would denote a union of time, or that the things occurred
together, [Gen 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011) (12.md); [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md); [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015). Compare Gesenius (Lexicon.md) on
the word על ‛al, 3. According to this, the meaning is, that the "host,"
or the Jewish people, were given to him at the same time, or in
connection with the daily sacrifice. The conquest over the people, and
the command respecting the daily sacrifice, were simultaneous. Both
passed into his hands, and he exercised jurisdiction over them both.

By reason of transgression - - בפשׁע beppâsha‛. That is, all this was on
account of the transgression of the people, or on account of abounding
iniquity. God gave up the people, and their temple, and their
sacrifices, into the hands of Antiochus, on account of the prevailing
impiety. Compare 1 Macc. 1:11-16. The author of that book traces all
these calamities to the acts of certain wicked men, who obtained
permission of Antiochus to introduce pagan customs into Jerusalem, and
who actually established many of those customs there.

And it cast down the truth to the ground - The true system of religion,
or the true method of worshipping God - represented here as truth in the
abstract. So in [Isa 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md), it is
said: "Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter." The
meaning here is, that the institutions of the true religion would be
utterly prostrate. This was fully accomplished by Antiochus. See 1 Macc.
1.

And it practiced - Hebrew. "it did," or it acted. That is, it undertook
a work, and was successful. So in [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md), where the same expression occurs:
"And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." This was fully accomplished in
Antiochus, who was entirely successful in all his enterprises against
Jerusalem. See 1 Macc. 1.

[Daniel 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 8:13</span></span>

Then I heard one saint speaking - One holy one. The vision was now
ended, and the prophet represents himself now as hearing earnest
inquiries as to the length of time during which this desolation was to
continue. This conversation, or these inquiries, he represents himself
as hearing among those whom he calls "saints" - or holy ones - קדשׁ
qâdôsh. This word might refer to a saint on earth, or to an angel - to
any holy being. As one of these, however, was able to explain the
vision, and to tell how long the desolation was to continue, it is more
natural to refer it to angels. So Lengerke understands it. The
representation is, that one holy one, or angel, was heard by Daniel
speaking on this subject, but nothing is recorded of what he said. It is
implied only that he was conversing about the desolations that were to
come upon the holy city and the people of God. To him thus speaking, and
who is introduced as having power to explain it, another holy one
approaches, and asks how long this state of things was to continue. The
answer to this question [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md) is
made, not to the one who made the inquiry, but to Daniel, evidently that
it might be recorded. Daniel does not say where this vision occurred -
whether in heaven or on earth. It was so near to him, however, that he
could hear what was said.

And another saint - Another holy one - probably an angel. If so, we may
conclude, what is in itself every way probable, that one angel has more
knowledge than another, or that things are communicated to some which
are not to others.

Unto that certain saint which spake - Margin, Palmoni, or, the numberer
of secrets, or, the wondeful numberer. The Hebrew word, פלמוני
palemônı̂y, occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. The similar form, פלני
pelonı̂y, occurs in [Rut 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md), "Ho, such
a one, turn aside;" in [Sa1 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md),
"appointed my servants to such and such a place;" and [Kg2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md), "In such and such a place." The
Italic words denote the corresponding Hebrew word. The word, according
to Gesenius, means some one, a certain one; in Arabic, one who is
distinct or definite, whom one points out as with the finger, and not by
name. It is derived from an obsolete noun, פלון pâlôn, from the verb פלה
pâlâh, to distinguish, and is united commonly with the word אלמני
'alemonı̂y - meaning, properly, one concealed or unknown. It is language,
therefore, which would be properly addressed to an unknown person with
whom we would desire to speak, or whom we would designate by the finger,
or in some such way, without being able to call the name. Thus applied
in the passage here, it means that Daniel did not know the names of the
persons thus speaking, but simply saw that one was speaking to another.
He had no other way of designating or distinguishing them than by
applying a term which was commonly used of a stranger when one wished to
address him, or to point him out, or to call him to him. There is no
foundation in the word for the meaning suggested in the margin.
Theodotion does not attempt to translate the word, but retains it -
φελμουνὶ phelmouni - Phelmouni. The Latin Vulgate well expresses the
meaning, dixit unus sanctus alteri nescio loquenti. The full sense is
undoubtedly conveyed by the two ideas,

\(a\) that the one referred to was unknown by name, and

\(b\) that he wished to designate him in some way, or to point him out.

How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice? - How long
is what is designed to be represented by the vision to continue; that
is, how long in fact will the offering of the daily sacrifice in the
temple be suspended?

And the transgression of desolation - Margin, making desolate. That is,
the act of iniquity on the part of Antiochus producing such desolation
in the holy city and the temple - show long is that to continue?

To give both the sanctuary - The temple; the holy place where God dwelt
by a visible symbol, and where he was worshipped.

And the host - The people of God - the Jewish people.

To be trodden under foot - To be utterly despised and prostrated - as
anything which is trodden under our feet.

[Daniel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 8:14</span></span>

And he said unto me - Instead of answering the one who made the inquiry,
the answer is made to Daniel, doubtless that he might make a record of
it, or communicate it to others. If it had been made to the inquirer,
the answer would have remained with him, and could have been of no use
to the world. For the encouragement, however, of the Hebrew people, when
their sanctuary and city would be thus desolate, and in order to furnish
an instance of the clear fulfillment of a prediction, it was important
that it should be recorded, and hence, it was made to Daniel.

Unto two thousand and three hundred days - Margin, evening, morning. So
the Hebrew, בקר ערב ‛ereb boqer. So the Latin Vulgate, ad vesperam et
mane. And so Theodotion - ἔως ἑσπέρας καὶ πρωΐ̀ heōs hesperas kai prōi -
"to the evening and morning." The language here is evidently what was
derived from Gen. i., or which was common among the Hebrews, to speak of
the "evening and the morning" as constituting a day. There can be no
doubt, however, that a day is intended by this, for this is the fair and
obvious interpretation. The Greeks were accustomed to denote the period
of a day in the same manner by the word νυχθήμερον nuchthēmeron (see
[Co2 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025).md), in order more
emphatically to designate one complete day. See Prof. Stuart's Hints on
Prophecy, pp. 99, 100. The time then specified by this would be six
years and a hundred and ten days.

Much difficulty has been felt by expositors in reconciling this
statement with the other designations of time in the book of Daniel,
supposed to refer to the same event, and with the account furnished by
Josephus in regard to the period which elapsed during which the
sanctuary was desolate, and the daily sacrifice suspended. The other
designations of time which have been supposed to refer to the same event
in Daniel, are [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md), where the
time mentioned is three years and a half, or twelve hundred and sixty
days; and [Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), where the same
time is mentioned, "a time, times, and an half," or three years and an
half, or, as before, twelve hundred and sixty days; and [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md), where the period mentioned is
"a thousand two hundred and ninety days;" and [Dan
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md), where the time mentioned is "a
thousand three hundred and thirty-five days." The time mentioned by
Josephus is three years exactly from the time when "their Divine worship
was fallen off, and was reduced to a profane and common use," until the
time when the lamps were lighted again, and the worship restored, for he
says that the one event happened precisely three years after the other,
on the same day of the month - Ant. b. xii. ch. vii. Section 6. In his
Jewish Wars, however, b. i. ch. i. Section 1, he says that Antiochus
"spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering
a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months." Now, in
order to explain the passage before us, and to reconcile the accounts,
or to show that there is no contradiction between them, the following
remarks may be made:

\(1\) We may lay out of view the passage in [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md). See the note at that passage. If
the reasoning there be sound, then that passage had no reference to
Antiochus, and though, according to Josephus, there is a remarkable
coincidence between the time mentioned there and the time during which
the daily sacrifice was suspended, yet that does not demonstrate that
the reference there is to Antiochus.

\(2\) We may lay out of view, also, for the present, the passages in
[Dan 12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md). Those will be the
subject of consideration hereafter, and for the present ought not to be
allowed to embarrass us in ascertaining the meaning of the passage
before us.

\(3\) On the assumption, however, that those passages refer to
Antiochus, and that the accounts in Josephus above referred to are
correct - though he mentions different times, and though different
periods are referred to by Daniel, the variety may be accounted for by
the supposition that separate epochs are referred to at the starting
point in the calculation - the terminus a quo. The truth was, there were
several decisive acts in the history of Antiochus that led to the
ultimate desolation of Jerusalem, and at one time a writer may have
contemplated one, and at another time another. Thus, there was the act
by which Jason, made high priest by Antiochus, was permitted to set up a
gymnasium in Jerusalem after the manner of the pagan (Prideaux, iii.
216; 1 Macc. 1:11-15); the act by which he assaulted and took Jerusalem,
entering the most holy place, stripping the temple of its treasures,
defiling the temple, and offering a great sow on the altar of
burnt-offerings (Prideaux, iii. 230, 231; 1 Macc. 1:20-28); the act,
just two years after this, by which, having been defeated in his
expedition to Egypt, he resolved to vent all his wrath on the Jews, and,
on his return, sent Apollonius with a great army to ravage and destroy
Jerusalem - when Apollonius, having plundered the city, set it on fire,
demolished the houses, pulled down the walls, and with the ruins of the
demolished city built a strong fortress on Mount Acra, which overlooked
the temple, and from which he could attack all who went to the temple to
worship (Prideaux, iii. 239, 240; 1 Macc. 1:29-40); and the act by which
Antiochus solemnly forbade all burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and
drink-offerings in the temple - (Prideaux, iii. 241, 242; 1 Macc.
1:44-51). Now, it is evident that one writing of these calamitous
events, and mentioning how long they would continue, might at one time
contemplate one of these events as the beginning, the terminus a quo,
and at another time, another of these events might be in his eye. Each
one of them was a strongly marked and decisive event, and each one might
be contemplated as a period which, in an important sense, determined the
destiny of the city, and put an end to the worship of God there.

\(4\) It seems probable that the time mentioned in the passage before us
is designed to take in the whole series of disastrous events, from the
first decisive act which led to the suspending of the daily sacrifice,
or the termination of the worship of God there, to the time when the
"sanctuary was cleansed." That this is so would seem to be probable from
the series of visions presented to Daniel in the chapter before us. The
acts of the "little horn" representing Antiochus, as seen in vision,
began with his attack on the "pleasant land" [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md), and the things which attracted
the attention of Daniel were, that he "waxed great," and made war on
"the host of heaven," and "cast some of the host and of the stars to the
ground" [Dan 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md), and "magnified
himself against the prince of the host" [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md) - acts which refer manifestly to
his attack on the people of God, and the priests or ministers of
religion, and on God him. self as the "prince of the host" - unless this
phrase should be understood as referring rather to the high priest. We
are then rather to look to the whole series of events as included within
the two thousand and three hundred days, than the period in which
literally the daily sacrifice was forbidden by a solemn statute. It was
practically suspended, and the worship of God interrupted during all
that time.

\(5\) The terminus ad quem - the conclusion of the period is marked and
settled. This was the "cleansing of the sanctuary." This took place,
under Judas Maccabeus, Dec. 25, 165 b.c. - Prideaux, iii. 265-268. Now,
reckoning back from this period, two thousand and three hundred days, we
come to August 5, 171 b.c. The question is, whether there were in this
year, and at about this time, any events in the series of sufficient
importance to constitute a period from which to reckon; events answering
to what Daniel saw as the commencement of the vision, when "some of the
host and the stars were cast down and stamped upon." Now, as a matter of
fact, there commenced in the year 171 b.c. a series of aggressions upon
the priesthood, and temple, and city of the Jews on the part of
Antiochus, which terminated only with his death. Up to this year, the
relations of Antiochus and the Jewish people were peaceful and cordial.

In the year 175 b.c. he granted to the Jewish people, who desired it,
permission to erect a gymnasium in Jerusalem, as above stated. In the
year 173 b.c. demand was made of Antiochus of the provinces of
Ccelo-Syria and Palestine by the young Philometor of Egypt, who had just
come to the throne, and by his mother - a demand which was the origin of
the war between Antiochus and the king of Egypt, and the beginning of
all the disturbances. - Prideaux, iii. 218. In the year 172 b.c.,
Antiochus bestowed the office of high priest on Menelaus, who was the
brother of Jason the high priest. Jason had sent Menelaus to Antioch to
pay the king his tribute-money, and while there Menelaus conceived the
design of supplanting his brother, and by offering for it more than
Jason had, he procured the appointment and returned to Jerusalem. -
Prideaux, iii. 220-222. Up to this time all the intercourse of Antiochus
with the Jews had been of a peaceful character, and nothing of a hostile
nature had occurred.

In 171 b.c. began the series of events which finally resulted in the
invasion and destruction of the city, and in the cessation of the public
worship of God. Menelaus, having procured the high priesthood, refused
to pay the tribute-money which he had promised for it, and was summoned
to Antioch. Antioclius being then absent, Menelaus took advantage of his
absence, and having, by means of Lysimachus, whom he had left at
Jerusalem, procured the vessels out of the temple, He sold them at Tyre,
and thus raised money to pay the king. In the meantime, Onias III, the
lawful high priest, who had fled to Antioch, sternly rebuked Menelaus
for his sacrilege, and soon after, at the instigation of Menelaus, was
allured from his retreat at Daphne, where he had sought an asylum, and
was murdered by Andronicus, the vicegerent of Antiochus. At the same
time, the Jews in Jerusalem, highly indignant at the profanation by
Menelaus, and the sacrilege in robbing the temple, rose in rebellion
against Lysimachus and the Syrian forces who defended him, and both cut
off this "sacrilegious robber" (Prideaux), and the guards by whom he was
surrounded.

This assault on the officer of Antiochus, and rebellion against him, was
the commencement of the hostilities which resulted in the ruin of the
city, and the closing of the worship of God. - Prideaux, iii. 224-226;
Stuart's Hints on Prophecy, p. 102. Here commenced a series of
aggressions upon the priesthood, and the temple, and the city of the
Jews, which, with occasional interruption, continued to the death of
Antiochus, and which led to all that was done in profaning the temple,
and in suspending the public worship of God, and it is doubtless to this
time that the prophet here refers. This is the natural period in
describing the series of events which were so disastrous to the Jewish
people; this is the period at which one who should now describe them as
history, would begin. It may not, indeed, be practicable to make out the
precise number of days, for the exact dates are not preserved in
history, but the calculation brings it into the year 171 b.c., the year
which is necessary to be supposed in order that the two thousand and
three hundred days should be completed. Compare Lengerke, in loc., p.
388. Various attempts have been made to determine the exact number of
the days by historic records. Bertholdt, whom Lengerke follows,
determines it in this manner. He regards the time referred to as that
from the command to set up pagan altars to the victory over Nicanor, and
the solemn celebration of that victory, as referred to in 1 Macc. 7:48,
49. According to this reckoning, the time is as follows: The command to
set up idol altars was issued in the year 145, on the 15th of the month
Kisleu. There remained of that year, after the command was given -

Half of the month Kisleu 15 days The month Thebet 30 days The month
Shebath 29 days The month Adar 30 days The year 146 354 days The year
147 354 days The year 148 354 days The year 149 354 days The year 150
354 days The year 15l to the 13th day of the month Adar, when the
victory over Nicanor was achieved 337 days Two intercalary months during
this time, according to the Jewish reckoning 60 days Total of 2,271
days. This would leave but twenty-nine days of the 2300 to be accounted
for, and this would be required to go from the place of the battle -
between Beth-Horon and Adasa (1 Macc. 7:39, 40) to Jerusalem, and to
make arrangements to celebrate the victory. See Bertholdt, pp. 501-503.
The reckoning here is from the time of founding the kingdom of the
Seleucidae, or the era of the Seleucidae.

Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed - Margin, justified. the Hebrew
word (צדק tsâdaq) means, to be right or straight, and then to be just or
righteous; then to vindicate or justify. In the form used here (Niphal),
it means to be declared just; to be justified or vindicated, and, as
applied to the temple or sanctuary, to be vindicated from violence or
injury; that is, to be cleansed. See Gesenius, Lexicon There is
undoubtedly reference here to the act of Judas Maccabeus, in solemnly
purifying the temple, and repairing it, and re-dedicating it, after the
pollutions brought upon it by Antiochus. For a description of this, see
Prideaux's Connexions, iii. 265-269. Judas designated a priesthood again
to serve in the temple; pulled down the altars which the pagan had
erected; bore out all the defiled stones into an unclean place; built a
new altar in place of the old altar of burnt-offerings which they had
defiled; hallowed the courts; made a new altar of incense, table of
showbread, golden candlestick, etc., and solemnly re-consecrated the
whole to the service of God. This act occurred on the twenty-fifth day
of the ninth month (Kisleu), and the solemnity continued for eight days.
This is the festival which is called "the feast of dedication" in the
New Testament [Joh 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022.md), and which
our Saviour honored with his presence. See 1 Macc. 4:41-58; 2 Macc.
10:1-7; Josephus, Ant. b. xii. ch. vii. Section 6, 7.

[Daniel 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 8:15</span></span>

And it came to pass ... - Daniel saw the vision, but was unable to
explain it.

And sought for the meaning - Evidently by meditating on it, or
endeavoring in his own mind to make it out.

There stood before me as the appearance of a man - One having the
appearance of a man. This was evidently Gabriel [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md), who now assumed a human form,
and who was addressed by the voice from between the banks of the Ulai,
and commenced to make known the meaning of the vision.

[Daniel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 8:16</span></span>

And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai - See the notes at
[Dan 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md). The voice seemed to come
from the river, as if it were that of the Genius of the river, and to
address Gabriel, who stood near to Daniel on the shore. This was
doubtless the voice of God. The speaker was invisible, and this method
of explaining the vision was adopted, probably to make the whole scene
more impressive.

Which called, and said, Gabriel - Gabriel is mentioned in the Scriptures
only in [Dan 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md); [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md); [Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md), [Luk
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md). In [Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md), he is mentioned as saying of
himself, "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God." The word
means, properly, "man of God." Nothing more is known of him, and he is
mentioned only as bearing messages to Daniel, to Zacharias the father of
John the Baptist, and to Mary.

Make this man to understand the vision - Explain it to him so that he
will under stand its meaning.

[Daniel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 8:17</span></span>

So he came near where I stood - He had seen him, evidently, at first in
the distance. He now drew near to Daniel, that he might communicate with
him the more readily.

And when, he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face - Doubtless
perceiving that he was a celestial being. See the notes at [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md). Compare [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md), and [Dan
10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#008.md). He was completely overpowered
by the presence of the celestial stranger, and sank to the ground.

But he said unto me, Understand, O son of man - Give attention, that you
may understand the vision. On the phrase "son of man," see the notes at
[Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md). It is here simply an
address to him as a man.

For at the time of the end shall be the vision - The design of this
expression is undoubtedly to cheer and comfort the prophet with some
assurance of what was to occur in future times. In what way this was
done, or what was the precise idea indicated by these words,
interpreters have not been agreed. Maurer explains it, "for this vision
looks to the last time; that is, the time which would immediately
precede the coming of the Messiah, which would be a time of calamity, in
which the guilt of the wicked would be punished, and the virtue of the
saints would be tried, to wit, the time of Antiochus Epiphanes."
Lengerke supposes that the end of the existing calamities - the
sufferings of the Jews - is referred to; and that the meaning is, that
in the time of the Messiah, to which the vision is extended, there would
be an end of their sufferings and trials. The design of the angel, says
he, is to support and comfort the troubled seer, as if he should not be
anxious that these troubles were to occur, since they would have an end,
or, as Michaelis observes, that the seer should not suppose that the
calamities indicated by the vision would have no end.

Perhaps the meaning may be this: "The vision is for the time of the
end;" that is, it has respect to the closing period of the world, under
which the Messiah is to come, and necessarily precedes that, and leads
on to that. It pertains to a series of events which are to introduce the
latter times, when the kingdom of God shall be set up on the earth. In
justification of this view of the passage, it may be remarked that this
is not only the most obvious view, but is sustained by all those
passages which speak of the coming of the Messiah as "the end," the
"last days," etc. Thus [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md) :
"upon whom the ends of the world are come." Compare the notes at [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md). According to this interpretation,
the meaning is, "the vision pertains to the end, or the closing
dispensation of things;" that is, it has a bearing on the period when
the end will come, or will introduce that period. It looks on to future
times, even to those times, though now remote (compare [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026).md), when a new order of things will
exist, under which the affairs of the world will be wound up. Compare
the notes at [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md).

[Daniel 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 8:18</span></span>

Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward
the ground - Overcome and prostrate with the vision. That is, he had
sunk down stupified or senseless. See [Dan
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#009.md). His strength had been entirely
taken away by the vision. There is nothing improbable in this, that the
sudden appearance of a celestial vision, or a heavenly being, should
take away the strength. Compare [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md); [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013.md), following; [Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md); [Jdg
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020.md), [Jdg
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#022.md); [Isa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md); [Luk
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#012.md), [Luk
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#029.md); [Luk
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009.md); [Act
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003.md), [Act
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008.md). "But he touched me, and set me
upright." Margin, as in Hebrew, "made me stand upon my standing." He
raised me up on my feet. So the Saviour addressed Saul of Tarsus, when
he had been suddenly smitten to the earth, by his appearing to him on
the way to Damascus: "Rise, and stand upon thy feet," etc., [Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md).

[Daniel 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 8:19</span></span>

And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end
of the indignation - In the future time when the Divine indignation
shall be manifest toward the Hebrew people; to wit, by suffering the
evils to come upon them which Antiochus would inflict. It is everywhere
represented that these calamities would occur as a proof of the Divine
displeasure on account of their sins. Compare [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md); [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035.md); 2 Macc. 7:33.

For at the time appointed the end shall be - It shall not always
continue. There is a definite period marked out in the Divine purpose,
and when that period shall arrive, the end of all this will take place.
See the notes at [Dan 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017.md).

[Daniel 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 8:20</span></span>

The ram which thou sawest ... - See the notes at [Dan
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md). This is one of the instances in
the Scriptures in which symbols are explained. There can be no doubt,
therefore, as to the meaning.

[Daniel 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 8:21</span></span>

And the rough goat - See the notes at [Dan
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md). In [Dan
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md) he is called a he-goat. Here the
word rough or hairy - שׂעיר s'â‛ı̂yr - is applied to it. This appellation
is often given to a goat [Lev 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024.md);
[Lev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#009.md); [Gen
37:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031.md). It would seem that either term
- a he-goat, or a hairy-goat - would serve to designate the animal, and
it is probable that the terms were used indiscriminately.

Is the king of Grecia - Represents the king of Greece. The word here
rendered Grecia (יון yâvân) denotes usually and properly Ionia, the
western part of Asia Minor; but this name was extended so as to embrace
the whole of Greece. See Aristoph. Acharn. 504, ibique Schol.; AEschyl.
Pers. 176, 561; Gesenius, Lexicon Latin Vulgate and Theodotion, here
render it "the king of the Grecians," and there can be no doubt that the
royal power among the Greeks is here referred to. See the notes at [Dan
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md).

And the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king -
Alexander the Great. The first that consolidated the whole power, and
that was known in the East as the king of Greece. So he is expressly
called in 1 Macc. 1:1: "The first over Greece." Philip, his father, was
opposed in his attempts to conquer Greece, and was defeated. Alexander
invaded Greece, burned Thebes, compelled the Athenians to submit, and
was declared generalissimo of the Grecian forces against the Persians.

[Daniel 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 8:22</span></span>

Now that being broken - By the death of Alexander.

Whereas four stood up for it - Stood up in its place.

Four kingdoms shall stand up - Ultimately. It is not necessary to
suppose that this would be immediately. If four such should in fact
spring out of this one kingdom, all that implied in the prophecy would
be fulfilled. On the fulfillment of this, see the notes at [Dan
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008.md).

But not in his power - No one of these four dynasties had at any time
the power which was wielded by Alexander the Great.

[Daniel 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 8:23</span></span>

And in the latter time of their kingdom - When it shall be drawing to an
end. All these powers were ultimately absorbed in the Roman power; and
the meaning here is, that taking the time from the period of their
formation - the division of the empire after the battle of Ipsus (see
the notes at [Dan 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008).md), until the time
when all would be swallowed up in the Roman dominion, what is here
stated - to wit, the rise of Antiochus - would be in the latter portion
of that period. The battle of Ipsus was fought 301 b.c., and the Roman
power was extended over all those regions gradually from 168 b.c. - the
battle of Pydna, when Perseus was defeated, and Macedonia was reduced to
a Roman province, to 30 b.c., when Egypt was subjected - the last of
these kingdoms that submitted to the Roman arms. Antiochus began to
reign, 175 b.c. - so that it was in the latter part of this period.

When the transgressors are come to the full - Margin, accomplished. That
is, when the state of things - the prevalence of wickedness and
irreligion in Judea - shall have been allowed to continue as long as it
can be - or so that the cup shall be full - then shall appear this
formidable power to inflict deserved punishment on the guilty nation.
The sacred writers often speak of iniquity as being full - of the cup of
iniquity as being full - as if there was a certain limit or capacity
beyond which it could not be allowed to go. When that arrives, God
interposes, and cuts off the guilty by some heavy judgment. Compare [Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md) : "The iniquity of the Amorites
is not yet full." [Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md) : "fill
ye up then the measure of your fathers." [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md) : "to fill up their sins alway."
The idea is, that there is a certain measure or amount of sin which can
be tolerated, but beyond that the Divine compassion cannot go with
safety to the universe, or consistently with the honor of God, and then
the punishment may be expected; then punishment must come. This is true,
doubtless, of individuals and nations, and this period had arrived in
regard to the Jews when Antiochus was permitted to lay their temple,
city, and country waste.

A king of fierce countenance - Stern and severe. This expression would
be applicable to many who have held the kingly office, and no one can
doubt that it may be applied with strict propriety to Antiochus.

And understanding dark sentences - Gesenius (Lexicon) explains the word
here rendered "dark sentences" to mean artifice, trick, stratagem. This
will better agree with the character of Antiochus, who was more
distinguished for craft and policy than he was for wisdom, or for
explaining enigmas. The meaning seems to be that he would be politic and
crafty, seeking to make his way, and to accomplish his purpose, not only
by the terror that he inspired, but by deceit and cunning. That this was
his character is well known. Compare the notes at [Dan
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md).

Shall stand up - Shall succeed, or there shall be such a king.

[Daniel 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 8:24</span></span>

And his power shall be mighty - He shall be a powerful monarch. Though
not as mighty as Alexander, yet his conquests of Egypt and other places
show that he deserved to be numbered among the mighty kings of the
earth.

But not by his own power - That is, it shall not be by any strength of
his own, but by the power which God gives him. This is true of all kings
and princes (compare [Joh 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011.md); [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005), following.md), but it seems to be
referred to here particularly to show that the calamities which he was
about to bring upon the Hebrew people were by Divine direction and
appointment. This great power was given him in order that he might be an
instrument in the Divine hand of inflicting deserved punishment on them
for their sins.

And he shall destroy wonderfully - In a wonderful or extraordinary
manner shall he spread desolation. This refers particularly to the
manner in which he would lay waste the holy city, and the land of Judea.
The history in the books of Maccabees shows that this was literally
fulfilled.

And shall prosper - Antiochus was among the most successful kings in his
various expeditions. Particularly was he successful in his enterprises
against the holy land.

And practice - Hebrew, "do." That is, he shall be distinguished not only
for "forming" plans, but for "executing" them; not merely for
"purposing," but for "doing."

And shall destroy the mighty and the holy people - The people of God -
the Jewish nation. See the notes at [Dan
8:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md).

[Daniel 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 8:25</span></span>

And through his policy - The word rendered "policy" here (שׂכל s'êkel)
means, properly, intelligence, understanding, wisdom; and then, in a bad
sense, craft, cunning. So it is rendered here by Gesenius, and the
meaning is, that he would owe his success in a great measure to craft
and subtilty.

He shall cause craft to prosper in his hand - He shall owe his success
in a great measure to a crafty policy, to intrigue, and to cunning. This
was true in an eminent sense, of Antiochus. See his history in Prideaux,
above referred to, and the books of Maccabees. Compare the notes at [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md). The same character is given of
him by Polybius, "Relig." lib. xxi. c. 5, tom. iv. p. 501, ed.
Schweighauser; Appian, "de reb. Syr." xlv. t. 1, p. 604, ed. Schweigh.
Compare 2 Macc. 5:24-26. He came to the kingdom by deceit (Prideaux,
iii. 212), and a great part of his success was owing to craft and
policy.

And he shall magnify himself in his heart - Shall be lifted up with
pride, or esteem himself of great consequence.

And by peace shall destroy many - Margin, "prosperity." The Hebrew word
(שׁלוה shalevâh) means, properly, tranquility, security, ease,
carelessness. Here the phrase seems to mean "in the midst of security"
(Gesenius, Lexicon); that is, while they were at ease, and regarded
themselves as in a state of safety, he would come suddenly and
unexpectedly upon them, and destroy them. He would make sudden war on
them, invading their territories, so that they would have no opportunity
to make preparation to meet him. Compare [Dan
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md), [Dan
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#024.md). It would seem to mean that he
would endeavor to produce the impression that he was coming in peace;
that he pretended friendship, and designed to keep those whom he meant
to invade and destroy in a state of false security, so that he might
descend upon them unawares. This was his policy rather than to declare
war openly, and so give his enemies fair warning of what he intended to
do. This description agrees every way with the character of Antiochus, a
leading part of whose policy always was to preserve the appearance of
friendship, that he might accomplish his purpose while his enemies were
off their guard.

He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes - Notes, [Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md). Against God, the ruler over the
kings of the earth.

But he shall be broken without hand - That is, without the hand of man,
or by no visible cause. He shall be overcome by Divine, invisible power.
According to the author of the first book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 6:8-16),
he died of grief and remorse in Babylon. He was on an expedition to
Persia, and there laid siege to Elymais, and was defeated, and fled to
Babylon, when, learning that his forces in Palestine had been repulsed,
penetrated with grief and remorse, he sickened and died. According to
the account in the second book of Maccabees (2 Macc. 9), his death was
most distressing and horrible. Compare Prideaux, iii. 272-275. All the
statements given of his death, by the authors of the books of Maccabees,
by Josephus, by Polybius, by Q. Curtius, and by Arrian (see the
quotations in Prideaux), agree in representing it as attended with every
circumstance of horror that can be well supposed to accompany a
departure from this world, and as having every mark of the just judgment
of God. The Divine prediction in Daniel was fully accomplished, that his
death would be "without hand," in the sense that it would not be by
human instrumentality; but that it would be by a direct Divine
infliction. When Antiochus died, the opposition to the Jews ceased, and
their land again had peace and rest.

And the vision of the evening and the morning - That is, of the two
thousand three hundred days. See [Dan
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md), and the margin on that verse.
The meaning here is, "the vision pertaining to that succession of
evenings and mornings." Perhaps this appellation was given to it
particularly because it pertained so much to the evening and morning
sacrifice.

Is true - Shall be certainly accomplished. This was said by the angel,
giving thus to Daniel the assurance that what he had seen [Dan
8:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009.md) was no illusion, but would
certainly come to pass.

Wherefore shut thou up the visions - Seal it up. Make a record of it,
that it may be preserved, and that its fulfillment may be marked. See
the notes at [Isa 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md).

For it shall be for many days - That is, many days will elapse before it
will be accomplished. Let a fair record, therefore, be made of it, and
let it be sealed up, that it may be preserved to prepare the people for
these events. "When" these things would come thus fearfully upon the
people of Judea, they would be the better able to bear these trials,
knowing the period when they would terminate.

[Daniel 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 8:27</span></span>

And I Daniel fainted - Hebrew, "I was " - נהייתי nı̂heyēythı̂y. Compare
[Dan 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md). The meaning, according to
Gesenius ("Lexicon"), is, "I was done up, and was sick:" - I was done
over, etc. Perhaps the "reason" of his using this verb here is, that he
represents himself as "having been sick," and then as fainting away, as
if his life had departed. The Latin Vulgate renders it langui.
Theodotion, ἐκοιμήθην ekoimēthēn - " was laid in my bed." The general
idea is plain, that he was overcome and prostrate at the effect of the
vision. He had been permitted to look into the future, and the scenes
were so appalling - the changes that were to occur were so great - the
calamities were so fearful in their character - and, above all, his mind
was so affected that the daily sacrifice was to cease, and the worship
of God be suspended, that he was entirely overcome. And who of us,
probably, could "bear" a revelation of what is to occur hereafter? Where
is there strength that could endure the disclosure of what may happen
even in a few years?

And was sick certain days - The exact time is not specified. The natural
interpretation is, that it was for a considerable period.

Afterward I rose up, and did the king's business - Compare the notes at
[Dan 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md). From this it would appear
that he had been sent to Shushan on some business pertaining to the
government. What it was we are not informed. As a matter of fact, he was
sent there for a more important purpose than any which pertained to the
government at Babylon - to receive disclosure of most momentous events
that were to occur in distant times. Yet this did not prevent him from
attending faithfully to the business entrusted to him - as no views
which we take of heavenly things, and no disclosures made to our souls,
and no absorption in the duties and enjoyments of religion, should
prevent us from attending with fidelity to whatever secular duties may
be entrusted to us. Sickness justifies us, of course, in not attending
to them; the highest views which we may have of God and of religious
truth should only make us more faithful in the discharge of our duties
to our fellow-men, to our country, and in all the relations of life. He
who has been favored with the clearest views of Divine things will be
none the less prepared to discharge with faithfulness the duties of this
life; he who is permitted and enabled to look far into the future will
be none the less likely to be diligent, faithful, and laborious in
meeting the responsibilites of the present moment. If a man could see
all that there is in heaven, it would only serve to impress him with a
deeper conviction of his obligations in every relation; if he could see
all that there is to come in the vast eternity before him, it would only
impress him with a profounder sense of the consequences which may follow
from the discharge of the present duty.

And I was astonished at the vision - He was stupified - he was overcome
- at the splendid appearance, and the momentous nature of the
disclosures. Compare the notes at [Dan
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#019.md).

But none understood it - It would seem probable from this, that he
communicated it to others, but no one was able to explain it. Its
general features were plain, but no one could follow out the details,
and tell "precisely" what would occur, before the vision was fulfilled.
This is the general nature of prophecy; and if neither Daniel nor any of
his friends could explain this vision in detail, are we to hope that we
shall be successful in disclosing the full meaning of those which are
not yet fulfilled? The truth is, that in all such revelations of the
future, there must be much in detail which is not now fully understood.
The general features may be plain - as, in this case, it was clear that
a mighty king would rise; that he would be a tyrant; that he would
oppress the people of God; that he would invade the holy land; that he
would for a time put a period to the offering of the daily sacrifice;
and that this would continue for a definite period; and that then he
would be cut off without human instrumentality: but who from this would
have been able to draw out, in detail, all the events which in fact
occurred? Who could have told precisely how these things would come to
pass? Who could have ventured on a biography of Antiochus Epiphanes? Yet
these three things are true in regard to this:

\(1\) That no one by human sagacity could have foreseen these events so
as to have been able to furnish these sketches of what was to be;

\(2\) That these were sufficient to apprise those who were interested
particularly of what would occur; and

\(3\) That when these events occurred, it was plain to all persons that
the prophecy had reference to them.

So plain is this - so clear is the application of the predictions in
this book, that Porphyry maintained that it was written after the events
had occurred, and that the book must have been forged.
