### [Joshua Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 7:1</span></span>

Committed a trespass - (compare [Lev
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015) note.md), "acted treacherously and
committed a breach of faith." This suitably describes the sin of Achan,
who had purloined and hidden away that which had been dedicated to God
by the ban [Jos 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#019.md).

The "trespass" was the act of one man, yet is imputed to all Israel, who
also share in the penalty of it [Jos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md). This is not to be explained as
though all the people participated in the covetousness which led to
Achan's sin [Jos 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021.md). The nation as a
nation was in covenant with God, and is treated by Him not merely as a
number of individuals living together for their own purposes under
common institutions, but as a divinely-constituted organic whole. Hence,
the sin of Achan defiled the other members of the community as well as
himself. and robbed the people collectively of holiness before God and
acceptableness with Him. Israel had in the person of Achan broken the
covenant [Jos 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011.md); God therefore
would no more drive out the Canaanites before them.

The accursed thing - Rather "in that which had been devoted or
dedicated." Achan in diverting any of these devoted things to his own
purposes, committed the sin of sacrilege, that of Ananias and Sapphira.
[Act 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md).

Achan or Achar - (the marginal reference) the "n" and "r" being
interchanged, perhaps for the sake of accommodating the name to עכר
‛âkar, "trouble" [Jos 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md). Zabdi is
generally identified with the Zimri of [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md). Zerah was twin brother of Pharez
and son of Judah [Gen 38:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#030.md). In this
genealogy, as in others, several generations are omitted, most likely
those which intervened between Zerah and Zabdi, and which covered the
space between the migration of Jacob's household to Egypt and the
Exodus. ([Num 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005), see the note.md).

[Joshua 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 7:2</span></span>

Ai, Bethel - See [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md) note.
(Modern travelers place the former at Khan Haiy, in the neighborhood of
Deir Diwan.)

[Joshua 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 7:3</span></span>

The total population of Ai was about twelve thousand [Jos
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025.md). It could therefore hardly muster
three thousand warriors.

[Joshua 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 7:5</span></span>

Shebarim - Rather, perhaps, "the stone quarries." The smallness of the
slaughter among the Israelites indicates that they fled early, probably
without real conflict in battle.

[Joshua 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 7:6</span></span>

On these signs of mourning, compare the marginal references and [Lev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md); [Num
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006.md); [Sa1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012.md).

[Joshua 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 7:9</span></span>

What wilt thou do unto thy great name? - i. e. "after the Canaanites
have cut off our name what will become of Thy Name?" This bold
expostulation, that of one wrestling in sore need with God in prayer,
like the similar appeals of Moses in earlier emergencies (Compare the
marginal references), is based upon God's past promises and mercies.
What would be said of (God by the pagan if now He permitted Israel to be
destroyed?

[Joshua 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 7:10</span></span>

God's answer is given directly, and in terms of reproof. Joshua must not
lie helpless before God; the cause of the calamity was to be discovered.

[Joshua 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 7:11</span></span>

Also stolen, and dissembled also - The anger of God and the heinousness
of Israel's sin are marked by the accumulation of clause upon clause. As
a climax they had even appropriated to their own use the consecrated
property purloined from God.

[Joshua 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 7:12</span></span>

Accursed - Compare [Jos 6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 7:14</span></span>

The Lord taketh - i. e. by lot. The Hebrew word for lot suggests that
small stones, probably white and black ones, were used. These were
probably drawn from a chest (compare the expressions in [Jos
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011.md); [Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001).md). The lot was regarded as
directed in its result by God (margin reference); and hence, was used on
many important occasions by the Jews and by other nations in ancient
times. For example:

(1), for apportionment, as of Canaan among the twelve tribes [Num
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md); of the Levitical cities ([Jos
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004) ff.md); of spoil or captives taken
in war [Joe 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003.md).

\(2\) for detection of the guilty, as in the case if Achan, Jonathan
[Sa1 14:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#042.md), and Jonah [Jon
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007.md).

\(3\) for determining the persons to undertake a dangerous or warlike
enterprise [Jdg 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010.md).

\(4\) for making appointment to important functions ([Lev
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md) ff; [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026).md); or for sharing the duties or
privileges of an office among those concerned [Ch1
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031.md); [Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md).

The casting of lots before Haman [Est
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md) seems to have been with a view of
determining the lucky day for his undertaking against the Jews. One
passage [Pro 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md) perhaps points also
to the employment of the lot to decide litigation.

[Joshua 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 7:15</span></span>

burnt with fire - i. e. after he had been put to death by stoning [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md); [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md).

[Joshua 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 7:19</span></span>

Give glory to the Lord - A form of solemn adjuration by which the person
addressed was called upon before God to declare the truth. The phrase
assumes that the glory of God is always promoted by manifestation of the
truth (compare the marginal references).

[Joshua 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 7:21</span></span>

A goodly Babylonian garment - literally, "a robe or cloak of Shinar,"
the plain in which Babylon was situated [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md). It was a long robe such as was
worn by kings on state occasions [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006.md), and by prophets [Kg1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013.md); [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md). The Assyrians were in early
times famous for the manufacture of beautiful dyed and richly
embroidered robes (compare [Eze
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#015).md). That such a robe should be
found in a Canaanite city is natural enough. The productions of the far
East found their way through Palestine both southward toward Egypt and
westward through Tyre to the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
(Compare [Eze 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#024) and the context..md)

Wedge of gold - i. e. some implement or ornament of gold shaped like a
wedge or tongue. The name lingula was given by the Romans to a spoon and
to an oblong dagger made in shape of a tongue. The weight of this
"wedge" was fifty shekels, i. e. about twenty-five ounces (see [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note.md). The silver was under the
rest of the stolen property. The mantle would naturally be placed
uppermost, and be used to cover up the others.

[Joshua 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 7:24</span></span>

The sin had been national ([Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md)
note), and accordingly the expiation of it was no less so. The whole
nation, no doubt through its usual representatives, took part in
executing the sentence. Achan had fallen by his own act under the ban
[Jos 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018.md), and consequently he and his
were treated as were communities thus devoted [Deu
13:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015.md). It would appear too that
Achan's family must have been accomplices in his sin; for the stolen
spoil could hardly have been concealed in his tent without their being
privy thereto.

[Joshua 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 7:26</span></span>

A great heap of stones - As a memorial of Achan's sin and its
punishment. (Compare [Jos 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md); [Sa2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017)..md)

The valley of Achor - Compare the marginal references. This valley
formed part of the northern border of Judah [Jos
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007.md); and must therefore have lain
among the ridges which cross the plain to the south of Jericho. But its
exact site is uncertain. (Conder identifies it with Wady Kelt.)
