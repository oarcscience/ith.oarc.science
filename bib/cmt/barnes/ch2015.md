### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

Oded is by some identified with Iddo, the prophet and historian of the
two preceding reigns. In the Hebrew the two names differ very slightly.

[2 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 15:3</span></span>

"Israel" here is used generally for the whole people of God; and the
reference is especially to the many apostasies in the days of the
Judges, which were followed by repentance and deliverance.

[2 Chronicles 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 15:6</span></span>

The allusion is probably to the destructions recorded in [Jdg
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md); 20:33-48.

[2 Chronicles 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 15:8</span></span>

Some versions have "the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded," which is
perhaps the true reading.

[2 Chronicles 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 15:9</span></span>

Strangers ... - i. e. "Israelites of the tribes of Ephraim and
Manasseh." The separation of the two kingdoms had made their Israelite
brethren "strangers," or "foreigners," to Judah.

[2 Chronicles 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 15:10</span></span>

In the third month - i. e. the month Sivan [Est
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009.md), corresponding with our June.

[2 Chronicles 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 15:11</span></span>

The prevalence of the number "seven" in the religious system of the Jews
has been noticed often. Seven bullocks and seven rams were a common
offering [Num 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#032.md); [Ch1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026.md); [Ch2
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021.md); [Job
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008.md); [Eze
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023.md). At the larger sacrifices,
however, it is seldom that we find the number seven at all prominent
(compare [Ch2 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024.md); [Ch2
35:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md); [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063).md).

[2 Chronicles 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 15:12</span></span>

Solemn renewals of the original covenant which God made with their
fathers in the wilderness [Exo 24:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md)
occur from time to time in the history of the Jews, following upon
intervals of apostasy. This renewal in the reign of Asa is the first on
record. The next falls 300 years later in the reign of Josiah. There is
a third in the time of Nehemiah (see the marginal references). On such
occasions, the people bound themselves by a solem oath to observe all
the directions of the Law, and called down God's curse upon them if they
forsook it.

[2 Chronicles 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 15:17</span></span>

Comparing this verse with marginal references, it would seem that in
[Ch2 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003.md), [Ch2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005.md) the intention and endeavors of
the monarch are in the writer's mind, while here he is speaking of the
practice of the people. However earnestly the most pious monarchs sought
to root out the high-place worship, they failed of complete success.
Compare a similar discrepancy, to be similarly explained, in the history
of Jehoshaphat [Ch2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006.md); [Ch2
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033.md).

The heart of Asa was perfect all his days - Not that Asa was sinless
(see [Ch2 16:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#002.md), [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012).md); but that he was free from the
sin of idolatry, and continued faithful to Yahweh all his life.

[2 Chronicles 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 15:19</span></span>

The five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa - This cannot be
reconciled with the chronqlogy of Kings [Kg1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md) : and the suggestion in the marg.
implies the adoption of a mode of marking time unknown either to himself
or any other Scriptural writer. It is supposed that the figures here and
in [Ch2 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001.md) are corrupt, and that in
both verses "twentieth" should replace "thirtieth." The attack of Baasha
would then have been made in the last year of Asa's reign; and ten years
of peace would have followed Asa's victory over Zerah.
