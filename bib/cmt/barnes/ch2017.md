### [2 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 17:1</span></span>

Jehoshaphat ascended the throne in the fourth year of Ahab [Kg1
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041), probably after that monarch had
contracted his alliance with the royal family of Sidon, and before he
was engaged in war with Syria. It was thus not unnatural that
Jehoshaphat should begin his reign by strengthening himself against a
possible attack on the part of his northern neighbor.

[2 Chronicles 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 17:3</span></span>

The first ways of his father David - The Septuagint and several Hebrew
manuscripts omit "David," which has probably crept in from the margin,
for David's "first ways" are nowhere else contrasted with his later
ways. The real meaning of the writer is, that Jehoshaphat followed the
example set by his father Asa in his earlier years [Ch2
14:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001); 15.

Baalim - On the plural form, see [Kg1
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#018) note.

[2 Chronicles 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 17:4</span></span>

The doings of Israel - i. e. the especially idolatrous doings of the
time - the introduction and establishment of the worship of Baal and the
groves.

[2 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 17:5</span></span>

Presents - i. e. "free-will offerings," in addition to the regular
taxes. See [Sa1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027).

[2 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 17:6</span></span>

His heart was lifted up - This expression generally occurs in a bad
sense [Deu 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014); [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016); [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001); [Pro
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012); but here it must be taken
differently. The margin "was encouraged" expresses fairly the true
meaning. He first began by setting an example of faithfulness to Yahweh.
He then proceeded to use his best endeavors to extirpate idolatry.

He took away the high places - Compare [Ch2
20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033), and see the [Ch2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017) note.

[2 Chronicles 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 17:7</span></span>

The princes were not sent as teachers themselves, but had the duty
committed to them of seeing that the people were taught. The actual
teachers were the priests and Levites of [Ch2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#008).

[2 Chronicles 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 17:9</span></span>

There is no reasonable doubt that this "book of the law" was the
Pentateuch - nearly, if not quite, in the shape in which we now have it.
Copies of the whole Law were, no doubt, scarce; and therefore
Jehoshaphat's commission took care to carry a copy with them.

[2 Chronicles 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 17:11</span></span>

Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents - i. e. "some of
the Philistines were among his tributaries." Compare [Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002); [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021).

Tribute silver - Or, "much silver" - literally "silver of burthen."

The Arabians - The Arab tribes who bordered Judaea to the south and the
southeast paid Jehoshaphat a fixed tribute in kind. Compare [Kg2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004) note.

[2 Chronicles 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 17:14</span></span>

The captains of thousands; Adnah the chief - literally, "princes of
thousands, Adnah the prince." The writer does not mean that Adnah (or
Johohanan, [Ch2 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#015)) was in any way
superior to the other "princes," but only that he was one of them.

Three hundred thousand - This number. and those which follow in [Ch2
17:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#015), have been with good reason
regarded as corrupt by most critics. For:

\(1\) They imply a minimum population of 1,480 to the square mile, which
is more than three times greater than that of any country in the known
world (circa 1880's).

\(2\) they produce a total just double that of the next largest estimate
of the military force of Judah, the 580, 000 of [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008).

\(3\) they are professedly a statement, not of the whole military force,
but of the force maintained at Jerusalem ([Ch2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#013); compare [Ch2
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#019)).

It is probable that the original numbers have been lost, and that the
loss was suppplied by a scribe, who took [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008) as his basis.
