### [Exodus Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001)

[Exodus 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 32:1</span></span>

In all probability these three chapters originally formed a distinct
composition. The main incidents recorded in them follow in the order of
time, and are therefore in their proper place as regards historical
sequence.

The golden calf - The people had, to a great extent, lost the
patriarchal faith, and were but imperfectly instructed in the reality of
a personal unseen God. Being disappointed at the long absence of Moses,
they seem to have imagined that he had deluded them, and had probably
been destroyed amidst the thunders of the mountain [Exo
24:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#015). Accordingly, they gave way
to their superstitious fears and fell back upon that form of idolatry
which was most familiar to them (see [Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004) note). The narrative of the
circumstances is more briefly given by Moses at a later period in one of
his addresses to the people [Deu
9:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008), [Deu
9:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025); [Deu
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001), [Deu
10:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008). It is worthy of remark, that
Josephus, in his very characteristic chapter on the giving of the law,
says nothing whatever of this act of apostacy, though he relates that
Moses twice ascended the mountain.

[Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001)

Unto Aaron - The chief authority during the absence of Moses was
committed to Aaron and Hur [Exo 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014).

Make us gods - The substantive אלהים 'elôhı̂ym is plural in form and may
denote gods. But according to the Hebrew idiom, the meaning need not be
plural, and hence, the word is used as the common designation of the
true God ([Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001), etc. See [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006) note). It here denotes a god, and
should be so rendered.

[Exo 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002)

Break off the golden earrings - It has been very generally held from
early times, that Aaron did not willingly lend himself to the mad design
of the multitude; but that, overcome by their importunity, he asked them
to give up such possessions as he knew they would not willingly part
with, in the hope of putting a check on them. Assuming this to have been
his purpose, he took a wrong measure of their fanaticism, for all the
people made the sacrifice at once [Exo
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003). His weakness, in any case, was
unpardonable and called for the intercession of Moses [Deu
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#020).

[Exo 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004)

The sense approved by most modern critics is: and he received the gold
at their hand and collected it in a bag and made it a molten calf. The
Israelites must have been familiar with the ox-worship of the Egyptians;
perhaps many of them had witnessed the rites of Mnevis at Heliopolis,
almost; on the borders of the land of Goshen, and they could not have
been unacquainted with the more famous rites of Apis at Memphis. It is
expressly said that they yielded to the idolatry of Egypt while they
were in bondage [Jos 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014); [Eze
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008); [Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003), [Eze
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008); and this is in keeping with the
earliest Jewish tradition (Philo). In the next verse, Aaron appears to
speak of the calf as if it was a representative of Yahweh - "Tomorrow is
a feast to the Lord." The Israelites did not, it should be noted,
worship a living Mnevis, or Apis, having a proper name, but only the
golden type of the animal. The mystical notions connected with the ox by
the Egyptian priests may have possessed their minds, and, when expressed
in this modified and less gross manner, may have been applied to the
Lord, who had really delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Their sin then lay, not in their adopting another god, but in their
pretending to worship a visible symbol of Him whom no symbol could
represent. The close connection between the calves of Jeroboam and this
calf is shown by the repetition of the formula, "which brought thee up
out of the land of Egypt" [Kg1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028).

These be thy gods - This is thy god. See [Exo
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001) note.

[Exodus 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 32:7</span></span>

The faithfulness of Moses in the office that had been entrusted to him
was now to be put to the test. It was to be made manifest whether he
loved his own glory better than he loved the brethren who were under his
charge; whether he would prefer that he should himself become the
founder of a "great nation," or that the Lord's promise should be
fulfilled in the whole people of Israel. This may have been especially
needful for Moses, in consequence of his natural disposition. See [Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003); and compare [Exo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011). With this trial of Moses
repeated in a very similar manner [Num
14:11-23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011), may be compared the trial of
Abraham Gen. 22 and of our Saviour [Mat
4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008).

[Exo 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008)

These be thy gods ... have brought - This is thy god, O Israel, who has
brought ...

[Exo 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010)

Let me alone - But Moses did not let the Lord alone; he wrestled, as
Jacob had done, until, like Jacob, he obtained the blessing [Gen
32:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).

[Exo 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014)

This states a fact which was not revealed to Moses until after his
second intercession when he had come down from the mountain and
witnessed the sin of the people [Exo
32:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030). He was then assured that the
Lord's love to His ancient people would prevail God is said, in the
language of Scripture, to "repent," when His forgiving love is seen by
man to blot out the letter of His judgments against sin ([Sa2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016); [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013); [Jon
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010), etc.); or when the sin of man
seems to human sight to have disappointed the purposes of grace ([Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006); [Sa1
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035), etc.). The awakened conscience
is said to "repent," when, having felt its sin, it feels also the divine
forgiveness: it is at this crisis that God, according to the language of
Scripture, repents toward the sinner. Thus, the repentance of God made
known in and through the One true Mediator reciprocates the repentance
of the returning sinner, and reveals to him atonement.

[Exo 32:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017)

Moses does not tell Joshua of the divine communication that had been
made to him respecting the apostasy of the people, but only corrects his
impression by calling his attention to the kind of noise which they are
making.

[Exo 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019)

Though Moses had been prepared by the revelation on the Mount, his
righteous indignation was stirred up beyond control when the abomination
was before his eyes.

[Exo 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020)

See [Deu 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021). What is related in this
verse must have occupied some time and may have followed the rebuke of
Aaron. The act was symbolic, of course. The idol was brought to nothing
and the people were made to swallow their own sin (compare [Mic
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013)).

[Exo 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022)

Aaron's reference to the character of the people, and his manner of
stating what he had done Exo. 5:24, are very characteristic of the
deprecating language of a weak mind.

[Exo 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#023)

Make us gods - Make us a god.

[Exo 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025)

Naked - Rather unruly, or "licentious".

Shame among their enemies - Compare [Psa
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013); [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004); [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037).

[Exo 32:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026)

The tribe of Levi, Moses' own tribe, now distinguished itself by
immediately returning to its allegiance and obeying the call to fight on
the side of Yahweh. We need not doubt that the 3,000 who were slain were
those who persisted in resisting Moses. The spirit of the narrative
forbids us to conceive that the act of the Levites was anything like an
indiscriminate massacre. An amnesty had first been offered to all by the
words: "Who is on the Lord's side?" Those who were forward to draw the
sword were directed not to spare their closest relations or friends; but
this must plainly have been with an understood qualification as regards
the conduct of those who were to be slain. Had it not been so, they who
were on the Lord's side would have had to destroy each other. We need
not stumble at the bold, simple way in which the statement is made.

[Exo 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029)

Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord ... - The margin contains the
literal rendering. Our version gives the most probable meaning of the
Hebrew, and is supported by the best authority. The Levites were to
prove themselves in a special way the servants of Yahweh, in
anticipation of their formal consecration as ministers of the sanctuary
(compare [Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008)), by manifesting a
self-sacrificing zeal in carrying out the divine command, even upon
their nearest relatives.

[Exo 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031)

Returned unto the Lord - i. e. again he ascended the mountain.

Gods of gold - a god of gold.

[Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032)

For a similar form of expression, in which the conclusion is left to be
supplied by the mind of the reader, see [Dan
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#015); [Luk
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009); [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042); [Joh
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062); [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022). For the same thought, see [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003). It is for such as Moses and Paul
to realize, and to dare to utter, their readiness to be wholly
sacrificed for the sake of those whom God has entrusted to their love.
This expresses the perfected idea of the whole burnt-offering.

Thy book - The figure is taken from the enrolment of the names of
citizens. This is its first occurrence in the Scriptures. See the
marginal references. and [Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003);
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001); [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020); [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005), etc.

[Exo 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033), [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034)

Each offender was to suffer for his own sin. Compare [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005); [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004), [Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020). Moses was not to be taken at
his word. He was to fulfill his appointed mission of leading on the
people toward the land of promise.

[Exo 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034)

Mine Angel shall go before thee - See the marginal references and [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007).

In the day when I visit ... - Compare [Num
14:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022). But though the Lord
chastized the individuals, He did not take His blessing from the nation.
