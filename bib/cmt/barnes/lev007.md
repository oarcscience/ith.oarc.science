### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)

[Leviticus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 7:1</span></span>

See [Lev 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#014) note. In [Lev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002) "sprinkle" should rather be cast
[Lev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005). All the details regarding
the parts put on the altar are repeated for each kind of sacrifice,
because the matter was one of paramount importance.

[Leviticus 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 7:8</span></span>

The skin of the burnt offering - It is most likely that the skins of the
sin-offering and the trespass-offering also fell to the lot of the
officiating priest.

[Leviticus 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 7:9</span></span>

See the marginal references.

[Leviticus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 7:11</span></span>

See Lev. 3:1-17. What is here added, relates to the accompanying מנחה
mı̂nchāh [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001), the classification
of peace-offerings into:

\(1\) thank-offerings,

\(2\) vow-offerings and

\(3\) voluntary-offerings, and the conditions to be observed by the
worshipper in eating the flesh.

[Leviticus 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 7:12</span></span>

For a thanksgiving - i. e., a thank-offering for mercies received.

[Leviticus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 7:13</span></span>

For his offering - The leavened bread was a distinct offering.

[Leviticus 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 7:14</span></span>

Out of the whole oblation - Rather, out of each offering. That is, one
loaf or cake out of each kind of meat-offering was to be a
heave-offering [Lev 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032) for the
officiating priest. According to Jewish tradition, there were to be ten
cakes of each kind of bread in every thank-offering. The other cakes
were returned to the sacrificer.

[Leviticus 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 7:16</span></span>

The vow-offering appears to have been a peace-offering vowed upon a
certain condition; the voluntary-offering, one offered as the simple
tribute of a devout heart rejoicing in peace with God and man offered on
no external occasion (compare [Lev
22:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#017)).

[Leviticus 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 7:18</span></span>

It was proper that the sacrificial meat should not be polluted by any
approach to putrefaction. But the exclusion of a mean-spirited economy
may further have furnished the ground for the distinction between the
thank-offerings and the others. The most liberal distribution of the
meat of the offering, particularly among the poor who were invited to
partake, would plainly be becoming when the sacrifice was intended
especially to express gratitude for mercies received.

[Leviticus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 7:21</span></span>

Unclean beast - that is, carrion of any kind. See Lev. 11.

Shall be cut off - See the [Exo 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014)
note.

[Leviticus 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 7:23</span></span>

This is emphatically addressed to the people. They were not to eat in
their own meal what belonged to the altar of Yahweh, nor what was the
perquisite of the priests. See [Lev
7:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#033).

[Leviticus 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 7:24</span></span>

Compare [Lev 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#039).

[Leviticus 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 7:26</span></span>

No manner of blood - See [Lev
17:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).

[Leviticus 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 7:30</span></span>

Wave-offering ... heave-offering - The latter appears to be used (like
קרבן qorbân, [Lev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002)) for offerings
in general. Waving (a moving to and fro, repeated several times) or
heaving (a lifting up once) the offering was a solemn form of dedicating
a thing to the use of the sanctuary.

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

The portion of the anointing ... - Rather, the appointed share of Aaron
and of his sons.

[Leviticus 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 7:37</span></span>

Of the consecrations - That is, of the sacrifices which were to be
offered in the consecration of the priests. See the marginal references.

[Leviticus 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 7:38</span></span>

wilderness of Sinai - Compare [Exo
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001).
