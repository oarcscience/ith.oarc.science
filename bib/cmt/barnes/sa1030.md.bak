### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 30:1</span></span>

On the third day - This indicates that Aphek was three days' march from
Ziklag, say about 50 miles, which agrees very well with the probable
situation of Aphek ([Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001) note.md).
From Ziklag to Shunem would not be less than 80 or 90 miles.

The Amalekites, in retaliation of David's raids [Sa1
27:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md), invaded "the south" of Judah
[Jos 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021.md); but owing to the absence
of all the men with David there was no resistance, and consequently the
women and children were carried off as prey, and uninjured.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 30:7</span></span>

Abiathar had continued to abide with David, ever since he joined him at
Keilah [Sa1 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md). On inquiry of the
Lord by the ephod, see [Jdg 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md) note.
The answers were evidently given by the Word of the Lord in the mouth of
the high priest (compare [Joh 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 30:9</span></span>

Besor - Thought to be the stream of the Wady Sheriah which enters the
sea a little south of Gaza.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 30:12</span></span>

Three days and three nights - Indicating that at least so long a time
had elapsed since the sack of Ziklag.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 30:14</span></span>

The Cherethites - Here used as synonymous with Philistines [Sa1
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016.md). In David's reign the body-guard
commanded by Benaiah consisted of Cherethites and Pelethites
(Philistines?) and a picked corps of six hundred men of Gath commanded
by Ittai the Gittite. It would seem from this that the Cherethites and
Philistines were two kindred and associated tribes, like Angles and
Saxons, who took possession of the seacoast of Palestine. The
Philistines, being the more powerful, gave their name to the country and
the nation in general, though that of the Cherethites was not wholly
extinguished. Many persons connect the name Cherethite with that of the
island of Crete.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 30:20</span></span>

The meaning is, "and David took all the sheep and oxen which the
Amalekites drove" (i. e. had in their possession) "before that
acquisition of cattle" (namely, before what they took in their raid to
the south), "and they" (the people) "said, This is David's spoil." This
was his share as captain of the band (compare [Jdg
8:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024).md). All the other plunder of the
camp - arms, ornaments, jewels, money, clothes, camels, accoutrements,
and so on - was divided among the little army. David's motive in
choosing the sheep and oxen for himself was to make presents to his
friends in Judah [Sa1 30:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 30:27</span></span>

Bethel - i. e. Bethuel [Ch1 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#030.md),
quite in the south near Beer-sheba, Hormah, and Ziklag; or Bethul [Jos
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#004.md), one of the cities of the
Simeonites.

South Ramoth - Rather, "Ramoth of the South country" [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md); [Sa1
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md), [Sa1
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md), so-called to distinguish it
from Ramoth-Gilead, one of the Simeonite cities [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008.md). Shimei, the Ramathite [Ch1
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027.md), who was over David's vineyards,
was evidently a native of this Ramath. See below [Sa1
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028.md).

Jattir - "In the mountains" of Judah, and one of the priests' cities, is
identified with 'Attir, ten miles south of Hebron.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 30:28</span></span>

Aroer - Not Aroer on the Arnon, but (if rightly written) some town in
Judah, not elsewhere named.

Siphmoth, Rachal [Sa1 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029.md), and
Athach [Sa1 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#030.md), are unknown and not
elsewhere mentioned; but Zabdi the Shiphmite [Ch1
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027.md), who was over David's
wine-cellars, was evidently a native of the first-named place. It is a
remarkable proof of the grateful nature of David, and of his fidelity to
his early friendships, as well as a curious instance of undesigned
coincidence, that we find among those employed by David in offices of
trust in the height of his power so many inhabitants of those obscure
places where he found friends in the days of his early difficulties.
Ezri the son of Chelub, Shimei the Ramathite, and Zabdi the Shiphmite,
as well as Ira and Gareb, and Ittai, and Hezrai, and many others, were
probably among these friends of his youth.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 30:30</span></span>

Chor-ashan - Perhaps the same as Ashan [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042.md), in the Shephelah of Judah,
inhabited by Simeonites, and one of the priests' cities [Ch1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#032.md); [Ch1
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#059.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 30:31</span></span>

Hebron - Now El-Khulil (see [Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002).md). Hebron was a city of refuge
[Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md), and one of the cities of
the Kohathites [Jos 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011.md). It lies
twenty miles south of Jerusalem.
