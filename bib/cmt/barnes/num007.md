### [Numbers Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 7:1</span></span>

On the day that - i. e. "at the time that," compare [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md). The presentation of the gifts in
fact occupied twelve days, as the sequel shows.

The enactments set forth in the chapters from Lev. 10 to Num. 6
inclusive, were doubtless promulgated at various times between the
consecration of the tabernacle and the departure from Sinai, but are for
convenience set out connectedly. The contents of the present chapter are
accordingly placed after them. The order pursued throughout is justly
noted as one which would naturally suggest itself to a narrator who was
contemporary with the events.

[Numbers 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 7:3</span></span>

Covered wagons - Some prefer to render "litter [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md) wagons:" i. e. litters which
were not on wheels, but borne by two oxen, one in front and one behind.
Such conveyances would probably be more convenient than wheeled wagons
in the rough country to be traversed.

[Numbers 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 7:7</span></span>

To the Gershonites, who had to transport the hangings and coverings of
the tabernacle, two wagons are assigned: to the Merarites, who had the
charge of the solid parts of the tabernacle, four wagons. The furniture
and vessels the Kohathites were to carry on their own shoulders. Compare
[Num 3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025.md), [Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md), [Num
3:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md).

[Numbers 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 7:12</span></span>

The several princes make their offerings in the order assigned to the
tribes Num. 2. It was doubtless the tribes themselves which presented
these gifts through their chiefs. The twelve offerings are strictly
alike, and were offered on twelve separate days.

[Numbers 7:84](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#084.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_084">num 7:84</span></span>

The aggregate worth, by weight, of the whole of the offerings was about
438 British pounds: But the real worth of such a sum, when measured by
the prices of clothing and food at that time, must have been vastly
greater.

[Numbers 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">num 7:89</span></span>

With him - i. e. as marginal, "with God," not (as some) with himself.

He heard the voice of one speaking - Rather, he heard the voice
speaking, or conversing. The effect was as though Moses was audibly
addressed by another person: how this effect was produced we are not
told.

Thus was the promise of [Exo 25:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020.md)
fulfilled; and that as an immediate response on the part of God to the
cheerful readiness with which the tribes had made their offerings, and
supplied everything needful for the Holy place and its service. All
being now complete as God had appointed, and the camp purified from
defilements, God meets Moses the mediator of the people, not as before
on the peak of Sinai far away, but in the midst of them, in the
dwelling-place which He henceforth vouchsafed to tenant.
