### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 43:0</span></span>

This chapter is evidently a continuation of the subject discussed in the
previous chapters, and refers mainly to the promised deliverance from
Babylon. The people of God are still contemplated by the prophet as
suffering the evils of their long and painful captivity, and his object
is to comfort them with the assurances of deliverance. The chapter may
be regard as composed of a succession of arguments, all tending to show
them that God would be their protector, and that their deliverance would
be certain. These arguments are not distinguished by any very clear
marks of transition, and all divisions of the chapter must he in a
measure arbitrary. But perhaps the following arrangement will comprise
the considerations which the prophet designed to suggest.

I. In the previous chapter he had severely rebuked the Jews, as being
deaf, and blind, and had showed them that it was on account of their
sins that these calamities had come upon them. Yet he now turns and
says, that they are the people whom he had redeemed, and whom it was his
purpose to deliver, and repeats the solemn assurance that they would be
rescued [Isa 43:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md). This assurance
consists of many items, or considerations, showing that they would be
recovered, however far they were driven from their own land.

1\. God had formed and redeemed them [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md). It followed from this that a God
of covenant faithfulness would be with them in their trials [Isa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md).

2\. They had been so precious to him and valuable, that he had given
entire nations for their ransom [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md). It followed from this, that he
would continue to give more, if necessary, for their ransom [Isa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md).

3\. It was rite fixed purpose of God to gather them again, wherever they
might be scattered, and they had, therefore, nothing to fear [Isa
43:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md).

II\. God asserts his superiority to all idol-gods. He makes a solemn
appeal, as he had done in Isa. 41, to show that the idols had no power;
and refers to all that he had predicted and to its fulfillment in proof
that he was the only true God, and had been faithful to his people [Isa
43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md). In doing this, he says:

1\. That none of the idols had been able to predict future events [Isa
43:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md).

2\. That the Jewish people were his witnesses that he was the true God,
and the only Saviour [Isa 43:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md).

3\. That he had existed forever, and that none could thwart his designs
[Isa 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md).

III\. God asserts his purpose to destroy the I power of Babylon [Isa
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md), [Isa
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md). He says:

1\. That he had sent to Babylon (by Cyrus) to bring down their power,
and prostrate their nobles [Isa
43:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md); and,

2\. Appeals to what he had formerly done; refers to the deliverance from
Egypt, and asserts it to be his characteristic that he made a way in the
sea, and led forth the chariot, the horse, the army, and the power [Isa
43:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016.md).

IV\. Yet he tells them [Isa 43:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018.md),
that all his former wonderful interpositions would be surpassed; that he
would do a new thing - so strange, so wonderful, and marvelous, that all
that he had formerly done should be forgotten.

1\. They are commanded not to remember the former things [Isa
43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018.md).

2\. He would do anew thing - a thing which in all his former
interpositions had not been done [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md).

3\. The characteristics of the future wonder would be, that he would
make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md); and that even the wild beasts
of the desert should be made to honor him [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md).

4\. He had formed that people for himself, and they should show forth
his praise [Isa 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md).

V. From these promises of protection and assistance, and these
assurances of favor, God turns to remind them of their sins, and assures
them that it was by no merit of theirs that he would thus interpose to
deliver them.

1\. He reminds them of their having neglected, as a people, to honor
him, and having witcheld what was his due [Isa
43:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md); yet,

2\. He would blot out their sins, but it was by no merit of theirs, but
by his mere mercy [Isa 43:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md).

3\. They had been a sinful people, and he had, therefore, humbled their
power, and given the nation to reproach, and a curse [Isa
43:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md). The same subject is resumed
and prosecuted in the next chapter, and they should be read together
without any interuption.

[Isaiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

But now - This expression shows that this chapter is connected with the
preceding. The sense is, "Though God has punished the nation, and showed
them his displeasure [Isa 42:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024.md),
yet now he will have mercy, and will deliver them.'

That created thee - The word 'thee' is used here evidently in a
collective sense as denoting the Jewish people. It is used because the
names 'Jacob' and 'Israel' in the singular number are applied to the
people. The word 'created' is used here to denote the idea that, as the
special people of God, they owed their origin to him, as the universe
owed its origin to his creative power. It means that, as a people, their
institutions, laws, customs, and privileges, and whatever they had that
was valuable, were all to be traced to him. The same word occurs in [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md), and again in [Isa
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015.md), 'I am Yahweh - the Creator of
Israel, your king' (see also [Isa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md); compare [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003).md).

Fear not - This is to be understood as addressed to them when suffering
the evils of the captivity of Babylon. Though they were captives, and
had suffered long, yet they had nothing to fear in regard to their final
extinction as a people. They should be redeemed from captivity, and
restored again to the land of their fathers. The argument here is, that
they were the chosen people of God; that he had organized them as his
people for great and important purposes, and that those purposes must be
accomplished. It would follow from that, that they must be redeemed from
their captivity, and be restored again to their land.

For I have redeemed thee - The word גאל gā'al means properly "to
redeem," to ransom by means of a price, or a valuable consideration, as
of captives taken in war; or to redeem a farm that was sold, by paying
back the price. It is sometimes used, however, to denote deliverance
from danger or bondage without specifying any price that was paid as a
ransom. Thus the deliverance of the Jews from Egyptian bondage is
sometimes spoken of as a redemption ([Exo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md); [Exo
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md); compare [Gen
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016.md); [Isa
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md); [Isa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023.md); [Jer
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#011.md); see the note at [Isa
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#027).md). It is not improbable, however,
that wherever redemption is spoken of in the Scriptures, even in the
most general manner, and as denoting deliverance from danger,
oppression, or captivity, there is still retained the idea of a ransom
in some form; a price paid; a valuable consideration; or something that
was given in the place of that which was redeemed, and which answered
the purpose of a valuable consideration, or a public reason of the
deliverance. Thus, in regard to the deliverance from Egypt - Egypt,
Ethiopia, and Seba are mentioned as the ransom (see the note at [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003).md); and so in the deliverance from
the captivity, Babylon was given in the place of the ransomed captives,
or was destroyed in order that they might be redeemed. So in all notions
of redemption; as, e. g., God destroyed the life of the great Redeemer,
or caused him to be put to death, in order that his chosen people might
be saved.

I have called thee by thy name - 'To call by name' denotes intimacy of
friendship. Here it means that God had particularly designated them to
be his people. His call had not been general, addressed to the nations
at large, but had been addressed to them in particular. Compare [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md), where God says that he had
designated 'by name' Bezaleel to the work of constructing the
tabernacle.

Thou art mine - They were his, because he had formed them as a people,
and had originated their institutions; because he had redeemed them, and
because he had particularly designated them as his. The same thing may
be said of his church now; and in a still more important sense, that
church is his. He has organized it; he has appointed its special
institutions; he has redeemed it with precious blood; and he has called
his people by name, and designated them as his own.

[Isaiah 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 43:2</span></span>

When thou passest through the waters - This is a general promise, and
means that whenever and wherever they should pass through water or fire,
he would protect them. It had been true in their past history as a
people; and the assurance is here given in order that they might be
comforted in view of the calamities which they were then suffering in
Babylon. Fire and water are often used in the Scriptures to denote
calamity - the latter because it overwhelms; the former because it
consumes; see [Psa 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md) - 'The waters
are come into my soul;' also [Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md); [Psa
124:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md); [Psa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012.md) - 'We went through fire and
through water.'

I will be with thee - (Compare the note at [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010).md).

And through the rivers - Also expressive of calamity and danger - like
attempting to ford deep and rapid streams.

They shall not overflow thee - As was the case with the Jordan when they
crossed it under the guidance of Joshua, and a pathway was made for the
armies of Israel.

When thou walkest through the fire - This is expressive of calamity and
danger in general like passing through fire. Yet it had a literal
fulfillment in the case of the three pious Jews who were cast by
Nebuchadnezzar into the burning furnace [Dan
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025.md), [Dan
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027.md).

Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee - It shall not only not consume
thee, but it shall hog even burn, or injure thee (see [Dan
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027).md). The Chaldee Paraphrase refers
this verse to the passage through the Red Sea, and to the protection
which God gave his people there. It is rendered, 'In the beginning, when
you passed through the Red Sea, my word was your aid. Pharaoh and Egypt,
who were mighty like the waters of a river, were not able to prevail
against you. And when thou didst go among a people who were formidable
like fire, they could not prevail against you, and the kingdoms which
were strong like flame could not consume you.' It is, however, to be
understood rather as a promise pertaining to the future; though the
language is mainly derived, undoubtedly, from God's protecting them in
their perils in former times.

[Isaiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 43:3</span></span>

For I am the Lord thy God - This verse continues the statement of the
reasons why he would protect them. He was Yahweh their God. He was not
only the true God, but he was the God who had entered into solemn
covenant with them, and who would therefore protect and defend them.

The Holy One of Israel - It was one of his characteristics that he was
the God of Israel. Other nations worshipped other gods. He was the God
of Israel; and as it was presumed that a god would protect his own
people, so he bound himself to deliver them.

Thy Saviour - This was another characteristic. He had saved them in days
of peril; and he had assumed toward them the relation of a Saviour; and
he would maintain that character.

I gave Egypt for thy ransom - This is a very important passage in regard
to the meaning of the word 'ransom.' The word נתתי nâthattı̂y - 'I gave'
is rendered by Gesenius (Commentary in loc.), and by Noyes, in the
future, 'I will give.' Gesenius supposes that it refers to the fact that
the countries specified would be made desolate, in order to effect the
deliverance of the Jews. He observes that although Cyrus did not conquer
them, yet that it was done by his successors. In particular, he refers
to the fact that Cambyses invaded and subdued Egypt (Herod. iii. 15);
and that he then entered into, and subdued Ethiopia and Meroe (Strabo
xvii.; Jos. Ant. ii. 10. 2). But the word properly refers to the past
time, and the scope of the passage requires us to understand it of past
events. For God is giving a reason why his people might expect
protection, and the reason here is, that he had been their deliverer,
and that his purpose to protect them was so fixed and determined, that
he had even brought ruin on nations more mighty and numerous than
themselves, in order to effect their deliverance.

The argument is, that if he had suffered Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba to be
desolated and ruined instead of them, or in order to effect their
deliverance, they had nothing to fear from Babylon or any other hostile
nation, but that he would effect their deliverance even at the expense
of the overthrow of the most mighty kingdoms. The word rendered 'ransom'
here is כפר kôpher. It is derived from כפר kâphar - whence the Latin
cooperio; the Italian coprire, the French couvrir; the Norman coverer,
and converer; and the English cover, and means literally to cover; to
cover over; to overlay with anything, as pitch, as in [Gen
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md). Hence, to cover over sins; to
overlook; to forgive; and hence, to make an expiation for sins, or to
atone for transgression so that it may be forgiven [Gen
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#021.md); [Exo
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#015.md); [Lev
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020.md); 5:26; [Lev
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md); [Lev
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006.md); [Psa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md); [Pro
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014.md); Jer. 18:25; [Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024). The noun (כפר kôpher.md) means:

1\. A village or hamlet, as beans a cover or shelter to the inhabitants
([Sa1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#018.md); compare the word כפר
kâphâr in [Ch1 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md); [Neh
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#002.md); [Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012).md).

2\. Pitch, as a material for overlaying [Gen
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014.md).

3\. The cypressflower, the alhenna of the Arabs, so called because the
powder of the leaves was used to cover over or besmear the nails in
order to produce the reddish color which Oriental femmes regarded as an
ornament (Simonis; [Sol 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md); [Sol
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#013), margin..md)

4\. A ransom; a price of redemption, or an expiation; so called because
by it sins were covered over, concealed, or removed [Exo
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036.md); [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md), [Exo
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016.md). In such an expiation, that
which was offered as the ransom was supposed to take the place of that
for which the expiation was made, and this idea is distinctly retained
in the versions of this passage.

Thus the Septuagint, Ἐποίησα ἄλλαγμά σου Αἴγυπτον, κ.τ.λ. Epoiēsa
allagma sou Aigupton, etc. - 'I made Egypt, etc., thy ἄλλαγμα allagma -
a commutation for thee; a change for thee; I put it in thy place, and it
was destroyed instead of thee.' So the Chaldee, 'I gave the Egyptians as
a commutation for thee' (חליפך chălı̂ypâk). So the Syriac, 'I gave Egypt
in thy place.' The true interpretation, therefore, is, that Egypt was
regarded as having been given up to desolation and destruction instead
of the Israelites. One of them must perish; and God chose that Egypt,
though so much more mighty and powerful, should be reduced to desolation
in order to deliver his people. They took their place, and were
destroyed instead of the Hebrews, in order that they might be delivered
from the bondage under which they groaned. This may be used as a
striking illustration of the atonement made for sin, when the Lord
Jesus, the expiatory offering, was made to suffer in the stead - ἄλλαγμα
allagma - of his people, and in order that sinners might live.

And if God's giving up the Egyptians to destruction - themselves so
guilty and deserving of death - in order to save his people, was a proof
of his love for them, how much greater is the demonstration of his love
when he gives his own holy Son to the bitter pains of death on a cross,
in order that his church may be redeemed! There has been much variety,
as has already been intimated, in the interpretation of this, and in
regard to the time and events referred to. It has, by many, been
supposed to refer to the invasion by Sennacherib, who, when he was about
to fall upon Jerusalem, turned his arms against the Egyptians and their
allies, by which means Jerusalem was saved by devoting those nations to
desolation. Vitringa explains it of Shalmaneser's design upon the
kingdom of Judah, after he had destroyed that of Samaria, from which he
was diverted by carrying the war against the Egyptians, Cusheans, and
Sabeans. But of this, Lowth says, there is no clear proof in history.

Seeker supposes that it refers to the fact that Cyrus overcame those
nations, and that they were given him for releasing the Jews. Lowth
says, 'perhaps it may mean, generally, that God had often saved his
people at the expense of other nations, whom he had as it were in their
stead given up to destruction.' The exact historical facts in the case
cannot be clearly made out; nor is this to be wondered at, that many
things of this nature should remain obscure for want of the light of
history, which in regard to those times is extremely deficient. In
regard to Egypt, however, I think the case is clear. Nothing is more
manifest than that the prophet refers to that great and wonderful fact -
the commonplace illustration of the sacred writers - that the Egyptians
were destroyed in order to effect the deliverance of the Jews, and were
thus given as a ransom for them.

Ethiopia - Hebrew, 'Cush.' In regard to this country, see the note at
[Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md). It is not improbable that
the prophet here refers to the facts referred to in that chapter, and
the destruction which it is there said would come upon that land.

And Seba - This was the name of a people descended from Cush [Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md); and hence, the name of the
country which they occupied. According to Josephus (Ant. ii. 10. 2), it
seems to have been Meroe, a province of Ethiopia, distinguished for its
wealth and commerce, surrounded by the two arms or branches of the Nile.
There still remain the ruins of a metropolis of the same name, not far
from the town of Shandy (Keppel's Travels in Nubia and Arabia, 1829).
Meroe is a great island or peninsula in the north of Ethiopia, and is
formed by the Nile, and the Astaboras, which unites with the Nile. It
was probably anciently called Seba, and was conquered by Cambyses, the
successor of Cyrus, and by him called Meroe, after his sister. That it
was near to Ethiopia is apparent from the fact that it is mentioned in
connection with it (compare [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md); [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014) : Herod. iii. 20.md). They would
naturally ally themselves to the Ethiopians. and share the same fate.

[Isaiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 43:4</span></span>

Since thou wast precious in my sight - This verse contains another
reason why God would defend and deliver them. That reason was, that he
had loved them as his people; and he was willing, therefore, that other
people should be overcome in order that they might be saved.

Thou hast been honorable - This does not refer so much to their personal
character, as to the fact that they had been honored by him with being
the depository of the precious truths of his religion. It means that he
had made them honorable by the favors bestowed on them; not that they
were honorable in reference to their own personal character and worth.

Therefore will I give men for thee - As in the case of Egypt, Ethiopia,
and Seba [Isa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md). He would cause
other nations to be destroyed, if it were necessary, in order to effect
their deliverance, and to restore them to their own land. We learn here:

1\. That nations and armies are in the hand of God, and at his disposal.

2\. That his people are dear to his heart, and that it is his purpose to
defend them.

3\. That the revolutions among nations, the rise of one empire, and the
fall of another, are often in order to promote the welfare of his
church, to defend it in danger, and deliver it in time of calamity.

4\. That his people should put the utmost confidence in God as being
able to defend them, and as having formed a purpose to preserve and save
them.

Expressions similar to those used in this verse occur frequently among
the Arabians (see Rosenmuller in loc).

For thy life - Margin, 'Person.' Hebrew, 'For thy soul;' that is, on
account of thee; or in thy place (see the notes at [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 43:5</span></span>

Fear not - (see the note at [Isa
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md), [Isa
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md); compare [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

I will bring thy seed - Thy children; thy descendants. The sense is, I
will re-collect my scattered people from all parts of the world. The
passage appears to have been taken from [Deu
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md), where God promises to gather his
people together again if they should be scattered among the nations, and
should then repent. Vitringa understands this of the spiritual
descendants of the Jews, or of those who should believe on the Messiah
among the Gentiles, and who should become the people of God. But the
more natural interpretation is, to refer it to the Jews who were
scattered abroad during the exile at Babylon, and as a promise to
re-collect them again in their own land.

From the east ... - From all parts of the earth; from all lands where
they were scattered. That they were driven to other places than Babylon
on the invasion of their land by the Chaldeans, is abundantly manifest
in the historical records [Jer 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016.md);
[Eze 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md); [Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021.md); [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md); [Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 43:6</span></span>

I will say to the north, Give up - Give up my people, or restore them to
their own land.

Bring my sons ... - Bring all my people from the distant lands where
they have been driven in their dispersion. This is a beautiful passage.
As if all lands were under the control of God, and he could at once
command and they would obey, he calls on them to yield up his people to
their own country. He issues a commandment which is heard in all
quarters of the globe, and the scattered people of God come flocking
again to their own land.

[Isaiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 43:7</span></span>

Every one that is called by my name - To be called by the name of
anyone, is synonymous with being regarded as his son, since a son bears
the name of his father (see [Isa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md);
[Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001).md). The expression, therefore,
means here, all who were regarded as the children of God; and the
promise is, that all such should be re-gathered to their own land.

For I have created him - (See the note at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

For my glory - In order to show forth, and illustrate my glory. They
shall be, therefore, defended and protected; and my glory shall be shown
in their recovery and salvation.

[Isaiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 43:8</span></span>

Bring forth the blind people - Many have understood this of the Jews. So
Vitringa, Rosenmuller, Grotius, and others understand it. But Lowth,
more correctly, regards it as referring to the Gentiles. It is designed
as an argument to show the superiority of God over all idols, and to
demonstrate that he was able to deliver his people from captivity and
exile. He appeals, therefore [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md), to his own people in proof of
his divinity and power. None of the pagan [Isa
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md) had been able to predict future
events, none of the pagan gods, therefore, could save; but Yahweh, who
had so often foretold events that were fulfilled, was able to deliver,
and of that fact his own people had had abundant evidence.

That have eyes - They had natural faculties to see and know God (compare
[Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md), but they had not improved
them, and they had, therefore, run into the sin and folly of idolatry.
The phrase 'bring forth,' implies a solemn appeal made by God to them to
enter into an argument on the subject (compare the note at [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 43:9</span></span>

Let all the nations be gathered together - Let them be assembled to give
evidence, or to adduce proofs that their idols are worthy of confidence
[Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md).

Who among them can declare this? - Who among them hath predicted this
state of things? Who has foretold the events which are now occurring? It
is implied here, that Yahweh had done this, but none of the pagan gods
had done it (see the note at [Isa
41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021).md).

And show us former things - (see the note at [Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022).md). The order of events, the
manner in which one event shall succeed another. Not merely, who can
declare one single event, but who can declare the succession, the order
in which many events shall follow each other - a far more difficult
thing than to declare one single future event. Neither had been done by
the pagan; both had been done by God.

That they may be justified - That it may be demonstrated that they are
what they pretend to be, and that they are worthy of the confidence of
people. The word 'justified' here, is used in the sense of being right,
or true; - let them in this manner show that their claims are just, and
well founded.

Or let them hear, and say, It is truth - (See the note at [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 43:10</span></span>

Ye are my witnesses - They were his witnesses, because, first, he had
given in them predictions of future events which had been literally
fulfilled: secondly, by his power of delivering them so often
manifested, he had shown that he was a God able to save. Neither of
these had been done by the idol-gods (compare [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md).

And believe me - Or rather, confide in me.

Before me there was no God formed - I am the only true, the eternal God.
In this expression, Yahweh says that he was the first being. He derived
his existence from no one. Perhaps the Hebrew will bear a little more
emphasis than is conveyed by our translation. 'Before me, God was not
formed,' implying that he was God, and that he existed anterior to all
other beings. It was an opinion among the Greeks, that the same gods had
not always reigned, but that the more ancient divinities had been
expelled by the more modern. It is possible that some such opinion may
have prevailed in the oriental idolatry, and that God here means to say,
in opposition to that, that he had not succeeded any other God in his
kingdom. His dominion was original, underived, and independent.

Neither shall there be after me - He would never cease to live; he would
never vacate his throne for another. This expression is equivalent to
that which occurs in the Book of Revelation, 'I am Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last' [Rev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011.md); and it
is remarkable that this language, which obviously implies eternity, and
which in Isaiah is used expressly to prove the divinity of Yahweh, is,
in the passage referred to in the Book of Revelation, applied no less
unequivocally to the Lord Jesus Christ.

[Isaiah 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 43:11</span></span>

I, even I, am the Lord - The repetition of the pronoun 'I' makes it
emphatic. The design is, to affirm that there was no other being to whom
the name 'Yahweh' pertained. There was no other one who had the
attributes which the name involved; there was, therefore, no other God.
On the meanins of the word Yahweh, see the note at [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md).

And beside me there is no Saviour - There is no one who can deliver from
oppression, and captivity, and exile, such as the Jews suffered in
Babylon; there is no one but he who can save from sin, and from hell.
All salvation, therefore, must come from God; and if we obtain
deliverance from temporal ills, or from eternal death, we must seek it
from him.

[Isaiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 43:12</span></span>

I have declared - I have announced or predicted future events; I have
warned of danger; I have marked out the path of safety. He had thus
shown that he was the true God (see the note at [Isa
41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022).md).

And have saved - I have delivered the nation in former times of danger,
and have thus shown that I would protect them.

And have showed - Hebrew, 'Caused to hear.' I have made known future
events, and have thus showed that I was God.

When there was no strange god among you - Before the time when there was
any idol in the nation, and when, therefore, it could not be pretended
that deliverance was to be traced to anyone but to Yahweh. The word
'god' here is not in the original, but is properly supplied. The word זר
zâr is evidently used instead of זר אל 'êl zâr, as in [Psa
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#020.md); [Psa
81:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#009.md). It denotes a god that is
worshipped by foreigners. The sense is, that their former deliverance
could in no sense be traced to any such foreign god.

Therefore, ye are my witnesses - You who have so often been defended;
you who have the predictions respecting future events, can be appealed
to as evidence that I am the only true God, able to deliver. The
doctrine taught in this passage is, that God may appeal to his dealings
with his people as a demonstration that he is the true God, and that he
is faithful and able to deliver - an appeal which may be made to his
church at large in view of its trials, persecutions, and deliverances;
and to every one who is his true friend and worshipper.

[Isaiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 43:13</span></span>

Yea, before the day was - Before the first day, or before the beginning
of time; from eternity. The Septuagint renders it correctly, Ἀπ ̓ ἀρχης
Ap' archēs, and the Vulgate (Ab initio), 'From the beginning.'

I am he - I am the same [Isa 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md).

I will work - I will accomplish my designs.

And who shall let it? - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Turn it back.' The meaning
is, 'Who can hinder it?' And the doctrine taught here is:

1\. That God is from everlasting, for if he was before time, he must
have been eternal.

2\. That he is unchangeably the same - a doctrine which is, as it is
here designed to be used, the only sure foundation for the security of
his people - for who can trust a being who is fickle, changing,
vacillating?

3\. That he can deliver his people always, no matter what are their
circumstances.

4\. That he will accomplish all his plans; no matter whether to save his
people, or to destroy his foes.

5\. That no one - man or devil - can hinder him. How can the feeble arm
of a creature resist God?

6\. That opposition to him is as fruitless as it is wicked. If people
wish for happiness, they must fall in with his plans, and aid in the
furtherance of his designs.

[Isaiah 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 43:14</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord your Redeemer - This verse commences another
argument for the safety of his people. It is the assurance to the Jews
in Babylon that he had sent to them a deliverer, and would bring down
the pride of the Chaldeans, and demolish their city.

Your Redeemer - (See the note at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

I have sent to Babylon - That is, the Persians and Medes, under the
command of Cyrus (compare the note at [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md). This implies that God had
command over all their armies and had the power of sending them where he
pleased (compare the notes at [Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md). This is to be understood as
seen by the prophet in vision. He sees the armies of Cyrus encompass
Babylon and the haughty city fall, and then says that God had sent or
directed them there.

And have brought down all their nobles - Margin, 'Bars.' But the word in
this place probably means neither, but rather fugitives (compare the
notes at [Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md). The word used
(בריח bârı̂yach), means sometimes bar, cross-bar, that which passed from
one side of the tabernacle to the other through rings, in order to carry
it; thou a harbor bolt of any kind [Jdg
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#003.md); [Neh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#003.md). But the word may also denote one
who flies; a fugitive; and is properly used in that sense here. The verb
ברח bârach, from which the word is derived, means often to break away,
to flee [Gen 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#008.md); [Gen
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md), [Gen
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md); [Sa1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#012.md); [Job
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022.md); [Jon
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md). Here it means those who
endeavored to escape from the impending calamity and destruction; or it
may refer to those who had taken refuge in Babylon from other lands, as
Babylon was doubtless composed in part of those who had sought a refuge
there from other nations - a conflux of strangers. But the former is the
more probable interpretation; and the idea seems to be, that Yahweh had
brought them down to their ships, or had led them to take refuge in
their ships from the impending judgments. Jerome, however, understands
it of removing the strong bars with which the prisoners of the exile
Jews were protected, so that they would be permitted to go forth in
peace and safety. Lowth renders it, 'I will bring down all her strong
bars.' The Septuagint renders it, φεύγοντες πάντας pheugontes pantas -
'All that fly.' So the Syriac.

And the Chaldeans - The inhabitants of Babylon.

Whose cry is in the ships - Lowth renders this, 'Exulting in their
ships.' Noyes, 'Ships of their delight.' The Vulgate, 'Glorying in their
ships.' The Septuagint, 'The Chaldeans shall be bound (δεθήσονται
dethēsontai) in ships.' The Syriac, 'Who glory in their ships.' The
sense is, probably, that the Chaldeans, when their city was taken, would
seek to take refuge in their ships in which they would raise a shout
(Rosenmuller). Or it may be, as Lowth supposes, that it was one of the
characteristics of the Chaldeans, that they boasted of their ships, and
of their commerce. Babylon was, as he remarks, favorably situated to be
a commercial and naval power. It was on the large river Euphrates, and
hence, had access to the Persian Gulf and the ocean; and there can be no
doubt that it was engaged, in the height of its power, in commercial
enterprises. On the north of the city, the Euphrates was united to the
Tigris by the canal called Nahar Malca or the Royal River, and thus a
large part of the produce of the northern countries, as far as the
Euxine and Caspian seas, naturally descended to Babylon (Herod. i. 194).

Semiramis, the founder of Babylon, is said to have had a fleet of three
thousand galleys. After the taking of the city by Cyrus, we hear indeed
little of the commerce of Babylon. The Euphrates was diverted from its
course, and spread over the adjacent country; and the Persian monarchs,
in order to prevent the danger of invasion from that quarter, purposely
obstructed the navigation, by making dams across both the Tigris and the
Euphrates (Strabo xvi.) It is not to be deemed remarkable, therefore,
that, in the times of its prosperity, the city of Babylon should be
noted for its commerce; or as a city exulting in its shipping, or
raising the sailor's cry - a cry such as is heard in any port now where
shipping abounds. The word rendered 'cry' (רנה rinnâh) denotes properly
a shout of rejoicing or joy [Kg1
22:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#036.md); [Psa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#006.md); [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md); and then also a mournful cry, an
outcry, wailing [Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md); [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md). Here it may mean the joyful cry
of commerce; the shout of the mariner as he leaves the port, or as he
returns to his home - the shout, the clamor, which is heard at the
wharfs of a commercial city. Such a cry is alluded to by Virgil in the
naval games which AEneas celebrated:

\- ferit athera clamor

Nauticus.

AEneid, v. 140, 1.

The sense here is, that God had sent to bring down that exulting city,
and to destroy all the indications of its commercial importance and
prosperity.

[Isaiah 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 43:15</span></span>

I am the Lord - I am Yahweh - proved to be such, as the connection
demands that we should interpret this, by sending to Babylon and
bringing down your oppressors. This interposition in destroying Babylon
would be a demonstration that he was Yahweh, the only true God, and
their God.

The Creator of Israel - (See the note at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

Your King - Ruling over you, and showing the right to do it by
delivering you from your foes.

[Isaiah 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 43:16</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - This verse contains a reference to the deliverance
from Egyptian servitude - the great storehouse of argument and
illustration with the sacred writers; the standing demonstration of
God's merciful interposition in behalf of their nation, and proof that
he was their God.

Which maketh - Whose characteristic it is to open a path of safety for
his people even when deep and rapid floods are before them The standing
roof of this which undoubtedly the prophet had in his eye, was the
deliverance from Egypt. Still, I think, he did not mean to refer to that
alone, but to that as an illustration of what God was, and had ever been
to his people.

A way in the sea - Referring to the path made through the waters of the
Red Sea when the children of Israel were permitted to go on dry ground.

[Isaiah 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 43:17</span></span>

Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse - The reference here is,
undoubtedly, to the occurrences which are recorded in [Exo
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004.md), following, when Pharaoh and his
host are said to have followed the Israelites, but were all submerged in
the sea. God is said to have brought them forth in accordance with the
general statement so often made, that he controls and directs princes
and nations (see the note at [Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

They shall lie down together - They shall sink together to death, as
Pharaoh and his army sunk together in a watery grave.

Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:

They sank as lead in the mighty waters.

[Exo 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md)

The depths have covered them:

They sank into the bottom as a stone.

[Exo 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#005.md)

They are extinct - They are destroyed, as the wick of a lamp is quenched
suddenly when immersed in water. This is a striking figure, to denote
the suddenness with which it was done, and the completeness of their
destruction. As a flame is entirely put out when plunged beneath the
water, so the whole host of the Egyptians were suddenly and completely
destroyed in the Red Sea. The sentiment in this verse is, that God has
power over the nations to control them; that it is one of his
characteristics to lead on the enemies of his people to destruction; and
that they are suddenly destroyed, and their hopes, and joys, and
triumphs put out forever. If it was so in regard to the Egyptians, it
will be also in regard to all his foes. And if this took place in regard
to a nation, it shall also in regard to individual sinners who oppose
themselves to God.

How oft is the candle of time wicked put out?

And how oft cometh their destruction upon them?

God distributeth sorrows in his anger.

They are as stubble before the wind,

And as chaff that the storm carrieth away.

[Job 21:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md)

[Isaiah 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 43:18</span></span>

Remember ye not ... - So great and wonderful shall be God's future
interpositions in your behalf, that what he has done, great as that was,
shall be comparatively forgotten.

The former things - The deliverance from Egypt, and the overthrow of his
enemies there.

The things of old - The things that were formerly done.

[Isaiah 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 43:19</span></span>

I will do a new thing - Something that has not hitherto occurred, some
unheard of and wonderful event, that shall far surpass all that he had
formerly done (see the note at [Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md).

Now it shall spring forth - (See the note at [Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md). It shall spring up as the grass
does from the earth; or it shall bud forth like the opening leaves and
flowers - a beautiful figure, denoting the manner in which the events of
Divine Providence come to pass.

I will even make a way in the wilderness - In this part of the verse,
the prophet describes the anxious care which God would show in
protecting his people, and providing for them in conducting them to
their native land. See the expressions fully explained in the notes at
[Isa 41:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md).

[Isaiah 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 43:20</span></span>

The beast of the field shall honor me - The sense of this passage is
plain, and the image is highly poetical and beautiful. God would pour
such copious floods of waters through the waste sandy deserts to supply
his people, that even the wild beasts would be sensible of his abundant
goodness, and would break forth into thanksgiving and praise for the
unusual supply.

The dragons - (See the note at [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md). The Septuagint renders the
word used here (תנין tannı̂yn), by σειρῆνες seirēnes - 'sirens' - among
the ancients a marine monster that was fabled to use sweet and alluring
tones of music. It is probable, however, that the Septuagint understood
here some species of wild-fowl which responded to one another. The
Syriac translator here interprets it as denoting some wild animal of the
canine species - a wood-dog.

And the owls - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Daughters of the owl, or ostrich'
(see the note at [Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 43:21</span></span>

This people have I formed for myself - To preserve the remembrance of my
name; to transmit the knowledge of the true God to future times, and to
celebrate my praise (see the notes at [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

They shall show forth my praise - They shall celebrate my goodness; or,
by their restoration to their own land, they shall show manifestly that
they are my people.

[Isaiah 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 43:22</span></span>

But thou hast not called upon me - The design of this and the following
verses, is to show them that they were indebted to the divine mercy
alone for their deliverance from bondage. It was not because they had
been either meritorious or faithful; it was not because they had
deserved these favors at his hand, for they had been a people that had
been distinguished for neglecting their God. On that account, these
calamities had come upon them, and their deliverance, therefore, was to
be an act of mere unmerited favor.

Thou hast been weary - As a people, you have been weary of my service.
They had accounted his laws grievous and oppressive; and they had
groaned under what they regarded as burdensome rites and ceremonies (see
[Amo 8:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md); [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013).md). God here refers, doubtless, to
the times before the captivity, and is stating what was the general
characteristic of the people.

[Isaiah 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 43:23</span></span>

Thou hast not brought me - As a people you have witcheld from me the
sacrifices which were commanded. They had not maintained and observed
his worship as he had required.

The small cattle - Margin, 'Lambs,' or 'kids.' The Hebrew word (שׂה
s'eh) denotes properly one of a flock - a sheep or a goat. It should
have been so rendered here. These animals were used for burnt-offerings,
and the Jews were required to offer them daily to God.

Of thy burnt-offerings - (Compare [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003).md). The burnt-offering was wholly
consumed on the altar.

With thy sacrifices - Bloody offerings. There is little difference
between this word and that rendered 'burnt-offerings.' If there is any,
it is that the word rendered 'sacrifice' (זבח zebach) is of wider
signification, and expresses sacrifice in general; the word rendered
'burnt-offering' (עלה ‛olâh), denotes that which is consumed, or which
ascends as an offering. The holocaust refers to its being burned; the
sacrifice to the offering, however made.

I have not caused thee to serve with an offering - 'I have not made a
slave of thee; I have not exacted such a service as would be oppressive
and intolerable - such as is imposed on a slave.' The word used here
(עבד ‛âbad), is often used in such a sense, and with such a reference
[Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md); 'Thou shalt not compel him
to serve the service of a bondman' [Exo
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md); [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md); [Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md); [Jer
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md). The sense is, that the laws of
God on the subject, were not grievous and oppressive.

With an offering - The word used here (מנחה minchāh) denotes properly a
bloodless oblation, and is thus distinguished from those mentioned
before. It consisted of flour mingled with salt, oil, and incense; or of
the fruits of the earth, etc. (see the notes at [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); compare [Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md); [Num
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#005.md).

Nor wearied thee - By exacting incense. I have not so exacted it as to
make it burdensome and wearisome to you.

With incense - (See the note at [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013).md). The word לבונה lebônâh (Greek
λίβανος libanos) denotes properly frankincense, a substance so called
from its white color, from לבן lāban, "to be white." It is found in
Arabia [Isa 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md), and in Palestine [Sol
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#006.md), [Sol
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#014.md), and was obtained by making
incisions in the bark of trees. It was much used in worship among the
Jews as well as by other nations. It was burned in order to produce an
agreeable fragrance [Exo 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008.md); [Exo
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#029.md); [Lev

[Isaiah 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 43:24</span></span>

Thou hast bought me - You have not purchased this - implying that it was
not produced in Palestine, but was an article of commerce. It was to be
obtained only from abroad. This is expressly affirmed in [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md) : 'To what purpose cometh there
to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from afar country?' That it
was an article of commerce is also apparent from [Eze
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#019.md) : 'Dan also and Javan going to
and fro occupied in thy fairs (that is, Tyre): bright iron, cassia, and
calamus (קנה qâneh), were in thy market.'

Sweet cane - The word used here (קנה qâneh), denotes properly "cane,
reed, calamus" (Greek κάννα kanna and κάννη kannē, Latin canna, whence
the English, cane; French, canne; Italian, canna). It usually refers to
a reed growing in wet or marshy ground. It denotes also sweet cane,
calamus aromaticus. It is sometimes joined with the word בשׂם bôs'em,
aromatic, odor, fragrance, spice, as in [Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md); see also [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020). According to Pliny (xii. 22.md) it
grew in Arabia, Syria, and India; according to Theophrastus, in the
vales of Lebanon (Hist. Plant. ix. 7). It was used among the Hebrews in
compounding the sacred perfumes [Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md). It is a knotty root, of a
reddish color, and contains a soft white pith - in resemblance probably
not unlike the calamus so well known in this country. Strabo and
Diodorus Siculus say that it grew in Saba. Hasselquist says that it is
common in the deserts of the two Arabias. It is gathered near Jumbo, a
port town of Arabia Petrea, from where it is brought into Egypt. The
Venetians purchase it, and use it in the composition of their
'theriaca.' It is much esteemed among the Arabs on account of its
fragrance. See Calmet (Art. Cane), and Gesenius (Lex. and Commentary in
loc). It was not probably used in the worship of God anywhere except
among the Hebrews. The pagans made use of incense, but I do not know
that they used the calamus.

Neither hast thou filled me - Margin, 'Made me drunk,' or 'abundantly
moistened.' The word used here (רוה râvâh), means properly "to drink to
the full, to be satisfied, sated with drink." See it explained in the
notes at [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md). It is applied to
water which is drank, or to fat which is sucked in or drank rather than
eaten [Psa 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md); or to a sword as
drinking up blood. Here it means to satiate, or to satisfy. They had not
offered the fat of sacrifices so as to satiate God. Probably this
passage does not mean that the Jews had wholly neglected the public
worship of God; they had not worshipped him with a proper spirit, and
had thus served him with their sins, and wearied him with their
transgressions. It is true, also, that while they were abundant in
external rites and ceremonies, they frequently made oblations to idols,
rather than to the true God. Perhaps, therefore, an emphasis is to be
placed on the word 'me' in this passage, meaning, that however diligent
and regular they had been in the performance of the external rites and
duties of religion, yet that God had been neglected.

Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins - You have made it oppressive,
burdensome, wearisome for me, like the hard and onerous service of a
slave (see the note at [Isa 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md);
compare the note at [Isa 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 43:25</span></span>

I, even I, am he - This verse contains a gracious assurance that their
sins would be blotted out, and the reason why it would be done. The
pronoun 'I' is repeated to make it emphatic, as in [Isa
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011.md). Perhaps also God designs to
show them the evil of the sins which are mentioned in the previous
verses, by the assurance that they were committed against him who alone
could forgive, and who had promised them pardon. The passage also
reminds them, that it was God alone who could pardon the sins of which,
as a nation, they had been guilty.

That blotteth out thy transgressions - This metaphor is taken from the
custom of keeping accounts, where, when a debt is paid, the charge is
blotted or cancelled. Thus God says he blotted out the sins of the Jews.
He cancelled them. He forgave them. Of course, when forgiven, punishment
could not be exacted, and he would treat them as pardoned; that is, as
his friends.

For mine own sake - Not because you deserve it, or have any claim, or
that it would not be right to punish you. Not even primarily to promote
your happiness and salvation, but for my sake;

1\. To show the benevolence of my character;

2\. To promote my glory by your forgiveness and salvation (see [Eze
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022).md).

And will not remember thy sins - They shall be forgiven. Hezekiah [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md) expresses the same idea by
saying 'thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.' We may learn from
this verse:

1\. That it is God only who can pardon sin. How vain, then, is it for
man to attempt it! How wicked for man to claim the prerogative! And yet
it is an essential part of the papal system that the Pope and his
priests have the power of remitting the penalty of transgression.

2\. That this is done by God solely for his own sake. It is not

\(a\) because we have any claim to it, for then it would not be pardon,
but justice. It is not

\(b\) because we have any power to compel God to forgive, for who can
contend with him, and how could mere power procure pardon? It is not

\(c\) because we have any merit, for then also it would be justice, and
we have no merit. Nor is it

\(d\) primarily in order that we may be happy, for our happiness is a
matter not worthy to be named, compared with the honor of God. But it is
solely for his own sake - to promote his glory - to show his perfections
- to evince the greatness of his mercy and compassion - and to show his
boundless and eternal love.

3\. They who are pardoned should live to his glory, and not to
themselves. For that they were forgiven, and it should be the grand
purpose of their lives so to live as to show forth the goodness,
compassion, and love of that merciful Being who has blotted out their
sins.

4\. If people are ever pardoned, they must come to God - and to God
alone. They must come, not to justify themselves, but to confess their
crimes. And they must come with a willingness that God should pardon
them on just such terms as he pleases; at just such a time as he
pleases; and solely with a view to the promotion of his own glory.
Unless they have this feeling, they never can be forgiven, nor should
they be forgiven.

[Isaiah 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 43:26</span></span>

Put me in remembrance - That is, urge all the arguments in your own
defense which you can urge. State everything in self-vindication which
can be stated. The language here is taken from the practice of courts
when a cause is on trial; and God urges them on their side, to urge all
in self-vindication which they can urge. On his part, he alleged that
the princes and rulers of the nation had sinned [Isa
43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md); that the whole nation had
transgressed [Isa 43:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md), and that
for this they were justly punished [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028.md). He here urges them to advance
all in self-defense which they could - if they could pretend that He had
forgotten anything; that they had merits which he had not considered; or
that he had charged them with crime with undue severity.

Let us plead together - Hebrew, 'Let us be judged together' (see the
note at [Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001).md).

Declare thou, that thou mayest be justified - That you may show that you
are just, or righteous; that you may demonstrate that you are unjustly
accused of crime, and punished with undue severity.

[Isaiah 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 43:27</span></span>

Thy first father hath sinned - This is the argument on the side of God,
to show that they were neither unjustly punished, nor punished with
undue severity. The argument is, that their rulers and teachers had been
guilty of crime, and that therefore it was right to bring all this
vengeance upon the nation. Various interpretations have been given of
the phrase 'thy first father.' A slight notice of them will lead to the
correct exposition.

1\. Many have supposed that Adam is referred to here. Thus Piscator,
Calovius, and most of the fathers, understand it; and, among the Jews,
Kimchi. But the objections to this are plain:

\(a\) Adam was not peculiarly the first father or ancestor of the Jews,
but of the whole human race.

\(b\) The Jews never boasted, or gloried in him as the founder of their
nation, but they always referred to Abraham under this appellation [Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md); [Joh
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md), [Joh
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md).

\(c\) It would have been irrelevant to the design of the prophet to have
referred to the sin of Adam in this case. God was vindicating his own
cause and conduct in destroying their capital and temple, and in sending
them as captives to a distant land. How would it prove that he was right
in this, to say that Adam was a transgressor? How would it demonstrate
his justice in these special inflictions of his anger to refer to the
apostasy of the ancestor of the whole human race?

2\. Others refer it to Abraham. This was the sentiment of Jerome, and of
some others; and by those who maintain this opinion, it is supposed to
refer to his doubting the truth of the promise [Gen
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md); or to the denial of his wife,
and his sin in inducing her to say that she was his sister [Gen
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#011.md); [Gen
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md); or to the fact that when young
he was an idolater. But the obvious objection to this is, that Abraham
is everywhere in the Scriptures proposed as an example of one eminently
devoted to God; nor could it be said that these calamities had come upon
them in consequence of his unfaithfulness, and his sins.

3\. Others refer it to the rulers and princes individually. Thus Grotius
refers it to Manasseh; Aben Ezra to Jeroboam, etc.

4\. Others, as Vitringa, refer it to the high priest, and particularly
to Uriah, who lived in the time of Ahaz, and particularly to the fact,
that, in obedience to the command of Ahaz, he constructed an altar in
Jerusalem like the one which he had seen and admired in Damascus [Kg2
16:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md). The objection to this
interpretation is, that no reason can be given for selecting this
particular act from a number of similar abominations on the part of the
priests and rulers, as the cause of the national calamities. It was only
one instance out of many of the crimes which brought the national
judgments upon them.

5\. Others, as Gesenius, suppose that the word is to be taken
collectively, not as referring to any particular individual, but to the
high priests in general. It is not uncommon to give the name 'father'
thus to a principal man among a people, and especially to one eminent in
religious authority. The word 'first' here does not refer to time, but
to rank; not the ancestor of the people, but the one having
appropriately the title of father, who had the priority also in rank.
The Septuagint renders it, Οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν πρῶτοι Hoi pateres humōn
prōtoi. It refers therefore, probably, to the character of the presiding
officers in religion, and means that the priests, supreme in rank, and
whose example was so important, had sinned; that there was irreligion at
the very foundation of influence and authority; and that therefore it
was necessary to bring these heavy judgments on the nation. No one
acquainted with the history of the Jewish people in the times
immediately preceding the captivity, can doubt that this was the
character of the high priesthood.

(Gesenius and some others give the words a collective sense, as
signifying either the succession of priests or ancestors in general. The
interpretation which understands the phrase of Abraham, is supposed by
some to be at variance with the uniform mention of that patriarch in
terms of commendation. But these terms are perfectly consistent with the
proposition that he was a sinner, which may here be the exact sense of
חטא châṭâ'. To the application of the phrase to Adam, it has been
objected, that he was not peculiarly the father of the Jews. To this it
may be answered, that if the guilt of the national progenitor would
prove the point in question, much more would it be established by the
fact of their belonging to a guilty race. At the same time it may be
considered as implied, that all their fathers, who had since lived,
shared in the original depravity; and thus the same sense is obtained
that would have been expressed by the collective explanation of first
father, while the latter is still taken in its strict and full sense, as
denoting the progenitor of all mankind. - Alexander)

And thy teachers - Margin, 'Interpreters.' The word used here (מלציך
melı̂ytseykā) is derived from לוץ lûts. This word means to stammer, to
speak unintelligibly; and then to speak in a foreign and barbarous
language, and then to interpret, from the idea of speaking a foreign
tongue. Hence, it may be used in the sense of an internuncius, or a
messenger ([Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md); compare the
notes at [Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md). That it refers
here to the priests, there can be no doubt, and is properly applied to
them because they sustained the office of interpreting his will to the
people, and generally of acting as internuncii or messengers between God
and them. The Septuagint renders it, " Ἄρχοντρς Archontes - 'Rulers.'

[Isaiah 43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 43:28</span></span>

Therefore I have profaned - The princes of the sanctuary, that is, the
priests, were by their office regarded as sacred, or set apart to the
service of God. To depose them from that office, to subject them to
punishment, and to send them into captivity, was, therefore, regarded as
profaning them. They were stripped of their office, and robes, and
honors, and reduced to the same condition, and compelled to meet with
the same treatment, as the common people. The sense is, that he had made
them common (for so the word חלל châlal is used in [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014.md); [Exo
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022.md); [Lev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#008.md); [Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md); [Mal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012.md); [Mal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002).md); he did not regard their office;
he used them all alike.

The princes of the sanctuary - Margin, 'Holy princes.' It means, either
those who presided over and directed the services of the sanctuary,
called in [Ch1 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005.md), 'governors of the
sanctuary;' or those who were holy in office. The Septuagint renders it,
Οἱ ἄρχοντες τὰ ἅγια μον Hoi archontes ta hagia mou - 'Who preside over
my holy things,' or my sanctuary. Vulgate, Principes sanctos - 'Holy
princes.' The Syriac, 'Thy princes have profaned the sanctuary.' The
sense is, that God had disregarded the official character of those who
were set apart to the sacred office, and had punished them in common
with the people at large for their sins.

And have given Jacob to the curse - The Septuagint renders it, 'I have
given Jacob to be destroyed' (ἀπωλέσαι apōlesai). The Hebrew word here
(חרם chērem), is that which is commonly used to denote a solemn
anathema, excommunication, or devotion to destruction (see the note at
[Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005).md).

To reproaches - The reproach, contempt, and scorn which they met with in
their captivity, and in a land of strangers (compare [Psa
137:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003).md).

Thus far God states the reasons why he had punished the nation. It had
been on account of the national irreligion and sins, and the destruction
had come upon all, but pre-eminently on the priests and the rulers. In
the arbitrary division which is made in the Bible into chapters, a very
improper separation has been made by making the chapter close here. The
sense of the whole passage is materially injured by this division, and
the scope of the whole argument is forgotten. The design of the entire
argument is, to show that God would not leave his people; that though he
punished them, he would not utterly destroy them; and that he would
appear again for their rescue, and restore them to their own land. This
argument is prosecuted in the following chapter; and in the commencement
of that chapter the thought is pursued, that though God had thus
punished them, yet he would appear and save them. The beginning of that
chapter is properly the continuation and completion of the argument
urged here, and this chapter should have closed at what is now [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md).
