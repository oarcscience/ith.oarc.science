*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 10:1</span></span>

See the Introduction.

[Proverbs 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 10:2</span></span>

Righteousness - Including, perhaps, the idea of benevolence. Compare the
use of δικαιοσύνη dikaiosunē, in [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001) (the older reading.md), and [Co2
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009.md).

[Proverbs 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 10:3</span></span>

Casteth away ... - Better, "overturns, disappoints the strong desire of
the wicked." Tantalus-like, they never get the enjoyment they thirst
after.

[Proverbs 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 10:4</span></span>

Slack - The word is elsewhere translated as "deceitful" [Job
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007.md); [Psa
120:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002.md); [Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md); [Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md). The two thoughts run easily
into each other.

[Proverbs 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 10:5</span></span>

The son is called upon to enter upon the labors of others, and reap
where they have sown. To sleep when the plenteous harvest lies ready for
the sickle is the most extreme laziness.

[Proverbs 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 10:6</span></span>

Covereth ... - The meaning is perhaps, the violence which the wicked has
done is as a bandage over his mouth, reducing him to a silence and
shame, like that of the leper [Lev
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md); [Mic
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007.md) or the condemned criminal [Est
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008.md), whose "face is covered."

[Proverbs 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 10:8</span></span>

A prating ... fall - Better, as in the margin. Inward self-contained
wisdom is contrasted with self-exposed folly.

[Proverbs 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 10:9</span></span>

Shall be known - literally, "shall be made to know" (see [Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md); [Jdg
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#016) margin.md) in the sense of exposed.

[Proverbs 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 10:10</span></span>

In [Pro 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md) the relation between the
two clauses was one of contrast, here of resemblance. Cunning,
reticence, and deceit ([Pro 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012) note.md)
bring sorrow no less than garrulity.

[Proverbs 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 10:11</span></span>

Compare [Pro 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md). Streams of living
water (like the "fountain of living waters" of [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md); [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md), and the "living water" of [Joh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010).md), flow from the mouth of the
righteous, but that of the wicked is "covered," i. e., stopped and put
to silence by their own violence.

[Proverbs 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 10:12</span></span>

Love covereth all sins - i. e., First hides, does not expose, and then
forgives and forgets all sins.

[Proverbs 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 10:13</span></span>

i\. e., The wisdom of the wise is seen in the words that issue from his
lips; the folly of the fool is not only seen in his speech, but brings
upon him the chastisement which he well deserves.

[Proverbs 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 10:14</span></span>

Lay up - The point of the maxim is that the wise man reserves what he
has to say for the right time, place, and persons (compare [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).md), as contrasted with the foolish,
ever giving immediate utterance to what destroys himself and others.

[Proverbs 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 10:15</span></span>

Destruction - That which crushes, throws into ruins. Wealth secures its
possessors against many dangers; poverty exposes men to worse evils than
itself, meanness, servility, and cowardice. Below the surface there
lies, it may be, a grave irony against the rich; see [Pro
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011.md).

[Proverbs 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 10:16</span></span>

A warning against the conclusion to seek wealth first of all, which men
of lower natures might draw from [Pro
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md).

"Quaerenda pecunia primum est;

Virtus post nummos?"

Horace, Ep. 1. i. 53.

Such an inference is met by the experience, that while wealth gotten by
honest industry is not only, like inherited riches a defense, but also a
blessing, the seeming profit (rather than "fruit") of the wicked tends
to further sin [Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), and so to
punishment. Compare [Rom 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md).

[Proverbs 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 10:17</span></span>

literally, A way of life is he that keepeth instruction. The verb
"erreth" is better rendered in the margin. The influence for good or
evil spreads beyond the man himself.

[Proverbs 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 10:18</span></span>

Better, He who hideth hatred is of lying lips. He who cherishes hatred,
is either a knave, or a fool - a knave if he hides, a fool if he utters
it.

[Proverbs 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 10:19</span></span>

There wanteth not sin - Some render this, "Sin shall not cease," etc.,
i. e., many words do not mend a fault. Silence on the part both of the
reprover and the offender is often better. The King James Version is,
however, preferable.

[Proverbs 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 10:20</span></span>

The tongue, the instrument of the mind is contrasted with the heart or
mind itself, the just with the wicked, the choice silver with the
worthless "little," the Hebrew word being possibly taken in its primary
sense as a "filing" or "scraping" of dross or worthless metal. If the
tongue is precious, how much more the mind! If the heart is worthless,
how much more the speech!

[Proverbs 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 10:21</span></span>

Feed - The Hebrew word, like ποιμαίνειν poimainein, includes the idea of
guiding as well as nourishing; doing a shepherd's work in both.

For want of wisdom - Some prefer, through him who wanteth understanding,
referring to a person. The wise guides others to safety; the fool,
empty-headed, and empty-hearted, involves others like himself in
destruction.

[Proverbs 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 10:23</span></span>

As the fool finds his sport in doing mischief, so the man of
understanding finds in wisdom his truest refreshment and delight.

[Proverbs 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 10:24</span></span>

The fear - i. e., The thing feared (compare the marginal reference).

Shall be granted - Or, He (Yahweh) giveth the desire of the righteous.

[Proverbs 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 10:25</span></span>

Or, when the whirlwind is passing, then the wicked is no more. Compare
[Mat 7:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024.md).

The righteous ... - In the later rabbinic interpretation this was
applied to the Messiah as being the Just One, the Everlasting
Foundation, on whom the world was established.

[Proverbs 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 10:26</span></span>

The teeth set on edge by the sour wine used by peasants [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014.md); [Psa
69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md), the eye irritated by
wood-smoke, these shadow the annoyance of having a messenger who will
loiter on the way.

[Proverbs 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 10:28</span></span>

Transpose "hope" and "expectation." The expectant waiting of the
righteous is joyful at the time, and ends in joy: the eager hope of the
wicked comes to nought.

[Proverbs 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 10:29</span></span>

Omit "shall be." The meaning is: "The Way of Yahweh," i. e., the Divine
Order of the world, has its two sides. It is "strength to the upright,
destruction to the workers of iniquity."

[Proverbs 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 10:30</span></span>

The wicked shall rot inhabit - The other and higher side of the same law
of the divine government appears in [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md).

[Proverbs 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 10:31</span></span>

Bringeth forth ... - As a tree full of life and sap brings forth its
fruit. So the "froward tongue" is like a tree that brings forth evil and
not good fruit; it "shall be cut down." The abuse of God's gift of
speech will lead ultimately to its forfeiture. There shall, at last, be
the silence of shame and confusion.

[Proverbs 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 10:32</span></span>

Know - i. e., "Know, and therefore utter." So, in like manner, the
"mouth of the wicked" knows, and therefore speaks frowardness, and that
only.
