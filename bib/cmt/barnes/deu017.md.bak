### [Deuteronomy Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 17:1</span></span>

This verse belongs in subject to the last chapter. It prohibits once
more (compare [Deu 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021).md) that form of
insult to God which consists in offering to Him a blemished sacrifice.

Any evil-favoredness - Render any evil thing. The reference is to the
faults or maims enumerated in [Lev
22:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#022.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 17:2</span></span>

Compare [Deu 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md) ff. Here special
reference is made to the legal forms to be adopted, [Deu
17:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005.md). The sentence was to be carried
into effect at "the gates" (compare [Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001) note.md) of the town in which the
crime was committed; because, as "all the people" were to take a part,
an open space would be requisite for the execution. Note the typical and
prophetical aspect of the injunction; compare [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 17:8</span></span>

The cases in question are such as the inferior judges did not feel able
to decide satisfactorily, and which accordingly they remitted to their
superiors (compare [Exo 18:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#023).md).

The Supreme court [Deu 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md) is
referred to in very general terms as sitting at the sanctuary [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md). "The judge" would no doubt
usually be a layman, and thus the court would contain both an
ecclesiastical and a civil element. Jehoshaphat [Ch2
19:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004.md) organized his judicial system
very closely upon the lines here laid down.

[Deuteronomy 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 17:14</span></span>

No encouragement is given to the desire, natural in an Oriental people,
for monarchical government; but neither is such desire blamed, as
appears from the fact that conditions are immediately laid down upon
which it may be satisfied. Compare the marginal references.

[Deuteronomy 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 17:15</span></span>

The king, like the judges and officers (compare [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018).md), is to be chosen by the people;
but their choice is to be in accordance with the will of God, and to be
made from among "their brethren." Compare [Sa1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md); [Sa1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#024.md); [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md); [Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016.md).

Thou mayest not set a stranger over thee - The Jews extended this
prohibition to all offices whatsoever (compare [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021).md); and naturally attached the
greatest importance to it: from where the significance of the question
proposed to our Lord, "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar?" [Mat
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md). A Gentile head for the Jewish
people, which it was a principal aim of the Law to keep special and
distinct from others, was an anomaly.

[Deuteronomy 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 17:16</span></span>

The horse was not anciently used in the East for purposes of agriculture
or traveling, but ordinarily for war only. He appears constantly in
Scripture as the symbol and embodiment of fleshly strength and the might
of the creature (compare [Psa 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md);
[Psa 33:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md); [Psa
147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md); [Job
39:19](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019) ff.md), and is sometimes
significantly spoken of simply as "the strong one" (compare [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016).md). The spirit of the prohibition
therefore is that the king of Israel must not, like other earthly
potentates, put his trust in costly and formidable preparations for war
(compare [Hos 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md).

Egypt was the principal source from where the nations of western Asia
drew their supplies of this animal (compare [Exo
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#005.md) ff; [Kg1
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md); [Kg2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006).md); but contact, traffic, or
alliance which would "cause the people to return to Egypt" would be to
reverse that great and beneficent wonderwork of God which inaugurated
the Mosaic covenant, the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt; and to
bring about of set purpose that which God threatened [Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md) as the most severe punishment
for Israel's sin.

[Deuteronomy 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 17:17</span></span>

Multiplication of wives would lead to sensuality, and so to an apostasy
no less fatal in effect than downright idolatry (compare [Exo
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#016).md). This rule, like the others,
abridges to the ruler of Israel liberties usually enjoyed without stint
by the kings of the East. The restriction was in the days of Moses
unprecedented; and demanded a higher standard in the king of Israel than
was looked for among his equals in other nations.

Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold - In this
third prohibition, as in the other two, excess is forbidden. Vast
accumulation of treasure could hardly be effected without oppression;
nor when effected fail to produce pride and a "trust in uncertain
riches" [Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 17:18</span></span>

It is in striking consistency with the dignity which everywhere
throughout the Mosaic legislation surrounds the chosen people of God,
that even if they will be "like as all the nations about" [Deu
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014.md), and be governed by a king, care
should nevertheless be taken that he shall be no Oriental despot. He is
to be of no royal caste, but "one from among thy brethren" [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md); he is to bear himself as a kind
of "primus inter pares," his heart "not being lifted up above his
brethren" [Deu 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020.md); he is, like his
subjects, to be bound by the fundamental laws and institutions of the
nation, and obliged, as they were, to do his duty in his station of life
with constant reference thereto. The spirit of the text is that of [Mat
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md).

A copy of this law - The whole Pentateuch, or, at any rate, the legal
portion of the Pentateuch.

A book ... before the priests the Levites - Compare the marginal
reference.
