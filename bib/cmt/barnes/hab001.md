### [Habakkuk Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 1:1</span></span>

The burden - On the word "burden" see the note at [Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md).

Which Habakkuk the prophet did see - The prophet's name signifies
"strong embrace." The word in its intensive form is used both of God's
enfolding the soul within His tender supporting love , and of man
clinging and holding fast to divine wisdom [Pro
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008.md). It fits in with the subject of
his prophecy, faith, cleaving fast to God amid the perplexities of
things seen. Dion.: "He who is spiritually Habakkuk, cleaving fast to
God with the arms of love, or enfolding Him after the manner of one
holily wrestling, until he is blessed, enlightened, and heard by Him, is
the seer here." "Let him who would in such wise fervidly embrace God and
plead with Him as a friend, praying earnestly for the deliverance and
consolation of himself and others, but who sees not as yet, that his
prayer is heard, make the same holy plaint, and appeal to the clemency
of the Creator." (Jer. Abarbanel has the like: "He strengthens himself
in pleading his cause with God as to the prosperity of Nebuchadnezzar as
if he were joined with God for the cause of his people" Preface to
Ezekiel). "He is called 'embrace' either because of his love to the
Lord; or because he engages in a contest and strife and (so to speak)
wrestling with God." For no one with words so bold ventured to challenge
God to a discussion of His justice and to say to Him, "Why, in human
affairs and the government of this world is there so great injustice?"

The prophet - The title, "the prophet," is added only to the names of
Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah. Habakkuk may have added it to his name
instead because he prominently expostulates with God, like the
Psalmists, and does not speak in the name of God to the people. The
title asserts that he exercised the pastoral office of the prophets,
although not directly in this prophecy.

Did see - Cyril: "God multiplied visons, as is written [Hos
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md), and Himself spoke to the
prophets, disclosing to them beforehand what should be, and all but
exhibiting them to sight, as if already present. But that they
determined not to speak from their own, but rather transmit to us the
words from God, he persuades us at the outset, naming himself a prophet,
and showing himself full of the grace belonging thereto."

[Habakkuk 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 1:2</span></span>

O Lord, how long shall I cry - Literally, "how long have I cried so
intensely to Thee?" Because it is always the cry of the creature to the
One who alone can hear or help - its God. Of this cry the Prophet
expresses that it had already lasted long. In that long past he had
cried out to God but no change had come. There is an undefined past, and
this still continues.

How long - as Asaph cries, "how long hast Thou been," and, it is
implied, wilt Thou be "wroth against the prayer of Thy people?" as we
should say," how long shall Thy wrath continue?" The words which the
prophet uses relate to domestic strife and wrong between man and man;
violence, iniquity, strife, contention [Hab
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md), nor are any of them used only of
the oppression of a foreign enemy. Also, Habakkuk complains of injustice
too strong for the law, and the perversion of justice [Hab
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004.md). And upon this, the sentence is
pronounced. The enemy is to be sent for judgment and correction [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md). They are then the sins of Judah
which the prophet rehearses before God, in fellow-suffering with the
oppressed. God answers that they shall be removed, but by the punishment
of the sinners.

Punishment does not come without sin, nor does sin endure without
punishment. It is one object of the Old Testament to exhibit the
connection between sin and punishment. Other prophets, as commissioned
by God, first denounced the sins and then foretold the punishment of the
impenitent. Habakkuk appeals to God's justice, as requiring its
infliction. On this ground too this opening of the prophecy cannot be a
complaint against the Chaldees, because their wrong would be no ground
of the punishment which the prophet denounced, but the punishment
itself, requiting wrong to man through human wrong.

Cyril: "The prophet considers the person of the oppressed, enduring the
intolerable insolence and contumely of those accustomed to do wrong, and
very skillfully doth he attest the unutterable lovingkindness of God,
for he exhibits Him as very forbearing, though accustomed to hate
wickedness, but that He doth not immediately bring judgment upon the
offenders, he showed clearly, saying that so great is His silence and
long-suffering, that there needeth a strong cry, in that some practice
intolerable covetousness against others, and use an unbridled insolence
against the weak, for his very complaints of God's endurance of evil
attest the immeasurable loving kindness of God."

Cyril: "You may judge hence of the hatred of evil among the saints. For
they speak of the woes of others as their own. So saith the most wise
Paul [Co2 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md), who is weak and I am
not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? and bade us [Rom
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015.md) weep with those who weep,
showing that sympathy and mutual love are especially becoming to the
saints."

The prophet, through sympathy or fellow-suffering with the sufferers, is
as one of them. He cries for help, as himself needing it, and being in
the misery, in behalf of which he prays. He says, "How long shall I
cry?" standing, as it were, in the place of all, and gathering all their
cries into one, and presenting them before God. It is the cry, in one,
of all which is wronged to the God of Justice, of all suffering to the
God of love. "When shall this scene of sin, and confusion, and wrong be
at an end, and the harmony of God's creation be restored? How long shall
evil not exist only, but prevail?" It is the cry of the souls under the
altar [Rev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md), "How long, O Lord,
Holy and True, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that
dwell on the earth?" It is the voice of the oppressed against the
oppressor; of the Church against the world; weary of hearing the Lord's
Name blasphemed, of seeing wrong set up on high, of holiness trampled
underfoot. It is in its highest sense His Voice, who, to sanctify our
longings for deliverance, said in the days of His Flesh [Psa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002.md), "I cry in the daytime, but Thou
hearest not."

Even cry out - aloud (it is the cry of anguish) Dion.: "We cry the
louder, the more we cry from the heart, even without words; for not the
moving of the lips, but the love of the heart sounds in the ears of
God."

Even cry out unto Thee. - Whether as an exclamation or a continuance of
the question, How long? The prophet gathered in one the prolonged cry of
past and future. He had cried out; he should cry on, "Violence." He
speaks as if the one word, jerked out, as it were, wrung forth from his
inmost soul, was, "Violence," as if he said this one word to the God of
justice and love.

[Habakkuk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 1:3</span></span>

Why dost Thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold - , or rather,
"Why beholdest Thou grievance?" God seemed to reverse what He had said
by Balaam [Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md), "He hath not
beheld iniquity in Jacob, and hath not seen grievousness in Israel"; and
in the Psalms [Psa 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md), "Thou hast
seen, for thou (emphatic) beholdest grievousness and wrong, to put it in
Thy hand," i. e., Thou layest it up in Thy hand, to cast it back on the
head of the evildoer. Now He seemed to behold it and leave it
unpunished, which yet Habakkuk says to God below, He could not do [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md); "Thou canst not look upon
iniquity." What then did this mean? What was the solution?

All forms and shapes of sin are multiplied; oppressive "violence" , such
as "covered the earth" before the flood, and brought it down; which
Nineveh had to put away [Jon 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#008.md), and
it was spared; "iniquity," i. e., what is unequal and contrary to truth,
falsehood.

Grievance - literally, burdensome wearisome "toil"; "spoiling," or open
robbery; "strife and contention," both through perversion of the law
and, without it, through endless jarrings of man with man. Sin recoils
on the sinner. So what he beholds is not "iniquity" only, but (in the
same word) "vanity"; "grievance"; which is a burden both to him who
suffers, and yet more to him who inflicts it. For nothing is so
burdensome as sin, nothing so empty as wickedness. And while to him who
suffers, the suffering is temporal, to him who inflicts it, it is
eternal. And yet the prophet and whose prays against ungodliness, "must
commiserate him who doth wrong yet more, since they hurt what is most
precious, their own soul, and that eternally" . All then is full of
evil. Wherever the prophet looks, some fresh violence is before him; it
confronts him on every side; "strife hath arisen" , come up, exists
where it was not before; "contention lifteth itself" on high, bowing
down all beside.

[Habakkuk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 1:4</span></span>

Therefore - i. e., Because God seemed not to awake to avenge His own
cause, people promised themselves that they might sin on with impunity.
Sin produces sin, and wrong produces wrong; it spreads like an
infectious disease, propagating itself, and each, to whom it reaches,
adds to its poison. At last, it reached those also, who should be in
God's stead to restrain it. The divine law itself is silenced, by the
power of the wicked, by the sin of the judge, the hopelessness of all.
When all around is evil, even those not yet lost are tempted to think;
"Why should I be other than they? What evil befalls them? Why stand
alone?" Even a Psalmist [Psa 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md),
[Psa 73:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md) speaks as if tempted to
"speak even as they. These are the ungodly who prosper in the world;
they increase in riches; verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and
washed my hands in innocency;" and Solomon [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md), "Because sentence against an
evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of
men is fully set in them to do evil."

The law is slacked - literally "is chilled" (as we say, "is paralyzed"),
through lack of the fire of love. This is what our Lord says [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md), Because iniquity shall abound,
the love of many shall wax cold. The divine law, the source of all
right, being chilled in people's hearts, "judgment," i. e., the sentence
of human justice, as conformed to divine justice, "doth never go forth."
Human sense of right is powerless, when there is not the love of God's
law. It seems always ready to act, but always falls short, like an arrow
from an unstrung bow. The man seems always about to do right; he judges,
sees, aright - all but does it - yet, at last, he always fails. "It goes
not forth. The children are come to the birth, and there is not strength
to bring forth" [Isa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003.md).

For the wicked doth compass about the righteous, laying snares for him,
as the Jews for our Lord; evil is too strong for a weak will to do
right, and overbears it. Pilate sought in many ways, how he might
deliver Jesus, yet he finally did deliver Christ into their hands.

Therefore wrong judgment proceedeth - literally, "judgment proceedeth
wrested." He had said, "it never goes forth;" never, that is, in its
true character; for, when it does "go forth," it is distorted. Dion.:
"For gifts or favor or fear or hate the guiltless are condemned trod the
guilty acquitted, as saith the Psalmist [Psa
82:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#002.md), 'How long will ye judge unjustly
and accept the persons of the ungodly?'" Theoph.: "'Judgment goes forth
perverted' in the seat of man's judgment (the soul), when, bribed by the
pleasures of sense, it leans to the side of things seen, and the ungodly
one, the rebel angel, besets and overpowers him who has the sense of
right; for it is right that things seen should give way to things unseen
[Co2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md); 'for the things which are
seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.'" Why
then all this? And how long? Why does God bring it before him and He who
"is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, behold grievance," which His
Holy Eyes could not endure? Neither the unseen presence of God nor the
mission of the prophet checks. If he rebukes, no one hearkened; if he
intercedes for sinners, or against sin, God made as though He would not
hear. God answers that, though to man's impatience the time seems long,
judgment shall come, and that, suddenly and speedily. While the
righteous is enquiring, "how long?" and the wicked is saying [Mat
24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048.md), "My Lord delayeth His coming,"
He is come, and seen in the midst of them.

[Habakkuk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 1:5</span></span>

Behold ye among the heathen - The whole tone of the words suddenly
changes. The Jews flattered themselves that, being the people of God, He
would not fulfill His threats upon them. They had become like the pagan
in wickedness; God bids them look out among them for the instrument of
His displeasure. It was an aggravation of their punishment, that God,
who had once chosen them, would now choose these whom He had not chosen,
to chasten them. So Moses had foretold; [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md), "They have moved Me to jealousy
by that which is not God; they have provoked Me to anger with their
vanities; and I will move them to jealousy with not-a-people, I will
provoke them to anger with a foolish nation." There were no tokens of
the storm which should sweep them away, yet on the horizon. No
forerunners yet. And so He bids them gaze on among the nations, to see
whence it should come. They might have expected it from Egypt. It should
come whence they did not expect, with a fierceness and terribleness
which they imagined not.

Regard - look narrowly, weigh well what it portends.

And wonder marvelously - literally, "be amazed, amazed." The word is
doubled to express how amazement should follow upon amazement; when the
first was passing away, new source of amazement should come; for .

I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be
told you. - So incredible it will be, and so against their wills! He
does not say, "ye would not believe if it were told you;" much less "if
it were told you of others;" in which case the chief thought would be
left unexpressed. No condition is expressed. It is simply foretold, what
was verified by the whole history of their resistance to the Chaldees
until the capture of the city; "Ye will not believe, when it shall be
told you." So it ever is. Man never believes that God is in earnest
until His judgments come. So it was before the flood, and with Sodom,
and with Lot's sons-in-law; so it was with Ahab and Jezebel; so with
this destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans, and what is shadowed
forth, by the Romans. So Jeremiah complained [Jer
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md), "They have belied the Lord, and
said, it is not He; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we
see sword nor famine," and [Jer
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md), "I am in derision daily;
everyone mocketh me. For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence
and spoil; because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and
a derision daily;" and Isaiah [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md), "Who hath believed our report?"
and John the Immerser speaks as though it were desperate [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md); "O generation of vipers, who hath
warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" and our Lord tells them [Mat
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038.md); [Luk
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035.md), "Your house is left unto you
desolate."

And yet they believed not, but delivered Him up to be put to death, lest
that should be, which did come, because they put Him to death [Joh
11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048.md). "If we let Him thus alone, all
people will believe on Him; and the Romans shall come, and take away
both our place and nation." Therefore, Paul applies these words to the
Jews in his day, because the destruction of the first temple by
Nebuchadnezzar was an image of the destruction of the second temple
(which by divine appointment, contrary to man's intention, took place on
the same day ), and the Chaldaeans were images of the Romans, that
second Babylon, pagan Rome; and both foreshowed the worse destruction by
a fiercer enemy - the enemy of souls - the spiritual wasting and
desolation which came upon the Jew first, and which shall come on all
who disobey the gospel. So it shall be to the end. Even now, the Jews
believe not, whose work their own dispersion is; His, who by them was
crucified, but who has "all power in heaven and in earth" [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). The Day of Judgment will come
like a thief in the night to those who believe not or obey not our
Lord's words.

[Habakkuk 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 1:6</span></span>

For lo - So God announces a future, in which His Hand shall be greatly
visible, whether more or less distant. In His sight it is present.

I raise up - God uses the free will and evil passions of people or
devils to His own ends; and so He is said to "raise up" those whom He
allows to be stirred up against His people, since the events which His
Providence permits, favor their designs, and it rests with Him to
withhold them. They lift themselves up for some end of covetousness or
pride. But there is a higher order of things, in which God orders their
actions to fulfill His righteousness by their iniquities.

The Chaldaeans, that bitter - מר. In [Jdg
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025.md); [Sa2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008.md), the less concise נפשׁ מר.

And hasty nation - נמהר as [Isa 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#004.md).
Jerome: "To its might and warlike boldness almost all the Greeks who
have written histories of the barbarians, witness."

Which shall march through the breadth of the land - rather, "the earth,"
literally "to the breadths of the earth," reaching to its whole length
and breadth, all its dimensions as in the description of Gog and Magog
[Rev 20:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008.md), "the number of whom is as
the sand of the sea; and they went up on the breadth of the earth;
unhindered, not pent up, but spreading abroad, where they will, over the
whole earth." All before it, is one wide even plain which it overspreads
and covers, like a flood, and yet is not spent nor exhausted.

To possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs - As God's people had
done, so should it be done to them. Spoiling and violence within [Hab
1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md) attract oppression from without.
The overcharged atmosphere casts down the lightning upon them. They had
expelled the weak from their dwelling [Mic
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009.md); others shall possess theirs. Yet
this scourge too shall pass by, since, although the Chaldaean did God's
Will, He willed it not, but His own (See [Isa
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md). The words, "not theirs,"
literally, "not to him" stand with a mysterious fullness of meaning. The
dwelling places not being his by right, shall not remain his, although
given to him, while God wills.

[Habakkuk 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 1:7</span></span>

They are terrible - איום 'âyôm occurs here only and [Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004.md), [Sol
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md), compared with the "bannered
host," but the root is common in אימה 'ēymâh.

And dreadful - He describes them, first in themselves, then in act. They
are terrible, and strike fear through their very being, their known
character, before they put it forth in act.

Their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. - Judgment
had gone forth in God's people wrested [Hab
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004.md); now shall it go forth against
them at the mere will of their master, who shall own no other rule or
Lord or source of his power. His own will shall be his only law for
himself and others. His elevation is too is, in his own thought, from
himself. He is self-sufficing; he holds from no other, neither from God
nor man. His "dignity" is self-sustained; His "judgment" is
irresponsible, as if there were none [Ecc
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md) higher than he. He has, like all
great world-powers, a real dignity and majesty. He infuses awe. The
dignity is real but faulty, as being held independently of God. This is
a character of antichrist [Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md);
[Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md), a lawless insolence, a
lifting up of himself.

[Habakkuk 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 1:8</span></span>

Their horses are swifter - literally, lighter, as we say "light of foot"

Than leopards - The wild beast intended is the panther, the lightest,
swiftest, fiercest, most bloodthirsty of beasts of prey "It runs most
swiftly and rushes brave and straight. You would say, when you saw it,
that it is borne through the air." Cyril: "It bounds exceedingly and is
exceedingly light to spring down on whatever it pursues."

More fierce - o

Than the evening wolves - Compare [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md), i. e., than they are when
fiercest, going forth to prey when urged to rabidness by hunger the
whole day through. Such had their own judges been [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md), and by such should they be
punished. The horse partakes of the fierceness of his rider in trampling
down the foe .

Their horsemen shall spread themselves - literally, widespread are their
horsemen

And their horsemen from far shall come - Neither distance of march shall
weary them, nor diffusion weaken them. So should Moses' prophecy be
again fulfilled ([Deu 28:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md), מרחוק
occurs in both.) "The Lord shall raise against thee a nation from far,
from the ends of the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue
thou shalt not understand; a nation of fierce countenance, which shall
not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young."

They shall fly as the eagle that hasteth - literally, hasting

To eat - Jerome: "not to fight, for none shall withstand; but with a
course like the eagle's, to whom all fowl are subdued, hasting but to
eat." Behold, Jeremiah says of Nebuchadnezzar [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md), he shall fly as an eagle and
spread his wings over Moab; and, he repeats the words [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md), over Bozrah. Our pursuers,
Jeremiah says [Lam 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md), are swifter
than the eagles of the heavens. Ezekiel likens him to [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md) "a great eagle with great wings
full of feathers;" in Daniel's vision he is [Dan
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md) "a lion with eagle's wings."

[Habakkuk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 1:9</span></span>

They shall come all for violence - "Violence" had been the sin of Judah
[Hab 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md), and now violence shall be
her punishment. It had been ever before the prophet; all were full of
it. Now should violence be the very end, one by one, of all the savage
horde poured out upon them; they all, each one of them come for
violence.

Their faces shall sup up as the east wind - קדומה occurs else only in
[Eze 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md), and [Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md) times in Ezek. 40-48 of the
ideal city and temple as "Eastwards." But except in the far-fetched
explanation of Abarb (mentioned also by Tanchum) that they ravaged, not
to settle but to return home with their booty, "Eastwards" would have no
meaning. Yet "forwards" is just as insulated a rendering as that adopted
by John and D. Kimchi, A. E. Rashi, Oh. Sip., Sal. B. Mel. Arab Tr.
(following Jonathan) "the East-wind; קדומה standing as a metaphor
instead of a simile the הbeing regarded as paragogic, as in לילה. So
also Symmachus ἄνεμος καύσων anemos kausōn. Jerome: "ventus urens.") "As
at the breath of the burning wind all green things dry up, so at sight
of these all shall be wasted." They shall sweep over everything
impetuously, like the east wind, scorching, blackening, blasting,
swallowing up all, as they pass over, as the East wind, especially in
the Holy Land, sucks up all moisture and freshness.

And they shall gather the captivity - i. e., the captives

As the sand - countless, as the particles which the East wind raises,
sweeping over the sand-wastes, where it buries whole caravans in one
death.

[Habakkuk 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 1:10</span></span>

And they - literally, "he," the word stands emphatically, he, alone
against all the kings of the earth

Shall scoff at the kings - and all their might taking them away or
setting them up at his pleasure and caprice, subduing them as though in
sport

And princes - literally, grave and majestic

Shall be a scorn unto them - i. e. him. Compare [Job
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#029.md). So Nebuchadnezzar bound
Jehoiakim [Ch2 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md); [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md) "in fetters to carry him to
Babylon;" then, on his submission made him for three years a tributary
king [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001.md), then on his rebellion
sent bands of Chaldees and other tributaries against him [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md); and then, or when Nebuchadnezzar
took Jehoiachin, Jeremiah's prophecy was fulfilled, that he should "be
buried with the burial of an ass, dragged and cast forth beyond the
gates of Jerusalem [Jer 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019.md), his
dead body cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost"
[Jer 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030.md). On the one hand, the
expression "slept with his fathers" does not necessarily imply that
Jehoiakim died a peaceful death, since it is used of Ahab [Kg1
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#040.md) and Amaziah [Kg2
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#020.md), [Kg2
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md) (in the other, Jeremiah's
prophecy was equally fulfilled, if the insult to his corpse took place
when Nebuchadnezzar took away Jehoiachin three months after his father's
death. See Daniel. Josephus attributes both the death and disgrace to
Nebuchadnezzar: Ant. x. 6. 3), then Nebuchadnezzar took away Jehoiachin;
then Zedekiah. He had also many kings captive with him in Babylon. For
on his decease Evil-Merodach brought Jehoiachin out of his prison after
27 years of imprisonment, "and set his throne above the throne of the
kings that were with him in Babylon" [Kg2
25:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md). Daniel says also to
Nebuchadnezzar [Dan 2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037.md); [Dan
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#022.md), "Thou, O king, art a king of
kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power and
strength and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the
beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven hath He given into thine
hand and hath made thee ruler over all."

They (he) shall deride every strong hold - as, aforetime, when God
helped her, Jerusalem laughed the Assyrian to scorn [Isa
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#022.md).

For they (he) shall heap dust, and take it - as Nebuchadnezzar did Tyre,
whose very name (Rock) betokened its strength. Jerome: "He shall come to
Tyre, and, casting a mound in the sea, shall make an island a peninsula,
and, amid the waves of the sea, land shall give an entrance to the
city."

The mount, or heaped-up earth, by which the besiegers fought on a level
with the besieged, or planted their engines at advantage, was an old and
simple form of siege, especially adapted to the great masses of the
Eastern armies. It was used in David's time [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md); and by the Assyrians [Kg2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032.md), Egyptians Ezra 17:17,
Babylonians ([Jer 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006.md); [Jer
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024.md); [Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004.md); [Eze
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md); [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md) ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027) in Hebrew.md), [Eze
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#008).md), and afterward, the Persians
(Herodotus i. 162). Here he describes the rapidity of the siege. To heap
up dust and to capture were one and the same thing.

It needed no great means; things slight as the dust sufficed in the
hands of those employed by God. Portion by portion [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md), "the King of Babylon took; all
that pertained to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt unto the
river Euphrates."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 1:11</span></span>

Then shall his mind change - or, better, "Then he sweeps by, חלף châlaph
is used of the overflowing of a river, [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md), of a wind chasing, [Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md), of the invisible presence of God
passing by, [Job 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md), or a spirit,
[Job 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#015.md), of the swift passing of our
days, like ship or eagle, Job 10:26, of idols utterly passing away. [Isa
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018.md), of rain past and gone, [Sol
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md). It is, together with עבר ‛âbar,
used of transgressing God's law [Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md). It is always intransitive,
except as piercing the temples of man [Jdg
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#026.md), or himself [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md).

A wind - רוח rûach, metaphor for simile, as [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014); (13 English.md) [Psa

And passes - עבר ‛âbar "pass over" (with חלף châlaph, as here,), [Isa

1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md); [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md); "transgress," passim; "pass

34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md); [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012).md)

And is guilty; this his strength is his god - The victory was completed,
all resistance ended. He sweeps by, as his own Euphrates, when
over-filled by the swelling [Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md)
of all its tributary streams, riseth up over all its banks, and
overwhelms all where it passes; as a wind which sweepeth [Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md) over the desert: and passes over
all bounds and laws, human and divine, and is guilty and stands guilty
before God, making himself as God.

This his power is his god - God had said to Israel [Exo
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#007.md), "I will be to thee God." The
Chaldaean virtually said, "this my strength is to me my god." This
Nebuchadnezzars own words speak [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030.md); "Is not this great Babylon, that
I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and
for the honor of my majesty?" And the statue which was to be worshipped,
was, very probably, of himself, as the intoxication of pride has made
other pagan kings or conquerors, Alexander or Darius. Belshazzar said
[Isa 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014.md), "I will be like the Most
High," and the prince of Tyre said [Eze
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002.md), "I am a god, and antichrist
shall "exalt himself above all that is called god, and, as God, sit in
the temple of God, shewing himself that he is god" [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004.md). Such is all pride. It sets itself
in the place of God, it ceases to think of itself as God's instrument,
and so becomes a god to itself, as though its eminence and strength were
its own, and its wisdom were the source of its power (See [Eze
28:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002).md), and its will the measure of
its greatness. The words, with a divine fullness, express severally,
that the king Shall sweep along, shall pass over all bounds and all
hindrances, and shall pass away, shall be guilty and shall bear his
guilt ; and so they comprise in one his sin and his punishment, his
greatness and his fall. And so, 40 years afterward Nebuchadnezzar, [Dan
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md). "whom he would, he slew; and
whom he would, he kept alive; and whom he would, he set up; and whom he
would, he put down; but when his heart was lifted up, and his mind
hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took
his glory from him;" [Dan 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031.md), "there
fell a voice from heaven, The kingdom is departed from thee; and
Belshazzar; [Dan 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#023.md), [Dan
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md), "in the same night that he
lifted up himself against the Lord of heaven, was slain."

[Habakkuk 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 1:12</span></span>

The prophet, having summed up the deeds of the enemy of God in this his
end, sets forth his questions anew. He had appealed against the evil of
the wicked of his people; he had been told of the vengeance by the
Chaldaeans (Heading of Hab. 1). But the vengeance is executed by them
who are far worse. How then? The answer is: "Wait to the end, and thou
shalt see." What remains are the triumphs of faith; the second chapter
closes with the entire prostration of the whole world before God, and
the whole prophecy with joyous trust in God amid the entire failure of
all outward signs of hope. Here, like the Psalmists (Asaph, Ps. 73 Ethan
[Psa 76:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001).md) and Jeremiah [Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md), he sets down at the very
beginning his entire trust in God, and so, in the name of all who at any
time shall be perplexed about the order of God's judgments, asks how it
shall be, teaching us that the only safe way of enquiring into God's
ways is by setting out with a living conviction that they, [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010.md), are "mercy and truth." And so
the address to God is full of awe and confidence and inward love. For
"God placeth the oil of mercy in the vessel of trustfulness."

Art Thou not - (the word has always an emphasis) "Thou" and not
whatsoever or whosoever it be that is opposed to Thee (be it
Nebuchadnezzar or Satan).

From everlasting - literally, from before? See the note at [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md). Go back as far as man can in
thought - God was still before; and so, much more before any of His
creatures, such as those who rebel against Him.

O Lord - it is the proper name of God, [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md), "Which is and Which was and Which
is to come" - I am, the Unchangeable; my God, i. e., whereas his own
might is (he had just said) the pagan's god, the Lord is his;

Mine Holy One - one word, denoting that God is his God, sufficeth him
not, but he adds (what does not elsewhere occur) "mine Holy One" in
every way, as hallowing him and hallowed by him. Dion.: "Who hallowest
my soul, Holy in Thine Essence, and whom as incomparably Holy I worship
in holiness." All-Holy in Himself, He becometh the Holy One of him to
whom He imparteth Himself, and so, by His own gift, belongeth, as it
were, to him. The one word in Hebrew wonderfully fits in with the truth,
that God becomes one with man by taking him to Himself. It is fall of
inward trust too, that he saith, "my God, my Holy One," as Paul saith,
[Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md), "Who loved me, and gave
Himself for me," i. e., as Augustine explains it , "O Thou God
Omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us, as if Thou caredst for
him only; and so for all, as if tbey were but one." The title, "my Holy
One," includes his people with himself; for God was his God, primarily
because he was one of the people of God; and his office was for and in
behalf of his people.

It involves then that other title which had been the great support of
Isaiah , by which he at once comforted his people, and impressed upon
them the holiness of their God, the holiness which their relation to
their God required, the Holy One of Israel. Thence, since Habakkuk
lived, for his people with himself, on this relation to God, as my God,
my Holy One, and that God, the Unchangeable; it follows," We shall not
die." There is no need of any mark of inference, "therefore we shall not
die." It is an inference, but it so lay in those titles of God, "He Is,
My God, My Holy One," that it was a more loving confidence to say
directly, we shall not die. The one thought involved the other. God, the
Unchangeable, had made Himself their God. It was impossible, then, that
lie should cast them off or that they should perish.

We shall not die, is the lightning thought of faith, which flashes on
the soul like all inspirations of God, founded on His truth and word,
but borne in, as it were, instinctively without inference on the soul,
with the same confidence as the Psalmist says [Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md), "The Lord hath chastened me
sore; but He hath not given me over unto death;" and Malachi [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md), "I am the Lord, I change not;
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed." Jerome: "Thou createdst us
from the beginning; by Thy mercy we are in being hitherto." Thy "gifts
and calling are without repentance." [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md) "did we look to his might; none
of us could withstand him. Look we to Thy mercy, Thine alone is it that
we live, are not slain by him, nor led to deeds of death." O Lord, again
he repeats the Name of God, whereby He had revealed Himself as their
God, the Unchangeable; "Thou, whose mercies fail not, hast ordained them
for judgment," not for vengeance or to make a full end, or for his own
ends and pleasure, but to correct Thine own [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md); [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md) in measure, which he, exceeding,
sinned (See [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md); [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015).md).

And O mighty God - literally, Rock. It is a bold title. "My rock" is a
title much used by David , perhaps suggested by the fastnesses amid
which he passed his hunted life, to express that not in them but in His
God was his safety. Habakkuk purposely widens it. He appeals to God, not
only as Israel's might and upholder, but as the sole Source of all
strength, the Supporter of all which is upheld , and so, for the time,
of the Chaldaean too. Hence, he continues the simple image: "Thou hast
founded him" . "Thou hast made him to stand firm as the foundation of a
building;" to reprove or set before those who have sinned against Thee,
what they had done. Since then God was the Rock, who had founded them,
from Him Alone had they strength; when He should withdraw it, they must
fall. How then did they yet abide, who abused the power given them and
counted it their own? And this the more, since ...

[Habakkuk 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 1:13</span></span>

Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil - The prophet repeats his
complaint (as troubling thoughts are accustomed to come back, after they
have been repelled,), in order to answer it more strongly. All sin is
hateful in God's sight, and in His Holy Wisdom He cannot endure to "look
toward iniquity." As man turns away from sickening sights, so God's
abhorrence of wrong is pictured by His not being able to "look toward
it." If He looked toward them, they must perish [Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md). Light cannot co-exist with
darkness, fire with water, heat with cold, deformity with beauty,
foulness with sweetness, nor is sin compatible with the Presence of God,
except as its Judge and punisher. Thou canst not look. There is an
entire contradiction between God and unholiness. And yet,

Wherefore lookest thou upon - viewest, as in Thy full sight make the
contrast stronger. God cannot endure "to look toward" (אל) iniquity, and
yet He does not only this, but beholdeth it, contemplateth it, and still
is silent), yea, as it would seem, with favor , bestowing upon them the
goods of this life, honor, glory, children, riches, as the Psalmist
saith [Psa 73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md); "Behold these are
the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches?" Why
lookest thou upon "them that deal treacherously, holdest Thy tongue,"
puttest restraint , as it were, upon Thyself and Thine own attribute of
Justice, "when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than
he?" [Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md) "in God's sight no man
living can be justified;" and, in one sense, Sodom and Gomorrah were
less unrighteous than Jerusalem, and [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015.md); [Mat
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#024.md); [Mar
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011.md); [Luk
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#012.md) "it shall be more tolerable for
them in the day of Judgment," because they sinned against less light;
yet the actual sins of the Chaldee were greater than those of Jerusalem,
and Satan's evil is greater than that of these who are his prey.

To say that Judah was more righteous than the Chaldaean does not imply
any righteousness of the Chaldaean, as the saying that ([Jer
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#011), Del..md) "God ransomed Jacob from
the hand of one stronger than he," does not imply any strength remaining
to Israel. Then, also, in all the general judgments of God, the
righteous too suffer in this world, whence Abraham intercedes for Sodom,
if there were but ten righteous in it; lest [Gen
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md) "the righteous be destroyed with
the wicked." Hence, God also spared Nineveh in part as having [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011.md) "more than sixscore thousand
persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left
hand," i. e., good from evil. No times were more full of sin than those
before the destruction of Jerusalem, yet the fury of the Assassins fell
upon the innocent. And so the words, like the voice of the souls under
the Altar [Rev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md), become the cry of
the Church at all times against the oppressing world, and of the blood
of the martyrs from Abel to the end, "Lord, how long?" And in that the
word "righteous" signifies both "one righteous man," and the whole class
or generation of the righteous, it speaks both of Christ the Head and of
all His members in whom (as by Saul) He was persecuted. The wicked also
includes all persecutors, both those who executed the Lord Christ, and
those who brought His servants before judgment-seats, and who blasphemed
His Name [Jam 2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006.md), and caused many
to blaspheme, and killed those whom they could not compel. And God, all
the while, seemeth to look away and not to regard.

[Habakkuk 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 1:14</span></span>

And makest men as the fishes of the sea - mute, helpless, in a stormy,
restless element, no cry heard, but themselves swept away in shoals,
with no power to resist.

As the creeping things - whether of the land (as it is mostly used), or
the sea [Psa 104:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#025.md). Either way, it is
a contemptuous name for the lowest of either.

That have no ruler over them - none to guide, order, protect them, and
so a picture of man deprived of the care and providence of God.

[Habakkuk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 1:15</span></span>

They take up all of them - (literally "he taketh up all of it") the
whole race as though it were one,

With an angle; they catch them - literally, he sweepeth it away

In their (his) net - One fisherman is singled out who partly by wiles
(as by the bait of "an angle"), partly by violence (the net or drag)
sweeps away and gathers as his own the whole kind. Nebuchadnezzar and
the Chaldaeans are herein a faint image of Satan, who casts out his
baits and his nets in the stormy sea of this life, taking some by
individual craft, sweeping others in whole masses, to do evil; and whoso
hath no ruler, and will not have Christ to reign over him [Luk
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#004.md), he allures, hurries, drags away
as his prey. Jerome: "Adam clave to his hook, and he drew him forth out
of Paradise with his net; and covered him with his drags, his varied and
manifold deceits and guiles. And "by one many became sinners," and in
Adam we 'all died,' and all saints afterward were with him alike cast
out of Paradise. And because he deceived the first man, he ceaseth not
daily to slay the whole human race."

[Habakkuk 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 1:16</span></span>

Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their
drag - literally he sacrifices unto his, etc. Whatever a man trusts in
is his god. If a man relies to compass his end by his strength, or his
wisdom, or his forethought, or his wealth, his armies or navies, these
his forces are his God. So the Assyrian said [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md), [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md), "By the strength of my hand I
did it; and by my wisdom, for I am prudent;" and God answered, "Shall
the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?" The coarse
forms of idolatry only embody outwardly the deep inward idolatry of the
corrupt human mind. The idol is [Eze
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004.md) "set up in the heart" first.
There have not indeed been lacking savage nations, who in very deed
worshiped their arms ; those of old worshiped spears as immortal gods ;
Even now we are told of some North American Indians "who designate their
bow and arrow as the only beneficent deities whom they know."

Among the civilized Romans, the worship of the eagles, their standards
to whom they did sacrifice , was no other nor better. The inward
idolatry is only a more subtle form of the same sin, the evil spirit
which shapes itself in the outward show. Here the idolatry of self is
meant, which did not join creatures with God as objects of worship; but
denying, Him in practice or misbelief, became aged to itself . So
Habakkuk had said, this his strength is his God. His idol was himself.

Because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous -
literally, is in the English margin, well-fed). All the choicest things
of the world stood at his command, as Nebuchadnezzar boasted ([Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030), compare 22.md), and all the
kingdoms of the world and their glory, all the knowledge and wisdom and
learning of the world, and the whole world itself, were Satan's lawful
prey [Luk 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006.md); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); [Isa
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024.md) Cyril: "Nebuchadnezzar, as by a
hook and meshes and line, swept into his own land both Israel himself
and other nations, encompassing them. Satan, as it were, by one line and
net, that of sin, enclosed all, and Israel especially, on account of his
impiety to Christ. "His food was choice." For Israel was chosen above
the rest, as from a holy root, that of the fathers, and having the "law
as a schoolmaster," and being called to the knowledge of the one true
God. Yet he, having this glory and grace, was taken with the rest. They
became his prey by error; but Israel, knowing Him who is by nature God,
in an ungodly manner, slaying Him who was by nature His Begotten Son and
who came as Man, were taken in his nets."

[Habakkuk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 1:17</span></span>

Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay
the nations? - The prophet, like Isaiah [Isa
18:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004.md), stands at the very last point,
before the fury and desire of the enemy was fulfilled. People, like
fish, were gathered together for a prey; he who had taken them was
rejoicing and exulting beforehand in his booty; his portion and meat
were the choice of the earth; the prophet leeks on, as it were, and
beholds the net full; there is but one step more; "Shall he empty it?
Shall he then devour those whom he has caught? and so cast his emptied
net again unceasingly, pitilessly, to slay the nations?" This question
he answers in the next chapter - A Deliverer will come!
