Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Ezra Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

[Ezra 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 3:1</span></span>

The seventh month - i. e., the month Tisri (nearly our September), the
most sacred month in the Jewish year [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016); Lev. 23:24-41.

[Ezra 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 3:2</span></span>

Jeshua, the high priest, was the son of Jozadak, who was carried into
captivity by Nebuchadnezzar [Ch1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015).

Zerubbabel was really the son of Pedaiah, Shealtiel's (or Salathiel's)
younger brother. But Shealtiel having no sons, and the royal line being
continued in the person of his nephew, Zerubbabel, the latter was
accounted Shealtiel's son.

[Ezra 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 3:3</span></span>

Upon his bases - They restored the old altar of burnt-offerings, which
stood directly in front of the temple-porch, upon the old foundation.
This became apparent on the clearing away of the ruins, and on a careful
examination of the site.

[Ezra 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 3:7</span></span>

According to the grant - i. e., in accordance with the permission
granted them by Cyrus to rebuild their temple [Ezr
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).

[Ezra 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 3:8</span></span>

Unto the house of God - i. e., to the place where the house of God had
been, and where God was believed still to have His special dwelling.

And appointed the Levites - This is the emphatic clause of the present
verse. Though so small a number of Levites had returned from Babylon
[Ezr 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040), yet they were especially
singled out to be entrusted with the task of superintending and
advancing the building of the temple.

[Ezra 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 3:9</span></span>

Jeshua - See the marginal reference. Not the high priest, but the head
of one of the two Levitical houses which had returned.

Together - The Hebrew phrase is very emphatic - "they stood up as one
man."

[Ezra 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 3:10</span></span>

They set the priests - Or, according to another reading, "The priests
stood."

The Levites the sons of Asaph - i. e., "such of the Levites as were
descendants of Asaph." It would seem as if no descendants of Heman or
Jeduthun had returned.

[Ezra 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 3:12</span></span>

Wept ... shouted ... for joy - Compare the marginal reference and [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010). It is implied that the
dimensions of the second temple were smaller than those of the first.
Hence, the feeling of sorrow which came upon some. They, however, who
had not seen the former temple, and so could not contrast the two,
naturally rejoiced to see the sanctuary of their religion begin to rise
from its ruins.
