Heritage

### [Exodus Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001.md)

For [Exo 38:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001.md) and [Exo
38:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#009.md) see the notes to Exo. 27.

[Exodus 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md)

See the marginal reference. The women who assembled at the entrance of
the tent of meeting were most probably devout women who loved the public
service of religion. The giving up of their mirrors for the use of the
sanctuary was a fit sacrifice for such women to make (compare [Exo
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022) note.md).

[Exodus 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021.md)

This is the sum ... - "This is the reckoning of the tabernacle, the
tabernacle of the Testimony as it was reckoned up according to the
commandment of Moses, by the service of the Levites, by the hand of
Ithamar," etc. The weight of the metals was taken by the Levites, under
the direction of Ithamar. The tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the
testimony, or the depository of the testimony, i. e. the tables of the
law [Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md).

[Exodus 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 38:23</span></span>

See [Exo 35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md) note.

[Exodus 38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 38:24</span></span>

Of the holy place - Rather, of the sanctuary. The gold was employed not
only in the holy place, but in the most holy place and in the entrance
to the tent [Exo 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038.md).

The gold of the offering - The gold of the wave offering.

Talents ... the shekel of the sanctuary - The shekel was the common
standard of weight and value with the Hebrews: and is probably to be
estimated at 220 English grains (just over half an ounce avoirdupois)
and its value in silver as 2s. 7d. The shekel of the sanctuary (or, the
holy shekel) would seem to denote no more than an exact shekel, "after
the king's weight" [Sa2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026.md),
"current money with the merchant" [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md).

In the reign of Joash, a collection similar to that here mentioned,
apparently at the same rate of capitation, was made for the repairs of
the temple [Ch2 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#009.md). The tax of later
times, called didrachma, στατήρ statēr, [Mat
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027.md), was not, like this and that of
Joash, a collection for a special occasion, but a yearly tax, for the
support of the temple, of a whole shekel. See also [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md).

The talent contained 3,000 shekels, as may be gathered from [Exo
38:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md). According to the computation
here adopted, the Hebrew talent was 94 2/7 lbs. avoirdupois. The Greek
(Aeginetan) talent, from which the Septuagint and most succeeding
versions have taken the name "talent," was 82 1/4 lbs. The original
Hebrew word, ככר kı̂kār, would denote a circular mass, and nearly the
same word, kerker, was in use among the Egyptians for a mass of metal
cast in the form of a massive ring with its weight stamped upon it.

[Exodus 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 38:26</span></span>

A bekah - Literally, "a half": the words "half a shekel," etc. appear to
be inserted only for emphasis, to enforce the accuracy to be observed in
the payment. See [Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md).
Respecting the capitation and the numbering of the people, see [Exo
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md).

[Exodus 38:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 38:27</span></span>

Sockets - Bases. See the margin reference.

[Exodus 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 38:28</span></span>

The hooks, chapiters, and fillets here spoken of belonged to the pillars
of the court. See [Exo 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010.md), [Exo
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017.md).

[Exodus 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 38:29</span></span>

According to the estimate of the shekel that has here been adopted, the
weight of the metals mentioned in this chapter would be nearly as
follows, in avoirdupois weight:

Gold 1 ton 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 13 lbs. Silver 4 tons 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 20 lbs.
Bronze 2 tons 19 cwt. 2 qrs. 11 lbs.

The value of the gold, if pure, in our money would be 175,075 British
pounds, 13 shillings, and of the silver, 38,034 British pounds, 15
shillings 10d. These quantities of the precious metals come quite within
the limits of probability, if we consider the condition of the
Israelites when they left Egypt (see [Exo
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003) note.md), and the object for which
the collection was made. Many have remarked that the quantities
collected for the tabernacle are insignificant when compared with the
hoards of gold and silver collected in the East in recent times, as well
as in ancient times.
