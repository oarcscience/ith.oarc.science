### [Deuteronomy Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

In this and the next chapter certain particular rights and duties,
domestic, social, and civil, are treated. The cases brought forward have
often no definite connection, and seem selected in order to illustrate
the application of the great principles of the Law in certain important
events and circumstances.

These four verses contain only one sentence, and should be rendered
thus: If a man hath taken a wife, etc., and given her a bill of
divorcement and [Deu 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#002.md) if she has
departed out of his house and become another man's wife; and [Deu
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#003.md) if the latter husband hates her,
then [Deu 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md) her former husband,
etc.

Moses neither institutes nor enjoins divorce. The exact spirit of the
passage is given in our Lord's words to the Jews', "Moses because of the
hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives" [Mat
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md). Not only does the original
institution of marriage as recorded by Moses [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md) set forth the perpetuity of the
bond, but the verses before us plainly intimate that divorce, while
tolerated for the time, contravenes the order of nature and of God. The
divorced woman who marries again is "defiled" [Deu
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md), and is grouped in this
particular with the adulteress (compare [Lev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#020).md). Our Lord then was speaking
according to the spirit of the law of Moses when he declared, "Whoso
marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery" [Mat
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md). He was speaking too not less
according to the mind of the prophets (compare [Mal
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014).md). But Moses could not
absolutely put an end to a practice which was traditional, and common to
the Jews with other Oriental nations. His aim is therefore to regulate
and thus to mitigate an evil which he could not extirpate.

[Deuteronomy 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 24:6</span></span>

Compare [Exo 22:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md).

[Deuteronomy 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 24:7</span></span>

Compare [Deu 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#014.md); and [Exo
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#016.md).

[Deuteronomy 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 24:10</span></span>

Compare [Exo 22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md).

[Deu 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md)

Righteousness unto thee - Compare [Deu
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md) note.

[Deuteronomy 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 24:16</span></span>

A caution addressed to earthly judges. Among other Oriental nations the
family of a criminal was commonly involved in his punishment (compare
[Est 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#013).md). In Israel it was not to
be so; compare marginal references.

[Deuteronomy 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 24:17</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. The motive assigned for these various
acts of consideration is one and the same [Deu
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#018.md), [Deu
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#022.md).
