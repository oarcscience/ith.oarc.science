### [1 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 9:1</span></span>

Rather, "So all Israel were reckoned ... the kings of Israel. And Judah
was carried away captive to Babylon for their transgressions."

[1 Chronicles 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 9:2</span></span>

The first inhabitants - i. e. the first inhabitants of the holy land
after the return from the captivity. They are enumerated under four
heads:

\(1\) Israelites, i. e. the mass of the laity, whether belonging to the
ten tribes or the two;

\(2\) priests;

\(3\) Levites; and

\(4\) the lowest order of the ministry, the Nethinims.

These last, whose name is derived from a root "to give," were a sort of
sacred slaves - persons "given" to the Levites to perform the more
laborious duties of the sanctuary. Some had been "given" as early as the
time of Moses [Num 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#047.md); and the
number afterward increased [Jos 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md);
[Ezr 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020.md). At the time of the return
from the captivity, owing to the small number of Levites who came back
[Ezr 2:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md), the services of the
Nethinims became very important. They are mentioned under the name of
Nethinims only in Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah.

[1 Chronicles 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 9:3</span></span>

The correspondence and the diversity between the account here and in
Nehemiah Neh. 11:4-19 are explained by the probability that both writers
drew from a common and fuller document. They selected, in some
instances, different names, or names which are now different through
corruption; and they frequently expressed the genealogies of the same
persons differently, both going on the principle of compression by means
of omissions, but omitting from their lists different links of the
chain.

[1 Chronicles 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 9:9</span></span>

The discrepancy between the numbers here and in Nehemiah [Neh
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#008.md) may arise from corruption. So in
[Ch1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#013.md), [Ch1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md).

[1 Chronicles 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 9:10</span></span>

"Jedaiah," "Jehoiarib," and "Jachin," are not here names of individuals
but of priestly families. From [Ch1
24:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#007.md), it appears that Jehoiarib was
the original head of the first "course," Jedaiah of the second shift,
and Jachin of the twenty-first shift.

[1 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 9:18</span></span>

Who hitherto waited - Translate, "Who to this day waits. These were the
porters in the stations of the sons of Levi." The words of the first
clause refer to Shallum, and imply that, whereas Shallum (or his house)
had originally the general superintendence of the temple gates, a change
had been made when the author wrote, and Shallum's charge had become the
east gate only. The second clause means; "these were the porters in
those fixed stations at the outer gates of the Temple, which
corresponded to the camp stations of the Levites who guarded the
tabernacle in the early times."

[1 Chronicles 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 9:19</span></span>

Shallum the son of Kore - A different person from the Shallum of [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md), and with a different office,
namely, the guarding the inner doors of the temple. The original
Shallum, Shelemaiah, or Meshelemaiah, was a Levite of the time of David
[Ch1 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#014.md). His descendants were still
called by his name, but had now a more important charge assigned to
them.

[1 Chronicles 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 9:22</span></span>

The porters, like the singers [Neh
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#029.md), dwelt for the most part in the
villages round Jerusalem. They were the descendants of those originally
selected for the work by David. David's arrangements are here regarded
as having had the sanction of Samuel - which would imply that he planned
them in the lifetime of Saul, while he was still a fugitive and an
outlaw.

[1 Chronicles 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 9:25</span></span>

See the marginal references. If the number of warders was, as stated in
Nehemiah ([Neh 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019).md) 172 (i. e. 168
besides the four chief warders), and the number employed at any one time
was, as under David [Ch1 26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md),
twenty-four, then the turn of the courses to keep ward came every seven
weeks.

[1 Chronicles 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 9:26</span></span>

Rather, "For the four chief porters, who were themselves Levites, were
in trust, who also had the charge of the chambers, etc." A contrast
seems intended between the four chief porters, whose charge was
constant, and the remainder, who kept watch by turns.

[1 Chronicles 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 9:28</span></span>

By tale - literally, "by number." The vessels for service taken out of
the treasury were counted, that the same number should be returned to
the treasury after the service was over,

[1 Chronicles 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 9:31</span></span>

Mattithiah ... the first-born of Shallum the Korahite - This Shallum
would seem to be the person mentioned in [Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019.md), whose actual first-born was
Zechariah [Ch1 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#002.md). Mattithiah may
have been his eldest lineal descendant at the time here spoken of.

[1 Chronicles 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 9:33</span></span>

The singers - No names follow, and it is thought that they have fallen
out.

Were free - "Free," i. e. from any special duties besides those of
supervision, which was so arranged among the overseers that someone
exercised it during every part of both day and night.

[1 Chronicles 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 9:34</span></span>

Chief throughout their generations - The superintendents, that is, were
the genealogical head of the different Levitical divisions, and bore
special rule, each over those of his own blood and race. The hereditary
principle prevailed, not only in the high priesthood, but also in the
priestly offices of the second rank.

[1 Chronicles 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 9:35</span></span>

An almost exact repetition of [Ch1
8:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029.md); and probably intentionally
made by the author. In order to connect the genealogical section of his
work with the historical, he re-introduces the genealogy of the person
with whose death his historical section opens.
