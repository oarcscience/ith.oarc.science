### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 9:1</span></span>

The genealogy of Saul is here given as far as Aphiah ("Abiah," [Ch1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#008)), who was of the house of Becher
the son of Benjamin [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021). "Kish"
[Ch1 9:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035) was the son of "Ner" the
son of "Jehiel," (or, "Abiel" here and [Sa1
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#051)), the first settler ("father,"
[Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035)) at Gibeon, or Gibeah of
Saul, and who married "Maachah," a daughter or granddaughter of Caleb.
If so, it is obvious that the names of several generations are omitted
between Kish and Abiel, and among them that from which the family of
Matri [Sa1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#021) was called.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#004)

The land of Shalisha was somewhere near Gilgal, i. e., Jiljulieh. It is
thought to derive its name from "three" (Shalosh) wadys which unite in
the wady of Karawa. The situation of Shalim is not known: its etymology
connects it more probably with the land of Shual [Sa1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017), apparently round Taiyibeh,
which was about nine miles from Gibeah.

Zuph - [Sa1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005), see [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001) note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 9:7</span></span>

Presents of bread or meat were as common as presents of money. (Compare
[Eze 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019); [Hos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 9:8</span></span>

The fourth part of a shekel - In value about sixpence. Probably the
shekel, like our early English silver coins, was divided into four
quarters by a cross, and actually subdivided, when required, into half
and quarter shekels.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 9:9</span></span>

This is manifestly a gloss inserted in the older narrative by the later
editor of the sacred text, to explain the use of the term in [Sa1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011), [Sa1
9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018). It is one among many
instances which prove how the very letter of the contemporary narratives
was preserved by those who in later times compiled the histories. We
cannot say exactly when the term "seer" became obsolete. See the
marginal references.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 9:13</span></span>

Before he go up - By this phrase we see that the high place was in the
highest part of the city. Like the "house of the god Berith" [Jdg
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046), it was probably the citadel of
Ramah. There was connected with the altar a room large enough for thirty
people to dine in [Sa1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 9:16</span></span>

That he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, etc. -
These words are not very easily reconcileable with [Sa1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013). It is possible that the
aggressive movements of the Philistines, after the long cessation
indicated by [Sa1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013), coupled with
Samuel's old age and consequent inability to lead them to victory as
before, were among the chief causes which led to the cry for a king. If
this were so the Philistine oppression glanced at in this verse might in
a general survey be rather connected with Saul's times than with
Samuel's.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 9:21</span></span>

The tribe of Benjamin, originally the smallest of all the tribes [Num
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#036), if Ephraim and Manasseh are
reckoned as one tribe, had been nearly annihilated by the civil war
recorded in Judg. 20. It had of course not recovered from that terrible
calamity in the time of Saul, and was doubtless literally much the
smallest tribe at that time. Nothing could be more improbable, humanly
speaking, than that this weak tribe should give a ruler to the mighty
tribes of Joseph and Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 9:22</span></span>

The parlour - The "hall" or "cell" attached to the chapel on the high
place, in which the sacrificial feast was accustomed to be held.
(Compare [Ch1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 9:24</span></span>

The shoulder and its appurtenances - would give the sense accurately.
The right shoulder was the priest's portion in the Levitical sacrifices.
Probably it was Samuel's own portion in this case, and he gave it to
Saul as a mark of the highest honor.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 9:26</span></span>

To the top of the house - "On the top." The bed on which Saul slept was
on the top of the house. It is very common in the East to provide extra
sleeping accommodation by placing a tent or awning on the house-top.
