### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 1:1</span></span>

Now - Rather, "and." The conjunction has here, probably, the same sort
of connecting force which it has at the opening of Joshua, Judges, 1
Samuel, etc., and implies that the historian regards his work as a
continuation of a preceding history.

King David - The expression "king David," instead of the simpler
"David," is characteristic of the writer of Kings. (See the introduction
to the Book of Kings) The phrase is comparatively rare in Chronicles and
Samuel.

Stricken in, years - David was perhaps now in his first year. He was
thirty years old when he was made king in Hebron [Sa2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md); he reigned in Hebron seven years
and six months [Sa2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#011.md); [Ch1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#004.md); and he reigned thirty-three years
at Jerusalem [Sa2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005.md). The expression
had here been used only of persons above eighty [Gen
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#011.md); [Gen
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#001.md); [Jos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md); [Jos
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#001.md) : but the Jews at this time were
not long-lived. No Jewish monarch after David, excepting Solomon and
Manasseh, exceeded sixty years.

Clothes - Probably "bed-clothes." The king was evidently bed-ridden [Kg1
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 1:2</span></span>

Since the Jewish law allowed polygamy, David's conduct in following -
what has been said to have been - physician's advice, was blameless.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 1:5</span></span>

The narrative concerning - Abishag, the Shunammite (see the margin
reference "a"), is introduced as necessary for a proper understanding of
Adonijah's later history (see [Kg1
2:13-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#013)..md) But even as it stands, it
heightens considerably the picture drawn of the poor king's weak and
helpless condition, of which Adonijah was not ashamed to take advantage
for his own aggrandizement. Adonijah was born while David reigned at
Hebron, and was therefore now between thirty-three and forty years of
age. He was David's fourth son, but had probably become the eldest by
the death of his three older brothers. He claimed the crown by right of
primogeniture [Kg1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015.md), and secretly
to his partisans (compare [Kg1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#010).md)
announced his intention of assuming the sovereignty. It was well known
to him, and perhaps to the Jews generally, that David intended to make
Solomon his successor [Kg1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#013.md).

To run before him - That is, he assumed the same quasi-royal state as
Absalom had done, when he contemplated rebellion [Sa2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 1:6</span></span>

Had not displeased him - i. e. "His father had never checked or thwarted
him all his life."

A very goodly man - Here, too, Adonijah resembled Absalom [Sa2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#025.md). The Jews, like the other
nations of antiquity, regarded the physical qualities of rulers as of
great importance, and wished their kings to be remarkable for strength,
stature, and beauty [Sa1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md).
Adonijah's personal advantages no doubt helped to draw the people to
him.

His mother ... - i. e. Haggith bare Adonijah after Maacah bare Absalom
[Sa2 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md). The words in italics are
not in the original; hence, some, by a slight alteration, read "David
begat him."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 1:7</span></span>

Joab's defection on this occasion, after his faithful adherence to David
during the troubles caused by Absalom 2 Sam. 18:2-17, may be accounted
for by his fear that Solomon would be a "man of rest" [Ch1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009.md) and by his preference for the
character of Adonijah. He may also have thought that Adonijah, as the
eldest son [Kg1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md), had almost a
right to succeed.

Abiathar's defection is still more surprising than Joab's. For his
history, see [Sa1 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md) note. Hereto,
David and he had been the firmest of friends. It has been conjectured
that he had grown jealous of Zadok, and feared being supplanted by him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 1:8</span></span>

There is some difficulty in understanding how Zadok and Abiathar came to
be both "priests" at this time, and in what relation they stood to one
another. The best explanation seems to be that Abiathar was the real
high priest, and officiated at the sanctuary containing the ark of the
covenant in Zion, while Zadok performed the offices of chief priest at
the tabernacle of Witness at Gibeon [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039.md).

For Benaiah, see [Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md); [Sa2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023.md); [Sa2
23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md). For Nathan, see [Sa2
7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md), [Sa2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#017.md); [Sa2
12:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md), [Sa2
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025.md). As privy to all David's plans
[Kg1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#024.md), he had no doubt fully
approved the order of succession which the king was known to intend.

Shimei and Rei - Shimei and Rei are perhaps David's two brothers, Shimma
and Raddai [Ch1 2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013.md).

Mighty men - Probably the company of 600, originally formed during
David's early wanderings [Sa1 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#013.md);
[Sa1 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002.md), and afterward maintained as
the most essential element of his standing army.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 1:9</span></span>

Adonijah's feast was probably of a sacrificial character, and intended
to inaugurate him as king. Compare the "sacrifices" of Absalom [Sa2
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md).

Zoheleth - No satisfactory explanation has been given of this name.
Large blocks of stone always attract attention in the East, and receive
names which are often drawn from some trivial circumstance. Sinai and
Palestine are full of such "Hajars," which correspond to the "Ebens" or
"stones" of Holy Scripture. (Compare [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md); [Jos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009.md); [Sa1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#014)..md) For En-Rogel, see the margin
reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 1:11</span></span>

The son of Haggith - Compare the margin reference. This expression was
well chosen to touch the pride of Bath-sheba. "Adonijah; not thy son,
but the son of thy rival, Haggith."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 1:12</span></span>

It would have been in accordance with general Eastern custom for Solomon
to suffer death, if Adonijah had succeeded in his attempt. But to have
executed his mother also would have been an unusual severity. Still,
such cases sometimes occurred: Cassander put to death Roxana, the widow
of Alexander the Great, at the same time with her son, the young
Alexander.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 1:14</span></span>

Confirm thy words - "Establish" them, by giving a second testimony.
Nathan thinks it best to move David's affections first through
Bath-sheba, before he comes in to discuss the matter as one of state
policy, and to take the king's orders upon it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 1:15</span></span>

Into the chamber - The "bed-chamber" or "inner chamber." Abishag was a
disinterested witness present, who heard all that Bath-sheba said to
David.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 1:16</span></span>

Bath-sheba bowed, like the woman of Tekoah [Sa2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#004.md), with the humble prostration of a
suppliant. Hence, the king's question, "What wouldest thou?"

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 1:20</span></span>

Tell them who shall sit on the throne - Side by side with what may be
called the natural right of hereditary succession, there existed in the
old world, and especially in the East, a right, if not of absolutely
designating a successor, yet at any rate of choosing one among several
sons. Thus, Cyrus designated Cambyses; and Darius designated Xerxes; and
a still more absolute right of nomination was exercised by some of the
Roman emperors.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 1:21</span></span>

Shall sleep - This euphemism for death, rare in the early Scriptures -
being found only once in the Pentateuch (margin reference.), and once
also in the historical books before Kings [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md) - becomes in Kings and Chronicles
the ordinary mode of speech (see [Kg1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#010.md); [Kg1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md), etc.; [Ch2
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#031.md); [Ch2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#016), etc..md). David uses the metaphor
in one psalm [Psa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003.md). In the later
Scriptures it is, of course, common. ([Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md); [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md); [Mat
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024.md); [Joh
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011.md); [Co1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md); [Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md); [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014), etc..md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 1:22</span></span>

Nathan came into the palace, not into the chamber, where he might not
enter unannounced. Bath-sheba retired before Nathan entered, in
accordance with Oriental ideas of propriety. So, when Bath-sheba was
again sent for [Kg1 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#028.md), Nathan
retired (compare [Kg1 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 1:24</span></span>

Hast thou said - Thou hast said. In the original no question is asked.
Nathan assumes, as far as words go, that the king has made this
declaration. He wishes to draw forth a disclaimer.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 1:29</span></span>

"As the Lord liveth" was the most common form of oath among the
Israelites (e. g. [Jdg 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019.md); [Sa1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#039.md); [Sa1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#006).md). It was unique to David to
attach a further clause to this oath - a clause of thankfulness for some
special mercy [Sa1 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034.md), or for God's
constant protection of him (here and in [Sa2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 1:31</span></span>

A lower and humbler obeisance than before [Kg1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#016.md). In the Assyrian sculptures
ambassadors are represented with their faces actually touching the earth
before the feet of the monarch.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 1:32</span></span>

The combination of the high priest, the prophet, and the captain of the
bodyguard (the Cherethites and Pelethites, [Kg1
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#038).md), would show the people that the
proceedings had the king's sanction. The order of the names marks the
position of the persons with respect to the matter in hand.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 1:33</span></span>

Mules and horses seem to have been first employed by the Israelites in
the reign of David, and the use of the former was at first confined to
great personages [Sa2 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029.md); [Sa2
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md). The rabbis tell us that it was
death to ride on the king's mule without his permission; and thus it
would be the more evident to all that the proceedings with respect to
Solomon had David's sanction.

Gihon - Probably the ancient name of the valley called afterward the
Tyropoeum, which ran from the present Damascus Gate, by Siloam, into the
Kedron vale, having the temple hill, or true Zion, on the left, and on
the right the modern Zion or ancient city of the Jebusites. The upper
"source" of the "waters of Gihon," which Hezekiah stopped (see the
margin reference), was probably in the neighborhood of the Damascus
Gate.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 1:34</span></span>

Anoint him - Inauguration into each of the three offices (those of
prophet, priest, and king) typical of the Messiah or Anointed One, was
by anointing with oil. Divine appointment had already instituted the
rite in connection with the kingly office [Sa2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md); but after Solomon we have no
express mention of the anointing of kings, except in the three cases of
Jehu, Joash, and Jehoahaz [Kg2 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006.md);
[Kg2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#012.md); [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md), who were all appointed
irregularly. At the time of the captivity, kings, whose anointing has
not been related in the historical books, still bear the title of "the
anointed of the Lord." [Lam 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md); [Psa
89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038.md), [Psa
89:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#051.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 1:35</span></span>

Over Israel and over Judah - There is no anticipation here of the
subsequent division of the kingdom; the antithesis between Judah and
Israel already existed in the reign of David [Sa2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009.md); [Sa2
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#011.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 1:37</span></span>

As the Lord hath been with my lord - This phrase expresses a very high
degree of divine favor. It occurs first in the promises of God to Isaac
[Gen 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#003.md), [Gen
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md) and Jacob [Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md). See further margin reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 1:39</span></span>

The tabernacle - Probably that which David had made for the ark of the
covenant on Mount Zion [Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md). For
the holy oil, see the margin reference. That it was part of the regular
furniture of the tabernacle appears from [Exo
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#011.md); [Exo
39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 1:40</span></span>

Piped with pipes - Some prefer "danced with dances" - a meaning which
the Hebrew would give by a change in the pointing, and the alteration of
one letter. But the change is unnecessary. (Flutepipes were known to the
Israelites [Sa1 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md); they were very
ancient in Egypt, and were known also to the Assyrians.

The earth rent - If the present Hebrew text is correct we have here a
strong instance of Oriental hyperbole. But it is suspected that there is
a slight corruption, and that the verb really used meant "resounded."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 1:42</span></span>

Jonathan had acted in a similar capacity, as a carrier of intelligence,
in the time of Absalom's attempt [Sa2
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#036.md); [Sa2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#017.md); but at that time, like his
father, he was faithful to David, and "a valiant man," "a virtuous man,"
or "a man of worth." (See [Kg1 1:52](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#052.md);
[Pro 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004)..md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 1:43</span></span>

Verily - "Nay, but" (or, "Not so").

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 1:47</span></span>

The king bowed himself - The king worshipped God and prayed that it
might be so. Compare [Gen 47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031.md), with
margin reference, [Heb 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">kg1 1:50</span></span>

On the "horns" of the altar, see [Exo
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#002.md) note. The altar to which Adonijah
fled was probably in the "tabernacle" already referred to [Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:52](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">kg1 1:52</span></span>

There shalt not an hair ... - This was a proverbial expression, meaning
"he shall suffer no hurt at all." Solomon's clemency in pardoning
Adonijah is very remarkable. In the East not only are pretenders almost
always punished with death, but it has often been the custom for each
king upon his accession to put to death all his brothers as mere
possible pretenders.
