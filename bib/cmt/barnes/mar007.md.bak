### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

[Mark 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 7:1</span></span>

See this passage explained in the notes at Mat. 15:1-20.

[Mar 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

Came from Jerusalem - Probably to observe his conduct, and to find
matter of accusation against him.

[Mar 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md)

Defiled hands - The hands were considered defiled or polluted unless
they were washed previous to every meal.

[Mar 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md)

Except they wash their hands oft - Our word "oft" means frequently,
often. The Greek wore translated oft has been rendered various ways.
Some have said that it means "up to the wrist" - unless they wash their
hands up to the wrist. Others have said up to the elbow." There is
evidence that the Pharisees had some such foolish rule as this about
washing, and it is likely that they practiced it faithfully. But the
Greek Word πυγμή pugmē - means properly the "fist," and the meaning here
is, "Unless they wash their hands (rubbing them) with the fist" - that
is, not merely dipping the finger or hands in water as a sign of
ablution, but rubbing the hands together as a ball or fist, in the usual
Oriental manner when water is poured over them. Hence, the phrase comes
to mean "diligently, carefully, sedulously." - Robinson, Lexicon. The
idea is, unless they pay the utmost attention to it, and do it carefully
and according to rule.

The tradition - What had been handed down; not what was delivered "by
writing" in the law of Moses, but what had been communicated from father
to son as being proper and binding.

The elders - The ancients; not the old men "then living," but those who
had lived formerly.

[Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004.md)

Market - This word means either the place where provisions were sold, or
the place where men were convened for any purpose. Here it probably
means the former.

Except they wash - In the original, "Except they baptize." In this place
it does not mean to immerse the whole body, but only the hands. There is
no evidence that the Jews washed their "whole bodies" every time they
came from market. It is probable that they often washed with the use of
a very small quantity of water.

The washing of cups - In the Greek, "the baptism of cups."

Cups - drinking vessels. Those used at their meals.

Pots - Measures of "liquids." Vessels made of wood, used to hold wine,
vinegar, etc.

brazen vessels - Vessels made of brass, used in cooking or otherwise.
These, if much polluted, were commonly passed through the fire: if
slightly polluted they were washed. Earthen vessels, if defiled, were
usually broken.

Tables - This word means, in the original, "beds or couches." It refers
not to the "tables" on which they ate, but to the "couches" on which
they reclined at their meals. See the notes at [Mat
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md). These were supposed to be
defiled when any unclean or polluted person had reclined on them, and
they deemed it necessary to purify them with water. The word "baptism"
is here used - in the original, "the baptism of tables;" but, since it
cannot be supposed that "couches" were entirely "immersed" in water, the
word "baptism" here must denote some other application of water, by
sprinkling or otherwise, and shows that the term is used in the sense of
washing in any way. If the word is used here, as is clear it is, to
denote anything except entire immersion, it may be elsewhere, and
baptism is lawfully performed, therefore, without immersing the whole
body in water.

[Mar 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#007.md)

For doctrines - For commands of God binding on the conscience. Imposing
"your" traditions as equal in authority to the laws of God.

[Mar 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008.md)

Laying aside - Rejecting, or making, it give place to traditions;
considering the traditions as superior in authority to the divine law.
This was the uniform doctrine of the Pharisees. See the notes at [Mat
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md).

The tradition of men - What has been handed down by human beings, or
what rests solely on their authority.

[Mar 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#009.md)

Full well - These words are capable of different interpretations. Some
read them as a question: "Do ye do well in rejecting?" etc. Others
suppose they mean "skillfully, cunningly." "You show great cunning or
art, in laying aside God's commands and substituting in their place
those of men." Others suppose them to be ironical. "How nobly you act!
From conscientious attachment to your traditions you have made void the
law of God;" meaning to intimate by it that they had acted wickedly and
basely.

[Mar 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#017.md)

The parable - The "obscure" and difficult remarks which he had made in
[Mar 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#015.md). The word "parable," here,
means "obscure" and "difficult saying." They could not understand it.
They had probably imbibed many of the popular notions of the Pharisees,
and they could not understand why a man was not defiled by external
things. It was, moreover, a doctrine of the law that men were
ceremonially polluted by contact with dead bodies, etc., and they could
not understand how it could be otherwise.

[Mar 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018.md)

Cannot defile him - Cannot render his "soul" polluted; cannot make him a
"sinner" so as to need this purifying as a "religious" observance.

[Mar 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019.md)

Entereth not into his heart - Does not reach or affect the "mind," the
"soul," and consequently cannot pollute it. Even if it should affect the
"body," yet it cannot the "soul," and consequently cannot need to be
cleansed by a religious ordinance. The notions of the Pharisees,
therefore, are not founded in reason, but are mere "superstition."

The draught - The sink, the vault. "Purging all meats." The word
"purging," here, means to purify, to cleanse. What is thrown out of the
body is the innutritious part of the food taken into the stomach, and
leaving only that which is proper for the support of life; and it
cannot, therefore, defile the soul.

All meals - All food; all that is taken into the body to support life.
The meaning is, that the economy or process by which life is supported
"purifies" or "renders nutritious" all kinds of food. The unwholesome or
innutritious parts are separated, and the wholesome only are taken into
the system. This agrees with all that has since been discovered of the
process of digestion and of the support of life. The food taken into the
stomach is by the gastric juice converted into a thick pulp called
chyme. The nutritious part of this is conveyed into small vessels, and
changed into a milky substance called "chyle." This is poured by the
thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein and mingles with the blood,
and conveys nutriment and support to all parts of the system. The
useless parts of the food are thrown off.

[Mar 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#020.md)

Hat which cometh out of the man - His words; the expression of his
thoughts and feelings; his conduct, as the development of inward malice,
anger, covetousness, lust, etc.

Defileth the man - Makes him really polluted or offensive in the sight
of God. This renders the soul corrupt and abominable in his sight. See
[Mat 15:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018.md).

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

See this miracle explained in the notes at [Mat
15:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021.md).

[Mar 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md)

Would have no man know it - To avoid the designs of the Pharisees he
wished to be retired.

[Mar 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026.md)

A Greek - The Jews called all persons "Greeks" who were not of their
nation. Compare [Rom 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md). The whole
world was considered as divided into Jews and Greeks. Though she might
not have been strictly a "Greek," yet she came under this general
appellation as a foreigner.

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

Departing from the coasts - The country or regions of Tyre.

Came unto the sea of Galilee - The Sea of Tiberias. See the notes at
[Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

Decapolis - See the notes at [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md). He did not go immediately into
Capernaum, or any city where he was known, but into the retired regions
around the Sea of Galilee. This was done to avoid the designs of the
Pharisees, who sought his life.

[Mark 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 7:32</span></span>

They bring - That is, his friends brought, or the people brought.

One that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech - Not entirely
mute, but who spoke indistinctly or with difficulty. His deafness might
not have been of long standing, and his speech, therefore, not entirely
ruined.

To put his hand upon him - That is, to cure him. Blessings were commonly
imparted by laying on the hands.

[Mark 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 7:33</span></span>

And he took him aside from the multitude - Why this was done we have no
means of information. It might have been to conceal from the multitude
everything respecting the "manner" of cure, in order that none might
attempt to cure in a similar way.

And he put his fingers into his ears ... - Why this was done it has been
found exceedingly difficult to explain. Jesus had power at once to open
his ears and loose his tongue, but for some cause he chose to accompany
it with a sign. This was intended, probably, simply to denote that the
power of healing came from him; to satisfy the man by the touch that he
had this power, and that it could come from no other quarter. Our
Saviour often used signs in this way to denote his power to heal. See
[Mar 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md); [Joh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md).

[Mark 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 7:34</span></span>

Looked up to heaven - To lift up the eyes to heaven is an act imploring
aid from God, and is an attitude of prayer, [Psa
121:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md); [Mar
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041.md); [Joh
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md).

He sighed - Pitying the sufferings of the man who stood before him.

Ephphatha - This word is "Syriac," the language which our Lord used in
addressing the man, and means "Be opened."

[Mark 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 7:35</span></span>

The string of his tongue was loosed - The difficulty in his speaking was
removed.

[Mark 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 7:36</span></span>

Tell no man - Do not noise it abroad. He was not ambitious of being
known, and he knew that if much was said of his cures, it would excite
the jealousy of the Pharisees and endanger his life.

[Mark 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 7:37</span></span>

Beyond measure - Exceedingly; very much. In the Greek, "Very
abundantly."

He hath done all things well - All things in a remarkable manner; or, he
has perfectly effected the cure of this deaf-mute.
