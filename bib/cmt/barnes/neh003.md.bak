### [Nehemiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 3:1</span></span>

Eliashib (compare the marginal reference) was the grandson of Joshua,
the high priest contemporary with Zerubbabel.

The sheep gate - This was a gate in the eastern wall, not far from the
pool of Bethesda, marginal reference, which was perhaps originally a
sheep-pool.

The exact line which the writer follows in describing the circuit of the
wall will probably be always a matter of dispute. According to the view
here taken, the line described commences near the pool of Bethesda, on
the east of the city, and is traced thence, first, northward, then
westward, then southward, and finally eastward, as far as the pool of
Siloam [Neh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md). From this point, it
seems to the writer of this note that the line of the outer wall is not
followed, but, instead of this, the inner wall of the "city of David,"
which included the temple, is traced. This wall is followed northward
from the pool of Siloam, past the "sepulchres of David" and Hezekiah's
pool to the "armoury" [Neh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md) at its
northwest corner; it is then followed eastward to "the tower which lieth
out from the king's house" [Neh 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md);
from this it is carried southward, along the western edge of the Kidron
valley to the "great tower which lieth out" [Neh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md), and then southwestward to the
point at which it commenced near Siloam [Neh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md). The special wall of the "city of
David" being thus completed, the writer finishes his entire account by
filling up the small interval between the northeast angle of this
fortification and the "sheep-gate" [Neh
3:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028.md), from which he started.

They sanctified it - The priests commenced the work with a formal
ceremony of consecration. When the work was completed, there was a
solemn dedication of the entire circuit (see Neh. 12:27-43).

The tower of Hananeel is often mentioned; that of Meah, or rather
Hammeah, or "the Hundred," in Nehemiah only. Both towers must have been
situated toward the northeastern corner of the city.

[Nehemiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 3:2</span></span>

The people of each provincial town were set to work for the most part on
the portion of the wall nearest their city. Thus, "the men of Jericho,"
were employed at the northeast corner of Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 3:3</span></span>

The fish gate - The gate through which fish from the Jordan and the Sea
of Galilee entered Jerusalem; a gate in the north wall, a little to the
east of the modern Damascus gate.

Locks - The word used (here and in [Neh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006.md), [Neh
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013).md) is thought to mean rather a
"cross-bar" than a lock, while that translated "bars" is regarded as
denoting the "hooks" or "catches" which held the cross-bar at its two
ends.

[Nehemiah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 3:5</span></span>

Tekoites - See [Sa2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md) note.

[Nehemiah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 3:6</span></span>

The old gate - Either the modern Damascus gate, the main entrance to the
city on the north side; or a gate a little further eastward.

[Nehemiah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 3:7</span></span>

Unto the throne ... - The meaning is thought to be "the men of Gibeon
and Mizpah, who, though they worked for Nehemiah, were not under his
government, but belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor on this
side the river."

[Nehemiah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 3:11</span></span>

The other piece - Rather, "another piece" (as in [Neh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md), [Neh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#021.md), [Neh
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md), [Neh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#030).md). It is conjectured that a verse
has fallen out in which Malchijah's and Hashub's "first piece" was
mentioned.

The tower of the furnaces - Either a tower at the northwestern angle of
the city; or, midway in the western wall. The origin of the name is
uncertain.

[Nehemiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 3:13</span></span>

Zanoah lay west of Jerusalem, at the distance of about 10 miles ([Jos
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034) note.md).

[Nehemiah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 3:15</span></span>

The "pool of Siloah" lies at the southwestern foot of the temple hill,
near the lower end of the Tyropoeon. It appears to have been at all
times beyond the line of the city wall, but was perhaps joined to the
city by a fortification of its own.

The king's gardens - See [Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md)
note.

The stairs - A flight of steps, still to be seen, led from the low
valley of the Tyropoeon up the steep sides of Ophel to the "city of
David," which it reached probably at a point not far south of the
temple.

[Nehemiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 3:16</span></span>

Beth-zur - Now Beit-sur, on the road from Jerusalem to Hebron [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058.md).

By "the sepulchres of David" must be understood the burial place in
which David and the kings his descendants to the time of Hezekiah were
interred. This was an excavation in the rock, in the near vicinity of
the temple [Eze 43:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md), and on its
western side. The position of the burial-place was well known until the
destruction of the city by Titus; but modern research has not yet
discovered it.

The pool - Probably that made by Hezekiah in the Tyropoeon valley, west
of the temple area (marginal reference).

[Nehemiah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 3:17</span></span>

The constant mention of "priests," "Levites," and Nethinims,"
sufficiently indicates that the writer is here concerned with the
sacerdotal quarter, that immediately about the temple.

[Neh 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#018.md)

Bavai - Or, "Binnui" [Neh 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#024.md); [Neh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#009.md).

The armoury at the turning of the wall - literally, "the armoury of the
corner." The northwestern corner of the special wall of the "city of
David" seems to be intended. See [Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md) note.

[Neh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#020.md)

The other piece - Rather, "another piece." The notice of Baruch's first
piece, like that of Malchijah's and Hashub's [Neh
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#011.md), seems to have slipped out of the
text.

[Neh 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#022.md)

The word here translated "plain" is applied in the rest of Scripture
almost exclusively to the Ghor or Jordan valley. Compare, however, [Neh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#028.md).

[Neh 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#024.md)

The turning of the wall - The northeastern angle of the "city of David"
seems here to be reached. At this point a tower "lay out" [Neh
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md), or projected extraordinarily,
from the wall, being probably a watch-tower commanding the Kidron valley
and all the approaches to the city from the southeast, the east, and the
northeast.

[Neh 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md)

The "king's high house" is almost certainly the old palace of David,
which was on the temple hill, and probably occupied a position directly
north of the temple.

That was by the court of the prison - Prisons were in old times adjuncts
of palaces. The palace of David must have had its prison; and the
"prison gate" [Neh 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039.md) was clearly
in this quarter.

[Neh 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026.md)

The marginal reading is better. On the Nethinims see [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md) note.

Ophel was the slope south of the temple (see the marginal reference "y"
note); and the water-gate, a gate in the eastern wall, either for the
escape of the superfluous water from the temple reservoirs, or for the
introduction of water from the Kidron valley when the reservoirs were
low.

[Neh 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027.md)

The foundations of an outlying tower near the southeast angle of the
temple area in this position have been recently discovered.

[Neh 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#028.md)

"The horse gate" was on the east side of the city, overlooking the
Kidron valley. It seems to have been a gate by which horses approached
and left the old palace, that of David, which lay north of the temple
[Neh 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md).

[Nehemiah 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 3:31</span></span>

The gate Miphkad - Not elsewhere mentioned. It must have been in the
east, or northeast, wall, a little to the south of the "sheep-gate"
