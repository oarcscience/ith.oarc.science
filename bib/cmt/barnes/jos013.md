### [Joshua Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 13:0</span></span>

Here commences the second portion of the book, the statements of which
were drawn from pre-existing documentary records (compare [Jos
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#009).md); the whole of the history being
introduced by a command of God to Joshua to proceed to allot the land
among the tribes.

[Joshua 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 13:1</span></span>

Joshua is bidden to allot the whole of the promised land among the
twelve tribes in faith that God would perfect in due time that expulsion
of the Canaanites which Joshua himself could not carry further (see [Jos
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023).md).

[Joshua 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 13:2</span></span>

This and [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md) name the still
unconquered districts in the southern half of the land, [Jos
13:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md) those in the north.

Geshuri - A district on the south of Philistia, the inhabitants of which
are again named in [Sa1 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md); but are
not to be confounded with the land of the Geshurites mentioned in [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md); [Jos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005.md).

[Joshua 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 13:3</span></span>

Sihor is derived from a root signifying "to be black," and is suitable
enough as an appellative of the Nile [Isa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md). Here it most probably stands for
"the river of Egypt" ([Num 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003) note.md),
the modern "Wady el Arish".

Ekron ("Akir") lay on the northern boundary of Judah [Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011.md), and was actually conquered by
the men of that tribe [Jdg 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md),
though assigned in the allotment of the land to Dan [Jos
19:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#043.md). It seems to have fallen again
into the hands of the Philistines in the days of the Judges [Sa1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#010.md), was reconquered by Samuel
(compare [Sa1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014).md), but figures in
subsequent times as a Philistine city only (compare [Sa1
17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md); [Kg2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md), [Kg2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#016), etc..md).

Lords - The Hebrew word סרן seren means "an axle," and is applied as a
title special to the chiefs (compare [Jdg
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003) and marginal references.md) of the
Philistines [Gen 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014.md).

Gaza was the most southern of the Philistine cities (compare [Jos
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041.md); [Jos
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#022).md). It was allotted to the tribe
of Judah [Jos 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047.md), and was, with
Askalon, taken by the warriors of that tribe [Jdg
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md). Both cities were soon
re-occupied by the Philistines, and subsequently are always mentioned as
Philistine cities. Gaza lay on the direct route of the Egyptian armies
in their invasions of Syria, by whom it was captured more than once.
Special judgments are denounced against Gaza for the cruelty of its
people toward the Jews in the time of their humiliation [Amo
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md); [Zep
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md); [Zac
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md), and in the time of Jerome the
ancient city was a ruin of which the foundations could hardly be traced,
and the then existing town was built on another site. Gaza was in later
times an episcopal see, and is now a thriving place containing some
15,000 inhabitants, a larger population than that of Jerusalem.

Ashdod ("Esdud;" Azotus, [Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040).md)
was, like Gaza, allotted to Judah (see [Jos
15:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#046).md), but was soon regained by
the Philistines, and became a principal seat of their Dagon worship.
Here the ark of God was taken after its capture by the Philistines ([Sa1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001) ff.md). Its name ( "fortress,"
"castle"), no less than its history (compare [Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md); [Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007), etc..md) indicates its importance as
a stronghold; it withstood for twenty-nine years the longest siege on
record by the Egyptian king Psammetichus. Like Gaza, it was doomed by
the Jewish prophets to desolation, and it was utterly destroyed by the
Maccabees (1 Macc. 10:77-84; 11:4). It was, however, rebuilt by the
Romans, and figures in Christian times as an episcopal city.

Askelon (see [Jdg 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018).md), the
birthplace of Herod the Great, figures as an important town and seaport
in the history of the Crusades, and very massive ruins still attest the
ancient strength and grandeur of the place. It is situated about midway
between Gaza and Ashdod.

Gath seems to have been first taken by David [Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md). It is not named again in the
book of Joshua. It was the town of Goliath [Sa1
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md), and is mentioned in David's
elegy over Saul as a leading Philistine city [Sa2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md). It was the nearest of the
Philistine cities to Jerusalem, but both the name and the city have
perished; its site is conjecturally placed (by Condor) at Tell es Safi.

Avites - See [Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md) note.

[Joshua 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 13:4</span></span>

Read "on the south," and connect the words with the verse preceding.
They indicate the southern limit of the still unconquered territory in
this neighborhood, as [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md) gives
the northern one.

Mearah - The "cave" (see the margin) has been referred to "Mugar Jczzin"
("cave of Jezzin"), between Tyre and Sidon, or to a district
characterized by deep cave-like ravines near Sidon and Dan-Laish.

[Joshua 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 13:5</span></span>

Giblites - The people of Gebal ("Jebail", 22 miles north of Beyronut).
They were "stone-squarers" [Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md)
and (ship) "caulkers" [Eze 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 13:6</span></span>

The King James Version would exhibit the sense more clearly if the words
from the beginning of [Jos 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md) to the
words "the Sidonians" in this verse were placed in a parenthesis, and
the order of the words before us changed thus: "I will drive them out."
The "them" meaning the inhabitants of the "very much land to be
possessed," spoken of in [Jos 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md).

[Joshua 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 13:8</span></span>

The writer appends to the command of God [Jos
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md) a statement that the other two
tribes and a half had already had their inheritance marked out for them
by Moses in the land east of Jordan. The boundaries of this territory as
a whole are first set forth [Jos
13:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md), and afterward the portions
assigned within it to the two tribes and a half are severally described
Josh. 13:15-33.

[Jos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014.md)

See [Deu 18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md) and notes.

[Jos 13:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md)

Inheritance of the tribe of Reuben. This territory was the most
southerly of the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel, and adjoined
Moab, which lay only on the other side of the Arnon. Hence, the
Reubenites became in after times much intermixed with the Moabites, who
in fact eventually acquired much of the land, and several, if not all,
of the cities here named as belonging to Reuben. This acquisition was
probably assisted by the fact that the territory north of Arnon had
formerly belonged to the Moabites, from whom it was wrested by the
Amorites (see [Num 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027), etc. notes.md).
It is not likely that the Amorite conquerors had completely extirpated
the Moabite inhabitants. Hence, in the days when the Reubenites became
engrossed in their pastoral pursuits, and probably not very long after
the days of Joshua, the Moabites easily encroached on their inheritance,
and in the end probably reoccupied nearly the whole of the ancient
kingdom of Sihon (Compare [Deu 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md)
note).

[Jos 13:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017.md)

See the marginal references for some of these names. Heshbon, Kedemoth,
and Mephaath became eventually Levitical cities.

[Jos 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md)

Dukes of Sihon - Rather "vassals of Sihon," probably those "dedicated"
or "appointed" with a libation.

[Jos 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023.md)

Jordan ... - i. e. the Jordan and its territory (compare similar
expressions in [Num 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006.md); [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016).md). The portion of the tribe of
Reuben at its northern extremity touched the Jordan; the main part of
his inheritance lay on the east of the Dead Sea.

[Jos 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md)

All the cities of Gilead - i. e. of Gilead in the narrower sense,
included in the territory of Sihon, and distinct from Bashan [Deu
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md).

Half the land of the children of Ammon - i. e. that half of the Ammonite
territory which had been conquered by the Amorites. This, after the
overthrow of Sihon, the Israelites took for their own. The land which
the Ammonites still held in the days of Moses, the Israelites were not
permitted to attack.

Rabbah was a border fortress, the principal stronghold of the Ammonites
[Num 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#024.md), and the residence of their
king. It was attacked and taken by Joab 2 Sam. 11; 12; [Ch1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001.md), but appears in later times again
as an Ammonitish city [Jer 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md); [Eze
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md); [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md). In the third century B.C. it
received from Ptolemy Philadelplus the name of Philadelphia, and was in
later times the seat of a Christian bishop; but has now for many
centuries been in ruins, remarkable for their grandeur and extent.

[Jos 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md)

The border of Debir - Rather perhaps "the border of Lidbir," which is
regarded as identical with the Lo-debar of [Sa2
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#004.md); [Sa2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027.md), one of the towns from which
provisions were brought to David at Mahanaim [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md).

[Jos 13:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md)

On the conquest of Bashan, see especially [Num
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033.md), etc. and notes.
