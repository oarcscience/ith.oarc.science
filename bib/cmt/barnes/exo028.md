### [Exodus Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 28:1</span></span>

(Compare Exo. 39:1-31.) Moses is now commanded to commit all that
pertains to the offerings made to the Lord in the sanctuary to the
exclusive charge of the members of a single family, who were to hold
their office from generation to generation. In the patriarchal times,
the external rites of worship had generally been conducted by the head
of the tribe or family, in accordance with the principle involved in the
dedication of the firstborn [Exo 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md);
[Num 3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012.md). Moses, as the
divinely-appointed and acknowledged leader of the nation, had, on a
special occasion, appointed those who were to offer sacrifice, and had
himself sprinkled the consecrating blood of the victims on the people
[Exo 24:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md), [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md). On the completion of the
tabernacle, after Aaron and his sons had been called to the priesthood,
he took chief part in the daily service of the sanctuary [Exo
40:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023.md), [Exo
40:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#031.md) until the consecration of the
family of Aaron, on which occasion he appears to have exercised the
priest's office for the last time (Lev. 8:14-29; compare Exo. 29:10-26).
The setting apart of the whole tribe of Levi for the entire cycle of
religious services is mentioned [Num
3:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005.md); 8:5-26; 18:1-32.

[Exo 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001.md)

Nadab and Abihu, the two older sons of Aaron, had accompanied their
father and the seventy Elders when they went a part of the way with
Moses up the mountain [Exo 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md), [Exo
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md). Soon after their consecration
they were destroyed for offering "strange fire before the Lord" [Lev
10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md). Eleazar and Ithamar are here
mentioned for the first time, except in the genealogy, [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md). Eleazar succeeded his father in
the High priesthood, and was himself succeeded by his son Phinehas [Jdg
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028.md). But Eli, the next high priest
named in the history, was of the line of Ithamar. The representatives of
both families held office at the same time in the days of David. See
[Ch1 24:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md); [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md).

[Exo 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003.md)

The spirit of wisdom - See [Exo 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003.md)
note. What may be especially noticed in this place is, that the spirit
of wisdom given by the Lord is spoken of as conferring practical skill
in the most general sense.

Garments to consecrate him - A solemn recognition of the significance of
an appointed official dress. It expresses that the office is not created
or defined by the man himself [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md), but that he is invested with it
according to prescribed institution. The rite of anointing was
essentially connected with investiture in the holy garments [Exo
29:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029.md); [Exo
40:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#012.md). The history of all nations
shows the importance of these forms.

[Exo 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#005.md)

With the exception of the gold, the materials were the same as those of
the tabernacle-cloth, the veil of the tabernacle and the
entrance-curtain of the tent [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md), [Exo
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md), [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md); [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md). The gold was made into thin flat
wires which could either be woven with the woolen and linen threads, or
worked with the needle. In regard to the mixture of linen and woollen
threads in the High priest's dress, see [Lev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md).

[Exo 28:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006.md)

The ephod - [Exo 39:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#002.md). The Hebrew
word has the same breadth of meaning as our word vestment. The garment
was worn over the shoulders, and was the distinctive vestment of the
High priest, to which "the breast-plate of judgment" was attached [Exo
28:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#025.md).

Cunninq work - Skilled work, or work of a skilled man [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md).

[Exo 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#007.md)

Compare [Exo 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#004.md). The ephod consisted
of two principal pieces of cloth, one for the back and the other for the
front, joined together by shoulder straps (see [Exo
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#027) note.md). Below the arms, probably
just above the hips, the two pieces were kept in place by a band
attached to one of the pieces. On the respect in which the ephod of the
High priest was held, see [Sa1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#028.md);
[Sa1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md); [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md); [Sa1
23:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md); [Sa1
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007.md). But an ephod made of linen
appears to have been a recognized garment not only for the common
priests [Sa1 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018.md), but also for those
who were even temporarily engaged in the service of the sanctuary [Sa1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018.md); [Sa2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md); [Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md).

[Exo 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008.md)

The curious girdle ... - Rather: the band for fastening it, which is
upon it, shall be of the same work, of one piece with it. This band
being woven on to one of the pieces of the ephod, was passed round the
body, and fastened by buttons, or strings, or some other suitable
contrivance.

[Exo 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#011.md)

Like the engravings of a signet - Compare [Exo
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#021.md), [Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md). These words probably refer to a
special way of shaping the letters, adapted for engraving on a hard
substance. Seal engraving on precious stones was practiced in Egypt from
very remote times.

Ouches of gold - Gold settings formed not of solid pieces of metal, but
of woven wire, wreathed round the stones in what is called cloisonnee
work, a sort of filigree, often found in Egyptian ornaments. These
stones, as well as those on the breastplate, were perhaps in the form of
ovals, or rather ellipses, like the cartouches, containing proper names,
in hieroglyphic inscriptions. The word "ouches" is used by Shakespeare,
Spenser, and some of their contemporaries in the general sense of
"jewels."

[Exo 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#012.md)

Upon the shoulders - i. e. upon the shoulder pieces of the ephod. See
[Exo 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#007.md).

Upon his two shoulders - Compare [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md). The high priest had to
represent the Twelve tribes in the presence of Yahweh; and the burden of
his office could not be so aptly symbolized anywhere as on his
shoulders, the parts of the body fittest for carrying burdens.

Verse 13-30

Compare [Exo 39:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#008.md).

[Exo 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#014.md)

Rather, two chains of pure gold shalt thou make of wreathen work,
twisted like cords. They were more like cords of twisted gold wire than
chains in the ordinary sense of the word. Such chains have been found in
Egyptian tombs.

[Exo 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015.md)

The breastplate of judgment - The meaning of the Hebrew word rendered
"breastplate," appears to be simply "ornament". The term breastplate
relates merely to its place in the dress.

[Exo 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#016.md)

Doubled - To give it stability, or to form what was used as a bag for
the Urim and Thummim: the latter appears to be the more likely.

[Exo 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#017.md)

Settings - Ouches of "cloisonnec" work, like those mentioned in [Exo
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#011.md).

A sardius - i. e. "the red stone." The Sardian stone, or sard, was much
used by the ancients for seals; and it is perhaps the stone of all
others the best for engraving.

Topaz - Not the stone now called the topaz: it may have been the
chrysolite, a stone of a greenish hue.

A carbuncle - More probably the beryl, which is a kind of emerald.

[Exo 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#018.md)

An emerald - Rather the garnet, which when cut with a convex face is
termed the carbuncle.

A sapphire - Not the stone now called the sapphire; the lapis-lazuli is
most probably meant.

A diamond - There is no trace of evidence that the ancients ever
acquired the skill to engrave on the diamond, or even that they were
acquainted with the stone. The "diamond" here may possibly be some
variety of chalcedony, or (perhaps) rock crystal.

[Exo 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#019.md)

A ligure - Amber, which came from Liguria.

[Exo 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#020.md)

A beryl - Supposed to be a brilliant yellow stone, identified with what
is now nown as the Spanish topaz.

A jasper - Probably the green jasper.

[Exo 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#022.md)

Chains ... - See [Exo 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#014.md).

[Exo 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#023.md)

On the two ends of the breastplate - The extremities spoken of here, and
in the next verse, must have been the upper corners of the square. The
chains attached to them [Exo 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#025.md)
suspended the breastplate from the ouches of the shoulder pieces [Exo
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#009.md), [Exo
28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#011.md).

[Exo 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#027.md)

"And two rings of gold shalt thou make and put them on the two shoulder
pieces of the ephod, low down in the front of it, near the joining,
above the band for fastening it." It would seem that the shoulder pieces
were continued down the front of the ephod as far as the band (see [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008).md); the joining appears to have
been the meeting of the extremities of the shoulder pieces with the
band. These rings were attached to the shoulder pieces just above this
joining.

[Exo 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#028.md)

The curious girdle of the ephod - The band for fastening it (see [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008) note.md).

[Exo 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#029.md)

See [Exo 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#012.md); the same names
engraved on the stones of the breastplate were worn over the heart, the
seat of the affections, as well as of the intellect, to symbolize the
relation of love and of personal interest which the Lord requires to
exist between the priest and the people.

[Exo 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030.md)

The Urim and the Thummim - "The Light and the Truth, or perfection."

From the way in which they are spoken of here and in [Lev
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#008.md), compared with [Exo
28:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015.md), it would appear that the
Urim and the Thummim were some material things, previously existing and
familiarly known, that they were separate from the breastplate itself,
as well as from the gems that were set upon it, and were kept in the bag
of the breastplate [Exo 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#016.md).

By means of them the will of Yahweh, especially in what related to the
wars in which His people were engaged, was made known. They were
formally delivered by Moses to Aaron [Lev
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#008.md), and subsequently passed on to
Eleazar [Num 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028.md); [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md). They were esteemed as the
crowning glory of the tribe of Levi [Deu
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008.md). There is no instance on record
of their being consulted after the time of David.

The opinion has prevailed to a great extent that the Urim and the
Thummim were of Egyptian origin, and two small images of precious stone,
and that the divine will was manifested through them by some physical
effect addressed to the eye or the ear.

Others prefer the view that they were some means for casting lots.
Appeals to lots were made under divine authority by the chosen people on
the most solemn occasions [Lev 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md);
[Num 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md); [Jos
7:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#014.md); [Jos
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006.md); [Jos
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008.md); [Sa1
14:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041.md); [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026.md), and it must have been a truth
commonly recognized by the people that though "the lot was cast into the
lap, the whole disposing thereof was of the Lord" [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md).

[Exo 28:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031.md)

The robe of the ephod - [Exo 39:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022.md).
A frock or robe of the simplest form, woven without seam, wholly of
blue. It was put on by being drawn over the head. It appears to have had
no sleeves. It probably reached a little below the knees. It must have
been visible above and below the ephod, the variegated texture of which
it must have set off as a plain blue groundwork.

[Exo 28:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#032.md)

An habergeon - Corselets of linen, such as appear to be here referred
to, were well known amongst the Egyptians.

[Exo 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035.md)

His sound - Its sound, i. e. the sound of the robe, that the people, who
stood without, when they heard the sound of the bells within the
tabernacle, might have a sensible proof that the high priest was
performing the sacred rite in their behalf, though he was out of their
sight.

That he die not - The bells also bore witness that the high priest was,
at the time of his ministration, duly attired in the dress of his
office, and so was not incurring the sentence of death (see also [Exo
28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043).md). An infraction of the laws for
the service of the sanctuary was not merely an act of disobedience; it
was a direct insult to the presence of Yahweh from His ordained
minister, and justly incurred a sentence of capital punishment. Compare
[Exo 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#021.md); [Lev
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035.md); [Lev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md).

[Exo 28:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md)

Compare [Exo 39:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027.md).

[Exo 28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md)

Holiness to the Lord - This inscription testified in express words the
holiness with which the high priest was invested in virtue of his sacred
calling.

[Exo 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#037.md)

A blue lace - The plate was fastened upon a blue band or fillet, so tied
round the mitre as to show the plate in front.

The mitre - A twisted band of linen [Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md) coiled into a cap, to which the
name mitre, in its original sense, closely answers, but which, in modern
usage, would rather be called a turban.

[Exo 28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md)

Bear the iniquity of the holy things - The Hebrew expression "to bear
iniquity" is applied either to one who suffers the penalty of sin ([Exo
28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043.md); [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017.md); [Lev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#016.md); [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041), etc..md), or to one who takes away
the sin of others ([Gen 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017.md); [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md); [Lev
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#022.md); [Num
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#015.md); [Sa1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025), etc..md). In several of these
passages, the verb is rightly rendered to forgive. The iniquity which is
spoken of in this place does not mean particular sins actually
committed, but that condition of alienation from God in every earthly
thing which makes reconciliation and consecration needful. Compare [Num
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001.md). It belonged to the high priest,
as the chief atoning mediator between Yahweh and His people (see the
note at [Exo 28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036).md), to atone for the
holy things that they might be "accepted before the Lord" (compare [Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015.md), note; [Lev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#020.md), [Lev
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#033), note.md): but the common priests
also, in their proper functions, had to take their part in making
atonement ([Lev 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020.md); [Lev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010.md); [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md); [Lev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#016.md); [Num
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023), etc..md).

[Exo 28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md)

The coat of fine linen - A long tunic, or cassock. Josephus says that it
was worn next the skin, that it reached to the feet, and that it had
closely fitting sleeves. The verb translated "embroider" appears rather
to mean weave in diaper work. The tissue consisted of threads of one and
the same color diapered in checkers, or in some small figure.

The girdle of needlework - The girdle of the work of the embroiderer
[Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md); [Exo
35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md). The word translated "girdle" is
different from that so rendered in [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008) (see the note.md), and is probably
Egyptian. Josephus says that it was wound several times round the body,
and that its ends ordinarily hung down to the feet, but were thrown over
the shoulder when the priest was engaged in his work.

[Exo 28:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040.md)

Bonnets - Caps of a simple construction which seem to have been
cup-shaped.

[Exo 28:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#041.md)

The dress of white linen was the strictly sacerdotal dress common to the
whole body of priests [Eze 44:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md).
"These were for glory and for beauty" not less than "the golden
garments" (as they were called by the Jews) which formed the high
priest's dress of state [Exo 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#002.md). The
linen suit which the high priest put on when he went into the most holy
place on the day of atonement, appears to have been regarded with unique
respect (Compare [Exo 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#010.md); [Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004.md), [Lev
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023).md), though it is nowhere stated
that it was distinguished in its make or texture, except in having a
girdle [Exo 28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039.md) wholly of white
linen, instead of a variegated one. The ancient Egyptian priests, like
the Hebrew priests, wore nothing but white linen garments in the
performance of their duties.

[Exo 28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043.md)

That they bear not iniquity and die - See [Exo
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035.md), note; [Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md) note.
