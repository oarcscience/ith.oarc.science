### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops - The "daughter of
troops" is still the same who was before addressed, Judah. The word is
almost always . used of "bands of men employed in irregular, marauding,
in-roads." Judah is entitled "daughter of troops," on account of her
violence, the robbery and bloodshed within her ([Mic
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md); [Mic
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md); etc. [Hos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010).md), as Jeremiah says, "Is this
house which is called by My Name become a den of robbers in your eyes?"
([Jer 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md), compare [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013).md). She then who had spoiled [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md) should now be spoiled; she who
had formed herself in bands to lay waste, shall now be gathered thick
together, in small bands, unable to resist in the open field; yet in
vain should she so gather herself; for the enemy was upon her, in her
last retreat.

This description has obviously no fulfillment, except in the infliction
by the Romans. For there was no event, before the invasion by
Sennacherib and accordingly in the prophet's own time, in which there is
any seeming fulfillment of it. But then, the second deliverance must be
that by the Maccabees; and this siege, which lies, in order of time,
beyond it, must be a siege by the Romans. With this it agrees, that
whereas, in the two former visitations, God promised, in the first,
deliverance, in the second, victory, here the prophet dwells on the
Person of the Redeemer, and foretells that the strength of the Church
should not lie in any human means [Mic
5:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md). Here too Israel had no king,
but a judge only. Then the "gathering in robber-bands" strikingly
describes their internal state in the siege of Jerusalem; and although
this was subsequent to and consequent upon the rejection of our Lord,
yet there is no reason why the end should be separated from the
beginning since the capture by Titus was but the sequel of the capture
by Pompey, the result of that same temper, in which they crucified
Jesus, because He would not be their earthly king. It was the close of
the organic existence of the former people; after which the remnant from
among them with the Gentiles, not Israel after the flesh, were the true
people of God.

He hath laid siege against us - The prophet, being born of them, and for
the great love he bore them, counts himself among them, as Paul mourns
over his brethren after the flesh. "They shall smite the judge of Israel
with a rod upon the cheek." So Paul said to him who had made himself
high priest, "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall; for sittest thou
to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to
the law" [Act 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003.md). It is no longer
"the king" (for they had said, "We have no King but Caesar [Joh
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015).md) but the "judge of Israel," they
who against Christ and His Apostles gave wrong judgment. As they had
smitten contrary to the law, so were the chief men smitten by Titus,
when the city was taken. As they had done it, was done unto them. To be
smitten on the thee, betokens shame; to smite with the red, betokens
destruction. Now both shall meet in one; as, in the Great Day, the
wicked "shall awake to shame and everlasting contempt, and shall perish
forever" [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md).

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

But - (And) thou, Bethlehem Ephratah With us, the chequered events of
time stand in strong contrast, painful or gladdening. Good seems to
efface evil, or evil blots out the memory of the good. God orders all in
the continuous course of His Wisdom. All lies in perfect harmony in the
Divine Mind. Each event is the sequel of what went before. So here the
prophet joins on, what to us stands in such contrast, with that simple,
And. Yet he describes the two conditions bearing on one another. He had
just spoken of the "judge of Israel" smitten on the cheek, and, before
[Mic 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), that Israel had neither king
nor "counsellor;" he now speaks of the Ruler in Israel, the Everlasting.
He had said, how Judah was to become mere bands of men; he now says, how
the "little Bethlehem" was to be exalted. He had said before, that the
rule of old was to come to "the tower of the flock, the daughter of
Jerusalem;" now, retaining the word, he speaks of the Ruler, in whom it
was to be established.

Before he had addressed "the tower of the flock;" now, Bethlehem. But he
has greater things to say now, so he pauses , And thou! People have
admired the brief appeal of the murdered Caesar, "Thou too, Brutus." The
like energetic conciseness lies in the words, "And thou! Bethlehem
Ephratah." The name Ephratah is not seemingly added, in order to
distinguish Bethlehem from the Bethlehem of Zabulon, since that is only
named once [Jos 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md), and Bethlehem
here is marked to be "the Bethlehem Judah" , by the addition, "too
little to be among the thousands of Judah." He joins apparently the
usual name, "Bethlehem," with the old Patriarchal, and perhaps poetic
[Psa 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md) name "Ephratah," either in
reference and contrast to that former birth of sorrow near Ephratah [Gen
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); [Gen
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007), or, (as is Micah's custom.md)
regarding the meaning of both names.

Both its names were derived from "fruitfulness;" "House of Bread" and
"fruitfulness;" and, despite of centuries of Mohammedan oppression, it
is fertile still. .

It had been rich in the fruitfulness of this world; rich, thrice rich,
should it be in spiritual fruitfulness. : "Truly is Bethlehem, 'house of
bread,' where was born "the Bread of life, which came down from heaven"
[Joh 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md). : "who with inward sweetness
refreshes the minds of the elect," "Angel's Bread" [Psa
78:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#025.md), and "Ephratah, fruitfulness,
whose fruitfulness is God," the Seed-corn, stored wherein, died and
brought forth much fruit, all which ever was brought forth to God in the
whole world.

Though thou be little among the thousands of Judah - Literally, "small
to be," that is, "too small to be among" etc. Each tribe was divided
into its thousands, probably of fighting men, each thousand having its
own separate head [Num 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016.md); [Num
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#004.md). But the thousand continued to be
a division of the tribe, after Israel was settled in Canaan [Jos
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#021.md), [Jos
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#030.md); [Sa1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019.md); [Sa1
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#023.md). The "thousand" of Gideon was
the meanest in Manasseh. [Jdg 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015.md).
Places too small to form a thousand by themselves were united with
others, to make up the number . So lowly was Bethlehem that it was not
counted among the possessions of Judah. In the division under Joshua, it
was wholly omitted . From its situation, Bethlehem can never have been a
considerable place.

It lay and lies, East of the road from Jerusalem to Hebron, at six miles
from the capital. "6 miles," Arculf, (Early Travels in Palestine, p. 6)
Bernard (Ibid. 29) Sae, wulf, (Ibid. 44) "2 hours." Maundrell, (Ibid.
455) Robinson (i. 470)). It was "seated on the summit-level of the hill
country of Judaea with deep gorges descending East to the Dead Sea and
West to the plains of Philistia," "2704 feet above the sea" . It lay "on
a narrow ridge" , whose whole length was not above a mile , swelling at
each extremity into a somewhat higher eminence, with a slight depression
between . : "The ridge projects Eastward from the central mountain
range, and breaks down in abrupt terraced slopes to deep valleys on the
N. E. and S." The West end too "shelves gradually down to the valley" .
It was then rather calculated to be an outlying fortress, guarding the
approach to Jerusalem, than for a considerable city.

As a garrison, it was fortified and held by the Philistines [Sa2
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#014.md) in the time of Saul, recovered
from them by David, and was one of the 15 cities fortified by Rehoboam.
Yet it remained an unimportant place. Its inhabitants are counted with
those of the neighboring Netophah, both before [Ch1
2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054.md) and after [Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026.md) the captivity, but both together
amounted after the captivity to 179 [Ezr
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021.md), [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md), or 188 [Neh
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026.md) only. It still does not appear
among the possessions of Judah [Neh
11:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025.md). It was called a city ([Rut
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019.md); [Ezr
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md), with 21; [Neh
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#006), with 26.md), but the name included
even places which had only 100 fighting men [Amo
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003.md). In our Lord's time it is called a
village [Joh 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md), a city, [Luk
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md), or a strong . The royal city
would become a den of thieves. Christ should be born in a lowly village.
: "He who had taken the form of a servant, chose Bethlehem for His
Birth, Jerusalem for His Passion."

Matthew relates how the Chief Priest and Scribes in their answer to
Herod's enquiries, where Christ should be born, [Mat
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md), alleged this prophecy. They
gave the substance rather than the exact words, and with one remarkable
variation, art not the least among the princes of Judah. Matthew did not
correct their paraphrase, because it does not affect the object for
which they alleged the prophecy, the birth of the Redeemer in Bethlehem.
The sacred writers often do not correct the translations, existing in
their time, when the variations do not affect the truth .

Both words are true here. Micah speaks of Bethlehem, as it was in the
sight of men; the chief priests, whose words Matthew approves, speak of
it as it was in the sight of God, and as, by the Birth of Christ, it
should become. : "Nothing hindered that Bethlehem should be at once a
small village and the Mother-city of the whole earth, as being the
mother and nurse of Christ who made the world and conquered it." : "That
is not the least, which is the house of blessing, and the receptacle of
divine grace." : "He saith that the spot, although mean and small, shall
be glorious. And in truth," adds Chrysostom, "the whole world came
together to see Bethlehem, where, being born, He was laid, on no other
ground than this only." : "O Bethlehem, little, but now made great by
the Lord, He hath made thee great, who, being great, was in thee made
little. What city, if it heard thereof, would not envy thee that most
precious Stable and the glory of that Crib? Thy name is great in all the
earth, and all generations call thee blessed. "Glorious things are
everywhere spoken of thee, thou city of God" [Psa
87:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003.md). Everywhere it is sung, that this
Man is born in her, and the Most High Himself shall establish her.

Out of thee shall He come forth to Me that is to be Ruler in Israel -
(Literally, shall (one) come forth to Me "to be Ruler.") Bethlehem was
too small to be any part of the polity of Judah; out of her was to come
forth One, who, in God's Will, was to be its Ruler. The words to Me
include both of Me and to Me. Of Me, that is, , by My Power and Spirit,"
as Gabriel said, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that Holy Thing which
shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God" [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md). To Me, as God said to Samuel, "I
will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided Me a king
among his sons" [Sa1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md). So now,
"one shall go forth thence to Me," to do My Will, to My praise and
glory, to reconcile the world unto Me, to rule and be Head over the true
Israel, the Church. He was to "go forth out of Bethlehem," as his
native-place; as Jeremiah says, "His noble shall be from him, and his
ruler shall go forth out of the midst of him" [Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md); and Zechariah, "Out of him
shall come forth the cornerstone; out of him the nail, out of him the
battle-bow, out of him every ruler together" [Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md). Before, Micah had said "to the
tower of Edar, Ophel of the daughter of Zion, the first rule shall come
to thee;" now, retaining the word, he says to Bethlehem, "out of thee
shall come one to be a ruler." "The judge of Israel had been smitten;"
now there should "go forth out of" the little Bethlehem, One, not to be
a judge only, but a Ruler.

Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting - Literally,
"from the days of eternity." "Going forth" is opposed to "going forth;"
a "going forth" out of Bethlehem, to a "going forth from eternity;" a
"going forth," which then was still to come, (the prophet says, "shall
go forth,") to a "going forth" which had been long ago (Rup.), "not from
the world but from the beginning, not in the days of time, but "from the
days of eternity." For "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God. The Same was in the beginning with God."
[Joh 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md). In the end of the days, He
was to go forth from Bethlehem; but, lest he should be thought then to
have had His Being, the prophet adds, His 'goings forth are from
everlasting.'" Here words, denoting eternity and used of the eternity of
God, are united together to impress the belief of the Eternity of God
the Son. We have neither thought nor words to conceive eternity; we can
only conceive of time lengthened out without end. : "True eternity is
boundless life, all existing at once," or , "to duration without
beginning and without end and without change."

The Hebrew names, here used, express as much as our thoughts can
conceive or our words utter. They mean literally, from afore, (that is,
look back as far as we can, that from which we begin is still "before,")
"from the days of that which is hidden." True, that in eternity there
are no divisions, no succession, but one everlasting "now;" one, as God,
in whom it is, is One. But man can only conceive of Infinity of space as
space without bounds, although God contains space, and is not contained
by it; nor can we conceive of Eternity, save as filled out by time. And
so God speaks after the manner of men, and calls Himself "the Ancient of
Days" [Dan 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md), , "being Himself the
age and time of all things; before days and age and time," "the
Beginning and measure of ages and of time." The word, translated "from
of old," is used elsewhere of the eternity of God [Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md). "The God of before" is a title
chosen to express, that He is before all things which He made. "Dweller
of afore" [Psa 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md) is a title,
formed to shadow out His ever-present existence.

Conceive any existence afore all which else you can conceive, go back
afore and afore that; stretch out backward yet before and before all
which you have conceived, ages afore ages, and yet afore, without end, -
then and there God was. That afore was the property of God. Eternity
belongs to God, not God to eternity. Any words must be inadequate to
convey the idea of the Infinite to our finite minds. Probably the sight
of God, as He is, will give us the only possible conception of eternity.
Still the idea of time prolonged infinitely, although we cannot follow
it to infinity, shadows our eternal being. And as we look along that
long vista, our sight is prolonged and stretched out by those millions
upon millions of years, along which we can look, although even if each
grain of sand or dust on this earth, which are countless, represented
countless millions, we should be, at the end, as far from reaching to
eternity as at the beginning. "The days of eternity" are only an
inadequate expression, because every conception of the human mind must
be so.

Equally so is every other, "From everlasting to everlasting" [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md); [Psa
103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017.md); "from everlasting" ([Psa
93:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#002.md), and of Divine Wisdom, or God the
Son, [Pro 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023).md); "to everlasting" [Psa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md); [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md); "from the day" [Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013.md), that is, since the day was. For
the word, from, to our minds implies time, and time is no measure of
eternity. Only it expresses pre-existence, an eternal Existence backward
as well as forward, the incommunicable attribute of God. But words of
Holy Scripture have their full meaning, unless it appear from the
passage itself that they have not. In the passages where the words,
forever, from afore, do not mean eternity, the subject itself restrains
them. Thus forever, looking onward, is used of time, equal in duration
with the being of whom it is written, as, "he shall be thy servant
forever" [Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md), that is, so long
as he lives in the body. So when it is said to the Son, "Thy throne, O
God, is forever and ever" [Psa 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006.md),
it speaks of a kingdom which shall have no end. In like way, looking
backward, "I will remember Thy wonders from old" [Psa
77:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#012.md), must needs relate to time,
because they are marvelous dealings of God in time. So again, "the
heavens of old, stand simply contrasted with the changes of man" [Psa
68:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#034.md). But "God of old is the Eternal
God" [Deu 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027.md). "He that abideth of
old" [Psa 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md) is God enthroned from
everlasting In like manner the "goings forth" here, opposed to a "going
forth" in time, (emphatic words being moreover united together,) are a
going forth in eternity.

The word, "from of old," as used of being, is only used as to the Being
of God. Here too then there is no ground to stop short of that meaning;
and so it declares the eternal "going-forth," or Generation of the Son.
The plural, "goings forth," may here be used, either as words of great
majesty, "God," "Lord," "Wisdom," (that is, divine [Pro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020.md); [Pro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001).md) are plural; or because the
Generation of the Son from the Father is an Eternal Generation, before
all time, and now, though not in time, yet in eternity still. As then
the prophet saith, "from the days of eternity," although eternity has no
parts, nor beginning, nor "from," so he may say "goings forth," to
convey, as we can receive it, a continual going-forth. We think of
Eternity as unending, continual, time; and so he may have set forth to
us the Eternal Act of the "Going Forth" of the Son, as continual acts.

The Jews understood, as we do now, that Micah foretold that the Christ
was to be born at Bethlehem, until they rejected Him, and were pressed
by the argument. Not only did the chief priests formally give the
answer, but, supposing our Lord to be of Nazareth, some who rejected
Him, employed the argument against Him. "Some said, Shall Christ come
out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the
seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?" [Joh
7:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041.md). They knew of two distinct
things: that Christ was:

\(1\) to be of the seed of David; and

\(2\) out of the town of Bethlehem.

Christians urged them with the fact, that the prophecy could be
fulfilled in no other than in Christ. : "If He is not yet born, who is
to go forth as a Ruler out of the tribe of Judah, from Bethlehem, (for
He must needs come forth out of the tribe of Judah, and from Bethlehem,
but we see that now no one of the race of Israel has remained in the
city of of Bethlehem, and thenceforth it has been interdicted that any
Jew should remain in the confines of that country) - how then shall a
Ruler be born from Judaea, and how shall he come forth out of Bethlehem,
as the divine volumes of the prophets announce, when to this day there
is no one whatever left there of Israel, from whose race Christ could be
born?"

The Jews at first met the argument, by affirming that the Messiah was
born at Bethlehem on the day of the destruction of the temple ; but was
hidden for the sins of the people. This being a transparent fable, the
Jews had either to receive Christ, or to give up the belief that He was
to be born at Bethlehem. So they explained it, "The Messiah shall go
forth thence, because he shall be of the seed of David who was out of
Bethlehem." But this would have been misleading language. Never did man
so speak, that one should be born in a place, when only a remote
ancestor had been born there. Micah does not say merely, that His family
came out of Bethlehem, but that He Himself should thereafter come forth
thence. No one could have said of Solomon or of any of the subsequent
kings of Judah, that they should thereafter come forth from Bethlehem,
any more than they could now say, 'one shall come forth from Corsic,' of
any future sovereign of the line of Napoleon III., because the first
Napoleon was a Corsican; or to us, 'one shall come out of Hanover,' of a
successor to the present dynasty, born in England, because George I.
came from Hanover in 1714.

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

Therefore - Since God has so appointed both to punish and to redeem, He,
God, or the Ruler "whose goings forth have been from of old from
everlasting," who is God with God, "shall give them up, that is,
withdraw His protection and the nearness of His Presence, "giving them
up:"

\(1\) into the hands of their enemies. And indeed the far greater part
never returned from the captivity, but remained, although willingly, in
the enemy's land, outwardly shut out from the land of the promise and
the hope of their fathers (as in [Ch2
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017).md).

\(2\) But also, all were, more than before, "given up" [Act
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md), [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md), to follow their own ways.

God was less visibly present among them. Prophecy ceased soon after the
return from the captivity, and many tokens of the nearness of God and
means of His communications with them, the Ark and the Urim and Thummim
were gone. It was a time of pause and waiting, wherein the fullness of
God's gifts was withdrawn, that they might look on to Him who was to
come. "Until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth,"
that is, until the Virgin who should conceive and bear a Son and call
His Name Emmanuel, God with us, shall give birth to Him who shall save
them. And then shall be redemption and joy and assured peace. God
provides against the fainting of hearts in the long time before our Lord
should come.

Then - (And). There is no precise mark of time such as our word then
expresses. He speaks generally of what should be after the Birth of the
Redeemer. "The remnant of His brethren shall return unto the children of
Israel." "The children of Israel" are the true Israel, "Israelites
indeed" [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md); they who are such,
not in name ([Rom 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006), etc..md) only, but
indeed and in truth. His brethren are plainly the brethren of the
Christ; either because Jesus vouchsafed to be born "of the seed of David
according to the flesh" [Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md), and
of them "as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God
blessed forever" [Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md); or as such
as He makes and accounts and "is not ashamed to call, brethren" [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md), being sons of God by grace, as
He is the Son of God by nature. As He says, "Whosoever shall do the will
of My Father which is in Heaven, the same is My brother and sister and
mother" [Mat 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#050.md); and, "My brethren
are these who hear the word of God and do it" [Luk
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#021.md).

The residue of these, the prophet says, shall return to, so as to be
joined with , the children of Israel; as Malachi prophesies, "He shall
bring back the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of
the children to the fathers" (Mal. 3:24, Hebrew). In the first sense,
Micah foretells the continual inflow of the Jews to that true Israel who
should first be called. All in each generation, who are the true Israel,
shall be converted, made one in Christ, saved. So, whereas, since
Solomon, all had been discord, and, at last, the Jews were scattered
abroad everywhere, all, in the true Prince of Peace, shall be one (see
[Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md); [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010), etc..md). This has been fulfilled
in each generation since our Lord came, and shall be yet further in the
end, when they shall haste and pour into the Church, and so "all Israel
shall be saved" [Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md).

But "the promise of God was not only to Israel after the flesh, but to
all" also that were afar off, even as many as the Lord our God should
call [Act 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md). All these may be
called the remnant of His brethren, even those that were, before, aliens
from the commonwealth of Israel and afar off [Eph
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md), but now, in Christ Jesus,
made one with them; all, brethren among themselves and to Christ their
ruler. : "Having taken on Him their nature in the flesh, He is not
ashamed to call them so, as the Apostle speaketh, confirming it out of
the Psalm, where in the Person of Christ he saith, "I will declare Thy
name unto My brethren" [Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md).
There is no reason to take the name, brethren, here in a narrower sense
than so to comprehend all "the remnant whom the Lord shall call" [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032.md), whether Jews or Gentiles. The
word "brethren" in its literal sense includes both, and, as to both, the
words were fulfilled.

[Micah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 5:4</span></span>

And He shall stand - The prophet continues to speak of personal acts of
this Ruler who was to be born. He was not to pass away, not to rule only
by others, but by Himself. To stand is the attitude of a servant, as
Jesus, although God and Lord of all, said of Himself, "He shall come
forth and serve them" [Luk 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037.md); "The
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md). "He shall stand" as a Shepherd
[Isa 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005.md), to watch, feed, guard them,
day and night; "He shall stand," as Stephen saw Christ "standing on the
Right Hand of God" [Act 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md), "to
succor all those who suffer for Him." : "For to sit belongs to one
judging; to stand, to one fighting or helping." "He shall stand," as
abiding, not to pass from them, as Himself saith, "Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world" [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md) : and He shall feed His flock by
His Spirit, His Word, His Wisdom and doctrine, His example and life;
yea, by His own Body and Blood John 6. They whom He feedeth "lack
nothing" [Psa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md).

In the strength of the Lord - He, who feedeth them with divine
tenderness, shall also have divine might, His Father's and His own, to
protect them; as He saith, "My sheep hear My Voice, and I know them and
they follow Me, neither shall any man pluck them out of My Hand. My
Father Which gave them Me is greater than all, and no man is able to
pluck them out of My Father's Hand. I and My Father are One" [Joh
10:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md). With authority, it is said,
"He commandeth even the unclean spirits and they come out" [Luk
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#036.md). His feeding or teaching also was
"with authority, and not as the scribes" [Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029.md).

In the majesty of the name of the Lord His God - As John says, "We
beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of His Father" [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); and He saith, "All power is
given unto Me in heaven and in earth" [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); so that the divine glory should
shine through the majesty of His teaching, the power of His Grace,
upholding His own, and the splendor of the miracles wrought by Him and
in His Name. "Of the Name of the Lord;" as He saith again, "Holy Father,
keep through Thine own Name those whom Thou hast given Me, that they may
be one as We are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Thy
Name" [Joh 17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md). : "Whoever then
is sent to feed His flock must stand, that is, be firm and unshaken;
feed, not sell, nor slay; and feed in might, that is, in Christ." His
God, as our Lord Himself, as Man, saith, "Unto My Father, and your
Father, and to My God and your God" .

But that Majesty He Himself wields, as no mere man can; He Himself is
invested with it. : "To ordinary kings God is strength [Psa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#007.md); [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md), or gives strength [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); men have strength in God; this
Ruler is clad in the strength of the Lord, that same strength, which the
Lord hath, whose is strength. Of Him, as Israel's King, the same is said
as of the Lord, as King of the whole earth [Psa
93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md); only that the strength of the
Messiah is not His own, but the Lord's. He is invested with the strength
of the Lord, because He is Man; as Man, He can be invested with the
whole strength of the Lord, only because He is also God."

And they shall abide - (Literally, sit, dwell) in rest and security and
unbroken peace under Christ their Shepherd and their King; they shall
not wander to and fro as heretofore "He, their Shepherd, shall stand;
they shall sit." "The word is the more emphatic, because it stands so
absolutely. This will be a sitting or dwelling, which will indeed
deserve the name. The original promise, so often forfeited by their
disobedience should be perfectly fulfilled; "and ye shall dwell in your
land safely, and I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down,
and none shall make you afraid" . So Amos and Micah had before promised
. And this is the result of the greatness of the promised Ruler, as the
like promise of the Psalm is rested on the immutability of God; "Thou
art the Same, and Thy years shall have no end. The children of Thy
servants shall dwell, and their seed shall be established before Thee."
[Psa 102:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md). For it follows,"

For now - (In the time which Micah saw as did Abraham with the eye of
faith,) "now," in contrast to that former time of lowliness. His life
shall be divided between a life of obscurity, and a life of never-ending
greatness.

Shall He be great unto the (very) ends of the earth - embracing them in
His rule, (as David and Solomon had foretold ,) and so none shall harm
those whom He, the King of all the earth, shall protect. The
universality of protection is derived from an universality of power. To
David God says, "I have made thee a great name, like the name of the
great that are in the earth" [Sa2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009.md).
Of Uzziah it is said, "His name went forth far; for he was marvelously
helped, until he was strong" ([Ch2
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md), add [Ch2
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008).md); but of the Messiah alone it is
said, that His power should reach to the ends of the earth; as God
prophesies of Himself, that His "Name should be great among the pagan"
[Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md), [Mal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md). So Gabriel said to His Mother,
"This," whom she should bear, "shall be great" .

[Micah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 5:5</span></span>

And this Man shall be the Peace - This, emphatically, that is, "This
Same," as is said of Noah, "This same shall comfort us" [Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md), or, in the song of Moses, of the
Lord, "This Same is my God" [Exo 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md).
Of Him he saith, not only that He brings peace, but that He Himself is
that Peace; as Paul saith, "He is our Peace" [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md), and Isaiah calls Him "the Prince
of peace" [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), and at His Birth
the heavenly host proclaimed "peace on earth" [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md); and He "preached peace to you
which were afar off, and to them that were nigh" [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md); and on leaving the world He
saith, "Peace I leave with you, My Peace I give unto you" [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md). "He shall be our Peace," within
by His Grace, without by His Protection. Lap.: "Wouldest thou have peace
with God, thine own soul, thy neighbor? Go to Christ who is our Peace,"
and follow the footsteps of Christ. "Ask peace of Him who is Peace.
Place Christ in thy heart and thou hast placed Peace there."

When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in
our palaces - Assur stands for the most powerful and deadliest foe,
"ghostly and bodily," as the Assyrian then was of the people of God. For
since this plainly relates to the time after Christ's coming, and, (to
say the least,) after the captivity in Babylon and deliverance [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md) from it, which itself followed
the dissolution of the Assyrian Empire, the Assyrians cannot be the
literal people, who had long since ceased to be In Isaiah too the
Assyrian is the type of antichrist and of Satan .

As Christ is our Peace, so one enemy is chosen to represent all enemies
who [Act 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md) vex the Church, whether
the human agents or Satan who stirs them up and uses them. "By the
Assyrian," says Cyril, "he here means no longer a man out of Babylon,
but rather marks out the inventor of sin, Satan. Or rather, to speak
fully, the implacable multitude of devils, which spiritually ariseth
against all which is holy, and fights against the holy city, the
spiritual Zion, whereof the divine Psalmist saith, "Glorious things are
spoken of thee, thou city of God." For Christ dwelleth in the Church,
and maketh it, as it were, His own city, although by His Godhead filling
all things. This city of God then is a sort of land and country of the
sanctified and of those enriched in spirit, in unity with God. When then
the Assyrian shall come against our city, that is, when barbarous and
hostile powers fight against the saints, they shall not find it
unguarded."

The enemy may tread on the land and on its palaces, that is, lay low
outward glory, vex the body which is of earth and the visible temple of
the Holy Spirit, as he did Paul by the thorn in the flesh, the minister
of Satan to buffet him, or Job in mind body or estate, but [Luk
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004.md) after that he has no more than he
can do; he cannot hurt the soul, because nothing can separate us from
the love of Christ, and (Rup.) Christ who is our Peace is in us; and of
the saint too it may be said, "The enemy cannot hurt him" [Psa
89:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022.md). Rib.: Much as the Church has
been vexed at all times by persecutions of devils and of tyrants, Christ
has ever consoled her and given her peace in the persecutions
themselves: "Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
we are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us,
so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ" [Co2
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md). The Apostles [Act
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md) departed from the presence of the
council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His
Name. And Paul writeth to the Hebrews, "ye had compassion of me in my
bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye
have in heaven a better and more enduring substance" [Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md).

Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men
- (Literally, anointed, although elsewhere used of pagan princes.)

The "shepherds" are manifestly inferior, spiritual, shepherds, acting
under the One Shepherd, by His authority, and He in them. The princes of
men are most naturally a civil power, according to its usage elsewhere
[Jos 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md); [Psa
83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md); [Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md). The "seven" is throughout the
Old Testament a symbol of a sacred whole, probably of the union of God
with the world , reconciled with it; eight, when united with it, is
something beyond it . Since then "seven" denotes a great, complete, and
sacred multitude, by the eight he would designate "an incredible and
almost countless multitude." Rib.: "So in defense of the Church, there
shall be raised up very many shepherds and teachers (for at no time will
it be forsaken by Christ;) yea by more and more, countlessly, so that,
however persecutions may increase, there shall never be lacking more to
teach, and exhort to, the faith."

[Micah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 5:6</span></span>

And they shall waste - Literally, feed on, and so eat up. They who were
shepherds of their own people, should consume their enemies. Jeremiah
uses the same image. "The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto
her; they shall pitch tents against her round about; they shall feed,
each his space" [Jer 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md). So Joshua
and Caleb say, "They, (the inhabitants of Canaan,) are bread for us"
[Num 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009.md). So it was said to Peter,
"arise, Peter, kill and eat" [Act
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#013.md); and what once was common,
defiled and unclean, shall turn to the nourishment and growth of the
Church, and be incorporated into Christ, being made part of His Body.

And the land of Nimrod - Babylon, which should displace Assyria, but
should carry on its work of chastising God's people, is joined by Micah,
as by Isaiah Isa. 10:5-34; 13-14:27, as an object of His judgment. In
Isaiah, they are the actual Assyria [Isa
10:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md) and Babylon [Isa
14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md) whose destruction is
foretold, yet so as to shadow out rebellion against God in its intensest
form, making itself independent of, or measuring itself against, God.
Hence, probably, here alone in holy Scripture, Babylon is called "the
land of Nimrod," as indeed he founded it [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md), but therewith was the author of
the tower of Babel also, which was built in rebellion against God,
whence his own name was derived . Assyria then, and the world-empire
which should succeed it, stand as representing the God-opposed world.

In the entrances thereof - (Literally, in the gates thereof.) The
shepherds of Israel shall not act on the defensive only, but shall have
victory over the world and Satan, carrying back the battle into his own
dominions, and overthrowing him there. Satan's malice, so far from
hurting the Church, shall turn to its good. Wherein he hoped to waste
it, he shall be wasted; wherein he seemed to triumph, he shall be
foiled. So it has been ever seen, how, under every persecution, the
Church grew. : "The more it was pressed down, the more it rose up and
flourished;" , "Shivering the assault of the Pagans, and strengthened
more and more, not by resisting, but by enduring." Yet all, by
whomsoever done, shall be the work of Christ alone, enduring in martyrs,
teaching in pastors, converting through the Apostles of pagan nations.
Wherefore he adds:

Thus (And) He shall deliver us from the Assyrian - Not they, the
subordinate shepherds, but He, the Chief Shepherd until the last enemy
shall be destroyed and death shall be swallowed up in victory, shall
deliver, whether by them or by Himself as He often so doth, - not us
only (the saying is the larger because unlimited) but - He shall
deliver, absolutely. Whosoever shall be delivered, He shall be their
deliverer; all, whom He alone knoweth, who alone "knoweth them that are
His" [Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md). "Neither is there
salvation in any other" [Act 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md).
"Whoso glorieth, let him glory in the Lord" [Co2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#017.md). Every member of Christ has part
in this, who, through the grace of God, "has power and strength to have
victory and to triumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh" -
not he, but the grace of God which is with him; and much more, all,
whether Apostles or Apostolic men, or Pastors, or Bishops and Overseers,
who, by preaching or teaching or prayer, bring those to the knowledge of
the truth, who "sat in darkness and the shadow of death" [Psa
107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md), and by whom "God translates us
into the kingdom of His dear Son" [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md).

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

And the remnant of Jacob - Micah ([Mic
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007).md), as well as Isaiah ([Isa
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021).md), had prophesied, that a remnant
only should return unto the Mighty God. These, though very many in
themselves, are yet but a remnant only of the unconverted mass; yet
this, "the remnant, who shall be saved" [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md), who believe in Christ, "the
little flock" [Luk 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md), of whom were
the Apostles and their disciples, "shall be, in the midst of many
people," whom they won to the faith, as John in Asia, Thomas in India,
Peter in Babylon and Rome, Paul well-nigh in the whole world, what?
something to be readily swallowed up by their multitude? No, but "as a
dew from the Lord, as the showers from the grass, which tarrieth not for
man, nor waiteth for the sons of men," quickening to life that, which,
like soon-withered (see [Psa 102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005.md),
[Psa 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md); [Kg2
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026.md); [Isa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027).md) grass, no human cultivation, no
human help, could reach.

In the Gospel and the grace of Christ there are both, gentleness and
might; softness, as the dew, might as of a lion. For "Wisdom reacheth
from one end to another mightily; and sweetly doth she order all things"
. The dew is, in Holy Scripture, a symbol of divine doctrine. "My
doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as
the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass"
[Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md). The dew comes down from
heaven, is of heavenly not of earthly birth, transparent, glistening
with light, reflecting the hues of heaven, gentle, slight, weak in
itself, refreshing, cooling the strong heats of the day (Ecclesiasticus
18:16; 43:22), consumed itself, yet thereby preserving life, falling on
the dry and withered grass wherein all nature droops, and recalling it
to freshness of life. And still more in those lands, where from the
beginning of April to the end of October, the close of the latter and
the beginning of the early rain, during all the hot months of summer,
the life of all herbage depends upon the dew alone . "Showers" are so
called from the "multitude" of drops, slight and of no account in
themselves, descending noiselessly yet penetrating the more deeply.

So did the Apostles "bedew the souls of believers with the word of
godliness and enrich them abundantly with the words of the Gospel,"
themselves dying, and the Church living the more through their death
[Co2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md), quenching the fiery heat of
passions, and watering the dry and barren soil, that it might bring
forth fruits unto Christ. Yet, they say, "the excellency of the power
was of God and not of us" [Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md).
and "God gave the increase" [Co1
3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md). For neither was their doctrine
"of man nor by man" [Gal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012.md); but it
came from heaven, the Holy Spirit teaching them invisibly and making
unlearned and ignorant men mighty inward and deed. Rup.: "Whence these
and these alone the Church of Christ looks up to, as furnishing the rule
of truth." Rib.: "The herb, upon which this dew falleth, groweth to God
without any aid of man, and flourisheth, and needeth neither doctrines
of philosophers, nor the rewards or praises of men."

[Micah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 5:8</span></span>

And the remnant of Jacob shall be as a young lion - o: "What more unlike
than the sweetness of the dew and the fierceness of the lion? What so
different as the gentle shower distilling on the herb, and the
savageness or vehemence of a lion roaring among "the flocks of sheeps?"
Yet both are ascribed to "the remnant of Jacob." Why? Because the
Apostles of Christ are both tender and severe, tender in teaching and
exhorting, severe in rebuking and avenging. How does Paul teach, "God
was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, and hath committed
unto us the word of reconciliation; now then we are ambassadors for
Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's
stead, be ye reconciled to God!" 2 Cor. 5:19-6:11. What sweeter than the
dew of love, the shower of true affection? And so, on to that, "our
heart is enlarged." They are such drops of dew as no one could doubt
came from "the Lord, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
mercies and the God of all comfort" [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md).

Yet the same Apostle after a little writes, "This is the third time I am
coming to you. I told you before and foretell you, and being absent now
I write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all others, that if
I come again, I will not spare, since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking
in me" [Co2 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md). See the severity
of a master, like the roaring of "a lion among the beasts of the
forest." For such surely are they whom he rebukes for the [Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021.md) uncleanness and fornication and
lasciviousness which they had committed. Was he not to such as a lion?
[Co1 5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002.md)? Was not Peter such, when
he rebuked Ananias first and then Sapphira his wife, and they fell down
and gave up the ghost? They tread down or "cast down imaginations and
every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God" [Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md); as Christ Himself, who spake in
them, is both a lamb and the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md), and nothing is so terrible as
"the wrath of the Lamb" [Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md).

And none can deliver - Dionysius: "For as the Apostles past from nation
to nation, and trod down paganism, subduing it to Christ, and taking
within their net the many converted nations, none could withdraw from
the Apostles' doctrine those whom they had converted." The pagan world
"cried out that the state is beset, that the Christians are in their
fields, their forts, their islands." : "We are a people of yesterday,
and yet we have filled every place belonging to you, cities, islands,
castles, towns, assemblies, your very camp, your tribes, companies,
palace, senate, forum! We leave you your temples only. We can count your
armies, our numbers in a single province will be greater."

[Micah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 5:9</span></span>

Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries - The might of the
Church is the Might of Christ in her, and the glory of the Church is His
from whom it comes and to whom it returns. It is all one, whether this
be said to Christ or to the "remnant of Jacob, that is, His Church. Her
"enemies" are His, and her's only because they are His, and hate her as
belonging to Him. They "shall be cut off," either ceasing to be His
enemies, or ceasing to be, as Julian or Arius or antichrist, "whom the
Lord shall consume with the spirit of His Mouth and shall destroy with
the brightness of His Coming" [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). And in the end, Satan also, over
whom Christ gave the Apostles "power to tread on all the power of the
Enemy" [Luk 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md), shall be "bruised
under our feet" [Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

[Micah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 5:10</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day - Of grace in the kingdom of
Christ and of His Presence in the Apostles and with the Church; "I will
cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee." The greater the glory and
purity of the church, the less it needs or hangs upon human aid. The
more it is reft of human aid, the more it hangs upon God. So God
promises, as a blessing, that He will remove from her all mere human
resources, both what was in itself evil, and what, although good, had
been abused. Most of these things, whose removal is here promised, are
spoken of at the same time by Isaiah, as sin, or the occasion of sin,
and of God's judgments to Judah. "Soothsayers," (the same word) "horses,
chariots, idols the work of their hands; high towers, fenced walls" [Isa
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md), [Isa
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015.md). Rib. Lap.: "I will take, from
thee all arms wherewith, while unconverted, thou opposedst the faith,"
all which thou settest up as idols in place of God. (Such are
witchcrafts, soothsayers, graven images, images of Ashtaroth.) "I will
take from thee all outward means and instruments of defense which
aforetime were turned into pride and sin;" as horses and chariots. Not
such shall be the arms of the Church, not such her strongholds. A horse
is a vain thing to save a man. Her arms shall be the despised Cross of
shame; her warriors, they who bear it; their courage, to endure in holy
patience and meekness; their might, the Holy Spirit within them; their
victories, through death, not of others, but their Master's and, in His,
their own. They shall overcome the world, as He overcame it, and through
Him alone and His Merits who overcame it by suffering.

I will cut off the cities of thy land - So God promised by Zechariah,
"Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls; for I will be unto
her a wall of fire round about" [Zac
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md). The Church shall not need the
temptation of human defense; for God shall fence her in on every side.
Great cities too, as the abode of luxury and sin, of power and pride,
and, mostly, of cruelty, are chiefly denounced as the objects of God's
anger. Babylon stands as the emblem of the whole city of the world or of
the devil, as opposed to God. Rup.: "The first city was built by Cain;
Abel and the other saints heed no continuing city" [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md) here. Cities then will include
(Rup.) "all the tumults and evil passions and ambition and strife and
bloodshed, which Cain brought in among men. Cities are collectively
called and are Babylon, with whom, (as in the Revelations we hear a
voice from heaven saying), "the kings of the earth committed fornication
and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of
her delicacies" [Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md); and of
which it is written, "And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great
millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall
that great city, Babylon, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at
all." [Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md). "Great rest then is
promised to holy Zion that is, the Church, when the cities or
strongholds of the land (strongholds, as they are, of earthliness) shall
be destroyed. For together with them are included all objects of desire
in them, with the sight whereof the citizens of the kingdom of God,
while pilgrims here, are tempted; whereof the wise man saith, Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity."

The fulfillment reaches on to the Day of Judgment, when the Church shall
finally receive glory from the Lord, and be "without spot and wrinkle"
[Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md). All looks on to that Day.
The very largeness of the promise, which speaks, in its fullest sense,
of the destruction of things, without which we can hardly do in this
life, (as cities or things very useful to the needs of man, (as horses,)
carries us on yet more to that Day when there will be no more need of
any outward things; Rup.: "when the heavy body shall be changed, and
shall have the swiftness of angels, and shall be transported whither it
willeth, without chariots and horses; and all things which tempt the eye
shall cease; and no evil shall enter; and there shall be no need of
divining, amid the presence and full knowledge of God, and where the
ever-present Face of God, who is Truth, shall shine on all, and nothing
be uncertain or unknown; nor shall they need to form in their souls
images of Him whom His own shall see as He Is; nor shall they esteem
anything of self, or the work of their own hands; but God shall be All
in all." In like way, the woe on those who obey not the truth, also
looks on to the end. It too is final. There is nothing to soften it.
Punishments in the course of life are medicinal. Here no mention is made
of Mercy, but only of executing vengeance; and that, with wrath and
fury; and that, such as they have not heard. For as eye hath not seen,
nor heart conceived the good things laid up in store for those who love
God, so neither the evil things prepared for those who, in act, shew
that they hate Him.
