*Notes on the Bible*, by Albert Barnes, \[1834\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Judges Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

[Judges 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 17:1</span></span>

See the introduction to the Book of Judges. The only point of contact
with the preceding history of Samson is, that we are still concerned
with the tribe of Dan. See [Jdg
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001), note. Josephus combines in one
narrative what we read here and in [Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034), and places it, with the story in
Judg. 18-21, immediately after the death of Joshua.

[Judges 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 17:2</span></span>

Thou cursedst - or, "adjuredst me by God." Compare [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063); [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001).

[Judges 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 17:3</span></span>

Such a superstitious and unlawful mode of worshipping Yahweh is quite of
a piece with [Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027); [Jdg
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031); [Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028), etc. It argues but slight
acquaintance with the Ten Commandments, which, from the ignorance of
reading and writing, were probably not familiar to the Israelites in
those unsettled times. The mother intimates that the consecration of the
silver was for the benefit of her son and his house, not for her own
selfish advantage: and that she adheres to her original design of
consecrating this silver for her son's benefit.

[Judges 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 17:4</span></span>

See [Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027), note; [Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019), note.

[Judges 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 17:6</span></span>

In those days ... - This phrase, indicating distinctly that the writer
lived after the establishment of the kingly government in Israel, is
unique to the author of these last five chapters.

[Judges 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 17:7</span></span>

The Hebrew words for "he sojourned there" are, שׁם גר gêr shām, which
words are used [Jdg 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030) in the
genealogy of this young Levite, whose name was "Jonathan, the son of
Gershom" (גרשׁם gêreshôm). Hence, some read here, "the son of Gershom."

[Judges 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 17:8</span></span>

Jonathan's state without a home gives us vivid picture of what must have
been the condition of many Levites.

[Judges 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 17:10</span></span>

Ten shekels - About 25 shillings to 26 shillings (see [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024)).

[Judges 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 17:13</span></span>

This shows the ignorance as well as the superstition of the age (compare
[Kg2 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022)), and gives a picture of
the lawlessness of the times. The incidental testimony to the Levitical
priesthood is to be noted; but the idolatrous worship in the immediate
neighborhood of Shiloh is passing strange.
