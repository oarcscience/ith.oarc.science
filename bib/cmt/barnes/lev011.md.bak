### [Leviticus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 11:1</span></span>

Yahweh speaks to Moses and Aaron conjointly. (Compare [Lev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md); [Lev
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001)..md) The high priest, in regard to
the legal purifications, is treated as co-ordinate with the legislator.

[Leviticus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 11:2</span></span>

Rather, "These are the animals which ye may eat out of all the beasts;"
that is, out of the larger creatures, the quadrupeds, as distinguished
from birds and reptiles. See [Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md). Of quadrupeds, those only might
be eaten which completely divided the hoof and chew the cud [Lev
11:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#003.md).

[Leviticus 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 11:3</span></span>

Parteth ... - Rather, is clovenfooted and completely separates the
hoofs.

[Leviticus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 11:4</span></span>

Divideth not the hoof - The toes of the camel are divided above, but
they are united below in a sort of cushion or pad resting upon the hard
bottom of the foot, which is "like the sole of a shoe." The Moslems eat
the flesh of the camel, but it is said not to be wholesome.

[Leviticus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 11:5</span></span>

The coney - The Old English name for a rabbit. The animal meant is the
Hyrax Syriacus. It bears some resemblance to the guinea-pig or the
marmot, and in its general appearance and habits [Pro
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026.md); [Psa
104:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md), it might easily be taken for a
rodent. But Cuvier discovered that it is, in its anatomy, a true
pachyderm, allied to the rhinoceros and the tapir, inferior to them as
it is in size.

He cheweth the cud - The Hyrax has the same habit as the hare, the
rabbit, the guinea-pig, and some other rodents, of moving its jaws when
it is at rest as if it were masticating. The rodents were familiarly
spoken of as ruminating animals, just as the bat was reckoned among
birds because it flies (see [Lev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#019).md), and as whales and their
congeners are spoken of as fish, when there is no occasion for
scientific accuracy.

[Leviticus 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 11:7</span></span>

He divide the hoof ... - It is cloven-footed and completely, etc. See
[Lev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#003.md) note. Of all the quadrupeds
of which the Law forbids the flesh to be eaten, the pig seems to have
been regarded as the most unclean. Compare the marginal references.
Several other nations have agreed with the Hebrews in this respect: the
reason being that its flesh is unwholesome, especially in warm climates.

[Leviticus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 11:9</span></span>

Any fish, either from salt water or fresh, might be eaten if it had both
scales and fins. but no other creature that lives in the waters.
Shellfish of all kinds, whether mollusks or crustaceans, and cetaceous
animals, were therefore prohibited, as well as fish which appear to have
no scales, like the eel; probably because they were considered
unwholesome, and (under certain circumstances) found to be so.

[Leviticus 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 11:13</span></span>

As far as they can be identified, the birds here mentioned are such as
live upon animal food. They were those which the Israelites might have
been tempted to eat, either from their being easy to obtain, or from the
example of other nations, and which served as types of the entire range
of prohibited kinds.

[Lev 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#013.md)

The eagle - Rather, the great vulture, which the Egyptians are known to
have ranked as the first among birds. Compare [Sa2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#023.md); [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005.md); [Pro
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005.md), etc.

The Ossifrage, or bone-breaker, was the lammer-geyer, and the "ospray"
(a corruption of ossifrage) the sea-eagle.

[Lev 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#014.md)

The vulture - Rather, the (black) kite [Isa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md) : "the kite," rather the red
kite, remarkable for its piercing sight [Job
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#007.md).

[Lev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#015.md)

Every raven after his kind - i. e. the whole family of corvidae.

[Lev 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#016.md)

And the owl ... - Rather, "and the ostrich, and the owl, and the gull,
and the hawk," etc.

[Lev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#018.md)

The swan - More probably the ibis, the sacred bird of the Egyptians.
"The gier eagle" is most likely the Egyptian vulture, a bird of
unprepossessing appearance and disgusting habits, but fostered by the
Egyptians as a useful scavenger.

[Lev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#019.md)

The heron ... the lapwing - Rather, the great plover the hoopoe, so
called from its peculiar cry.

[Leviticus 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 11:20</span></span>

Rather, "All creeping things which have wings," etc. The word rendered
creeping things may be regarded as coextensive with our word vermin. It
is derived from a verb which signifies not only to creep, but to teem,
or bring forth abundantly [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md);
[Gen 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#017.md); [Exo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003.md); [Psa
105:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#030.md), and so easily came to denote
creatures which are apt to abound, to the annoyance of mankind.

[Leviticus 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 11:21</span></span>

Legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth - The families of
the Saltatoria, of which the common cricket, the common grasshopper, and
the migratory locust, may be taken as types.

[Leviticus 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 11:22</span></span>

In the uncertainty of identifying these four creatures, it has been
suggested that some of the names may belong to locusts in an imperfect
state of development. Most modern versions have taken a safer course
than our translators, by retaining the Hebrew names.

[Leviticus 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 11:24</span></span>

Unclean - If the due purification was omitted at the time, through
negligence or forgetfulness, a sin-offering was required. See [Lev
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 11:29</span></span>

The identification of "the creeping things" here named is not always
certain. They are most likely those which were occasionally eaten. For
the "Tortoise" read "the great lizard," for the "ferret" the "gecko"
(one of the lizard tribe), for the "chameleon" read the "frog" or the
Nile lizard: by the word rendered "snail" is probably meant another kind
of lizard, and by the "mole" the "chameleon."

[Leviticus 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 11:33</span></span>

Earthen vessel - See the marginal references.

[Leviticus 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 11:35</span></span>

See [Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md). The word rendered
"ranges for pots" has been conjectured to mean either an excavated
fireplace, fitted to receive a pair of ovens, or a support like a pair
of andirons.

[Leviticus 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lev 11:42</span></span>

Whatsoever goeth upon the belly - i. e. all footless reptiles, and
mollusks, snakes of all kinds, snails, slugs, and worms. "Whatsoever
goeth upon all four;" i. e. "creeping things," or vermin; such as the
weasel, the mouse or the lizard. Whatsoever hath more feet; i. e. all
insects, except the locust family ([Lev
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022) note.md), myriapods, spiders, and
caterpillars.

[Leviticus 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lev 11:44</span></span>

These verses set forth the spiritual ground on which the distinction
between clean and unclean is based. Compare the marginal references and
[Lev 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md); [Lev
20:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md); [Pe1
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

The basis of the obligation to maintain the distinction was the call of
the Hebrews to be the special people of Yahweh. It was to he something
in their daily life to remind them of the covenant which distinguished
them from the nations of the world. By Jesus Christ it was revealed [Mat
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md) to the elect people that they
were no longer to he tied by the letter of the Law in regard to their
food, but were to be left to the exercise of a regenerated judgment.
They were to learn that the kingdom of God is not eating, or abstaining
from, meats and drinks; but righteousness, and truth, and peace, and joy
in the Holy Spirit ([Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md).
Compare [Act 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015.md); [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004).md).
