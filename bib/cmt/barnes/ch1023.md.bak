Heritage

### [1 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 23:1</span></span>

See the marginal references and notes. [Ch1
23:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028.md) give the most complete
account in Scripture of the nature of the Levitical office.

[1 Chronicles 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 23:24</span></span>

From the age of twenty years - The Levites had hitherto not entered upon
their regular functions until the age of thirty [Ch1
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md). Certain lighter duties were by
the Law imposed on them at the age of twenty-five [Num
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024.md); but it was not until they were
five years older that they became liable to the full service of the
sanctuary. David appears now to have made a change. By his "last words"
[Ch1 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md) the time for the Levites to
enter on the full duties of their office was advanced from thirty to
twenty years. This change was based upon the lighter character of the
labors imposed on them now that the ark had ceased to be carried from
place to place and obtained a permanent habitation [Ch1
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#026.md). The limit of age continued in
after times where David had fixed it (see [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md).

[1 Chronicles 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 23:27</span></span>

By the "last words of David" some understand an historical work on the
latter part of his reign, drawn up probably by Gad or Nathan (compare
[Ch1 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md); [Ch1
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#029).md). Others suppose that he left
behind him a work containing directions for the service of the
sanctuary.

[1 Chronicles 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 23:31</span></span>

Though the Levites were not allowed by themselves to offer sacrifice,
yet there were many respects in which they assisted the priests when
sacrifice was offered. See [Ch2 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md);
[Ch2 35:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011.md).

The set feasts - The Passover, Feast of Pentecost, and Feast of
Tabernacles (marginal reference).
