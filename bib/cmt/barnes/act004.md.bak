### [Acts Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

[Acts 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 4:1</span></span>

The priests - It is probable that these priests were a part of the
Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. It is evident that they
claimed some authority for preventing the preaching of the apostles.

The captain of the temple - See the [Mat
26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md); [Luk
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#004.md) note. This was the commander of
the guard stationed chiefly in the tower Antonia, especially during the
great feasts; and it was his duty to preserve order and prevent any
tumult. He came at this time to prevent a tumult or suppress a riot, as
it was sup posed that the teaching of the apostles and the crowd
collected by the healing of the lame man would lead to a tumult.

And the Sadducees - See the notes on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md). One of the doctrines which the
Sadducees maintained was, that there was no resurrection of the dead.
Hence, they were particularly opposed to the apostles for preaching it,
because they gave so clear proof that Jesus had risen, and were thus
spreading the doctrine of the resurrection among the people.

Came upon them - This expression implies that they came in a sudden and
violent manner. See [Luk 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md).

[Acts 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 4:2</span></span>

Being grieved - The word thus translated occurs in only one other place
in the New Testament [Act 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018.md). It
implies more than simple sorrow; it was a mingled emotion of indignation
and anger. They did not grieve because they thought it a public
calamity, but because it interfered with their authority and opposed
their doctrine. It means that it was painful to them, or they could not
bear it. It is often the case that bigots, and people in authority, have
this kind of grief, at the zeal of people in spreading the truth, and
thus undermining their influence and authority.

That they taught the people - The ground of their grief was as much the
fact that they should presume to instruct the people as the matter which
they taught them. They were offended that unlearned Galileans, in no way
connected with the priestly office, and unauthorized by them, should
presume to set themselves up as religious teachers. They claimed the
right to watch over the interests of the people, and to declare who was
authorized to instruct the nation. It has been no unusual thing for men
in ecclesiastical stations to take exceptions to the ministry of those
who have not been commissioned by themselves. Such men easily fancy that
all power to instruct others is lodged in their hands, and they oppose
others simply from the fact that they have not derived their authority
from them. The true question in this case was whether these Galileans
gave proof that they were sent by God. The working of the miracle in
this case should have been satisfactory. We have here, also, a striking
instance of the fact that men may turn away from evidence, and from most
important points, and fix their attention on something that opposes
their prejudices, and which may be a matter of very little moment. No
inquiry was made whether the miracle had been really performed; but the
only inquiry was whether they had conformed to their views of doctrine
and order.

And preached through Jesus ... - The Sadducees would be particularly
opposed to this. They denied the doctrine of the resurrection, and they
were troubled that the apostles adduced proof of it so strong as the
resurrection of Jesus. It was perceived that this doctrine was becoming
established among the people; multitudes believed that he had risen; and
if he had been raised up, it followed also that others would rise. The
Sadducees, therefore, felt that their cause was in danger, and they
joined with the priests in endeavoring to arrest its spread among the
people. This is the account of the first opposition that was made to the
gospel as it was preached by the apostles. It is worthy of remark that
it excited so much and so speedily the enmity of those in power, and
that the apostles were so soon called to test the sincerity of their
attachment to their Master. They who but a few days before had fled at
the approach of danger, were now called to meet this opposition, and to
show their attachment to a risen Redeemer; and they did it without
shrinking. They showed now that they were indeed the true friends of the
crucified Saviour, and this remarkable change in their conduct is one of
the many proofs that they were influenced from above.

[Acts 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 4:3</span></span>

Put them in hold - That is, they took them into "custody," or into safe
keeping. Probably they committed them to the care of a guard.

Eventide - Evening. It was not convenient to assemble the council at
night. This was, moreover, the time for the evening prayer or sacrifice,
and it was not usual to assemble the Sanhedrin at that hour.

[Acts 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 4:4</span></span>

Howbeit - But; notwithstanding.

Many of them ... - This was one of the instances, which has since been
so often repeated, in which persecution is seen to have a tendency to
extend and establish the faith which it was designed to destroy. It
finally came to be a proverb that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed
of the church"; and there is no lesson which men have been so slow to
learn as that to oppose and persecute men is the very way to confirm
them in their opinions and to spread their doctrines. It was supposed
here that the disciples were few; that they were without power, wealth,
and influence; and that it was easy to crush them at once. But God made
their persecution the means of extending, in a signal manner, the truths
of the gospel and the triumphs of his word. And so in all ages it has
been, and so it ever will be.

And the number ... - It seems probable that in this number of 5,000
there were included the 120 persons who are mentioned in [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md), and the 3,000 people who were
converted on the day of Pentecost, [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md). It does not appear probable that
5,000 would have been assembled and converted in Solomon's porch [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md) on occasion of the cure of the
lame man. Luke doubtless means to say that, up to this time, the number
of persons who had joined themselves to the apostles was about 5,000. On
this supposition, the work of religion must have made a very rapid
advance. How long this was after the day of Pentecost is not mentioned,
but it is clear that it was at no very distant period; and the accession
of near two thousand to the number of believers was a very striking
proof of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit.

Of the men - Of the "persons." The word "men" is often used without
reference to sex, [Luk 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031.md); [Rom
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#008.md); [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md).

[Acts 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 4:5</span></span>

Their rulers - The rulers of the Jews; doubtless the members of the
Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation. Compare [Act
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015.md). See the notes on [Mat
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md); [Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md). The expression their rulers
looks as if this book was written for the Gentiles, or Luke would have
said our rulers.

Elders - Presbyters, or those who were chosen from among the people to
sit in the Sanhedrin. It is probable that the rulers were those who held
also some other office, but were also authorized to sit in the Great
Council.

Scribes - See the notes on [Mat 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md).

And Annas ... - See the notes on [Joh
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md). It is by no means certain that
Annas was at that time the high priest, but he had been, and doubtless
retained the title. He was father-in-law to Caiaphas, the high priest;
and from this fact, together with his former dignity, he is mentioned
first.

Caiaphas - Son-in-law of Annas, and now exercising the office of the
high priest, [Joh 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md).

John, and Alexander ... - Of these persons nothing more is known. It is
clear that they were members of the Great Council, and the mention of
their names shows that the men of chief authority and influence were
assembled to silence the apostles. Annas and Caiaphas had been concerned
in the condemnation of Jesus, and they would now feel a special interest
in arresting the progress of the gospel among the people. All the
success of the gospel reflected back light upon the wicked ness of the
act of condemning the Lord Jesus. And this fact may serve, in part, to
account for their strong desire to silence the apostles.

At Jerusalem - εἰς eis. This was the usual place of assembling the
Sanhedrin. But the Jewish writers (see Lightfoot on this place) say that
40 years before the destruction of the city, on account of the great
increase of crime, etc., the Sanhedrin was removed from place to place.
The declaration of Luke that they were now assembled in Jerusalem, seems
to imply that they sometimes met in other places. It is probable that
the members of the Sanhedrin were not in the city at the time mentioned
in [Act 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md), and this was the reason
why the trial was deferred to the next day.

[Acts 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 4:7</span></span>

In the midst - In the presence of the Great Council.

By what power ... - A similar question was put to Christ in the temple,
[Mat 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md).

By what name - That is, by whose authority. It is very probable that
they expected to intimidate the apostles by this question. They claimed
the right of regulating the religious affairs of the nation. They had
vast power with the people. They assumed that all power to instruct the
people should originate with them; and they expected that the apostles
would be confounded, as having violated the established usage of the
nation. It did not seem to occur to them to enter into an investigation
of the question whether this acknowledged miracle did not prove that
they were sent by God, but they assumed that they were impostors, and
attempted to silence them by authority. It has been usual with the
enemies of religion to attempt to intimidate its friends, and when
argument fails, to attempt to silence Christians by appealing to their
fears.

[Acts 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 4:8</span></span>

Filled with the Holy Ghost - See the notes on [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md).

Ye rulers ... - Peter addressed the Sanhedrin with perfect respect. He
did not call in question their authority to propose this question. He
seemed to regard this as a favorable opportunity to declare the truth
and state the evidence of the Christian religion. In this he acted on
the principle of the injunction which he himself afterward gave [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md), "Be ready always to give an
answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you,
with meekness and fear." Innocence is willing to be questioned; and a
believer in the truth will rejoice in any opportunity to state the
evidence of what is believed. It is remarkable, also, that this was
before the Great Council of the nation - the body that was clothed with
the highest authority. Peter could not have forgotten that before this
very council, and these very men, his Master had been arraigned and
condemned; nor could he have forgotten that in the very room where this
same council was convened to try his Lord, he had himself shrunk from an
honest avowal of attachment to him, and shamefully and profanely denied
him.

That he was now able to stand boldly before this same tribunal evinced a
remarkable change in his feelings, and was a most clear and impressive
proof of the genuineness of his repentance when he went out and wept
bitterly. Compare [Luk 22:54-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054.md). And
we may remark here, that one of the most clear evidences of the
sincerity of repentance is when it leads to a result like this. So
deeply was the heart of Peter affected by his sin [Luk
22:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#062.md), and so genuine was his sorrow,
that he doubtless remembered his crime on this occasion, and the memory
of it inspired him with boldness. It may be further remarked, that one
evidence of the genuineness of repentance is a desire to repair the evil
which is done by crime. Peter had done dishonor to his Master and his
cause in the presence of the great council of the nation. Nothing, on
such an occasion, would be more likely to do injury to the cause than
for one of the disciples of the Saviour to deny him - one of his
followers to be guilty of profaneness and falsehood. But here was an
opportunity, in some degree, at least, to repair the evil. Before the
same council, in the same city, and in the presence. of the same people,
it is not an unnatural supposition that Peter rejoiced that he might
have opportunity to bear his testimony to the divine mission of the
Saviour whom he had before denied. By using the customary language of
respect applied to the Great Council, Peter also has shown us that it is
proper to evince respect for office and for those in power. Religion
requires us to render this homage, and to treat men in office with
deference, [Mat 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021.md); [Rom
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md); [Pe1
2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md).

[Acts 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 4:9</span></span>

If we this day - If as is the fact; or since we are thus examined.

Examined - Questioned; if the purpose is to institute an inquiry into
this case, or since it is the purpose to institute such an inquiry.

The good deed - The act of benevolence; the benefit conferred on an
infirm man. He assumes that it was undeniable that the deed had been
done.

To the impotent man - To this man who was infirm or lame. The man was
then present, [Act 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md), [Act
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#014.md). He may have been arrested with
the apostles; or he may have been present as a spectator; or, as Neander
supposes, he may have been summoned as a witness.

By what means - This was the real point of the inquiry. The fact that he
had been made whole was not denied. The only question was whether it had
been done by the authority and power of Jesus of Nazareth, as Peter
declared it to be, [Act 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md), [Act
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md).

[Acts 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 4:10</span></span>

Be it known ... - Peter might have evaded the question, or he might have
resorted to many excuses and subterfuges (Calvin), if he had been
desirous of avoiding this inquiry. But it was a noble opportunity for
vindicating the honor of his Lord and Master. It was a noble opportunity
also for repairing the evil which he had done by his guilty denial of
his Lord. Although, therefore, this frank and open avowal was attended
with danger, and although it was in the presence of the great and the
mighty, yet he chose to state fully and clearly his conviction of the
truth. Never was there an instance of greater boldness, and never could
there be a more striking illustration of the fitness of the name which
the Lord Jesus gave him, that of a rock, [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md); [Mat
16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md). The timid, trembling,
yielding, and vacillating Simon; he who just before was terrified by a
servant-girl, and who on the lake was afraid of sinking, is now
transformed into the manly, decided, and firm Cephas, fearless before
the Great Council of the nation, and in an unwavering tone asserting the
authority of him whom he had just before denied, and whom they had just
before put to death. It is not possible to account for this change
except on the supposition that this religion is true. Peter had no
worldly motive to actuate him. He had no prospect of wealth or fame by
this. Even the hopes of honor and preferment which the apostles had
cherished before the death of Jesus, and which might have been supposed
to influence them then, were now abandoned by them. Their Master had
died, and all their hopes of human honor and power had been buried in
his grave. Nothing but the conviction of the truth could have made this
change, and transformed this timid disciple to a bold and uncompromising
apostle.

By the name - By the authority or power, [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md).

Of Jesus Christ - The union of these two names would be particularly
offensive to the Sanhedrin. They denied that Jesus was the Christ, or
the Messiah; Peter, by the use of the word "Christ," affirmed that he
was. In the language then used, it would be, "By the name of Jesus, the
Messiah."

Of Nazareth - Lest there should be any mistake about his meaning, he
specified that he referred to the despised Nazarene; to him who had just
been put to death, as they supposed, covered with infamy. Christians
little regard the epithets of opprobrium which may be affixed to
themselves or to their religion.

Whom ye crucified - There is emphasis in all the expressions that Peter
uses. He had before charged the people with the crime of having put him
to death, [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md); [Act
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md). But he now had the
opportunity, contrary to all expectation, of urging the charge with
still greater force on the rulers themselves, on the very council which
had condemned him and delivered him to Pilate. It was a remarkable
providence that an opportunity was thus afforded of urging this charge
in the presence of the Sanhedrin, and of proclaiming to them the
necessity of repentance. Little did they imagine, when they condemned
the Lord Jesus, that this charge would be so soon urged. This is one of
the instances in which God takes the wise in their own craftiness, [Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md). They had arraigned the apostles;
they demanded their authority for what they had done; and thus they had
directly opened the way, and invited them to the serious and solemn
charge which Peter here urges against them.

[Acts 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 4:11</span></span>

This is the stone - This passage is found in [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md). It is quoted, also, by our
Saviour as applicable to himself. See the notes on [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md). The ancient Jews applied this
to David. In the Targum on [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md), this passage is rendered, "The
child who was among the sons of Jesse, and was worthy to be constituted
king, the builders rejected." The New Testament writers, however, apply
it without any doubt to the Messiah. Compare [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md). And from this passage we may
learn that God will overrule the devices and plans of wicked men to
accomplish his own purposes. What people despise and set at naught, he
esteems of inestimable value in his kingdom. What the great and the
mighty contemn, he regards as the very foundation and cornerstone of the
edifice which he designs to rear. Nothing has been more remarkable than
this in the history of man; and in nothing is more contempt thrown on
the proud projects of people, than that what they have rejected God has
made the very basis of his schemes.

[Acts 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 4:12</span></span>

Neither is there salvation - The word "salvation" properly denotes any
"preservation," or keeping anything in a "safe" state; a preserving from
harm. It I signifies, also, deliverance from any evil of body or mind;
from pain, sickness, danger, etc., [Act
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md). But it is in the New Testament
applied particularly to the work which the Messiah came to do, "to seek
and to save that which was lost," [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md). This work refers primarily to a
deliverance of the soul from sin [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md); [Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031.md); [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md); [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md). It then denotes, as a consequence
of freedom from sin, freedom from all the ills to which sin exposes man,
and the attainment of that perfect peace and joy which will be bestowed
on the children of God in the heavens. The reasons why Peter introduces
this subject here seem to be these:

\(1\) He was discoursing on the deliverance of the man that was healed -
his salvation from a long and painful calamity. This deliverance had
been accomplished by the power of Jesus. The mention of this suggested
that greater and more important salvation from sin and death which it
was the object of the Lord Jesus to effect. As it was by his power that
this man had been healed, so it was by his power only that people could
be saved from death and hell. Deliverance from any temporal calamity
should lead the thoughts to that higher redemption which the Lord Jesus
contemplates in regard to the soul.

\(2\) this was a favorable opportunity to introduce the doctrines of the
gospel to the notice of the Great Council of the nation. The occasion
invited to it; the mention of a part of the work of Jesus invited to a
contemplation of his whole work. Peter would not have done justice to
the character and work of Christ if he had not introduced that great
design which he had in view to save people from death and hell. It is
probable, also, that he advanced a sentiment in which he expected they
would immediately concur, and which accorded with their wellknown
opinions, that salvation was to be obtained only by the Messiah. Thus,
Paul [Act 26:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md) says that he taught
nothing else than what was delivered by Moses and the prophets, etc.
Compare [Act 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md); [Act
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md). The apostles did not pretend to
proclaim any doctrine which was not delivered by Moses and the prophets,
and which did not, in fact, constitute a part of the creed of the Jewish
nation.

In any other - Any other person. He does not mean to say that God is not
able to save, but that the salvation of the human family is entrusted to
the hands of Jesus the Messiah.

For there is none other name - This is an explanation of what he had
said in the previous part of the verse. The word "name" here is used to
denote "the person himself" (i. e., There is no other being or person.)
As we would say, there is no one who can save but Jesus Christ. The word
"name" is often used in this sense. See the notes on [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md), [Act
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md). That there is no other Saviour,
or mediator between God and man, is abundantly taught in the New
Testament; and it is, indeed, the main design of revelation to prove
this. See [Ti1 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md); [Act
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md).

Under heaven - This expression does not materially differ from the one
immediately following, "among men." They are designed to express with
emphasis the sentiment that salvation is to be obtained in "Christ
alone," and not in any patriarch, or prophet, or teacher, or king, or in
any false Messiah.

Given - In this word it is implied that "salvation" has its origin in
God; that a Saviour for people must be given by him; and that salvation
cannot be originated by any power among people. The Lord Jesus is thus
uniformly represented as given or appointed by God for this great
purpose [Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md); [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md); [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md); [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md); [Rom
5:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021.md); and hence, Christ is called the
"unspeakable gift" of God, [Co2 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md).

Whereby we must be saved - By which it is fit, or proper δεῖ dei, that
we should be saved. There is no other way of salvation that is adapted
to the great object contemplated, and therefore, if saved, it must be in
this way and by this plan. The schemes of people's own devices are not
adapted to the purpose, and therefore cannot save. The doctrine that
people can be saved only by Jesus Christ is abundantly taught in the
Scriptures. To show the failure of all other schemes of religion was the
great design of the first part of the Epistle to the Romans. By a
labored argument Paul there shows Rom. 1 that the Gentiles had failed in
their attempt to justify themselves; and in Rom. 2-3 that the same thing
was true also of the Jews. If both these schemes failed, then there was
need of some other plan, and that plan was that by Jesus Christ. If it
be asked, then, whether this affirmation of Peter is to be understood as
having respect to infants and the pagan, we may remark:

\(1\) That his design was primarily to address the Jews, "Whereby we
must be saved." But,

\(2\) The same thing is doubtless true of others. If, as Christians
generally believe, infants are saved, there is no absurdity in supposing
that it is by the merits of the atonement. But for that there would have
been no promise of salvation to any of the human race. No offer has been
made except by the Mediator; and to him, doubtless, is to be ascribed
all the glory of raising up even those in infancy to eternal life. If
any of the pagan are to be saved, as most Christians suppose, and as
seems in accordance with the mercy of God, it is no less certain that it
will be in consequence of the intervention of Christ. Those who will be
brought to heaven will sing one song [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), and will be prepared for eternal
union in the service of God in the skies. Still, the Scriptures have not
declared that great numbers of the pagan will be saved who have not the
gospel. The contrary is more than implied in the New Testament, [Rom
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md).

Neither has the Scripture affirmed that all the pagan will certainly be
cut off. It has been discovered by missionaries among the pagan that
individuals have, in a remarkable way; been convinced of the folly of
idolatry, and were seeking a better religion; that their minds were in a
serious, thoughtful, inquiring state; and that they at once embraced the
gospel when it was offered to them as exactly adapted to their state of
mind, and as meeting their inquiries. Such was extensively the case in
the Sandwich Islands; and the following instance recently occurred in
this country: "The Flathead Indians, living west of the Rocky Mountains,
recently sent a deputation to the white settlements to inquire after the
Bible. The circumstance that led to this singular movement is as
follows: It appears that a white man (Mr. Catlin) had penetrated into
their country, and happened to be a spectator at one of their religious
ceremonies. He informed them that their mode of worshipping the Supreme
Being was radically wrong, and that the people away toward the rising of
the sun had been put in possession of the true mode of worshipping the
Great Spirit. On receiving this information, they called a national
council to take this subject into consideration. Some said, if this be
true, it is certainly high time we were put in possession of this mode.
They accordingly deputed four of the chiefs to proceed to Louis to see
their great father, General Clark, to inquire of him the truth of this
matter.

They were cordially received by the general, who gave them a succinct
history of revelation, and the necessary instruction relative to their
important mission. Two of them sunk under the severe toils attending a
journey of 3,000 miles. The remaining two, after acquiring what
knowledge they could of the Bible, its institutions and precepts,
returned, to carry back those few rays of divine light to their
benighted countrymen." In what way their minds were led to this State we
cannot say, or how this preparation for the gospel was connected with
the agency and merits of Christ we perhaps cannot understand; but we
know that the affairs of this entire world are placed under the control
of Christ [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md); [Eph
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md), and that the arrangements of
events by which such people were brought to this state of mind are in
his hands. Another remark may here be made. It is, that it often occurs
that blessings come upon us from benefactors whom we do not see, and
from sources which we cannot trace.

On this principle we receive many of the mercies of life; and from
anything that appears, in this way many blessings of salvation may be
conferred on the world, and possibly many of the pagan be saved. Still,
this view does not interfere with the command of Christ to preach the
gospel, [Mar 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md). The great mass of
the pagan are not in this state; but the fact here adverted to, so far
as it goes, is an encouragement to preach the gospel to the entire
world. If Christ thus prepares the way; if he extensively fits the minds
of the pagan for the reception of the gospel; if he shows them the evil
and folly of their own system, and leads them to desire a better, then
this should operate not to produce indolence, but activity, and zeal,
and encouragement to enter into the field white for the harvest, and to
toil that all who seek the truth, and are prepared to embrace the
gospel, may be brought to the light of the Sun of righteousness.

[Acts 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 4:13</span></span>

Boldness - This word properly denotes "openness" or "confidence in
speaking." It stands opposed to "hesitancy," and to "equivocation" in
declaring our sentiments. Here it means that, in spite of danger and
opposition, they avowed their doctrines without any attempt to conceal
or disguise them.

Peter and John - It was they only who had been concerned in the healing
of the lame man, [Act 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md).

And perceived - When they knew that they were unlearned. This might have
been ascertained either by report or by the manner of their speaking.

Unlearned - This word properly denotes "those who were not acquainted
with letters, or who had not had the benefit of an education."

Ignorant men - ἰδιῶται idiōtai. This word properly denotes "those who
live in private, in contradistinction from those who are engaged in
public life or in office." As this class of persons is commonly also
supposed to be less learned, talented, and refined than those in office,
it comes to denote "those who are rude and illiterate." The idea
intended to be conveyed here is, that these men had not had
opportunities of education (compare [Mat
4:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018).md), and had not been accustomed
to public speaking, and hence, they were surprised at their boldness.
This same character is uniformly attributed to the early preachers of
Christianity. Compare [Co1 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md); [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md). The Galileans were regarded by
the Jews as particularly rude and uncultivated, [Mat
26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073.md); [Mar
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017.md).

They marvelled - They wondered that men who had not been educated in the
schools of the rabbis, and accustomed to speak in public, should declare
their sentiments with so much boldness.

And they took knowledge - This expression means simply that riley knew,
or that they obtained evidence that they had been with Jesus. It is not
said in what way they obtained this evidence, but the connection leads
us to suppose it was by the miracle which they had performed, by their
firm and bold declaration of the doctrines of Jesus, and perhaps by the
irresistible conviction that none would be thus bold who had not been
personally with him, and who had not the firmest conviction that he was
the Messiah. They had not been trained in their schools, and their
boldness could not be attributed to the arts of rhetoric, but was the
native, ingenuous, and manly exhibition of a deep conviction of the
truth of what they spoke, and that conviction could have been obtained
only by their having been with him, and having been satisfied that he
was the Messiah. Such conviction is of far more value in preaching than
all the mere teachings of the schools; and without such a conviction,
all preaching will be frigid, hypocritical, and useless.

Had been with Jesus - Had been his followers, and had attended person
ally on his ministry. They gave evidence that they had seen him, been
with him, heard him, and were convinced that he was the Messiah. We may
learn here:

\(1\) That if men wish to be successful in preaching, it must be based
on deep and thorough conviction of the truth of what they deliver.

\(2\) they who preach should give evidence that they are acquainted with
the Lord Jesus Christ; that they have imbibed his spirit, pondered his
instructions, studied the evidences of his divine mission, and are
thoroughly convinced that he was from God.

\(3\) boldness and success in the ministry, as well as in everything
else, will depend far more on honest, genuine, thorough conviction of
the truth than on the endowments of talent and learning, and the arts
and skill of eloquence. No man should attempt to preach without such a
thorough conviction of truth; and no man who has it will preach in vain.

\(4\) God often employs the ignorant and unlearned to confound the wise,
[Co1 1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md). But it is not by their
ignorance. It was not the ignorance of Peter and John that convinced the
Sanhedrin. It was done in spite of their ignorance. It was their
boldness and their honest conviction of truth. Besides, though not
learned in the schools of the Jews, they had been under a far more
important training, under the personal direction of Christ himself, for
three years; I and now they were directly endowed by the Holy Spirit
with the power of speaking with tongues. Though not taught in the
schools, yet there was an important sense in which they were not
unlearned and ignorant men. Their example should not, therefore, be pled
in favor of an unlearned ministry. Christ himself expressed his
opposition to an unlearned ministry by teaching them himself, and then
by bestowing on them miraculous endowments which no learning at present
can furnish. It may be remarked, further, that in the single selection
which he made of an apostle after his ascension to heaven, when he came
to choose one who had not been under his personal teaching, he chose a
learned man, the apostle Paul, and thus evinced his purpose that there
should be training or education in those who are invested with the
sacred office.

\(5\) yet in the case before us there is a striking proof of the truth
and power of religion. These men had not acquired their boldness in the
schools; they were not trained for argument among the Jews; they did not
meet them by cunning sophistry; but they came with the honest conviction
that what they were saying was true. Were they deceived? Were they not
competent to bear witness? Did they have any motive to attempt to palm a
falsehood onto people? Infidelity must answer many such questions as
these before the apostles can be convicted of imposture.

[Acts 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 4:14</span></span>

They could say nothing ... - The presence of the man that was healed was
an unanswerable fact in proof of the truth of what the apostles alleged.
The miracle was so public, clear, and decisive; the man that was healed
was so well known, that there was no evasion or subterfuge by which they
could escape the conclusion to which the apostles were conducting them.
It evinced no little gratitude in the man that was healed that he was
present on this occasion, and showed that he was deeply interested in
what befell his benefactors. The miracles of Jesus and his apostles were
such that they could not be denied, and hence, the Jews did not attempt
to deny that they performed them. Compare [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md); [Joh
11:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#045.md); [Act
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#036.md).

[Acts 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 4:15</span></span>

What shall we do to these men? - The object which they had in view was
evidently to prevent their preaching. The miracle was performed, and it
was believed by the people to have been made. This they could not expect
to be able successfully to deny. Their only object, therefore, was to
prevent the apostles from making the use which they saw they would to
convince the people that Jesus was the Messiah. The question was, in
what way they should prevent this; whether by putting them to death, by
imprisoning them, or by scourging them; or whether by simply exerting
theft authority and forbidding them. From the former they were deterred,
doubtless, by fear of the multitude; and they therefore adopted the
latter, and seemed to suppose that the mere exertion of their authority
would be sufficient to deter them from this in future.

The council - Greek: The "Sanhedrin." This body was composed of 71 or 72
persons, and was entrusted with the principal affairs of the nation. It
was a body of vast influence and power, and hence they supposed that
their command might be sufficient to restrain ignorant Galileans from
speaking. Before this same body, and probably the same men, our Saviour
was arraigned, and by them condemned before he was delivered to the
Roman governor, [Mat 26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059.md), etc. And
before this same body, and in the presence of the same men, Peter had
just before denied his Lord, [Mat
26:70](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070.md), etc. The fact that the
disciples had fled on a former occasion, and that Peter had denied his
Saviour, may hate operated to induce them to believe that they would be
terrified by their threats, and deterred from preaching publicly in the
name of Jesus.

A notable miracle - A known, undeniable miracle.

That it spread - That the knowledge of it may not spread among them any
further.

Let us straitly threaten them - Greek: "Let us threaten them with a
threat." This is a "Hebraism" expressing intensity, certainty, etc. The
threat was a command [Act 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md) not to
teach, implying their displeasure if they did do it. This threat,
however, was not effectual. On the next occasion, which occurred soon
after [Act 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md), they added beating to
their threats in order to deter them from preaching in the name of
Jesus.

[Acts 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 4:19</span></span>

Whether it be right ... - The apostles abated nothing of their boldness
when threatened. They openly appealed to their judges whether their
command could be right. And in doing this, they expressed their full
conviction of the truth of what they had said, and their deliberate
purpose not to regard their command, but still to proclaim to the people
the truth that Jesus was the Messiah.

In the sight of God - That is, whether God will judge this to be right.
The grand question was how God would regard it. If he disapproved it, it
was wrong. It was not merely a question pertaining to their reputation,
safety, or life; it was a question of conscience before God. We have
here a striking instance of the principle on which Christians act. It
is, to lay their safety, reputation, and life out of view, and bring
everything to the test whether it will please God. If it will, it is
right; if it will not, it is wrong.

To hearken - To "hear" and to "hearken" are often used to denote to
"obey," [Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md); [Joh
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md), etc.

Judge ye - This was an appeal to them directly as judges and as men. And
it may be presumed that it was an appeal which they could not resist.
The Sanhedrin acknowledged itself to have been appointed by God, and to
have no authority which was not derived from his appointment. Of course,
God could modify, supersede, or repeal their authority; and the abstract
principle that it was better to obey God than man they could not call in
question. The only inquiry was whether they had evidence that God had
issued any command in the case. Of that the apostles were satisfied, and
that the rulers could not deny. It may be remarked that this is one of
the first and most bold appeals on record in favor of the right of
private judgment and the liberty of conscience. That liberty was
supposed in all the Jewish religion. It was admitted that the authority
of God in all matters was superior to that of man. And the same spirit
manifested itself thus early in the Christian church against all
dominion over the conscience, and in favor of the right to follow the
dictates of the conscience and the will of God. As a mere historical
fact, therefore, it is interesting to contemplate this, and still more
interesting in its important bearings on human liberty and human
happiness. The doctrine is still more explicitly stated in [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md), "We ought to obey God rather
than man."

[Acts 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 4:20</span></span>

For ... - This is given as a reason why they should obey God rather than
man. They had had so clear evidence that God had sent the Messiah, and
they had received a direct and solemn command [Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md) to preach the gospel, that they
could not be restrained. There was a necessity laid on them to preach.
See [Co1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md). Compare [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md); [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md); [Job
32:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018.md); [Psa
39:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001.md).

It has already been remarked that these two verses contain an important
principle in favor of religious liberty the liberty of conscience and of
private judgment. They contain the great principle of Christianity and
of the Protestant religion, that the responsibility of men for their
religious opinions is direct to God, and that other men have no power of
control. The opposite of this is tyranny and oppression. It may be
proper, in addition, to present some further remarks, involved in the
principle here stated:

\(1\) Religion, from the beginning, has been favorable to liberty. There
was no principle more sacred among the Jews than that they were to be
independent of other nations. Perhaps no people have ever been so
restive under a foreign yoke, so prone to rebel, and so difficult to be
broken down by oppression and by arms, as were the Jews. So true was
this, that it appeared to other nations to be mere obstinacy. They were
often subdued, but they rose against their oppressors and threw off the
yoke. No people have been found who were so difficult to be reduced to
slavery. It is well known that the Romans were accustomed to subject the
captives taken in war to perpetual servitude; and commonly the spirit of
the captive was broken, and he remained quietly in bondage. But not so
the Jew. Nothing ever tamed his spirit. No bribes, or threats, or chains
could induce him to violate the laws of his religion. Even in captivity,
we are told that the Jewish slaves at Rome would observe the Sabbath;
would keep the feasts of their nation, and would never conform to the
customs of an idolatrous people. To the Romans this appeared to be mere
obstinacy. But it was the genius of their religion. The right of liberty
of thought was one which they would not surrender. The spirit of the
patriarchs was favorable to liberty, and implied responsibility only to
God. Familiarity with the sacred books had taught them these lessons,
and neither time nor distance could obliterate them. In the time of
Christ, the great mass of the nation were evidently opposed to the tax
paid to the Roman nation, and sighed under this burden, until they rose
and attempted to assert their rights; and their city, and temple, and
land were sacrificed rather than yield this great principle.

\(2\) this same principle was evinced by the apostles and by the early
Christians. With this doctrine fresh upon their hearts, they went forth
to other lands. They maintained it at the expense of their blood, and
thousands fell as martyrs in the cause of liberty and of private
judgment in religion. No one ever defended liberty more firmly than the
early martyrs; and each one that died, died in defense of a principle
which is now the acknowledged right of all people.

\(3\) the designs of tyranny and superstition have been to destroy this
principle. This was the aim of the Sanhedrin; and yet, when Peter and
John appealed to their consciences, they did not dare to avow their
purpose. This has been the aim of all tyrants, and this the effect of
all superstition. Hence, the Church of Rome has taken away the
Scriptures from the people, and has thus furnished incontestable
evidence that in its view the Bible is favorable to liberty. For
centuries, tyranny reigned in one black flight over Europe; nor was the
darkness dispelled until the Bible, that taught people the principles of
freedom, was restored to them.

\(4\) the effect of the principle avowed by the apostles had been
uniform. Luther began the reformation by finding in a monastery a copy
of the Bible, a book which until that time - when more than twenty years
of age - he had never seen. The effect on the liberties of Europe was
immediately seen. Hume admitted that whatever liberty England possessed
was to be traced to the Puritans. Our own land (America) is a striking
instance of the effect of this great principle, and of its influence on
the rights of man. And just in proportion as the New Testament is spread
abroad will people seek for freedom and break the chains of oppression.
The best way to promote universal liberty is to spread the Bible to the
ends of the earth. There is not a precept in it that is not favorable to
freedom. It tends to enlarge and liberalize the mind; to teach people
their rights; to put an end to ignorance, the universal stronghold of
superstition and tyranny; and to diffuse the love of justice, truth, and
order. It shows man that he is responsible to God, and that no one has a
right to ordain anything which contravenes the liberty of his fellow.

If it be asked here what the principle is, I answer:

\(1\) That people have a right to their private judgment in matters of
religion, subject only to God. The only restraint which, it is now
settled, can be imposed on this, is, that no man has a right, under
pretence of conscience, to injure or molest his fellow-men, or to
disturb the peace and harmony of society.

\(2\) no magistrate, church, council, or parent, has a right to impose a
creed on others, and to demand subscription to it by mere authority.

\(3\) no magistrate, church, or parent, has a right to control. the free
exercise of private judgment in this case. The power of a parent is to
teach, advise, and entreat. The duty of a child is to listen with
respect; to examine with candor; to pray over the subject, and to be
deliberate and calm, not rash, hasty, impetuous, and self-willed. But
when the child is thus convinced that his duty to God requires a
particular course, then here is a higher obligation than any earthly
law, and he must obey God rather than man, ever a father or a mother,
[Mat 10:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037.md).

\(4\) every man is responsible to God for his opinions and his conduct.
Man may not control him, but God may and will. The great question before
every man is, What is right in the sight of God? It is not, What is
expedient, or safe, or pleasurable, or honorable among people? but, What
is right in the sight of God? Neither in their opinions nor their
conduct are people free from responsibility. From this whole subject we
see the duty of spreading the Bible. If we love liberty; if we hate
tyranny and superstition; if we wish to extend the knowledge of the
rights of man, and break every arm of oppression, let us spread far and
wide the Book of God, and place in every palace and every cottage on the
globe a copy of the sacred Scriptures.

[Acts 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 4:21</span></span>

Finding nothing ... - That is, not being able to devise any way of
punishing them without exciting a tumult among the people, and
endangering their own authority. The Sanhedrin was frequently influenced
by this fear; and it shows that their own authority was much dependent
on the caprice of the multitude. Compare [Mat
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026.md).

All men - That is, the great mass or body of the people.

Glorified God - Praised God for the miracle. This implies:

\(1\) That they believed that the miracle was genuine.

\(2\) that they were grateful to God for so signal a mercy in conferring
health and comfort on a man who had been long afflicted. We may add
further, that here is the highest evidence of the reality of the
miracle. Even the Sanhedrin, with all their prejudice and opposition,
did not call it in question; and the common people, who had doubtless
been acquainted with this man for years, were convinced that it was
real. It would have been impossible to impose on keensighted and jealous
adversaries in this manner if this had been an imposture.

[Acts 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 4:22</span></span>

For the man ... - The age of the man is mentioned to show the certainty
and greatness of the miracle. If it had been a man who had been lame but
a few years, or if it had been a child or a very young man, the case
would not been so remarkable. But after a continuance of 40 years, all
hope of healing him by any ordinary means must have been abandoned, and
all pretence that this was jugglery or deception must have been absurd.

[Acts 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 4:23</span></span>

Their own company - They joined the other apostles and Christians, [Act
2:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md).

And reported ... - It doubtless became a subject of interesting inquiry
what they should do in this case. They had been threatened by the
highest authority of the nation, and commanded not to preach again in
the name of Jesus. Whether they should obey them and be silent, or
whether they should leave Jerusalem and preach elsewhere, could not but
be an interesting subject of inquiry, and they very properly sought the
counsel of their brethren, and looked to God for direction, an example
which all should follow who are exposed to persecution, or who are in
any perplexity about the path of duty.

[Acts 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 4:24</span></span>

They lifted up their voice - To lift up the voice, among the Hebrews,
was a phrase denoting either an "address" to the people [Jdg
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md), or a phrase expressive of
"weeping" [Gen 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#011.md); [Jdg
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#004.md); [Rut
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009.md); [Sa1
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016.md), or of "prayer." To lift up the
voice to God means simply they prayed to Him.

With one accord - Unitedly. Properly, with one mind or purpose. See
notes on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md). The union of the
early Christians is often noticed in the Acts of the Apostles. Thus far,
there was no jar or dissension in their society, and everything has the
appearance of the most entire affection and confidence.

Lord - Greek: Δέσποτα Despota - "Despota." From this word is derived the
word "despot." This is not the usual word employed by which to address
God. The word commonly translated "Lord" is Κυρίος Kurios. The word used
here denotes "one who rules over others," and was applied to the highest
magistrate or officer. It denotes "authority; power; absoluteness in
ruling." It is a word denoting more authority in ruling than the other.
That more commonly denotes a property in a thing; this denotes "absolute
rule." It is applied to God in [Luk
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029.md); [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md); to Jesus Christ, [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md); to masters, [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md); [Tit
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); to husbands, [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md); and to a possessor or owner, [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md).

Thou art God - This ascription of praise seems to have been designed to
denote their sense of his power to deliver them, and of his right to
dispose of them. They were employed in his service; they were
encompassed with dangers; and they acknowledged him as their God, who
had made all things, and who had an entire right to direct, and to
dispose of them for his own glory. In times of danger and perplexity we
should remember that God has a right to do with us as he pleases; and we
should go cheerfully, and commit ourselves into his hands.

Which hast made ... - Gen. 1: This passage is taken directly from [Psa
146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md). Compare [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md).

[Acts 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 4:25</span></span>

Who by the mouth ... - , [Psa 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md).
This is a strong, solemn testimony to the inspiration of David. It is a
declaration of the apostles, made in solemn prayer, that God himself
spake by the mouth of David. This is the second part of their prayer. In
the first, they acknowledge the right of God to rule; in this, they
appeal to a prophecy; they plead that this was a thing foretold; and as
God had foreseen it and foretold it, they appealed to him to protect
them. The times of tumult and opposition which had been foreseen, as
about to attend the introduction of the gospel, had now come. They
inferred, therefore, that Jesus was the Messiah; and as God had designed
to establish his kingdom, they appealed to him to aid and protect them
in this great work. This passage is taken from [Psa
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md), and is an exact quotation from
the Septuagint. This proves that the Psalm had reference to the Messiah.
Thus, it was manifestly understood by the Jews; and the authority of the
apostles settles the question. The Psalm was composed by David, but on
what occasion is not known; nor is it material to our present purpose.
It has been a matter of inquiry whether it referred to the Messiah
primarily, or only in a secondary sense. Grotius supposes that it was
composed by David when exposed to the hostility of the Assyrians, the
Moabites, Philistines, Amalekites, etc.; and that, in the midst of his
dangers, he sought consolation in the purpose of God to establish him
and his kingdom. But the more probable opinion is, that it referred
directly and solely to the Messiah.

Why did the heathen - The nations which were not Jews. This refers,
doubtless, to the opposition which would be made to the spread of
Christianity, and not merely to the opposition made to the Messiah
himself, and to the act of putting him to death.

Rage - This word refers to the excitement and tumult of a multitude; not
a settled plan, but rather the heated and disorderly conduct of a mob.
It means that the progress of the gospel would encounter tumultuous
opposition, and that the excited nations would rush violently to put it
down and destroy it.

And the people - The expression "the people" does not refer to a class
of people different essentially from the pagan. The "pagan," Hebrew and
Greek, "the nations," refer to people as organized into communities; the
expression the people is used to denote the same persons without respect
to their being so organized. The Hebrews were in the habit, in their
poetry, of expressing the same idea essentially in parallel members of a
sentence; that is, the last member of a sentence or verse expressed the
same idea, with some slight variation, as the former. (See Lowth on the
sacred poetry of the Hebrews.)

Imagine - The word "imagine" does not quite express the force of the
original. The Hebrew and the Greek both convey the idea of meditating,
thinking, purposing. It means that they employed "thought," "plan,"
"purpose," in opposing the Messiah.

Vain things - The word used here κενά kena is a literal translation of
the Hebrew רק rēyq, and means usually "empty," as a vessel. which is not
filled; then "useless," or what amounts to nothing, etc. Here it means
that they devised a plan which turned out to be vain or ineffectual.
They attempted an opposition to the Messiah which could not succeed. God
would establish his kingdom in spite of their plans to oppose it. Their
efforts were vain because they were not strong enough to oppose God;
because he had purposed to establish the kingdom of his Son; and because
he could overrule even their opposition to advance his cause.

[Acts 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 4:26</span></span>

The kings of the earth - The Psalmist specifies more particularly that
kings and rulers would be opposed to the Messiah. This had occurred
already by the opposition made to the Messiah by the rulers of the
Jewish people, and it would be still more evinced by the opposition of
princes and kings as the gospel spread among the nations.

Stood up - The word used here παρίστημι paristēmi commonly means "to
present oneself, or to stand forth, for the purpose of aiding,
counseling," etc. But here it means that they "rose," or "presented
themselves," to evince their opposition. They stood opposed to the
Messiah, and offered resistance to him.

The rulers - This is another instance of the Hebrew parallelism. The
word does not denote another class of people from kings, but expresses
the same idea in another form, or in a more general manner, meaning that
all classes of persons in authority would be opposed to the gospel.

Were gathered together - Hebrew, consulted together; were united in a
consultation. The Greek implies that they were assembled for the purpose
of consultation.

Against the Lord - In the Hebrew, "against Yahweh." This is the special
name which is given in the Scriptures to God. They rose against his plan
of appointing a Messiah, and against the Messiah whom he had chosen.

Against his Christ - Hebrew, against his Messiah, or his Anointed. See
the notes on [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). This is one of
the places where the word "Messiah" is used in the Old Testament. The
word occurs in about 40 places, and is commonly translated "his
anointed," and is applied to kings. The direct reference of the word to
the Messiah in the Old Testament is not frequent. This passage implies
that opposition to the Messiah is opposition to Yahweh. And this is
uniformly supposed in the sacred Scriptures. He that is opposed to
Christ is opposed to God. He that neglects him neglects God. He that
despises him despises God, [Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md);
[Mat 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#005.md); [Joh
12:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044.md); [Luk
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md), "He that despiseth me,
despiseth him that sent me." The reasons of this are:

\(1\) That the Messiah is "the brightness of the Father's glory, and the
express image of his person," [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).

\(2\) he is equal with the Father, possessing the same attributes and
the same power, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

\(3\) he is appointed by God to this great work of saving people. To
despise him, or to oppose him, is to despise and oppose him who
appointed him to this work, to contemn his counsels, and to set him at
naught.

\(4\) his work is dear to God. It has engaged his thoughts. It has been
approved by him. His mission has been confirmed by the miraculous power
of the Father, and by every possible manifestation of his approbation
and love. To oppose the Messiah is, therefore, to oppose what is dear to
the heart of God, and which has long been the object of his tender
solicitude. It follows from this, that they who neglect the Christian
religion are exposing themselves to the displeasure of God, and
endangering their everlasting interests. No man is safe who opposes God;
and no man can have evidence that God will approve him who does not
embrace the Messiah, whom He has appointed to redeem the world.

[Acts 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 4:27</span></span>

For of a truth - Truly; in reality.

Thy holy child Jesus - The word "child" is commonly applied to infants,
or to sons and daughters in very early life. The word which is used here
παῖς pais is different from what is commonly applied to the Lord Jesus
υἱός huios. The latter expresses sonship without respect to age. The
word which is here used also sometimes expresses sonship with out any
regard to age, and the word "son" would have been a more happy
translation. Thus, the same word is translated in [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md), [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md). In [Act
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#012.md), it is translated "youngman."

Both Herod ... - [Luk 23:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001.md).

With the Gentiles - The Romans, to whom he was delivered to be
crucified.

The people of Israel - The Jews, who were excited to this by the rulers,
[Mat 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020.md).

[Acts 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 4:28</span></span>

For to do ... - See the notes on [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md); [Act
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md). The facts which are brought to
view in these verses are among the most remarkable on record. They are
briefly these:

\(1\) That the Jewish rulers were opposed to the Messiah, and slew him.

\(2\) that the very people to whom he came, and for whose benefit he
labored, joined in the opposition, so that it became the act of a united
people.

\(3\) that the Romans, who were there as a sort of representation of all
pagan nations, were easily prevailed on to join in the persecution, and
to become the executioners.

\(4\) that thus opposite factions, and dissimilar and prejudiced people,
became united in opposing the Messiah.

\(5\) that the rulers of the Roman people, the emperors, the statesmen,
the philosophers, and the rulers of other nations, united to oppose the
gospel, and brought all the power of persecution to stay its progress.

\(6\) that the people of the empire, the mass of people, were easily
prevailed upon to join in the persecution, and to endeavor to arrest its
progress. It may be added,

\(7\) That the gospel has encountered similar difficulties and
opposition wherever it has been faithfully presented to the attention of
people. It has become a very serious question why this has been; on what
pretence this opposition has been vindicated, or how it can be accounted
for - a question which it is of as much importance for the infidel as
for the Christian to settle. We know that accusations of the corrupt
lives of the early Christians were freely circulated, and that most
gross accounts of their scandalous conduct were propagated by those who
chose to persecute them. (See Lardner's "Credibility.") But such
accounts are not now believed, and it is not certain that they were ever
seriously believed by the rulers of the pagan people. It is certain that
it was not on things account that the first opposition arose to Christ
and his religion.

It is not proper here to enter into an examination of the causes of this
opposition. We may state the outlines, however, in few words:

\(1\) The Jewish rulers were mortified, humbled, and moved with envy,
that one so poor and despised should claim to be the Messiah. They had
expected a Messiah of a different rank and character; and all their
prejudices rose at once against his claims to this high office, [Mat
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#018.md); [Mar
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#010.md).

\(2\) the common people, disposed extensively to acknowledge his claims,
were urged on by the enraged and vindictive priests to demand his death,
[Mat 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020.md).

\(3\) Pilate was pressed on against his will by the impetuous and
enraged multitude to deliver one whom he regarded as innocent.

\(4\) the Christian religion, in its advances, struck at once at the
whole fabric of superstition in the Roman empire and throughout the
world. It did not, like other religions, ask a place amidst the
religions already existing. It was exclusive in its claims. It denounced
all other systems as idolatry or superstition, and sought to overthrow
them. Those religions were interwoven with all the habits of the people;
they were connected with all the departments of the state; they gave
occupation to a vast number of priests and other officer who obtained
their livelihood by the existing superstitions, and who brought, of
course, all the supposed sacredness of their character to support them.
A religion which attempted to overthrow the whole fabric, therefore, at
once excited all their malice. The monarchs whose thrones were based on
the existing state of things, and the people who venerated the religion
of their ancestors, would be opposed to the new system.

\(5\) Christianity was despised. It was regarded as one form of the
superstition of the Jews, and there were no people who were regarded
with so much contempt by other nations as the Jews. The writings of the
Romans on this point are full proof.

\(6\) the new religion was opposed to all the crimes of the world. It
began its career in a time of eminent wickedness. It plunged at once
into the midst of that wickedness; sought the great cities where crimes
and pollutions were concentrated, and boldly reproved every form of
prevailing impiety. At Athens, at Corinth, at Ephesus, at Rome itself,
it denounced the judgment of God against every form of guilt. Whatever
may be charged on the apostles, it will not be alleged that they were
timid in denouncing the sins of the world. From all these causes it is
not wonderful that the early Christians were persecuted. If it be asked.

\(7\) Why the same religion meets with opposition now in lands that are
nominally Christian, it may be remarked:

\(a\) that the human heart is the same that it always was, opposed to
truth and righteousness;

\(b\) that religion encounters still a host of sins that are opposed to
it - pride, envy, malice, passion, and the love of the world;

\(c\) that there has always been a special opposition in the human heart
to receiving salvation as the gift of God through a crucified Redeemer;
and,

\(d\) that all the forms of vice, and lust, and profaneness that exist
in the world, are opposed, and ever will be, to a religion of purity,
self-denial, and love.

On the whole, we may remark here:

\(1\) That the fact that Christianity has been thus opposed, and has
triumphed, is no small proof of its divine origin. It has been fairly
tried, and still survives. It was well to put it to the rest, and to
bring to bear on it everything which had a tendency to crush it, and
thus to furnish the highest proof that it is from God.

\(2\) this religion cannot be destroyed; it will triumph; opposition to
it is vain; it will make its way throughout the world; and the path of
safety is not to oppose what God is intending to establish in the earth.
Sinners who stand opposed to the gospel should tremble and be afraid,
for sooner or later they must fall before its triumphant advances. It is
not safe to oppose what has already been opposed by kings and rulers in
every form, and yet has triumphed. It is not wise to risk one's eternal
welfare on the question of successful opposition to what God has, in so
many ages and ways, pledged himself to protect; and when God has
solemnly declared that the Son, the Messiah, whom he would set on his
holy hill of Zion, should "break" his enemies "with a rod of iron, and
dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel," [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md).

[Acts 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 4:29</span></span>

Behold their threatenings - So look upon them as to grant us
deliverance. They did not purpose to abandon their undertaking; they
resolved to persevere; and they expected that this purpose would involve
them in danger. With this purpose they implored the protection of God;
they asked that he would not suffer them to be deterred from speaking
boldly; and they sought that constant additional proof might be granted
of the presence and power of God to confirm the truth of their message.

And grant ... - This is an instance of heroic boldness, and a
determination to persevere in doing their duty to God. When we are
assailed by those in power; when we are persecuted and in danger, we
should commit our way unto God, and seek his aid, that we may not be
deterred from the path of duty.

[Acts 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 4:30</span></span>

By stretching forth thine hand ... - The apostles not only desired
boldness to speak, but they asked that God would continue to work
miracles, and thus furnish to them, and to the people, evidence of the
truth of what they delivered. They did not even ask that he would
preserve their lives, or keep them from danger. They were intent on
their work, and they confidently committed their way to God, making it
their great object to promote the knowledge of the truth, and seeking
that God would glorify himself by establishing his kingdom among people.

Signs and wonders - Miracles. (See the notes on [Act
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md).

[Acts 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 4:31</span></span>

And when they had prayed - The event which followed was regarded by them
as an evidence that God heard their prayer.

The place was shaken - The word which is translated "was shaken"
commonly denotes "violent agitation," as the raging of the sea, the
convulsion of an earthquake, or trees shaken by the wind, [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md); [Act
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#026.md); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md). The language here is suited to
express the idea of an earthquake. Whether the motion was confined to
the house where they were is not said. They probably regarded this as an
answer to their prayer, or as an evidence that God would be with them:

\(1\) Because it was sudden and violent, and was not produced by any
natural causes;

\(2\) Because it occurred immediately, while they were seeking divine
direction;

\(3\) Because it was an exhibition of great power, and was an evidence
that God could protect them; and,

\(4\) Because a convulsion so great, sudden, and mighty was suited at
that time to awe them with a proof of the presence and power of God. A
similar instance of an answer to prayer by an earthquake is recorded in
[Act 16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md). Compare [Act
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md). It may be added, that among the
Jews an earthquake was very properly regarded as a striking and
impressive proof of the presence of Yahweh, [Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Psa
68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md), "The earth shook, the heavens
also dropped at the presence of God; even Sinai itself was moved at the
presence of God, the God of Israel." See also the sublime description in
Hab. 3, particularly [Act 4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md).
Compare [Mat 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054.md). Among the pagan,
an earthquake was regarded as proof of the presence and favor of the
Deity. (See Virgil, Aeneid, 3:89.)

They were all filled ... - See the notes on [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md). Their being filled with the Holy
Spirit here rather denotes their being inspired with confidence or
boldness than being endowed with new powers, as in [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md).

[Acts 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 4:32</span></span>

And the multitude - The number of believers at this time had become
large. In [Act 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004.md), it is said that it
was five thousand, and the number was constantly increasing.

One heart - This expression denotes "tender union." They felt alike, or
were attached to the same things, and this preserved them from jars and
dissensions.

One soul - This phrase also denotes "close and tender union." No
expression could denote it more strikingly than to say of friends they
have one soul. Plutarch cites an ancient verse in his life of Cato of
Utica with this very expression - "Two friends, one soul" (Grotius).
Thus, Diogenes Laertius also (5, [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011).md) says respecting Aristotle, that
"being asked what was a friend, answered that it was one soul dwelling
in two bodies" (Kuinoel). The Hebrews spake of two friends as being "one
man." There can be no more striking demonstration of union and love than
to say of more than five thousand suddenly drawn together that they had
one soul! And this union they evinced in every way possible - in their
conduct, in their prayers, and in their property. How different would
have been the aspect of the church if the union had continued to the
present time!

Neither said ... - That is, I they did not regard it as their own, but
to be used for the benefit of the whole society. See the notes on [Act
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md).

[Acts 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 4:33</span></span>

And with great power - See [Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md).
The word "power" here denotes "efficacy," and means that they had
"ability" given them to bear witness of the resurrection of the Saviour.
it refers, therefore, I rather to their preaching than to their
miracles.

Gave the apostles witness - The apostles bore testimony to.

The resurrection of the Lord Jesus - This was the main point to be
established. If it proved that the Lord Jesus came to life again after
having been put to death, it established all that he taught, and was a
demonstration that he was sent from God. They exerted, therefore, all
their powers to prove this, and their success was such as might have
been expected. Multitudes were converted to the Christian faith.

And great grace ... - The word "grace" means "favor." See the notes on
[Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md). The expression here may
mean either that the favor of God was remarkably shown to them, or that
they had great favor in the sight of the people. It does not refer, as
the expression now does commonly, to the internal blessings of religion
on a man's own soul, to their personal advancement in the Christian
graces, but to the favor or success that attended their preaching. The
meaning probably is, that the "favor" of the "people" toward them was
great, or that great success attended their ministry among them. Thus,
the same word grace (Greek) is used in [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md). If this is its meaning, then
here is an instance of the power of the testimony of the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus to impress the minds of people. But this is not all, nor
probably is it the main idea. It is that their union, their benevolence
their liberality in supplying the needs of the needy, was a means of
opening the hearts of the people, and of winning them to the Saviour. If
we wish to incline others to our opinions, nothing is better adapted to
it than to show them kindness, and even to minister to their temporal
needs.

Benevolence toward them softens the heart, and inclines them to listen
to us. It disarms their prejudices, and disposes them to the exercise of
the mild and amiable feelings of religion. Hence, our Saviour was
engaged in healing the diseases and supplying the needs of the people.
He drew around him the poor, the needy, and the diseased, and supplied
their necessities, and thus prepared them to receive his message of
truth. Thus, God is love, and is constantly doing good, that his
goodness may lead people to repentance, [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md). And hence, no persons have better
opportunities to spread the true sentiments of religion, or are clothed
with higher responsibilites, than those who have it in their power to do
good, or than those who are habitually engaged in bestowing favors.
Thus, physicians have access to the hearts of people which other persons
have not. Thus, parents have an easy access to the minds of children.
for they are constantly doing them good. And thus Sunday-school
teachers, whose whole work is a work of benevolence, have direct and
most efficient access to the hearts of the children committed to their
care.

[Acts 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 4:34</span></span>

That lacked - That was in want, or whose needs were not supplied by the
others.

As many as ... - The word used here is employed in a large, indefinite
sense; but it would be improper to press it so as to suppose that every
individual that became a Christian sold at once all his property. The
sense doubtless is, that this was done "when it was necessary:" they
parted with whatever property was needful to supply the needs of their
poor brethren. That it was by no means considered a matter of
"obligations," or enjoined by the apostles, is apparent from the case of
Ananias, [Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md). The fact that
"Joses" is particularly mentioned [Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md) shows that it was by no means a
universal practice thus to part with all their possessions. He was "one"
instance in which it was done. Perhaps there were many other similar
instances; but all that the passage requires us to believe is, that they
parted with whatever was "needful" to supply the needs of the poor. This
was an eminent and instructive instance of Christian liberality, and of
the power of the gospel in overcoming one of the strongest passions that
ever exist in the human bosom - the love of money. Many of the early
Christians were poor. They were collected from the lower orders of the
people. But "all" Were not so. Some of them, it seems, were people of
affluence; but the effect of religion was to bring them all, in regard
to feeling, at least, on a level. They felt that they were members of
one family, and they therefore imparted their property cheerfully to
their brethren. Besides this, they were about to go to other lands to
preach the gospel, and they cheerfully parted with their property that
they might go and proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ. See the
notes on [Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md).

[Acts 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 4:35</span></span>

And laid them down ... - That is, they committed the money received for
their property to the disposal of the apostles, to distribute it as was
necessary among the poor. This soon became a burdensome and inconvenient
office, and they therefore appointed men who had special charge of it,
[Act 6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md), etc.

[Acts 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 4:36</span></span>

And Joses - Many manuscripts, instead of "Joses," here read "Joseph."
The reasons why this individual is selected and specified particularly
were, doubtless, because he was a foreigner; because it was a remarkable
instance of liberality; and because he subsequently distinguished
himself in the work of the ministry. He gave himself, his property, his
all, to the service of the Lord Jesus, and went forth to the
self-denying labors of the gospel. He is mentioned elsewhere with honor
in the New Testament [Act 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024.md), [Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md), and usually as the companion of
the apostle Paul. The occasion on which he became connected with Paul in
the ministry was when he himself was sent forth by the church at
Jerusalem to Antioch. There, it seems, he heard of the fame of Paul and
went to Tarsus to seek him, and brought him with him to Antioch, [Act
11:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#022.md). Before this he had been
acquainted with him, and had introduced him to the other apostles at a
time when they were afraid of Paul, and unwilling to acknowledge him as
an apostle, [Act 9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md). At Antioch,
Barnabas was led into dissimulation by Peter in regard to the Gentiles,
and was reproved by his friend and companion, Paul, [Gal
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013.md). He and Paul continued to travel
in fellowship until a dispute arose at Antioch about Mark, and they
separated, Paul going with Silas through Syria and Cilicia, and
Barnabas, with Mark, sailing for his native place, Cyprus, [Act
15:35-41](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#035.md). See the following places for
particulars of his history: [Act
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#022.md), [Act
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025.md), [Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md); [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Act
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md), [Act
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050.md); [Act
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012.md); [Act
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md); [Co1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006.md); [Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md), [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).

Who by the apostles was surnamed ... - The practice of giving surnames,
as expressive of character, was not uncommon. Thus, Simon was called
Peter, or Cephas, [Joh 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044.md); and thus
James and John were surnamed Boanerges, [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md).

Barnabas, which is ... - This word properly denotes "the son of
prophecy." It is compounded of two Syriac words, the one meaning "son,"
and the other "prophecy." The Greek word which is used to interpret this
παράκλησις paraklēsis, translated "consolation," means properly
exhortation, entreaty, petition, or advocacy. It also means "consolation
or solace"; and from this meaning the interpretation has been given to
the word "Barnabas," but with evident impropriety. It does not appear
that the name was bestowed on account of this, though it is probable
that he possessed the qualification for administering comfort or
consolation in an eminent degree, but on account of his talent for
"speaking," or "exhorting" the people to holiness, and his success in
preaching. Compare [Act 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md).

A Levite - One of the descendants of Levi employed in the lower services
of the temple. The whole tribe of Levi was set apart to the service of
religion. It was divided into priests and Levites. The three sons of
Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Of the family of "Kohath" Aaron
was descended, who was the first high priest. His oldest son succeeded
him, and the remainder of his sons were "priests." All the others of the
tribe of Levi were called "Levites," and were employed in the work of
the temple, in assisting the priests in performing sacred music, etc.,
Num. 3; [Deu 12:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md); [Deu
18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md); [Ch1
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md).

Of the country of Cyprus - Cyprus is the largest island in the
Mediterranean; an island extremely fertile, abounding in wine, honey,
oil, wool, etc. It is mentioned in [Act
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004.md); [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md). The island is near to Cicilia,
and is not far from the Jewish coast. It is said by Dion Caccius (lib.
68, 69) that the Jews were very numerous in that island - Clark.
Barnabas afterward became, with Paul, a distinguished preacher to the
Gentiles. It is worthy of remark, that "both" were born in pagan
countries, though by descent Jews; and as they were trained in pagan
lands, they were better suited for their special work. The case of
Barnabas is that of a man who had property when he entered the ministry,
and who gave up all for the Lord Jesus. The great mass of ministers,
like very many who have been distinguished in other professions, have
been taken from among the poor, and from humble ranks in life. But all
have not been. Many have been wealthy, and have devoted all to Christ;
and in regard to others, it is to be remarked, that a very considerable
proportion of them could have gained more "wealth" in some other
profession than they do in the ministry. The ministry is a work of
self-denial, and none should enter it who are not prepared to devote all
to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.
