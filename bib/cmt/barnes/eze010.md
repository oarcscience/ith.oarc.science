### [Ezekiel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 10:1</span></span>

As in Ezek. 1, the vision of the glory of the Lord, the particulars
given identifying the two visions.

[Ezekiel 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 10:2</span></span>

He spake - The person enthroned.

The cherub - The particular cherub who was to hand the coals to destroy
[Psa 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004.md); [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016.md); [Rev
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008.md).

[Ezekiel 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 10:3</span></span>

On the right side - On the south [Eze
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#002.md). The idolatries had been seen on
the north side. On the south stood the "cherubim" ready to receive and
bear away the glory of the Lord.

[Ezekiel 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 10:4</span></span>

A repetition of [Eze 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md). Now the
glory of the Lord had gone up from the cherub to the threshold of the
house. [Eze 10:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md) describe what had
occurred before the "man went in" [Eze
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 10:5</span></span>

The Almighty God - El Shaddai; compare the [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md) note.

[Ezekiel 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 10:7</span></span>

One cherub - The "cherub" who stood next the wheel by the side of which
the man stood. The representative of the priestly office now gives up
his post of reconciliation, and becomes simply a minister of wrath;
another sign that God will turn from Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 10:8</span></span>

An explanation following upon the mention of the "hand." It is
characteristic of this chapter that the narrative is interrupted by
explanatory comments. The "narrative" is contained in [Eze
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md), [Eze
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#006.md), [Eze
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md), [Eze
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015) (first clause.md), 18, 19; the
other verses contain the "interposed explanations."

[Ezekiel 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 10:11</span></span>

The head - Either "the leading wheel which the others followed," or more
probably, the head of a cherub (one for all), the description passing
from the wheels to the cherubim [Eze
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012.md).

[Ezekiel 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 10:13</span></span>

According to the marginal rendering the present verse refers back to
[Eze 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md), [Eze
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#006.md), and tells us that the name
"galgal, a rolling thing" (compare [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013).md), was given to the wheels in the
seer's hearing. But taking [Eze 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014.md)
as a description, and reading [Eze
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015.md) immediately after [Eze
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md), the meaning is clear. In the
hearing Of the seer a voice calls upon the wheels, and, obedient to the
call, the cherubim are lifted up and the wheels roll on. The word
"galgal" would be better rendered "chariot" instead of "wheel;"
"chariot" representing very well the collection of "wheels."

[Ezekiel 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 10:14</span></span>

The first face ... - The face of the first was the face of the cherub,
and the face of the second was the face of a man, and the third the face
of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle. Of the four faces of each
cherub, the seer names only one - the face looking in the direction in
which that cherub leads the motion of the chariot. The face of the
cherub which presented itself to the seer was that of "an ox." When he
looking northward first saw the chariot the "ox-face" was on the left
side [Eze 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md). This would make the
ox-face look eastward, and it is not unlikely that the man might
approach the chariot from the southeastern part of the inner court.

[Ezekiel 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 10:16</span></span>

are a repetition of the general description of the nature and connection
of the various parts of the vision, and this is the more appropriate as
showing why they were regarded as "one living creature" [Eze
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015.md). The attributes here assigned to
them show that they were pervaded by one will - "the spirit of the
living creature" (others, as in the margin, "the spirit of life") "was
in them."

[Ezekiel 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 10:19</span></span>

The cherubim (or chariot) had stood first on the threshold of the
temple-door, and there received the glory of the Lord. They then lifted
their wings, rose, and left the temple by "the east gate" of the outer
court at "the entrance" of which they now for a time stood. It was by
the east gate of the outer court that the glory of the Lord returned to
the new temple [Eze 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004.md).

And every one stood - Or, "and" they "stood." The Cheruibim and wheels
are viewed as "one living creature."

[Ezekiel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 10:20</span></span>

In this departure of the glory of the Lord from the temple, the seer
recognizes for the first time the full meaning of the vision which he
had seen on the banks of Chebar Ezek. 1. What he had seen there (did
indeed imply that Yahweh had forsaken His house; but now this is made
clear. The Glory has left the holy of holies, has appeared in the court,
has been enthroned on the Living Four, and with them has departed from
the temple. It is now clear that these Four (in form similar to, yet
differing from, the cherubim of the temple) are indeed the cherubim, in
the midst of whom the Lord dwelleth.
