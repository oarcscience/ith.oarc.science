### [Philippians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

[Philippians](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">phi 2:0</span></span>

This chapter Phil. 2 is made up principally of exhortations to the
performance of various Christian duties, and the exhibition of Christian
virtues. The apostle first exhorts the Philippians, in the most tender
manner, so to live as to give him joy, by evincing among themselves
unity and concord. He entreats them to do nothing by strife and a desire
of distinction, but to evince that humility which is manifested when we
regard others as more worthy than we are; [Phi
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md). This exhortation he enforces in
a most impressive manner by a reference to the example of Christ - an
example of condescension and humiliation fitted to repress in us all the
aspirings of ambition, and to make us ready to submit to the most humble
offices to benefit others; [Phi
2:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md). He then exhorts them to work
out their salvation with diligence, assuring them, for their
encouragement, that God worked in them to will and to do of his good
pleasure; [Phi 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md).

To this he adds an exhortation that they would avoid everything like
complaining and disputing - that they would be blameless and harmless in
their walk, showing the excellency of the religion which they loved to
all around them, and exerting such an influence on others that Paul
might feel that he had not labored in vain; [Phi
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md). To excite them to this, he
assures them that he was ready himself to be sacrificed for their
welfare, and should rejoice if by his laying down his life their
happiness would be promoted. He asked the same thing in return from
them; [Phi 2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md). He then tells
them, in expressing his interest in them, that he hoped soon to be able
to send Timothy to them again - a man who felt a deep interest in their
welfare, and whose going to them would be one of the highest proofs of
the apostle's love; [Phi 2:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md). The
same love for them, he says, he had now shown by sending to them
Epaphroditus - a man to whom he was tenderly attached, and who had an
earnest desire again to return to the church from which he had been
sent. Paul sent him, therefore, again to Philippi, that he might be with
them and comfort them, and he asked for him a kind reception and
affectionate treatment, in view of the sufferings which he had
experienced in the cause of the Redeemer; [Phi
2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md).

[Philippians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 2:1</span></span>

If there be therefore any consolation in Christ - This, with what is
said in the remainder of the verse, is designed as a motive for what he
exhorts them to in [Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md) - that
they would be of the same mind, and would thus fulfill his joy. To urge
them to this, he appeals to the tender considerations which religion
furnished - and begins by a reference to the consolation which there was
in Christ. The meaning here may be this: "I am now persecuted and
afflicted. In my trials it will give me the highest joy to learn that
you act as becomes Christians. You also are persecuted and afflicted
[Phi 1:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md); and, in these
circumstances, I entreat that the highest consolation may be sought; and
by all that is tender and sacred in the Christian religion, I conjure
you, so to live as not to dishonor the gospel. So live as to bring down
the highest consolation which can be obtained - the consolation which
Christ alone can impart We are not to suppose that Paul doubted whether
there was any consolation in Christ but the form of expression here is
one that is designed to urge upon them the duty of seeking the highest
possible. The consolation in Christ is that which Christ furnishes or
imparts. Paul regarded him as the source of all comfort, and earnestly
prays that they might so live that he and they might avail themselves in
the fullest sense of that unspeakable enjoyment. The idea is, that
Christians ought at all times, and especially in affliction, so to act
as to secure the highest possible happiness which their Saviour can
impart to them. Such an object is worth their highest effort; and if God
sees it needful, in order to that, that they should endure much
affliction, still it is gain. Religious consolation is always worth all
which it costs to secure it.

If any comfort of love - If there be any comfort in the exercise of
tender affection. That there is, no one can doubt. Our happiness is
almost all centered in love. It is when we love a parent, a wife, a
child, a sister, a neighbor, that we have the highest earthly enjoyment.
It is in the love of God, of Christ, of Christians, of the souls of
people, that the redeemed find their highest happiness. Hatred is a
passion full of misery; love an emotion full of joy. By this
consideration, Paul appeals to them, and the motive here is drawn from
all the joy which mutual love and sympathy are fitted to produce in the
soul Paul would have that love exercised in the highest degree, and
would have them enjoy all the happiness which its mutual exercise could
furnish.

If any fellowship of the Spirit - The word "fellowship - κοινωνία
koinōnia - means that which is common to two or more; that of which they
partake together; [Eph 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md) note; [Phi
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md) note. The idea here is, that among
Christians there was a participation in the influences of the Holy
Spirit; that they shared in some degree the feelings, views, and joys of
the Sacred Spirit Himself; and that this was a privilege of the highest
order. By this fact, Paul now exhorts them to unity, love, and zeal - so
to live that they might partake in the highest degree of the
consolations of this Spirit.

If any bowels and mercies - If there is any affectionate bond by which
you are united to me, and any regard for my sorrows, and any desire to
fill up my joys, so live as to impart to me, your spiritual father and
friend, the consolation which I seek.

[Philippians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 2:2</span></span>

Fulfil ye my joy - Fill up my joy so that nothing shall be wanting to
complete it. This, he says, would be done by their union, zeal, and
humility; compare [Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md).

That ye be like-minded - Greek That ye think the same thing; see the
notes at [Co2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md). Perfect unity of
sentiment, opinion, and plan would be desirable if it could be attained.
It may be, so far as to prevent discord, schism, contention and strife
in the church, and so that Christians may be harmonious in promoting the
same great work - the salvation of souls.

Having the same love - Love to the same objects, and the same love one
for another. Though their opinions might differ on some points, yet they
might be united in love; see the notes at [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md).

Being of one accord - σύμψυχοι sumpsuchoi - of one soul; having your
souls joined together. The word used here does not occur elsewhere in
the New Testament. It means a union of soul; or an acting together as if
but one soul actuated them.

Of one mind - Greek "Thinking the same thing." The apostle here uses a
great variety of expressions to denote the same thing. The object which
he aimed at was union of heart, of feeling, of plan, of purpose. He
wished them to avoid all divisions and strifes; and to show the power of
religion by being united in the common cause. Probably there is no
single thing so much insisted on in the New Testament as the importance
of harmony among Christians. Now, there is almost nothing so little
known; but if it prevailed, the world would soon be converted to God;
compare the notes at [Joh 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md) - or
see the text itself without the notes.

[Philippians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 2:3</span></span>

Let nothing be done through strife - With a spirit of contention. This
command forbids us to do anything, or attempt anything as the mere
result of strife. This is not the principle from which we are to act, or
by which we are to be governed. We are to form no plan, and aim at no
object which is to be secured in this way. The command prohibits all
attempts to secure anything over others by mere physical strength, or by
superiority of intellect or numbers. or as the result of dark schemes
and plans formed by rivalry, or by the indulgence of angry passions, or
with the spirit of ambition. We are not to attempt to do anything merely
by outstripping others, or by showing that we have more talent, courage,
or zeal. What we do is to be by principle, and with a desire to maintain
the truth, and to glorify God. And yet how often is this rule violated!
How often do Christian denominations attempt to outstrip each other, and
to see which shall be the greatest! How often do ministers preach with
no better aim! How often do we attempt to outdo others in dress, and it
the splendor of furniture and equipment! How often, even in plans of
benevolence, and in the cause of virtue and religion, is the secret aim
to outdo others. This is all wrong. There is no holiness in such
efforts. Never once did the Redeemer act from such a motive, and never
once should this motive be allowed to influence us. The conduct of
others may be allowed to show us what we can do, and ought to do; but it
should not be our sole aim to outstrip them; compare [Co2
9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md).

Or vain glory - The word used here - κενοδοξία kenodoxia occurs nowhere
else in the New Testament, though the adjective - κενόδοξος kenodoxos -
occurs once in [Gal 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026.md); see the
notes at that place. It means properly empty pride, or glory, and is
descriptive of vain and hollow parade and show. Suidas renders it, "any
vain opinion about oneself" - ματαία τις περὶ ἑαυτου οἴησις mataia tis
peri eautou oiēsis. The idea seems to be that of mere self-esteem; a
mere desire to honor ourselves, to attract attention, to win praise, to
make ourselves uppermost, or foremost, or the main object. The command
here solemnly forbids our doing anything with such an aim - no matter
whether it be in intellectual attainments, in physical strength, in
skill in music, in eloquence or song, in dress, furniture, or religion.
Self is not to be foremost; selfishness is not to be the motive.
Probably there is no command of the Bible which would have a wider sweep
than this, or would touch on more points of human conduct, it fairly
applied. Who is there who passes a single day without, in some respect,
desiring to display himself? What minister of the gospel preaches, who
never has any wish to exhibit his talents, eloquence, or learning? How
few make a gesture, but with some wish to display the grace or power
with which it is done! Who, in conversation, is always free from a
desire to show his wit, or his power in argumentation, or his skill in
repartee? Who plays at the piano without the desire of commendation? Who
thunders in the senate, or goes to the field of battle; who builds a
house, or purchases an article of apparel; who writes a book, or
performs a deed of benevolence, altogether uninfluenced by this desire?
If all could be taken out of human conduct which is performed merely
from "strife," or from "vain-glory," how small a portion would be left!

But in lowliness of mind - Modesty, or humility. The word used here is
the same which is rendered "humility" in [Act
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019.md); [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md), [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md); humbleness, in [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md); and lowliness, in [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). It does not elsewhere occur in
the New Testament. It here means humility, and it stands opposed to that
pride or self-valuation which would lead us to strive for the
ascendancy, or which acts from a wish for flattery, or praise. The best
and the only true correction of these faults is humility. This virtue
consists in estimating ourselves according to truth. It is a willingness
to take the place which we ought to take in the sight of God and man;
and, having the low estimate of our own importance and character which
the truth about our insignificance as creatures and vileness as sinners
would produce, it will lead us to a willingness to perform lowly and
humble offices that we may benefit others.

Let each esteem other better than themselves - Compare [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md). This is one of the effects
produced by true humility, and it naturally exists in every truly modest
mind. We are sensible of our own defects, but we have not the same clear
view of the defects of others. We see our own hearts; we are conscious
of the great corruption there; we have painful evidence of the impurity
of the motives which often actuate us - of the evil thoughts and corrupt
desires in our own souls; but we have not the same view of the errors,
defects, and follies of others. We can see only their outward conduct;
but, in our own case, we can look within. It is natural for those who
have any just sense of the depravity of their own souls, charitably to
hope that it is not so with others, and to believe that they have purer
hearts. This will lead us to feel that they are worthy of more respect
than we are. Hence, this is always the characteristic of modesty and
humility - graces which the gospel is eminently suited to produce. A
truly pious man will be always, therefore, an humble man, and will wish
that others should be preferred in office and honor to himself. Of
course, this will not make him blind to the defects of others when they
are manifested; but he will be himself retiring, modest, unambitious,
unobtrusive. This rule of Christianity would strike a blow at all the
ambition of the world. It would rebuke the love of office and would
produce universal contentment in any low condition of life where the
providence of God may have cast our lot; compare the notes at [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md).

[Philippians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 2:4</span></span>

Look not every man on his own things - That is, be not selfish. Do not
let your care and attention be wholly absorbed by your own concerns, or
by the concerns of your own family. Evince a tender interest for the
happiness of the whole, and let the welfare of others lie near your
hearts. This, of course, does not mean that there is to be any improper
interference in the business of others, or that we are to have the
character of "busy-bodies in other people's matters" (compare the [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md), note; [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md), note; [Pe1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015), note.md); but that we are to regard
with appropriate solicitude the welfare of others, and to strive to do
them good.

But every man also on the things of others - It is the duty of every man
to do this. No one is at liberty to live for himself or to disregard the
wants of others. The object of this rule is to break up the narrow
spirit of selfishness, and to produce a benevolent regard for the
happiness of others. In respect to the rule we may observe:

\(1\) We are not to be "busybodies" in the concerns of others; see the
references above. We are not to attempt to pry into their secret
purposes. Every man has his own plans, and thoughts, and intentions,
which no other one has a right to look into. Nothing is more odious than
a meddler in the concerns of others.

\(2\) we are not to obtrude our advice where it is not sought, or at
unseasonable times and places, even if the advice is in itself good. No
one likes to be interrupted to hear advice; and I have no right to
require that he should suspend his business in order that I may give him
counsel.

\(3\) we are not to find fault with what pertains exclusively to him. We
are to remember that there are some things which are his business, not
ours; and we are to learn to "possess our souls in patience," if he does
not give just as much as we think be ought to benevolent objects, or if
he dresses in a manner not to please our taste, or if he indulges in
things which do not accord exactly with our views. He may see reasons
for his conduct which we do not; and it is possible that be may be
right, and that, if we understood the whole case, we should think and
act as he does. We often complain of a man because be does not give as
much as we think he ought, to objects of charity; and it is possible
that he may be miserably niggardly and narrow. But it is also possible
that he may be more embarrassed than we know of; or that he may just
then have demands against him of which we are ignorant; or that he may
have numerous poor relatives dependent on him; or that he gives much
with "the left hand" which is not known by "the right hand." At any
rate, it is his business, not ours; and we are not qualified to judge
until we understand the whole case.

\(4\) we are not to be gossips about the concerns of others. We are not
to hunt up small stories, and petty scandals respecting their families;
we are not to pry into domestic affairs, and divulge them abroad, and
find pleasure in circulating snell things from house to house. There are
domestic secrets, which are not to be betrayed; and there is scarcely an
offence of a meaner or more injurious character than to divulge to the
public what we have seen a family whose hospitality we have enjoyed.

\(5\) where Christian duty and kindness require us to look into the
concerns of others, there should be the utmost delicacy. Even children
have their own secrets, and their own plans and amusements, on a small
scale, quite as important to them as the greater games which we are
playing in life; and they will feel the meddlesomeness of a busybody to
be as odious to them as we should in our plans. A delicate parent,
therefore, who has undoubtedly a right to know all about his children,
will not rudely intrude into their privacies, or meddle with their
concerns. So, when we visit the sick, while we show a tender sympathy
for them, we should not be too particular in inquiring into their
maladies or their feelings. So, when those with whom we sympathize have
brought their calamities on themselves by their own fault, we should not
ask too many questions about it. We should not too closely examine one
who is made poor by intemperance, or who is in prison for crime. And so,
when we go to sympathize with those who have been, by a reverse of
circumstances, reduced from affluence to penury, we should not ask too
many questions. We should let them tell their own story. If they
voluntarily make us their confidants, and tell us all about their
circumstances, it is well; but let us not drag out the circumstances, or
wound their feelings by our impertinent inquiries, or our indiscreet
sympathy in their affairs. There are always secrets which the sons and
daughters of misfortune would wish to keep to themselves.

However, while these things are true, it is also true that the rule
before us positively requires us to show an interest in the concerns of
others; and it may be regarded as implying the following things:

\(1\) We are to feel that the spiritual interests of everyone in the
church is, in a certain sense, our own interest. The church is one. It
is confederated together for a common object. Each one is entrusted with
a portion of the honor of the whole, and the conduct of one member
affects the character of all. We are, therefore, to promote, in every
way possible, the welfare of every other member of the church. If they
go astray, we are to admonish and entreat them; if they are in error, we
are to instruct them; if they are in trouble, we are to aid them. Every
member of the church has a claim on the sympathy of his brethren, and
should be certain of always finding it when his circumstances are such
as to demand it.

\(2\) there are circumstances where it is proper to look with special
interest on the temporal concerns of others. It is when the poor, the
fatherless, and the afflicted must be sought out in order to be aided
and relieved. They are too retiring and modest to press their situation
on the attention of others, and they need that others should manifest a
generous care in their welfare in order to relieve them. This is not
improper interference in their concerns, nor will it be so regarded.

\(3\) for a similar reason, we should seek the welfare of all others in
a spiritual sense. We should seek to arouse the sinner, and lead him to
the Saviour. He is blind, and will not come himself; unconcerned, and
will not seek salvation; filled with the love of this world, and will
not seek a better; devoted to pursuits that will lead him to ruin, and
he ought to be apprised of it. It is no more an improper interference in
his concerns to apprise him of his condition, and to attempt to lead him
to the Saviour, than it is to warn a man in a dark night, who walks on
the verge of a precipice, of his peril; or to arouse one from sleep
whose house is in flames. In like manner, it is no more meddling with
the concerns of another to tell him that there is a glorious heaven
which may be his, than it is to apprise a man that there is a mine of
golden ore on his farm. It is for the man's own interest, and it is the
office of a friend to remind him of these things. He does a man a favor
who tells him that he has a Redeemer, and that there is a heaven to
which he may rise; he does his neighbor the greatest possible kindness
who apprises him that there is a world of infinite woe, and tells him of
an easy way by which he may escape it. The world around is dependant on
the church of Christ to be apprised of these truths. The frivolous ones
will not warn the fools of their danger; the crowd that presses to the
theater or the ballroom will not apprise those who are there that they
are in the broad way to hell; and everyone who loves his neighbor,
should feel sufficient interest in him to tell him that he may be
eternally happy in heaven.

[Philippians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 2:5</span></span>

Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus - The object of
this reference to the example of the Saviour is particularly to enforce
the duty of humility. This was the highest example which could be
furnished, and it would illustrate and confirm all the apostle had said
of this virtue. The principle in the case is, that we are to make the
Lord Jesus our model, and are in all respects to frame our lives, as far
as possible, in accordance with this great example. The point here is,
that he left a state of inexpressible glory, and took upon him the most
humble form of humanity, and performed the most lowly offices, that he
might benefit us.

[Philippians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 2:6</span></span>

Who, being in the form of God - There is scarcely any passage in the New
Testament which has given rise to more discussion than this. The
importance of the passage on the question of the divinity of the Saviour
will be perceived at once, and no small part of the point of the appeal
by the apostle depends, as will be seen, in the fact that Paul regarded
the Redeemer as equal with God. If he was truly divine, then his
consenting to become a man was the most remarkable of all possible acts
of humiliation. The word rendered "form" - μορφή morphē - occurs only in
three places in the New Testament, and in each place is rendered "form."
[Mar 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012.md); [Phi
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). In Mark it is applied to the
form which Jesus assumed after his resurrection, and in which he
appeared to two of his disciples on his way to Emmaus. "After that he
appeared in another form unto two of them." This "form" was so unlike
his usual appearance, that they did not know him. The word properly
means, form, shape, bodily shape, especially a beautiful form, a
beautiful bodily appearance - Passow. In [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), it is applied to the appearance
of a servant - and took upon him the form of a servant;" that is, he was
in the condition of a servant - or of the lowest condition. The word
"form" is often applied to the gods by the classic writers, denoting
their aspect or appearance when they became visible to people; see Cic.
de Nat. Deor. ii. 2; Ovid, Meta. i. 37; Silius, xiii. 643; Xeno. Memora.
iv; Aeneid, iv. 556, and other places cited by Wetstein, in loc.
Hesychius explains it by ἰδέα εῖδος idea eidos. The word occurs often in
the Septuagint:

\(1\) as the translation of the word ציי - Ziv - "splendour," [Dan
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#033.md); [Dan
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006.md), [Dan
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#009.md); [Dan
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028.md);

\(2\) as the translation of the word תּבנית tabniyth, structure, model,
pattern - as in building, [Isa 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013.md);

\(3\) as the translation of תּמונה temuwnah, appearance, form, shape,
image, likeness, [Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md); see also
Wisdom [Job 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#001.md).

The word can have here only one or two meanings, either:

\(1\) splendor, majesty, glory - referring to the honor which the
Redeemer had, his power to work miracles, etc. - or.

\(2\) nature, or essence - meaning the same as φύσις phusis, "nature,"
or ουσία ousia, "being."

The first is the opinion adopted by Crellius, Grotius, and others, and
substantially by Calvin. Calvin says, "The form of God here denotes
majesty. For as a man is known from the appearance of his form, so the
majesty which shines in God, is his figure. Or to use a more appropriate
similitude, the form of a king consists of the external marks which
indicate a king - as his scepter, diadem, coat of mail, attendants,
throne, and other insignia of royalty; the form of a counsul is the
toga, ivory chair, attending lictors, etc. Therefore Christ before the
foundation of the world was in the form of God, because he had glory
with the Father before the world was; [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md). For in the wisdom of God, before
he put on our nature, there was nothing humble or abject, but there was
magnificence worthy of God." Commentary in loc. The second opinion is,
that the word is equivalent to nature, or being; that is, that he was in
the nature of God, or his mode of existence was that of God, or was
divine. This is the opinion adopted by Schleusner (Lexicon); Prof.
Stuart (Letters to Dr. Channing, p. 40); Doddridge, and by orthodox
expositors in general, and seems to me to be the correct interpretation.
In support of this interpretation, and in opposition to that which
refers it to his power of working miracles, or his divine appearance
when on earth, we may adduce the following considerations:

\(1\) The "form" here referred to must have been something before he
became a man, or before he took upon him the form of a servant. It was
something from which he humbled himself by making "himself of no
reputation;" by taking upon himself "the form of a servant;" and by
being made "in the likeness of men." Of course, it must have been
something which existed when he had not the likeness of people; that is,
before he became incarnate. He must therefore have had an existence
before he appeared on earth as a man, and in that previous state of
existence there must have been something which rendered it proper to say
that he was "in the form of God."

\(2\) that it does not refer to any moral qualities, or to his power of
working miracles on earth, is apparent from the fact that these were not
laid aside. When did he divest himself of these in order that he might
humble himself? There was something which he possessed which made it
proper to say of him that he was "in the form of God," which he laid
aside when he appeared in the form of a servant and in the likeness of
human beings. But assuredly that could not have been his moral
qualities, nor is there any conceivable sense in which it can be said
that he divested himself of the power of working miracles in order that
he might take upon himself the "form of a servant." All the miracles
which he ever did were performed when he sustained the form of a
servant, in his lowly and humble condition. These considerations make it
certain that the apostle refers to a period before the incarnation. It
may be added:

\(3\) that the phrase "form of God" is one that naturally conveys the
idea that he was God. When it is said that he was "in the form of a
servant," the idea is, that he was actually in a humble and depressed
condition, and not merely that he appeared to be. Still it may be asked,
what was the "form" which he had before his incarnation? What is meant
by his having been then "in the form of God?" To these questions perhaps
no satisfactory answer can be given. He himself speaks [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md) of "the glory which he had with
the Father before the world was;" and the language naturally conveys the
idea that there was then a manifestation of the divine nature through
him, which in some measure ceased when he became incarnate; that there
was some visible splendor and majesty which was then laid aside. What
manifestation of his glory God may make in the heavenly world, of
course, we cannot now fully understand. Nothing forbids us, however, to
suppose that there is some such visible manifestation; some splendor and
magnificence of God in the view of the angelic beings such as becomes
the Great Sovereign of the universe - for he "dwells in light which no
map can approach unto;" [Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md).
That glory, visible manifestation, or splendor, indicating the nature of
God, it is here said that the Lord Jesus possessed before his
incarnation.

Thought it not robbery to be equal with God - This passage, also, has
given occasion to much discussion. Prof. Stuart renders it: "did not
regard his equality with God as an object of solicitous desire;" that
is, that though he was of a divine nature or condition, be did not
eagerly seek to retain his equality with God, but took on him an humble
condition - even that of a servant. Letters to Channing, pp. 88-92. That
this is the correct rendering of the passage is apparent from the
following considerations:

\(1\) It accords with the scope and design of the apostle's reasoning.
His object is not to show, as our common translation would seem to
imply, that he aspired to be equal with God, or that he did not regard
it as an improper invasion of the prerogatives of God to be equal with
him, but that he did not regard it, in the circumstances of the case, as
an object to greatly desired or eagerly sought to retain his equality
with God. Instead of retaining this by an earnest effort, or by a grasp
which he was unwilling to relinquish, he chose to forego the dignity,
and to assume the humble condition of a man.

\(2\) it accords better with the Greek than the common version. The word
rendered "robbery" - ἁρπαγμος harpagmos - is found nowhere else in the
New Testament, though the verb from which it is derived frequently
occurs; [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md); [Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md); [Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md); [Joh
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012.md), [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Act
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029.md); [Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md); [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md), [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md); [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md). The notion of violence, or
seizing, or carrying away, enters into the meaning of the word in all
these places. The word used here does not properly mean an act of
robbery, but the thing robbed - the plunder - das Rauben (Passow), and
hence something to be eagerly seized and appropriated. Schleusner;
compare Storr, Opuscul. Acade. i. 322, 323. According to this, the
meaning of the word here is, something to be seized and eagerly sought,
and the sense is, that his being equal with God was not a thing to be
anxiously retained. The phrase "thought it not," means "did not
consider;" it was not judged to be a matter of such importance that it
could not be dispensed with. The sense is, "he did not eagerly seize and
tenaciously hold" as one does who seizes prey or spoil. So Rosenmuller,
Schleusner, Bloomfield, Stuart, and others understand it.

To be equal with God - τὸ εἶναι ἶσα Θεῷ to einai isa Theō. That is, the
being equal with God he did not consider a thing to be tenaciously
retained. The plural neuter form of the word "equal" in Greek - ἶσα isa
- is used in accordance with a known rule of the language, thus stated
by Buttman: "When an adjective as predicate is separated from its
substantive, it often stands in the neuter where the substantive is a
masculine or feminine, and in the singular where the substantive is in
the plural. That which the predicate expresses is, in this case,
considered in general as a thing." Greek Grammar, section 129, 6. The
phrase "equal with God," or "equal with the gods," is of frequent
occurrence in the Greek Classics; see Wetstein in loc. The very phrase
here used occurs in the Odyssey:

Τον νῦν ἴσα Θεῷ Ἰθακήσιοι εἰσορόωσι Ton nun isa Theō Ithakēsioi
eisoroōsi

Compare [Joh 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md). "Made himself equal
with God." The phrase means one who sustains the same rank, dignity,
nature. Now it could not be said of an angel that he was in any sense
equal with God; much less could this be said of a mere man. The natural
and obvious meaning of the language is, that there was an equality of
nature and of rank with God, from which he humbled himself when he
became a man. The meaning of the whole verse, according to the
interpretation suggested above, is, that Christ, before he became a man,
was invested with honor, majesty, and glory, such as was appropriate to
God himself; that there was some manifestation or splendor in his
existence and mode of being then, which showed that he was equal with
God; that he did not consider that that honor, indicating equality with
God, was to be retained at all events, and so as to do violence, as it
were, to other interests, and to rob the universe of the glory of
redemption; and that he was willing, therefore, to forget that, or lay
it by for a time, in order that he might redeem the world. There were a
glory and majesty which were appropriate to God, and which indicated
equality with God - such as none but God could assume. For how could an
angel have such glory, or such external splendor in heaven, as to make
it proper to say that he was "equal with God?" With what glory could he
be invested which would be such as became God only? The "fair"
interpretation of this passage, therefore, is, that Christ before his
incarnation was equal with God.

[Philippians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 2:7</span></span>

But made himself of no reputation - This translation by no means conveys
the sense of the original According to this it would seem that he
consented to be without distinction or honor among people; or that he
was willing to be despised or disregarded. The Greek is ἑαυτον ἐκένωσεν
heauton ekenōsen. The word κενόω kenoō means literally, to empty, "to
make empty, to make vain or void." It is rendered: "made void" in [Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md); "made of none effect," [Co1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md); "make void," [Co1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md); "should be vain," [Co2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003.md). The word does not occur elsewhere
in the New Testament, except in the passage before us. The essential
idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and,
hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and
dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes
a more humble rank and station. In regard to its meaning here, we may
remark:

\(1\) that it cannot mean that he literally divested himself of his
divine nature and perfections, for that was impossible. He could not
cease to be omnipotent, and omnipresent, and most holy, and true, and
good.

\(2\) it is conceivable that he might have laid aside, for a time, the
symbols or the manifestation of his glory, or that the outward
expressions of his majesty in heaven might have been withdrawn. It is
conceivable for a divine being to intermit the exercise of his almighty
power, since it cannot be supposed that God is always exerting his power
to the utmost. And in like manner there might be for a time a laying
aside or intermitting of these manifestations or symbols, which were
expressive of the divine glory and perfections. Yet,

\(3\) this supposes no change in the divine nature, or in the essential
glory of the divine perfections. When the sun is obscured by a cloud, or
in an eclipse, there is no real change of its glory, nor are his beams
extinguished, nor is the sun himself in any measure changed. His luster
is only for a time obscured. So it might have been in regard to the
manifestation of the glory of the Son of God. Of course there is much in
regard to this which is obscure, but the language of the apostle
undoubtedly implies more than that he took an humble place, or that he
demeaned himself in an humble manner. In regard to the actual change
respecting his manifestations in heaven, or the withdrawing of the
symbols of his glory there, the Scriptures are nearly silent, and
conjecture is useless - perhaps improper. The language before us fairly
implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine
- that glory which is involved in the phrase "being in the form of God"
- and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition
of a servant.

And took upon him the form of a servant - The phrase "form of a
servant," should be allowed to explain the phrase "form of God," in [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). The "form of a servant" is that
which indicates the condition of a servant, in contradistinction from
one of higher rank. It means to appear as a servant, to perform the
offices of a servant, and to be regarded as such. He was made like a
servant in the lowly condition which he assumed. The whole connection
and force of the argument here demands this interpretation. Storr and
Rosenmuller interpret this as meaning that he became the servant or
minister of God, and that in doing it, it was necessary that he should
become a man. But the objection to this is obvious. It greatly weakens
the force of the apostle's argument. His object is to state the depth of
humiliation to which he descended, and this was best done by saying that
he descended to the lowest condition of humanity and appeared in the
most humble garb. The idea of being a "servant or minister of God" would
not express that, for this is a term which might be applied to the
highest angel in heaven. Though the Lord Jesus was not literally a
servant or slave, yet what is here affirmed was true of him in the
following respects:

\(1\) He occupied a most lowly condition in life.

\(2\) he condescended to perform such acts as are appropriate only to
those who are servants. "I am among you as he that serveth;" [Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027.md); compare [Joh
13:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md).

And was made in the likeness of men - Margin, habit. The Greek word
means likeness, resemblance. The meaning is, he was made like unto
people by assuming such a body as theirs; see the notes at [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md).

[Philippians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 2:8</span></span>

And being found - That is, being such, or existing as a man, he humbled
himself.

In fashion as a man - The word rendered "fashion" - σχῆμα schēma - means
figure, mien, deportment. Here it is the same as state, or condition.
The sense is, that when he was reduced to this condition he humbled
himself, and obeyed even unto death. He took upon himself all the
attributes of a man. He assumed all the innocent infirmities of our
nature. He appeared as other people do, was subjected to the necessity
of food and clothing, like others, and was made liable to suffering, as
other men are. It was still he who had been in the "form of God" who
thus appeared; and, though his divine glory had been for a time laid
aside, yet it was not extinguished or lost. It is important to remember,
in all our meditations on the Saviour, that it was the same Being who
had been invested with so much glory in heaven, that appeared on earth
in the form of a man.

He humbled himself - Even then, when he appeared as a man. He had not
only laid aside the symbols of his glory [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), and become a man; but when he was
a man, he humbled himself. Humiliation was a constant characteristic of
him as a man. He did not aspire to high honors; he did not affect pomp
and parade; he did not demand the service of a train of menials; but he
condescended to the lowest conditions of life; [Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027.md). The words here are very
carefully chosen. In the former case [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), when he became a man, he "emptied
himself," or laid aside the symbols of his glory; now, when a man, he
humbled himself. That is, though he was God appearing in the form of man
- a divine person on earth - yet he did not assume and assert the
dignity and prerogatives appropriate to a divine being, but put himself
in a condition of obedience. For such a being to obey law, implied
voluntary humiliation; and the greatness of his humiliation was shown by
his becoming entirely obedient, even until he died on the cross.

And became obedient - He subjected himself to the law of God, and wholly
obeyed it; [Heb 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md). It was a characteristic of the
Redeemer that he yielded perfect obedience to the will of God. Should it
be said that, if he was God himself, he must have been himself the
lawgiver, we may reply that this rendered his obedience all the more
wonderful and all the more meritorious. If a monarch should for an
important purpose place himself in a position to obey his own laws,
nothing could show in a more striking manner their importance in his
view. The highest honor that has been shown to the Law of God on earth
was, that it was perfectly observed by him who made the Law - the great
Mediator.

Unto death - He obeyed even when obedience terminated in death. The
point of this expression is this: One may readily and cheerfully obey
another where there is no particular peril. But the case is different
where obedience is attended with danger. The child shows a spirit of
true obedience when he yields to the commands of a father, though it
should expose him to hazard; the servant who obeys his master, when
obedience is attended with risk of life; the soldier, when he is morally
certain that to obey will be followed by death. Thus, many a company or
platoon has been ordered into the "deadly breach," or directed to storm
a redoubt, or to scale a wall, or to face a cannon, when it was morally
certain that death would be the consequence. No profounder spirit of
obedience can be evinced than this. It should be said, however, that the
obedience of the soldier is in many cases scarcely voluntary, since, if
he did not obey, death would be the penalty. But, in the case of the
Redeemer, it was wholly voluntary. He placed himself in the condition of
a servant to do the will of God, and then never shrank from what that
condition involved.

Even the death of the cross - It was not such a death as a servant might
incur by crossing a stream, or by failing among robbers, or by being
worn out by toil; it was not such as the soldier meets when he is
suddenly cut down, covered with glory as he falls; it was the long
lingering, painful, humiliating death of the cross. Many a one might be
willing to obey if the death that was suffered was regarded as glorious;
but when it is ignominious, and of the most degrading character, and the
most torturing that human ingenuity can invent, then the whole character
of the obedience is changed. Yet this was the obedience the Lord Jesus
evinced; and it was in this way that his remarkable readiness to suffer
was shown.

[Philippians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 2:9</span></span>

Wherefore - As a reward of this humiliation and these sufferings. The
idea is, that there was an appropriate reward for it, and that that was
bestowed upon him by his exaltation as Mediator to the right hand of
God; compare the notes at [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md).

God also hath highly exalted him - As Mediator. Though he was thus
humbled, and appeared in the form of a servant, he is now raised up to
the throne of glory, and to universal dominion. This exaltation is
spoken of the Redeemer as he was, sustaining a divine and a human
nature. If there was, as has been supposed, some obscuration or
withdrawing of the symbols of his glory [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), when he became a man, then this
refers to the restoration of that glory, and would seem to imply, also,
that there was additional honor conferred on him. There was all the
augmented glory resulting from the work which he had performed in
redeeming man.

And given him a name which is above every name - No other name can be
compared with his. It stands alone. He only is Redeemer, Saviour. He
only is Christ, the Anointed of God; see the notes at [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md). He only is the Son of God. His
rank, his titles, his dignity, are above all others; see this
illustrated in the notes at [Eph
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md).

[Philippians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 2:10</span></span>

That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow - The knee should bow,
or bend, in token of honor, or worship; that is, all people should adore
him. This cannot mean merely that at the mention of the name of Jesses
we should bow; nor is there any evidence that God requires this. Why
should we bow at the mention of that name, rather than at any of the
other titles of the Redeemer? Is there any special sacredness or honor
in it above the other names which he bears? And why should we how at his
name rather than at the name of the Father! Besides, if any special
homage is to be paid to the name of the Saviour under the authority of
this passage - and this is the only one on which the authority of this
custom is based - it should be by bowing the knee, not the head. But the
truth is, this authorizes and requires neither; and the custom of bowing
at the name of Jesus, in some churches, has arisen entirely from a
misinterpretation of this passage. There is no other place in the Bible
to which an appeal is made to authorize the custom; compare Neal's
History of the Puritans, chapter 5. Ninth 5. The meaning here is, not
that a special act of respect or adoration should be shown wherever the
name "Jesus" occurs in reading the Scriptures, or whenever it is
mentioned, but that he was so exalted that it would be proper that all
in heaven and on earth should worship him, and that the time would come
when he would be thus everywhere acknowledged as Lord. The bowing of the
knee properly expresses homage, respect, adoration (compare the notes at
[Rom 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004).md); and it cannot be done to
the Saviour by those who are in heaven, unless it be divine.

Of things in heaven - ἐπουρανίων epouraniōn - rather of beings in
heaven, the word "things" being improperly supplied by our translators.
The word may be in the neuter plural; but it may be also in the
masculine plural, and denote beings rather than things. Things do not
bow the knee; and the reference here is undoubtedly to angels, and to
the "spirits of the just made perfect" in heaven. If Jesus is worshipped
there, he is divine; for there is no idolatry eta creature in heaven. In
this whole passage there is probably an allusion to [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); see it illustrated in the notes
at [Rom 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md). In the great divisions
here specified - of those in heaven, on the earth, and under the earth -
the apostle intends, doubtless, to denote the universe. The same mode of
designating the universe occurs in [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md); [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004.md); compare [Psa
96:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011.md). This mode of expression is
equivalent to saying, "all that is above, around, and beneath us," and
arises from what appears to us. The division is natural and obvious -
that which is above us in the heavens, that which is on the earth where
we dwell, and all that is beneath us.

And things in earth - Rather, "beings on earth," to wit, people; for
they only are capable of rendering homage.

And things under the earth - Beings under the earth. The whole universe
shall confess that he is Lord. This embraces, doubtless, those who have
departed from this life, and perhaps includes also fallen angels. The
meaning is, that riley shall all acknowledge him as universal Lord; all
how to his sovereign will; all be subject to his control; all recognize
him as divine. The fallen and the lost will do this; for they will be
constrained to yield an unwilling homage to him by submitting to the
sentence from his lips that shall consign them to woe; and thus the
whole universe shall acknowledge the exalted dignity of the Son of God.
But this does not mean that they will all be saved, for the guilty and
the lost may be compelled to acknowledge his power, and submit to his
decree as the sovereign of the universe. There is the free and cheerful
homage of the heart which they who worship him in heaven will render;
and there is the constrained homage which they must yield who are
compelled to acknowledge his authority.

[Philippians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 2:11</span></span>

And that every tongue should confess - Everyone should acknowledge him.
On the duty and importance of confessing Christ, see the notes at [Rom
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md).

That Jesus Christ is Lord - The word "Lord," here, is used in its
primitive and proper sense, as denoting owner, ruler, sovereign; compare
the notes at [Rom 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md). The meaning
is, that all should acknowledge him as the universal sovereign.

To the glory of God the Father - Such a universal confession would honor
God; see the notes at [Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md), where
this sentiment is explained.

[Philippians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 2:12</span></span>

Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed - The Philippians had
from the beginning manifested a remarkable readiness to show respect to
the apostle, and to listen to his teaching. This readiness he more than
once refers to and commends. He still appeals to them, and urges them to
follow his counsels, that they might secure their salvation.

Now much more in my absence - Though they had been obedient when he was
with them, yet circumstances had occurred in his absence which made
their obedience more remarkable, and more worthy of special
commendation.

Work out your own salvation - This important command was first addressed
to Christians, but there is no reason why the same command should not be
regarded as addressed to all - for it is equally applicable to all. The
duty of doing this is enjoined here; the reason for making the effort,
or the encouragement for the effort, is stated in the next verse. In
regard to the command here, it is natural to inquire why it is a duty;
and what is necessary to be done in order to comply with it? On the
first of these inquiries, it may be observed that it is a duty to make a
personal effort to secure salvation, or to work out our salvation:

\(1\) Because God commands it. There is no command more frequently
repeated in the Scriptures, than the command to make to ourselves a new
heart; to strive to enter in at the strait gate; to break off from sin,
and to repent.

\(2\) it is a duty because it is our own personal interest that is at
stake. No one else has, or can have, as much interest in our salvation
as we have. It is every person's duty to be as happy as possible here,
and to be prepared for eternal happiness in the future world. No person
has a right either to throw away his life or his soul. He has no more
right to do the one than the other; and if it is a person's duty to
endeavor to save his life when in danger of drowning, it is no less his
duty to endeavor to save his soul when in danger of hell.

\(3\) our earthly friends cannot save us. No effort of theirs can
deliver us from eternal death without our own exertion. Great as may be
their solicitude for us, and much as they may do, there is a point where
their efforts must stop - and that point is always short of our
salvation, unless we are roused to seek salvation. They may pray, and
weep, and plead, but they cannot save us. There is a work to be done on
our own hearts which they cannot do.

\(4\) it is a duty, because the salvation of the soul will not take care
of itself without an effort on our part. There is no more reason to
suppose this than that health and life will take care of themselves
without our own exertion. And yet many live as if they supposed that
somehow all would yet be well; that the matter of salvation need not
give them any concern, for that things will so arrange themselves that
they will be saved. Why should they suppose this anymore in regard to
religion than in regard to anything else?

\(5\) it is a duty, because there is no reason to expect the divine
interposition without our own effort. No such interposition is promised
to any man, and why should he expect it? In the case of all who have
been saved, they have made an effort - and why should we expect that God
will favor us more than he did them? "God helps them who help
themselves;" and what reason has any man to suppose that he will
interfere in his case and save him, if he will put forth no effort to
"work out his own salvation?" In regard to the other inquiry - What does
the command imply; or what is necessary to be done in order to comply
with it? We may observe, that it does not mean:

\(a\) that we are to attempt to deserve salvation on the ground of
merit. That is out of the question; for what can man do that shall be an
equivalent for eternal happiness in heaven? Nor,

\(b\) does it mean that we are to endeavor to make atonement for past
sins. That would be equally impossible, and it is, besides, unnecessary.
That work has been done by the great Redeemer. But it means:

\(i\) that we are to make an honest effort to be saved in the way which
God has appointed;

\(ii\) that we are to break off from our sins by true repentance;

\(iii\) that we are to believe in the Saviour, and honestly to put our
trust in him;

\(iv\) that we are to give up all that we have to God;

\(v\) that we are to break away from all evil companions and evil plans
of life; and,

\(vi\) that we are to resist all the allurements of the world, and all
the temptations which may assail us that would lead us back from God,
and are to persevere unto the end. The great difficulty in working out
salvation is in forming a purpose to begin at once. When that purpose is
formed, salvation is easy.

With fear and trembling - That is, with that kind of anxiety which one
has who feels that he has an important interest at stake, and that he is
in danger of losing it. The reason or the ground for "fear" in this case
is in general this: there is danger of losing the soul.

\(1\) so many persons make shipwreck of all hope and perish, that there
is danger that we may also.

\(2\) there are so many temptations and allurements in the world, and so
many things that lead us to defer attention to religion, that there is
danger that we may be lost.

\(3\) there is danger that if the present opportunity passes, another
may not occur. Death may soon overtake us. No one has a moment to lose.
No one can designate one single moment of his life, and say, "I may
safely lose that moment. I may safely spend it in the neglect of my
soul."

\(4\) it should be done with the most earnest concern, front the
immensity of the interest at stake. If the soul is lost, all is lost.
And who is there that can estimate the value of that soul which is thus
in danger of being lost forever?

[Philippians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 2:13</span></span>

For it is God that worketh in you - This is given as a reason for making
an effort to be saved, or for working out our salvation. It is often
thought to be the very reverse, and people often feel that if God works
"in us to will and to do," there can be no need of our making an effort,
and that there would be no use in it. If God does all the work, say
they, why should we not patiently sit still, and wait until He puts
forth His power and accomplishes in us what He wills? It is of
importance, therefore, to understand what this declaration of the
apostle means, in order to see whether this objection is valid, or
whether the fact that God "works in us" is to be regarded as a reason
why we should make no effort. The word rendered "worketh" - ἐνεργῶν
energōn - working - is from a verb meaning to work, to be active to
produce effect - and is that from which we have derived the word
"energetic." The meaning is, that God "produces a certain effect in us;"
he exerts such an influence over us as to lead to a certain result in
our minds - to wit, "to will and to do." Nothing is said of the mode in
which this is done, and probably this cannot be understood by us here;
compare [Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md). In regard to the
divine agency here referred to, however, certain things, though of a
negative character, are clear:

\(1\) It is not God who acts for us. He leads us to "will and to do." It
is not said that he wills and does for us, and it cannot be. It is man
that "wills and does" - though God so influences him that he does it.

\(2\) he does not compel or force us against our will. He leads us to
will as well as to do. The will cannot be forced; and the meaning here
must be that God exerts such an influence as to make us willing to obey
Him; compare [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md).

\(3\) it is not a physical force, but it must be a moral influence. A
physical power cannot act on the will. You may chain a man, incarcerate
him in the deepest dungeon, starve him, scourge him, apply red-hot
pincers to his flesh, or place on him the thumb-screw, but the will is
still free. You cannot bend that or control it, or make him believe
otherwise than as he chooses to believe. The declaration here,
therefore, cannot mean that God compels us, or that we are anything else
but free agents still, though He "works in us to will and to do." It
must mean merely that he exerts such an influence as to secure this
result.

To will and to do of his good pleasure - Not to will and to do
everything, but "His good pleasure." The extent of the divine agency
here referred to, is limited to that, and no man should adduce this
passage to prove that God "works" in him to lead him to commit sin. This
passage teaches no such doctrine. It refers here to Christians, and
means that he works in their hearts that which is agreeable to him, or
leads them to "will and to do" that which is in accordance with his own
will. The word rendered "good pleasure" - εὐδοκία eudokia - means
"delight, good-will, favor;" then "good pleasure, purpose, will;" see
[Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md); [Th2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md). Here it means that which would
be agreeable to him; and the idea is, that he exerts such an influence
as to lead people to will and to do that which is in accordance with his
will. Paul regarded this fact as a reason why we should work out our
salvation with fear and trembling. It is with that view that he urges
it, and not with any idea that it will embarrass our efforts, or be a
hindrance to us in seeking salvation. The question then is, how this
fact can be a motive to us to make an effort? In regard to this we may
observe:

\(1\) That the work of our salvation is such that we need help, and such
help as God only can impart. We need it to enable us to overcome our
sins; to give us such a view of them as to produce true penitence; to
break away from our evil companions; to give up our plans of evil, and
to resolve to lead different lives. We need help that our minds may be
enlightened; that we may be led in the way of truth; that we may be
saved from the danger of error, and that we may not be suffered to fall
back into the ways of transgression. Such help we should welcome from
any quarter; and any assistance furnished on these points will not
interfere with our freedom.

\(2\) the influence which God exerts on the mind is in the way of help
or aid. What He does will not embarrass or hinder us. It will prevent no
effort which we make to be saved; it will throw no hindrance or obstacle
in the way. When we speak of Gods working "in us to will and to do,"
people often seem to suppose that His agency will hinder us, or throw
some obstacle in our way, or exert some evil influence on our minds, or
make it more difficult for us to work out our salvation than it would be
without His agency. But this cannot be. We may be sure that all the
influence which God exerts over our minds, will be to aid us in the work
of salvation, not to embarrass us; will be to enable us to overcome our
spiritual enemies and our sins, and not to put additional weapons into
their hands or to confer on them new power. Why should people ever dread
the influence of God on their hearts, as if he would hinder their
efforts for their own good?

\(3\) the fact that God works is an encouragement for us to work. When a
man is about to set out a peach or an apple tree, it is an encouragement
for him to reflect that the agency of God is around him, and that he can
cause the tree to produce blossoms, and leaves, and fruit. When he is
about to plow and sow his farm, it is an encouragement, not a hindrance,
to reflect that God works, and that he can quicken the grain that is
sown, and produce an abundant harvest. What encouragement of a higher
order can man ask? And what farmer is afraid of the agency of God in the
case, or supposes that the fact that God exerts an agency is a reason
why he should not plow and plant his field, or set out his orchard? Poor
encouragement would a man have in these things if God did not exert any
agency in the world, and could not be expected to make the tree grow or
to cause the grain to spring up; and equally poor would be all the
encouragement in religion without his aid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 2:14</span></span>

Do all things without murmurings and disputings - In a quiet, peaceful,
inoffensive manner. Let there be no brawls, strifes, or contentions. The
object of the apostle here is, probably, to illustrate the sentiment
which he had expressed in [Phi 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md),
where he had inculcated the general duties of humbleness of mind, and of
esteeming others better than themselves, in order that that spirit might
be fully manifested, he now enjoins the duty of doing everything in a
quiet and gentle manner, and of avoiding any species of strife; see the
notes at [Eph 4:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md).

[Philippians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 2:15</span></span>

That ye may be blameless - That you may give no occasion for others to
accuse you of having done wrong.

And harmless - Margin, "sincere." The Greek word (ἀκέραιος akeraios)
means properly that which is unmixed; and then pure, sincere. The idea
here is, that they should be artless, simple, without guile. Then they
would injure no one. The word occurs only in [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md), where it is rendered "harmless,"
and [Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md), where it is rendered
"sincere"; see the [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md) note,
and [Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md) note.

The sons of God - The children of God; a phrase by which true Christians
were denoted; see the [Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md) note;
[Eph 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md) note.

Without rebuke - Without blame; without giving occasion for anyone to
complain of you.

In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation - Among those of perverted
sentiments and habits; those who are disposed to complain and find
fault; those who will take every occasion to pervert what you do and
say, and who seek every opportunity to retard the cause of truth and
righteousness. It is not certainly known to whom the apostle refers
here, but it seems not improbable that he had particular reference to
the Jews who were in Philippi. The language used here was employed by
Moses [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md), as applicable to the
Jewish people, and it is accurately descriptive of the character of the
nation in the time of Paul. The Jews were among the most bitter foes of
the gospel, and did perhaps more than any other people to embarrass the
cause of truth and prevent the spread of the true religion.

Among whom ye shine - Margin, "or, shine ye." The Greek will admit of
either construction, and expositors have differed as to the correct
interpretation. Rosenmuller, Doddridge and others regard it as
imperative, and as designed to enforce on them the duty of letting their
light shine. Erasmus says it is doubtful whether it is to be understood
in the indicative or imperative. Grotius, Koppe, Bloomfield, and others
regard it as in the indicative, and as teaching that they did in fact
shine as lights in the world. The sense can be determined only by the
connection; and in regard to it different readers will form different
opinions. It seems to me that the connection seems rather to require the
sense of duty or obligation to be understood. The apostle is enforcing
on them the duty of being blameless and harmless; of holding forth the
word of life; and it is in accordance with his design to remind them
that they ought to be lights to those around them.

As lights in the world - The comparison of Christians with light, often
occurs in the Scriptures; see at [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md), note, 16, note. The image here
is not improbably taken from light-houses on a seacoast. The image then
is, that as those light-houses are placed on a dangerous coast to
apprise vessels of their peril, and to save them from shipwreck, so the
light of Christian piety shines on a dark world, and in the dangers of
the voyage which we are making; see the note of Burder, in Ros. Alt. u.
neu. Morgenland, in loc.

[Philippians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 2:16</span></span>

Holding forth the word of life - That is, you are under obligation to
hold forth the word of life. It is a duty incumbent on you as Christians
to do it. The "word of life" means the gospel, called the "word of life"
because it is the message that promises life; or perhaps this is a
Hebraism, denoting the living, or life-giving word. The gospel stands
thus in contrast with all human systems of religion - for they have no
efficacy to save - and to the law which "killeth;" see the [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md), note, and [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md), note. The duty here enjoined is
that of making the gospel known to others, and of thus keeping up the
knowledge of it in the world. This duty rests on Christians (compare
[Mat 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md), [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016).md), and they cannot escape from the
obligation. They are bound to do this, not only because God commands it,
but:

\(1\) because they are called into the church that they may be witnesses
for God, [Isa 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md).

\(2\) because they are kept on the earth for that purpose. If it were
not for some such design, they would be removed to heaven at once on
their conversion.

\(3\) because there are no others to do it. The frivolous ones will not
warn the fools, nor will the proud warn the proud, nor the scoffer the
scoffer. The thoughtless and the vain will not go and tell others that
there is a God and a Saviour; nor will the wicked warn the wicked, and
tell them that they are in the way to hell. There are none who will do
this but Christians; and, if they neglect it, sinners will go unwarned
and unalarmed down to death. This duty rests on every Christian.

The exhortation here is not made to the pastor, or to any officer of the
church particularly; but to the mass of communicants. They are to shine
as lights in the world; they are to hold forth the word of life. There
is not one member of a church who is so obscure as to be exempt from the
obligation; and there is not one who may not do something in this work.
If we are asked how this may be done, we may reply:

\(1\) They are to do it by example. Everyone is to hold forth the living
word in that way.

\(2\) by efforts to send the gospel to those who have it not. There is
almost no one who cannot contribute something, though it may be but two
mites, to accomplish this.

\(3\) by conversation. There is no Christian who has not some influence
over the minds and hearts of others; and he is bound to use that
influence in holding forth the word of life.

\(4\) by defending the divine origin of religion when attacked.

\(5\) by rebuking sin, and thus testifying to the value of holiness. The
defense of the truth, under God, and the diffusion of a knowledge of the
way of salvation, rests on those who are Christians. Paganism never
originates a system which it would not be an advantage to the world to
have destroyed as soon as it is conceived. Philosophy has never yet told
of a way by which a sinner may be saved. The world at large devises no
plan for the salvation of the soul. The most crude, ill-digested, and
perverse systems of belief conceivable, prevail in the community called
"the world." Every form of opinion has an advocate there; every
monstrous vagary that the human mind ever conceived, finds friends and
defenders there. The human mind has of itself no elastic energy to bring
it from the ways of sin; it has no recuperative power to lead it back to
God. The world at large is dependant on the church for any just views of
God, and of the way of salvation; and every Christian is to do his part
in making that salvation known.

That I may rejoice - This was one reason which the apostle urged, and
which it was proper to urge, why they should let their light shine. He
had been the instrument of their conversion, he had founded their
church, he was their spiritual father, and had shown the deepest
interest in their welfare; and he now entreats them, as a means of
promoting his highest joy, to be faithful and holy. The exemplary piety
and holy lives of the members of a church will be one of the sources of
highest joy to a minister in the day of judgment; compare [Jo3
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md).

In the day of Christ - The day when Christ shall appear - the day of
judgment. It is called the day of Christ, because he will be the
glorious object which will be prominent on that day; it will be the day
in which he will be honored as the judge of all the world.

That I have not run in vain - That is, that I have not lived in vain -
life being compared with a race: see the notes at [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md).

Neither laboured in vain - In preaching the gospel. Their holy lives
would be the fullest proof that he was a faithful preacher.

[Philippians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 2:17</span></span>

Yea, and if I be offered - Margin, "poured forth." The mention of his
labors in their behalf, in the previous verse, seems to have suggested
to him the sufferings which he was likely yet to endure on their
account. He had labored for their salvation. He had exposed himself to
peril that they and others might have the gospel. On their account he
had suffered much; he had been made a prisoner at Rome; and there was a
possibility, if not a probability, that his life might be a forfeit for
his labors in their behalf. Yet he says that, even if this should
happen, he would not regret it, but it would be a source of joy. The
word which is used here - σπένδομαι spendomai - properly means, to pour
out, to make a libation; and is commonly used, in the classic writers,
in connection with sacrifices. It refers to a drink-offering, where one
who was about to offer a sacrifice, or to present a drink-offering to
the gods, before he tasted of it himself, poured out apart of it on the
altar. Passow. It is used also to denote the fact that, when an animal
was about to be slain in sacrifice, wine was poured on it as a solemn
act of devoting it to God; compare [Num
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005.md); [Num
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007.md), [Num
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014.md). In like manner, Paul may have
regarded himself as a victim prepared for the sacrifice. In the New
Testament it is found only in this place, and in [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md), where it is rendered, "I am ready
to be offered;" compare the notes at that place. It does not here mean
that Paul really expected to be a sacrifice, or to make an expiation for
sin by his death; but that he might be called to pour out his blood, or
to offer up his life as if he were a sacrifice, or an offering to God.
We have a similar use of language, when we say that a man sacrifices
himself for his friends or his country.

Upon the sacrifice - ἐπὶ τῆ θυσίᾳ epi tē thusia. The word rendered here
as "sacrifice," means:

\(1\) the act of sacrificing;

\(2\) the victim that is offered; and,

\(3\) any oblation or offering.

Robinson's Lexicon. Here it must be used in the latter sense, and is
connected with "faith" - "the sacrifice of your faith." The reference is
probably to the faith, i. e., the religion of the Philippians, regarded
as a sacrifice or an offering to God; the worship which they rendered to
Him. The idea of Paul is, that if, in order to render that offering what
it should be - to make it as complete and acceptable to God as possible
- it were necessary for him to die, pouring out his blood, and strength,
and life, as wine was poured out to prepare a sacrifice for the altar
and make it complete, he would not refuse to do it, but would rejoice in
the opportunity. He seems to have regarded them as engaged in making an
offering of faith, and as endeavoring to make the offering complete and
acceptable; and says that if his death were necessary to make their
piety of the highest and most acceptable kind, he was ready to die.

And service - λειτουργία leitourgia - a word taken from an act of
worship, or public service, and especially the ministry of those engaged
in offering sacrifices; [Luk 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md);
[Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md). Here it means, the
ministering or service which the Philippians rendered to God; the
worship which they offered, the essential element of which was faith.
Paul was willing to endure anything, even to suffer death in their
cause, if it would tend to make their "service" more pure, spiritual,
and acceptable to God. The meaning of the whole is:

\(1\) that the sufferings and dangers which he now experienced were in
their cause, and on their behalf; and,

\(2\) that he was willing to lay down his life, if their piety would be
promoted, and their worship be rendered more pure and acceptable to God.

I joy - That is, I am not afraid of death; and if my dying can be the
means of promoting your piety, it will be a source of rejoicing; compare
the notes at [Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md).

And rejoice with you all - My joy will be increased in anything that
promotes yours. The fruits of my death will reach and benefit you, and
it will be a source of mutual congratulation.

[Philippians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 2:18</span></span>

For the same cause - Because we are united, and what affects one of us
should affect both.

Do ye joy, and rejoice with me - That is, "do not grieve at my death. Be
not overwhelmed with sorrow, but let your hearts be filled with
congratulation. It will be a privilege and a pleasure thus to die." This
is a noble sentiment, and one that could have been uttered only by a
heroic and generous mind - by a man who will not dread death, and who
felt that it was honorable thus to die Doddridge has illustrated the
sentiment by an appropriate reference to a fact stated by Plutarch. A
brave Athenian returned from the battle of Marathon, bleeding with
wounds and exhausted, and rushed into the presence of the magistrates,
and uttered only these two words - χαιρετε chairete, χαιρομεν chairomen
- "rejoice, we rejoice," and immediately expired. So Paul felt that
there was occasion for him, and for all whom he loved, to rejoice, if he
was permitted to die in the cause of others, and in such a manner that
his death would benefit the world.

[Philippians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 2:19</span></span>

But I trust in the Lord Jesus - His hope was that the Lord Jesus would
so order affairs as to permit this - an expression that no man could use
who did not regard the Lord Jesus as on the throne, and as more that
human.

To send Timotheus shortly unto you - There was a special reason why Paul
desired to send Timothy to them rather than any other person, which he
himself states, [Phi 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md). "Ye know
the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he hath served with me
in the gospel." From this passage, as well as from [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), where Timothy is joined with Paul
in the salutation, it is evident that he had been with the apostle at
Philippi. But this fact is nowhere mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of
the Acts of the Apostles, which contains an account of the visit of Paul
to that place. The narrative in the Acts , however, as Dr. Paley has
remarked (Horae Paulinae, in loc.) is such as to render this altogether
probable, and the manner in which the fact is adverted to here is such
as would have occurred to no one forging an epistle like this, and shows
that the Acts of the Apostles and the epistle are independent books, and
are not the work of imposture.

In the Acts of the Apostles it is said that when Paul came to Derbe and
Lystra he found a certain disciple named Timothy, whom he would have go
forth with him; Phil [Act 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md). The
narrative then proceeds with an account of the progress of Paul through
variotis provinces of Asia Minor, until it brings him to Troas. There he
was warned in a vision to go over into Macedonia. In pursuance of this
call, he passed over the Aegean Sea, came to Samothracia, and thence to
Neapolis, and thence to Philippi. No mention is made, indeed, of Timothy
as being with Paul at Philippi, but after he had left that city, and had
gone to Berea, where the "brethren sent away Paul," it is added, "but
Silas and Timotheus abode there still." From this it is evident that he
had accompanied them in their journey, and had no doubt been with them
at Philippi. For the argument which Dr. Paley has derived from the
manner in which this subject is mentioned in the Acts , and in this
Epistle in favor of the genuineness of the Scripture account; see Horae
Paul, on the Epistle to the Philippians, no. iv.

When I know your state - It was a considerable time since Epaphroditus
had left the Philippians, and since, therefore, Paul had been informed
of their condition.

[Philippians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 2:20</span></span>

For I have no man like-minded - Margin, "so dear unto me." The Greek is,
ἰσόψυχον isopsuchon - similar in mind, or like-minded. The meaning is,
that there was no one with him who would feel so deep an interest in
their welfare.

Who will naturally care - The word rendered "naturally" - γνησίως
gnēsiōs - means sincerely and the idea is, that he would regard their
interests with a sincere tenderness and concern. He might be depended on
to enter heartily into their concerns. This arose doubtless from the
fact that he had been with them when the church was founded there, and
that he felt a deeper interest in what related to the apostle Paul than
any other man. Paul regarded Timothy as a son, and Paul's sending him on
such an occasion would evince the feelings of a father who should send a
beloved son on an important message.

[Philippians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 2:21</span></span>

For all seek their own - That is, all who are with me. Who Paul had with
him at this time is not fully known, but he doubtless means that this
remark should apply to the mass of Christians and Christian ministers
then in Rome. Perhaps he had proposed to some of them to go and visit
the church at Philippi, and they had declined it because of the distance
and the dangers of the way. When the trial of Paul came on before the
emperor, all who were with him in Rome fled from him [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md), and it is possible that the same
disregard of his wishes and his welfare had already begun to manifest
itself among the Christians who were at Rome, so that he was constrained
to say that, as a general thing, they sought their own ease and comfort,
and were unwilling to deny themselves in order to promote the happiness
of those who lived in the remote parts of the world. Let us not be harsh
in judging them. How many professing Christians in our cities and towns
are there now who would be willing to leave their business and their
comfortable homes and go on embassy like this to Philippi? How many are
there who would not seek some excuse, and show that it was a
characteristic that they "sought their own" rather than the things which
pertained to the kingdom of Jesus Christ?

Not the things which are Jesus Christ's - Which pertain to his cause and
kingdom. They are not willing to practice self-denial in order to
promote that cause. It is implied here:

\(1\) that it is the duty of those who profess religion to seek the
things which pertain to the kingdom of the Redeemer, or to make that the
great and leading object of their lives. They are bound to be willing to
sacrifice their own things - to deny themselves of ease, and to be
always ready to expose themselves to peril and want if they may be the
means of advancing his cause.

\(2\) that frequently this is not done by those who profess religion. It
was the case with the professed Christians at Rome, and it is often the
case in the churches now. There are few Christians who deny themselves
much to promote the kingdom of the Redeemer; few who are willing to lay
aside what they regard as their own in order to advance his cause.
People live for their own ease; for their families; for the prosecution
of their own business - as if a Christian could have anything which he
has a right to pursue independently of the kingdom of the Redeemer, and
without regard to his will and glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 2:22</span></span>

But ye know the proof of him - You have had evidence among yourselves
how faithfully Timothy devoted himself to the promotion of the gospel,
and how constantly he served with me. This proves that Timothy was with
Paul when he was at Philippi.

As a son with the father - Manifesting the same spirit toward me which a
son does toward a father, and evincing the same interest in my work. He
did all he could do to aid me, and lighten my labors and sufferings.

[Philippians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 2:23</span></span>

So soon as I shall see how it will go with me - Paul was a prisoner at
Rome, and there was not a little uncertainty whether he would be
condemned or acquitted. He was, it is commonly supposed, in fact
released on the first trial; [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md). He now felt that he would soon
be able to send Timothy to them at any rate. If he was condemned and put
to death, he would, of course, have no further occasion for his
services, and if he was released from his present troubles and dangers,
he could spare him for a season to go and visit the churches.

[Philippians 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">phi 2:24</span></span>

But I trust in the Lord ... - note, [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md).

[Philippians 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 2:25</span></span>

Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus - Epaphroditus
is nowhere else mentioned but in this Epistle; see [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md). All that is known of him,
therefore, is what is mentioned here. He was from Philippi, and was a
member of the church there. He had been employed by the Philippians to
carry relief to Paul when he was in Rome [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md), and while in Rome he was taken
dangerously sick. News of this had been conveyed to Philippi, and again
intelligence had been brought to him that they had heard of his sickness
and that they were much affected by it. On his recovery, Paul thought it
best that he should return at once to Philippi, and doubtless sent this
Epistle by him. He is much commended by Paul for his faithfulness and
zeal.

My brother - In the gospel; or brother Christian. These expressions of
affectionate regard must have been highly gratifying to the Philippians.

And companion in labour - It is not impossible that he may have labored
with Paul in the gospel, at Philippi; but more probably the sense is,
that he regarded him as engaged in the same great work that he was. It
is not probable that he assisted Paul much in Rome, as he appears to
have been sick during a considerable part of the time he was there.

And fellow-soldier - Christians and Christian ministers are compared
with soldiers [Plm 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md); [Ti2
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md), because of the nature of the
service in which they are engaged. The Christian life is a warfare;
there are many foes to be overcome; the period which they are to serve
is fixed by the Great Captain of salvation, and they will soon be
permitted to enjoy the triumphs of victory. Paul regarded himself as
enlisted to make war on all the spiritual enemies of the Redeemer, and
he esteemed Epaphroditus as one who had shown that he was worthy to be
engaged in so good a cause.

But your messenger - Sent to convey supplies to Paul; [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md). The original is, "your apostle"
- ὑμῶν δὲ ἀπόστολον humōn de apostolon - and some have proposed to take
this literally, meaning that he was the apostle of the church at
Philippi, or that he was their bishop. The advocates for Episcopacy have
been the rather inclined to this, because in [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), there are but two orders of
ministers mentioned - "bishops and deacons" - from which they have
supposed that "the bishop" might have been absent, and that "the bishop"
was probably this Epaphroditus. But against this supposition the
objections are obvious:

\(1\) The word ἀπόστολος apostolos; means properly one sent forth, a
messenger, and it is uniformly used in this sense unless there is
something in the connection to limit it to an "apostle," technically so
called.

\(2\) the supposition that it here means a messenger meets all the
circumstances of the case, and describes exactly what Epaphroditus did.
He was in fact sent as a messenger to Paul; [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md).

\(3\) he was not an apostle in the proper sense of the term - the
apostles having been chosen to be witnesses of the life, the teachings,
the death, and the resurrection of the Saviour; see [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md); compare the notes, [Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md).

\(4\) if he had been an apostle, it is altogether improbable that he
would have seen sent on an errand comparatively so humble as that of
carrying supplies to Paul. Was there no one else who could do this
without sending their bishop? Would a diocese be likely to employ a
"bishop" for such a purpose now?

And he that ministered to my wants - [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md).

[Philippians 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 2:26</span></span>

For he longed after you all - He was desirous to see you all, and to
relieve your anxiety in regard to his safety.

[Philippians 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 2:27</span></span>

For indeed he was sick nigh unto death - Dr. Paley has remarked (Hor.
Paul. on Phil no. ii.) that the account of the sickness and recovery of
Epaphroditus is such as to lead us to suppose that he was not restored
by miracle; and he infers that the power of healing the sick was
conferred on the apostles only occasionally, and did not depend at all
on their will, since, if it had, there is every reason to suppose that
Paul would at once have restored him to health. This account, he adds,
shows also that this Epistle is not the work of an impostor. Had it
been, a miracle would not have been spared. Paul would not have been
introduced as showing such anxiety about a friend lying at the point of
death, and as being unable to restore him. It would have been said that
he interposed at once, and raised him up to health.

But God had mercy on him - By restoring him to health evidently not by
miracle, but by the use of ordinary means.

On me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow - In addition to all
the sorrows of imprisonment, and the prospect of a trial, and the want
of friends. The sources of his sorrow, had Epaphroditus died, would have
been such as these:

\(1\) He would have lost a valued friend, and one whom he esteemed as a
brother and worthy fellow-laborer.

\(2\) He would have felt that the church at Philippi had lost a valuable
member.

\(3\) his grief might have been aggravated from the consideration that
his life had been lost in endeavoring to do him good. He would have felt
that he was the occasion, though innocent, of his exposure to danger.

[Philippians 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">phi 2:28</span></span>

I send him therefore the more carefully - With more diligence, or speed;
I was the more ready to send him.

That I may be the less sorrowful - That is, on account of my solicitude
for you; that I may know that your minds are at ease, and that you
rejoice in his being among you.

[Philippians 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 2:29</span></span>

Receive him therefore in the Lord - As the servant of the Lord, or as
now restored to you by the Lord, and therefore to be regarded as a fresh
gift from God. Our friends restored to us after a long absence, we
should receive as the gift of God, and as a proof of his mercy.

And hold such in reputation - Margin, honor such. This is a high
commendation of Epaphroditus, and, at the same time, it enjoins an
important duty in regard to the proper treatment of those who sustain
such a character. It is a Christian duty to honor those who ought to be
honored, to respect the virtuous and the pious, and especially to honor
those who evince fidelity in the work of the Lord.

[Philippians 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 2:30</span></span>

Because for the work of Christ - That is, either by exposing himself in
his journey to see the apostle in Rome, or by his labors there.

Not regarding his life - There is a difference in the mss. here, so
great that it is impossible now to determine which is the true reading,
though the sense is not materially affected. The common reading of the
Greek text is, παραβολευσάμενος paraboleusamenos; literally
"misconsulting, not consulting carefully, not taking pains." The other
reading is, παραζολευσάμενος parazoleusamenos; "exposing oneself to
danger," regardless of life; see the authorities for this reading in
Wetstein; compare Bloomfield, in loc. This reading suits the connection,
and is generally regarded as the correct one.

To supply your lack of service toward me - Not that they had been
indifferent to him, or inattentive to his wants, for he does not mean to
blame them; but they had not had an opportunity to send to his relief
(see [Phi 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010).md), and Epaphroditus
therefore made a special journey to Rome on his account. He came and
rendered to him the service which they could not do in person; and what
the church would have done, if Paul had been among them, he performed in
their name and on their behalf.

Remarks On Philippians 2

1\. Let us learn to esteem others as they ought to be; [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). Every person who is virtuous and
pious has some claim to esteem. He has a reputation which is valuable to
him and to the church, and we should not withhold respect from him. It
is one evidence, also, of true humility and of right feeling, when we
esteem them as better than ourselves, and when we are willing to see
them honored, and are willing to sacrifice our own ease to promote their
welfare. It is one of the instinctive promptings of true humility to
feel that other persons are better than we are.

2\. We should not he disappointed or mortified if others think little of
us - if we are not brought into prominent notice among people; [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). We profess to have a low opinion
of ourselves, if we are Christians, and we ought to have; and why should
we be chagrined and mortified if others have the same opinion of us? Why
should we not be willing that they should accord in judgment with us in
regard to ourselves?

3\. We should be willing to occupy our appropriate place in the church;
[Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). That is true humility; and
why should anyone be unwilling to be esteemed just as he ought to be?
Pride makes us miserable, and is the grand thing that stands in the way
of the influence of the gospel on our hearts. No one can become a
Christian who is not willing to occupy just the place which he ought to
occupy; to take the lowly position as a penitent which he ought to take;
and to have God regard and treat him just as he ought to be treated. The
first, second, and third thing in religion is humility; and no one ever
becomes a Christian who is not willing to take the lowly condition of a
child.

4\. We should feel a deep interest in the welfare of others; [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md). People are by nature selfish, and
it is the design of religion to make them benevolent. They seek their
own interests by nature, and the gospel would teach them to regard the
welfare of others. If we are truly under the influence of religion,
there is not a member of the church in whom we should not feel an
interest, and whose welfare we should not strive to promote as far as we
have opportunity. And we may have opportunity every day. It is an easy
matter to do good to others. A kind word, or even a kind look, does
good; and who so poor that he cannot render this? Every day that we
live, we come in contact with some who may be benefited by our example,
our advice, or our alms; and every day, therefore, may be closed with
the feeling that we have not lived in vain.

5\. Let us in all things look to the example of Christ; [Phi
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md). He came that he might be an
example; and he was exactly such an example as we need. We may be always
sure that we are right when we follow his example and possess his
spirit. We cannot be so sure that we are right in any other way. He came
to be our model in all things, and in all the relations of life:

\(a\) He showed us what the law of God requires of us.

\(b\) lie showed us what we should aim to be, and what human nature
would be if it were wholly under the influence of religion.

\(c\) lie showed us what true religion is, for it is just such as was
seen in his life.

\(d\) he showed us how to act in our treatment of mankind.

\(e\) he showed us how to bear the ills of poverty, and want, and pain,
and temptation, and reproach, from the world. We should learn to
manifest the same spirit in suffering which he did, for then we are sure
we are right.

\(f\) and he has showed us how to die. He has exhibited in death just
the spirit which we should when we die; for it is not less desirable to
die well than to live well.

6\. It is right and proper to worship Christ; [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). He was in the form of God, and
equal with God; and, being such, we should adore him. No one need be
afraid to render too high honor to the Saviour; and all piety may he
measured by the respect which is shown to him. Religion advances in the
world just in proportion as people are disposed to render honor to the
Redeemer; it becomes dim and dies away just in proportion as that honor
is withheld.

7\. Like the Redeemer, we should he willing to deny ourselves in order
that we may promote the welfare of others; [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). We can never, indeed, equal his
condescension. We can never stoop from such a state of dignity and honor
as he did; but, in our measure, we should aim to imitate him. If we have
comforts, we should be willing to deny ourselves of them to promote the
happiness of others. If we occupy an elevated rank in life, we should be
willing to stoop to one more humble. If we live in a palace, we should
be willing to enter the most lowly cottage, if we can render its inmates
happy.

8\. Christ was obedient unto death; [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md). Let us be obedient also, doing
the will of God in all things. If in his service we are called to pass
through trials, even those which will terminate in death, let us obey.
He has a right to command us, and we have the example of the Saviour to
sustain us. if he requires us, by his providence, and by the leadings of
his Spirit, to forsake our country and home; to visit climes of
pestilential air, or to traverse wastes of burning sand, to make his
name known; if he demands that, in that service, we shall die far away
from kindred and home, and that our bones shall be laid on the banks of
the Senegal or the Ganges - still, let us remember that these sufferings
are not equal to those of the Master. He was an exile from heaven, in a
world of suffering. Our exile from our own land is not like that from
heaven; nor will our sufferings, though in regions of pestilence and
death, be like his sufferings in the garden and on the cross.

9\. Let us rejoice that we have a Saviour who has ascended to heaven,
and who is to be forever honored there; [Phi
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md). He is to suffer no more. He
has endured the last pang; has passed through a state of humiliation and
woe which he will never repeat; and has submitted to insults and
mockeries to which it will not be necessary for him to submit again.
When we now think of the Redeemer, we can think of him as always happy
and honored. There is no moment, by day or by night, in which he is not
the object of adoration, love, and praise - nor will there ever be such
a moment to all eternity. Our best friend is thus to be eternally
reverenced, and in heaven he will receive a full reward for all his
unparalleled woes.

10\. Let us diligently endeavor to work out our salvation; [Phi
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md). Nothing else so much demands
our unceasing solicitude as this, and in nothing else have we so much
encouragement. We are assured that God aids us in this work. He throws
no obstructions in our path, but all that God does in the matter of
salvation is in the way of help. He does not work in us evil passions,
or impure desires, or unbelief; his agency is to enable us to perform
"his good pleasure," or that which will please him - that is, that which
is holy. The farmer is encouraged to plow and plant his fields when God
works around him by sending the warm breezes of the spring, and by
refreshing the earth with gentle dews and rains. And so we may be
encouraged to seek our salvation when God works in our hearts, producing
serious thoughts, and a feeling that we need the blessings of salvation.

11\. Christians should let their light shine; [Phi
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md). God has called them into his
kingdom that they may show what is the nature and power of true
religion. They are to illustrate in their lives the nature of that
gospel which he has revealed, and to show its value in purifying the
soul, and in sustaining it in the time of trial. The world is dependent
on Christians for just views of religion, and every day that a Christian
lives he is doing something to honor or dishonor the gospel. Every word
that he speaks, every expression of the eye, every cloud or beam of
sunshine on his brow, will have some effect in doing this. He cannot
live without making some impression upon the world around him, either
favorable or unfavorable to the cause of his Redeemer.

12\. We should be ready to die, if called to such a sacrifice in behalf
of the church of Christ; [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md). We
should rejoice in being permitted to suffer, that we may promote the
welfare of others, and be the means of saving those for whom Christ
died. It has been an honor to be a martyr in the cause of religion, and
so it ever will be when God calls to such a sacrifice of life. If he
calls us to it, therefore, we should not shrink from it, nor should we
shrink from any sufferings by which we may honor the Saviour, and rescue
souls from death.

13\. Let us learn, from the interesting narrative respecting
Epaphroditus at the close of this chapter, to live and act as becomes
Christians in every situation in life; [Phi
2:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md). It was much to have the
praise of an apostle and to be commended for his Christian conduct, as
this stranger in Rome was. He went there, not to view the wonders of the
imperial city, and not to run the rounds of giddy pleasure there, but to
perform an important duty of religion. While there he became sick - not
by indulgence in pleasures; not as the result of feasting and revelry,
but in the work of Christ. In a strange city, far from home, amidst the
rich, the great, the frivolous; in a place where theaters opened their
doors, and where places of amusement abounded, he led a life which an
apostle could commend as pure. There is nothing more difficult for a
Christian than to maintain an irreproachable walk when away from the
usual restraints and influences that serve to keep him in the paths of
piety, and when surrounded with the fascinations and allurements of a
great and wicked city.

There strangers, extending the rites of hospitality, often invite the
guest to places of amusement which the Christian would not visit were he
at home. There the desire to see all that is to be seen, and to hear all
that is to be heard, attracts him to the theater, the opera, and the
gallery of obscene and licentious statuary and painting. There the plea
readily presents itself that an opportunity of witnessing these things
may never occur again; that he is unknown, and that his example,
therefore, can do no harm; that it is desirable, from personal
observation, to know what is the condition of the world; or that perhaps
his former views in these matters may have been precise and puritanical.
To such considerations he yields; but yields only to regret it in future
life. Rarely is such a thing done without its being in some way soon
known; and rarely, very rarely does a Christian minister or other member
of the church travel much without injury to his piety, and to the cause
of religion. A Christian man who is under a necessity of visiting Europe
from this country, should feel that he has special need of the prayers
of his friends, that he may not dishonor his religion abroad; he who is
permitted to remain at home, and to cultivate the graces of piety in his
own family, and in the quiet scenes where he has been accustomed to
move, should regard it as a cause of special thankfulness to God.
