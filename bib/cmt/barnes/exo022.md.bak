### [Exodus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 22:1</span></span>

The theft of an ox appears to have been regarded as a greater crime than
the theft of a sheep, because it showed a stronger purpose in wickedness
to take the larger and more powerful animal. It may have been on similar
moral ground that the thief, when he had proved his persistency in crime
by adding to his theft the slaughter, or sale, of the animal, was to
restore four times its value in the case of a sheep (compare the
marginal references), and five times its value in the case of an ox; but
if the animal was still in his possession alive (see [Exo
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004).md) he had to make only twofold
restitution.

[Exodus 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 22:2</span></span>

If a thief, in breaking into a dwelling in the night, was slain, the
person who slew him did not incur the guilt of blood; but if the same
occurred in daylight, the slayer was guilty in accordance with [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md). The distinction may have been
based on the fact that in the light of day there was a fair chance of
identifying and apprehending the thief.

[Exodus 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 22:5</span></span>

Shall put in his beast, and shall feed - Rather, shall let his beast go
loose, and it shall feed.

[Exodus 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 22:8</span></span>

It would appear that if the master of the house would clear himself of
imputation, the loss of the pledged article fell upon its owner.

[Exodus 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 22:9</span></span>

All manner of trespass - He who was accused, and he who had lost the
stolen property, were both to appear before the judges [Exo
18:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#025.md).

[Exodus 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 22:10</span></span>

This law appears to relate chiefly to herdsmen employed by the owners of
cattle. When an animal was stolen [Exo
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#012.md), it was presumed either that the
herdsman might have prevented it, or that he could find the thief and
bring him to justice (see [Exo 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004).md).
When an animal was killed by a wild beast, the keeper had to produce the
mangled carcass, not only in proof of the fact, but to show that he had,
by his vigilance and courage, deprived the wild beast of its prey.

[Exodus 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 22:15</span></span>

It came for his hire - The sum paid for hiring was regarded as covering
the risk of accident.

[Exodus 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 22:16</span></span>

See the marginal references.

[Exodus 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 22:18</span></span>

Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live - See the marginal references. and
[Lev 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md). The witch is here named to
represent the class. This is the earliest denunciation of witchcraft in
the law. In every form of witchcraft there is an appeal to a power not
acting in subordination to the divine law. From all such notions and
tendencies true worship is designed to deliver us. The practice of
witchcraft was therefore an act of rebellion against Yahweh, and, as
such, was a capital crime. The passages bearing on the subject in the
Prophets, as well as those in the law, carry a lesson for all ages. [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md); [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md); [Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md); [Isa
47:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md); [Mic
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012.md), etc.

[Exodus 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 22:20</span></span>

This was probably an old formula, the sense of which, on its ethical
side, is comprised in the first and second commandments.

Shall be utterly destroyed - The Hebrew word here used is חרם châram (i.
e. devoted). See [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md).

[Exodus 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 22:21</span></span>

A stranger - See [Exo 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010.md) note.

[Exodus 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 22:22</span></span>

Afflict - A word including all cold and contemptuous treatment. See [Deu
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md). Contrast the blessing, [Deu
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#029.md).

[Exodus 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 22:25</span></span>

See the notes at [Lev 25:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#035.md);
compare [Deu 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 22:26</span></span>

The law regarding pledges is expanded, [Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md), [Deu
24:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 22:28</span></span>

The gods - Heb. אלהים 'ělôhı̂ym. See [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md) note. Many take it as the name of
God (as in [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001).md), and this
certainly seems best to represent the Hebrew, and to suit the context.

Curse the ruler ... - See [Act 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005.md).

[Exodus 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 22:29</span></span>

The offering of firstfruits appears to have been a custom of primitive
antiquity and was connected with the earliest acts of sacrifice. See
[Gen 4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003.md). The references to it here
and in [Exo 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md) had probably been
handed down from patriarchal times. The specific law relating to the
firstborn of living creatures was brought out in a strong light in
connection with the deliverance from Egypt [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md), [Exo
13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md); compare [Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Lev
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md); [Deu
26:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md); [Neh
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#035.md).

The first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors - See the margin. The
rendering of our King James Bible is a paraphrase.

[Exodus 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 22:31</span></span>

The sanctification of the nation was emphatically symbolized by
strictness of diet as regards both the kind of animal, and the mode of
slaughtering. See Lev. 11; 17.
