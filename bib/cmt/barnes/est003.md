### [Esther Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md)

[Esther 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 3:1</span></span>

The name, Haman, is probably the same as the Classical Omanes, and in
ancient Persian, "Umana", an exact equivalent of the Greek "Eumenes."
Hammedatha is perhaps the same as "Madata" or "Mahadata", an old Persian
name signifying "given by (or to) the moon."

The Agagite - The Jews generally understand by this expression "the
descendant of Agag," the Amalekite monarch of 1 Sam. 15. Haman, however,
by his own name, and the names of his sons [Est
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#007.md) and his father, would seem to
have been a genuine Persian.

The Classical writers make no mention of Haman's advancement; but their
notices of the reign of Xerxes after 479 B.C. are exceedingly scanty.

[Esther 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 3:2</span></span>

Mordecai probably refused the required prostration, usual though it was,
on religious grounds. Hence, his opposition led on to his confession
that he was a Jew [Est 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#004.md).

[Esther 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 3:4</span></span>

Whether Mordecai's matters would stand - Rather, "whether Mordecai's
words would hold good" - whether, that is, his excuse, that he was a
Jew, would be allowed as a valid reason for his refusal.

[Esther 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 3:6</span></span>

To destroy all the Jews - In the East massacres of a people, a race, a
class, have at all times been among the incidents of history, and would
naturally present themselves to the mind of a statesman. The Magophonia,
or the great massacre of the Magi at the accession of Darius Hystaspis,
was an event not then fifty years old, and was commemorated annually. A
massacre of the Scythians had occurred about a century previously.

[Esther 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 3:7</span></span>

In the first month ... - i. e. in March or April of 474 B.C.

"Pur" is supposed to be an old Persian word etymologically connected
with the Latin "pars", and signifying "part" or "lot." The practice of
casting lots to obtain a lucky day still obtains in the East, and is
probably extremely ancient. A lot seems to have been cast, or a throw of
some kind made, for each day of the month and each month of the year.
The day and month which obtained the best throws were then selected.
Assyrian calendars note lucky and unlucky days as early as the eighth
century B.C. Lots were in use both among the Oriental and the Classical
nations from a remote antiquity.

"Adar," the twelfth month, corresponds nearly to our March. It seems to
have derived its name from "adar", "splendor," because of the brightness
of the sun and the flowers at that time.

[Esther 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 3:9</span></span>

Ten thousand talents of silver - According to Herodotus, the regular
revenue of the Persian king consisted of 14,560 silver talents; so that,
if the same talent is intended, Haman's offer would have exceeded
two-thirds of one year's revenue (or two and one-half million British
pound sterling). Another Persian subject, Pythius, once offered to
present Xerxes with four millions of gold darics, or about four and
one-half pounds.

[Esther 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 3:11</span></span>

The silver is given to thee - Some understand this to mean that Xerxes
refused the silver which Haman had offered to him; but the passage is
better explained as a grant to him of all the property of such Jews as
should be executed [Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md).

[Esther 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 3:12</span></span>

On the thirteenth day - Haman had, apparently (compare [Est
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007.md) with [Est
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013).md), obtained by his use of the lot
the 13th day of Adar as the lucky day for destroying the Jews. This may
have caused him to fix on the 13th day of another month for the
commencement of his enterprise. So, the Jews throughout the empire had
from 9 to 11 months of warning of the peril which threatened them.

[Esther 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 3:13</span></span>

Present, the Jews keep three days - the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th of
Adar - as connected with "the Feast of Purim;" but they make the 13th a
fast, commemorative of the fast of Esther [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md), and keep the feast itself on the
14th and 15th of Adar.

[Esther 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 3:15</span></span>

Shushan was perplexed - Susa was now the capital of Persia, and the main
residence of the Persians of high rank. These, being attached to the
religion of Zoroaster, would naturally sympathize with the Jews, and be
disturbed at their threatened destruction. Even apart from this bond of
union, the decree was sufficiently strange and ominous to "perplex"
thoughtful citizens.
