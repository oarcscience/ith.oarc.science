### [Ezekiel Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 34:1</span></span>

The prophet has yet to pronounce a judgment upon unfaithful rulers,
whose punishment will further the good of those whom they have
misguided. He shows what the rulers should have been, what they have
been, and what in the coming times they shall be when the True King
shall reign in the true kingdom. Hence, follows a description of
Messiah's reign.

[Ezekiel 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 34:2</span></span>

Shepherds - Not priests or prophets, but rulers and kings (see the [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008) note.md). The most ancient title for
"ruler" is a monogram which occurs on the oldest monuments discovered in
the cuneiform character. In the Assyrian language it became riu (compare
Hebrew רעה râ‛âh =shepherd). In the traditions of Berosus we find that
Alorus, the first king in the world, received from the Divinity the
title of Shepherd. The title, as well as the monogram, was preserved to
the latest times of the Assyrian monarchy. While the distress and misery
of the people daily in creased, the last kings of Judah exacted more and
more from their subjects and lavished more and more on personal luxury
and show.

[Ezekiel 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 34:11</span></span>

Yahweh is the shepherd of His people. He will do all which the shepherds
should have done and did not. These promises - partially fulfilled in
the return from Babylon, and in the subsequent prosperity under the
Maccabees - point to the ingathering of all nations in the Church of
Christ the Good Shepherd. Compare [Mat
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011.md) : John 10:1-18; [Rom
9:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md).

[Ezekiel 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 34:12</span></span>

The cloudy and dark day - Contrasted with the day in which the Lord will
be among them like a shepherd to gather them together again.

[Ezekiel 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 34:16</span></span>

With judgment - It is characteristic of Yahweh as a shepherd that He
judges between sheep and sheep, rejecting the proud and accepting the
penitent and broken-hearted.

[Ezekiel 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 34:20</span></span>

Yahweh having promised to be a Ruler of His people, the administration
of the divine kingdom is now described, as carried on by One King, the
representative of David, whose dominion should fulfill all the promises
originally made to the man after God's own heart. Ezekiel does not so
much add to, as explain and develope, the original promise; and as the
complete fulfillment of the spiritual blessings, which the prophets were
guided to proclaim, was manifestly never realized in any temporal
prosperity of the Jews, and never could and never can be realized in any
earthly kingdom, we recognize throughout the Sacred Volume the one
subject of all prophecy - the Righteous King, the Anointed Prince, the
Son and the Lord of David.

[Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md)

One shepherd - One, as ruling over an undivided people, the distinction
between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah having been done away.

My servant David - David was a fit type of the True King because he was
a true and faithful servant of Yahweh. That which David was partially
and imperfectly, Christ is in full perfection (compare [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md); [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md); [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007)..md)

[Eze 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026.md)

The blessings here foretold are especially those of the old covenant.
The wilderness (or, pasture-country) and the woods, the places most
exposed to beasts and birds of prey, become places of security. Under
the new covenant Sion and the hills around are representative of God's
Church; and temporal blessings are typical of the blessings showered
down upon Christ's Church by Him who has vanquished the powers of evil.

[Eze 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029.md)

A plant - Equivalent to the "Branch," under which name Isaiah and
Jeremiah prophesy of the Messiah. The contrast in this verse to hunger
seems to favor the idea that the "plant" was for food, i. e., spiritual
food, and in this sense also, applicable to the Messiah (compare [Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035)..md)

The shame of the pagan - The shameful reproaches with which the pagan
assail them.

[Eze 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md)

Translate "Ye are my flock, the flock of my pasture (compare [Jer
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001).md); ye are men, and I am your God."
