### [Judges Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001)

[Judges 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 20:1</span></span>

The "congregation" is the technical term for the whole community of the
Israelite people. Its occurrence here is an indication of the early date
of these transactions.

From Dan to Beer-sheba - We cannot safely infer from this expression
that the settlement of Dan, recorded in Judg. 18 had taken place at this
time. It only proves that in the writer's time, from Dan to Beer-sheba
was a proverbial expression for all Israel (compare the marginal
reference).

With the land of Gilead - Meaning all the trans-Jordanic tribes;
mentioned particularly, both to show that the whole congregation of the
children of Israel, in its widest meaning, took part in the council, and
also because of Jabesh-Gilead [Jdg
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008), [Jdg
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#010).

Unto the Lord in Mizpeh - The phrase "unto the Lord", implies the
presence of the tabernacle ([Jdg 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011)
note). Mizpeh in Benjamin [Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026),
from its connection with Bethel and Ramah, is probably meant here. It is
the same as that which appears as a place of national assembly in [Sa1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005); [Sa1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017); [Kg2
25:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#023). It must have been near
Shiloh and Gibeah, and in the north of Benjamin. The Benjamites were
duly summoned with the other tribes; so that their absence was
contumacious [Jdg 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#003).

[Judges 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 20:2</span></span>

The chief - literally, "the corner stones." (Compare [Sa1
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#038).)

[Judges 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 20:8</span></span>

They bound themselves not to break up and disperse until they had
punished the wickedness of Gibeah.

[Judges 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 20:9</span></span>

By lot - To determine who should go up first [Jdg
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018). The shape of the ground
probably made it impossible for the whole force to operate at once; and
the question of spoil would have something to do with the arrangement.
(Compare [Sa1 30:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#022).)

[Judges 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 20:10</span></span>

In order to make it possible for the force of Israel to keep the field,
and do to the men of Gibeah what their wickedness deserved, every tenth
man (40,000 in all) was appointed to find provisions for the whole army.

[Judges 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 20:15</span></span>

Comparing the numbers here with those in Num. 1; 26, it is seen that in
the case both of the Benjamites and the Israelites the numbers are
diminished by about one-third, i. e., they appear as about two-thirds
only of what they were at the last numbering in the plains of Moab. This
diminution seems to indicate disturbed and harassing times. With this
agrees the mention of the cities, as containing the whole Benjamite
population. The inference is that the open country and unwalled villages
were not safe, but that the Benjamites kept the Canaanites in subjection
only by dwelling in fortified towns.

[Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016)

See [Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015), and note. In the
Septuagint and Vulgate the 700 chosen men of Gibeah are represented as
the seven hundred left-handed slingers.

[Judges 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 20:18</span></span>

Went up to the house of God - It should be "to Bethel." At this time the
ark was at Bethel (compare [Sa1 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#003)),
and not at Shiloh. It is not unlikely that though Shiloh was the chief
residence of the ark [Jer 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012), yet
the tabernacle, being moveable, was, either at stated times, or as
occasion required, moved to where the Judge resided, or the congregation
assembled (compare [Sa1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016)). On the
present occasion the ark may have been moved to Bethel for the
convenience of proximity to the great national council at Mizpeh.

[Judges 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 20:21</span></span>

Gibeah, being on a hill, was difficult of access to an attacking army,
and gave great advantage to the defenders, who fought from higher
ground, and probably defended a narrow pass, while their companions on
the walls could gall the assailants with their slingstones.

[Judges 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 20:26</span></span>

Fasted until even - The regular time for ending a fast among the Hebrews
was sunset (compare [Sa1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024); [Sa2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#012)). Such national fasts are called
by the rabbis "fasts of the congregation," and were enjoined in times of
great affliction.

On the offerings, see Lev. i., 3.

[Judges 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 20:28</span></span>

Phinehas, the son of Eleazar ... - A most important chronological
statement, which makes it probable that these events occurred within
twenty years of the death of Joshua.

To-morrow - The two former answers only bade them go up against
Benjamin; now, for the first time, the promise is added, "Tomorrow,"
etc. (compare [Jos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001)).

[Judges 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 20:29</span></span>

The stratagem described is exactly that by which Joshua took Ai
(marginal reference).

[Judges 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 20:31</span></span>

To the house of God - "To Bethel," as in the margin. On "Gibeah in the
field," see [Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024) note.

[Judges 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 20:33</span></span>

Baal-tamar is only mentioned here. It took its name from some palm-tree
that grew there; perhaps the same as the "palm-tree of Deborah, between
Ramah and Bethel" [Jdg 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#005), the exact
locality here indicated, since "the highway" [Jdg
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#031) along which the Israelites
enticed the Benjamites to pursue them, leads straight to Ramah, which
lay only a mile beyond the point where the two ways branch off.

The meadows of Gibeah - The word rendered "meadow" is only found here.
According to its etymology, it ought to mean a "bare open place", which
is particularly unsuitable for an ambush. However, by a change in the
vowel-points, without any alteration in the letters, it becomes the
common word for "a cavern".

[Judges 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jdg 20:42</span></span>

The way of the wilderness - i. e., the wilderness which extended from
Jericho to the hills of Bethel.

Them which came out of the cities - These must be the Benjamites [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015). Hence, "in the midst of them"
must mean "in their own cities", where they severally fled for refuge,
but failed to find shelter [Jdg 20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048).
Anathoth, Alemath, Ramah, Ataroth, Geba, Michmash, Ai, Bethel, Migron,
etc., would probably be the cities meant, all lying east and north of
Gibeah.

[Judges 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jdg 20:43</span></span>

The language and construction of this verse is poetical; it seems to be
an extract from a song, and to describe, in the language of poetry, the
same event which the preceding verse described in that of prose.

With ease - Or "rest" [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033); [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011). The expression is very obscure.
The margin takes it as the name of a place.

[Judges 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jdg 20:45</span></span>

Rimmon - A village named "Rummon", situated on the summit of a conical
chalky hill, still exists, and forms a remarkable object in the
landscape, visible in all directions. It lies 15 miles north of
Jerusalem. It is a different place from Rimmon in the south of Judah
[Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032), and Remmon in Zebulon [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013). Gidom, mentioned nowhere else,
was evidently close to Rimmon.

[Judges 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jdg 20:46</span></span>

In [Jdg 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035) the number given is
25,100. [Jdg 20:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#044) give the details
of the loss on that day: 18,000, 5,000, and 2,000; in all 25,000. But as
the Benjamites numbered 26,700 men [Jdg
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#015), and 600 escaped to the rock of
Rimmon, it is clear that 1,100 are unaccounted for, partly from no
account being taken of those who fell in the battles of the two first
days, partly from the use of round numbers, or from some other cause.
The numbers given both here and in [Jdg
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035) are expressly restricted to
those who fell on "that" (the third) "day."

[Judges 20:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jdg 20:48</span></span>

They treated Benjamin as devoted to utter destruction, as Jericho had
been [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017), [Jos
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021), and the whole tribe was all but
actually extirpated. We see in the punishment inflicted the same
ferocity which marked both the crime and the Levite's mode of requiring
vengeance.
