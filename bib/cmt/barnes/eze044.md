### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 44:0</span></span>

The relation of the different classes of people to the temple and its
courts.

[Eze 44:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md). The position of the
Prince.

[Ezekiel 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 44:1</span></span>

Outward sanctuary - The court of the priests, as distinguished from the
temple itself. This gate was reserved for the prince, to whom it was
opened on certain days. Only a prince of the house of David might sit
down in the priests' court (compare [Eze
46:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001).md).

[Ezekiel 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 44:2</span></span>

The Lord hath entered in - See [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md).

[Ezekiel 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 44:3</span></span>

The prince - Foretold under the name of David [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md). The rabbis understood this to
be the Messiah.

To eat bread - See [Lev 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md); [Lev
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009.md); according to the old Law these
feasts belonged only to the priests; none of the rest of the
congregation, not even the king, might partake of them. The new system
gives to the "prince" a privilege which he did not before possess; the
prince, as the representative of the Messiah, standing in a higher
position than the kings of old. "To eat bread" may also include
participation in the animals sacrificed, portions of which were reserved
for those of the people who offered them.

[Ezekiel 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 44:4</span></span>

Admonition to the ministering priests, grounded upon former neglect.

[Eze 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004.md)

The north gate before the house - The north gate of the inner court. God
expostulates with His people in the seat of their former idolatries [Eze
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md).

[Eze 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#005.md)

Mark well - The careful arrangements made had all been intended to keep
the temple and its surroundings from profanation. Hence, attention to
these particulars is enjoined.

[Eze 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md)

Strangers - This refers especially to the sin of unauthorized and
unfaithful priests ministering in the services of the temple. Compare
marginal references.

[Eze 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008.md)

Mine holy things - The altar, its sacrifices, the sacred utensils, and
the like.

For yourselves - According to your own pleasure, not My ordinances [Num
16:40](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#040.md).

[Eze 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010.md)

The Levites as a body had remained true to the temple-service at
Jerusalem [Ch2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md); but individuals
among them deserted to Israel probably from the first (see the marginal
references), as in later years some went over to the worship of the
Samaritans on Mount Gerizim. These apostate Levites "shall bear their
iniquities," they shall not be restored to their former rank and
privileges.

[Eze 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#011.md)

Ministers - As, according to the new system, the Levites, as a body,
were to receive their portion in the "oblation" [Eze
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005.md); the only manner in which the
Levites of [Eze 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010.md) could live at
all, was as part of the whole body, to which they were therefore
reunited, but in the lowest grade. It is remarkable that the number of
Levites who returned after the captivity was very small, not exceeding
400, of whom only 74 were priests' assistants ([Ezr
2:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040.md); compare [Ezr
8:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015).md). The gap in their number was
filled up by 220 Nethinim ("given" ones), probably originally strangers
and captives, who, although employed in the temple services, were held
by the Jews in the lowest repute.

[Eze 44:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#012.md)

Lifted up mine hand - i. e., "The Lord sware" [Eze
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005.md), that they should bear their
iniquities.

[Ezekiel 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 44:17</span></span>

Regulations as to the priests' services. The garments of the priests are
defined and various rules prescribed in the Law are repeated with some
additions in order to denote additional care to avoid uncleanness.

[Eze 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#018.md)

The material of which the four vestments of the ordinary priest were
made was "linen," or, more accurately, "byssus," the cotton stuff of
Egypt. The two special qualities of the byssus - white and shining - are
characteristic, and on them part of the symbolic meaning depended.
Compare [Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md).

[Eze 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#019.md)

They shall not sanctify the people - They shall not touch the people
with their holy garments. The word "sanctify" is used because the effect
of touching was to separate as holy the persons or things so touched
([Exo 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md); compare [Lev
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018).md). The priests wore the
distinctive dress, only while performing in the temple strictly
sacrificial services.

The holy chambers; see [Eze 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001.md) ff.

[Eze 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#022.md)

Restrictions and exceptions intended to mark the holiness of the office
of a priest, imposing on him additional (compare the marginal reference)
obligations to purity, and communicating it in some degree to his wife.
In the Christian Church all the members are "priests" [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md); [Rev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006.md). Hence, the directions for
maintaining the holiness of the "priesthood" in the new order, represent
the necessity for holiness in all Christians, and the exclusion of the
"uncircumcised in heart and in flesh" is equivalent to the exclusion of
"all that defileth" from the New Jerusalem [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md).

[Eze 44:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#024.md)

There was in Herod's Temple a council of priests, whose special duty it
was to regulate every thing connected with the sanctuary. They did not
ordinarily busy themselves with criminal questions, although they took a
leading part in the condemnation of Jesus [Mar
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001.md).

[Eze 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md)

It shall be unto them - The remains of the sacrifices were a chief
source of the priests' support. The burnt-offerings being entirely
consumed, the priests had the skins, which yielded a considerable
revenue; meat-offerings and drink-offerings belonged entirely to them.
sin-offerings and trepass-offerings, except in particular cases, also
belonged to the priests and were partaken of in the temple. Of the
peace-offerings a portion dedicated to the Lord by waving was left for
the priests, and the rest eaten by the officers and their friends,
either in the courts of the temple, or at least within Jerusalem. The
kitchen-courts (K, Plan II Ezek. [Eze
46:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#021).md), were provided in order to
prepare these public meals.

[Eze 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md)

Oblation - Offering, margin "heave-offering" (see [Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md); [Exo
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002.md); [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027); Notes and Pref. to Leviticus.md).
