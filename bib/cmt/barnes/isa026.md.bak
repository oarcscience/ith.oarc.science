### [Isaiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 26:0</span></span>

For the general scope and design of this chapter, see the remarks at the
commencement of Isa. 24 and [Isa
25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md). It is a song of praise
supposed to be sung by the Jews on their return to their own land, and
in the re-establishment of the government of God with the ordinances of
worship on Mount Zion. It was usual, as has been already remarked, to
celebrate any great event with a song of praise, and the prophet
supposes that the recovered Jews would thus be disposed to celebrate the
goodness of Yahweh in again restoring them to their own land, and to the
privileges of their own temple service. There are some indications that
this was designed to be sung with a chorus, and with alternate
responses, as many of the Psalms were. The ode opens with a view of
Jerusalem as a strong city, in which they might find protection under
the guardianship of God [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md).
Then there is a response, or a call, that the gates of the strong city
should be open to receive the returning nation [Isa
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002.md).

This is followed by a declaration of the safety of trusting in Yahweh,
and a call on all to confide in him [Isa
26:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md). The reason of this is stated
[Isa 26:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md), that Yahweh humbled the
proud, and guarded the ways of the just. The confidence of the Jews in
Yahweh is next described [Isa 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md),
[Isa 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md); and this is followed by a
declaration [Isa 26:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md) that the
wicked would not recognize the hand of God; and by an assertion that all
their deliverance had been performed by God [Isa
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md). This is succeeded by an
acknowledgment that they had submitted to other lords than Yahweh; but
that now they would submit to him alone [Isa
26:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md). The declaration succeeds
that God had enlarged their nation [Isa
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015.md); and this is followed by a
description of their calamities, and their abortive efforts to save
themselves [Isa 26:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md). Many had
died in their captivity, yet there is now the assurance that they should
live again [Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); and a general
call on the people of God to enter into their chambers, and hide
themselves there until the indignation should be overpast [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md), with the assurance that Yahweh
would come forth to punish the oppressors for their iniquity [Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md). With this assurance the poem
closes.

[Isaiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 26:1</span></span>

In that day shall this song be sung - By the people of God, on their
restoration to their own land.

We have a strong city - Jerusalem. This does not mean that it was then
strongly fortified, but that God would guard it, and that thus it would
be strong. Jerusalem was easily capable of being strongly fortified [Psa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#002.md); but the idea here is, that
Yahweh would be a protector, and that this would constitute its
strength.

Salvation will God appoint for walls - That is, he will himself be the
defender of his people in the place of walls and bulwarks. A similar
expression occurs in [Isa 60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018.md) (see
also [Jer 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023.md), and [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md).

Bulwarks - This word means properly bastions, or ramparts. The original
means properly a pomoerium, or antemural defense; a space without the
wall of a city raised up like a small wall. The Syriac renders it, Bar
shuro, - 'Son of a wall,' meaning a small wall. It was usually a
breastwork, or heap of earth thrown up around the city, that constituted
an additional defense, so that if they were driven from that they could
retreat within the walls.

[Isaiah 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 26:2</span></span>

Open ye the gates - This is probably the language of a chorus responding
to the sentiment in [Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). The
captive people are returning; and this cry is made that the gates of the
city may be thrown open, and that they may be permitted to enter without
obstruction (compare [Psa 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md), [Psa
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009.md); [Psa
118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019).md).

That the righteous nation which keepeth the truth - Who, during their
long captivity and contact with pagan nations, have not apostatized from
the true religion, but have adhered firmly to the worship of the true
God. This was doubtless true of the great body of the captive Jews in
Babylon.

[Isaiah 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 26:3</span></span>

Thou wilt keep him - The following verses to [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md), contain moral and religious
reflections, and seem designed to indicate the resignation evinced by
the 'righteous nation' during their long afflictions. Their own feelings
they are here represented as uttering in the form of general truths to
be sources of consolation to others.

In perfect peace - Hebrew as in the Margin, 'Peace, peace;' the
repetition of the word denoting, as is usual in Hebrew, emphasis, and
here evidently meaning undisturbed, perfect peace. That is, the mind
that has confidence in God shall not be agitated by the trials to which
it shall be subject; by persecution, poverty, sickness, want, or
bereavement. The inhabitants of Judea had been borne to a far distant
land. They had been subjected to reproaches and to scorn [Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md); had been stripped of their
property and honor; and had been reduced to the condition of prisoners
and captives. Yet their confidence in God had not been shaken. They
still trusted in him; still believed that he could and would deliver
them. Their mind was, therefore, kept in entire peace. So it was with
the Redeemer when he was persecuted and maligned ([Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md); compare [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046).md). And so it has been with tens
of thousands of the confessors and martyrs, and of the persecuted and
afflicted people of God, who have been enabled to commit their cause to
him, and amidst the storms of persecution, and even in the prison and at
the stake, have been kept in perfect peace.

Whose mind is stayed on thee - Various interpretations have been given
of this passage, but our translation has probably hit upon the exact
sense. The word which is rendered 'mind' (יצר yētser) is derived from
יצר yâtsar to form, create, devise; and it properly denotes that which
is formed or made [Psa 103:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md); [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md), [Heb
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018.md). Then it denotes anything that is
formed by the mind - its thoughts, imaginations, devices [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Deu
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021.md). Here it may mean the thoughts
themselves, or the mind that forms the thoughts. Either interpretation
suits the connection, and will make sense. The expression, 'is stayed on
thee,' in the Hebrew does not express the idea that the mind is stayed
on God, though that is evidently implied. The Hebrew is simply, whose
mind is stayed, supported (סמוּך sâmûk); that is, evidently, supported
by God. There is no other support but that; and the connection requires
us to understand this of him.

[Isaiah 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 26:4</span></span>

Trust ye in the Lord for ever - The sense is, 'Let your confidence in
God on no occasion fail. Let no calamity, no adversity, no persecution,
no poverty, no trial of any kind, prevent your reposing entire
confidence in him.' This is spoken evidently in view of the fact stated
in the previous verse, that the mind that is stayed on him shall have
perfect peace.

For in the Lord Jehovah - 'This is one of the four places where our
translators have retained the original word Yahweh (compare [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md); [Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md) :18; the notes at [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002).md). The original is יהוה ביה beyâhh
yehovâh; the first word, יה yâhh, (compare [Psa
68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004).md), being merely an abridged form
of Yahweh. The same form occurs in [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md). The union of these two forms
seems designed to express, in the highest sense possible, the majesty,
glory, and holiness of God; to excite the highest possible reverence
where language fails of completely conveying the idea.

Is everlasting strength - Hebrew as in the Margin, 'The rock of ages;' a
more poetic and beautiful expression than in our translation. The idea
is, that God is firm and unchangeable like an eternal rock; and that in
him we may find protection and defense for everlasting ages (see [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), et al.; [Sa1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#002.md); [Sa2
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#032.md), [Sa2
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#047.md); [Sa2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003.md); [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md); [Psa
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md); [Psa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md); [Psa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md); [Psa
62:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002.md), [Psa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#006.md), ..., where God is called 'a
rock').

[Isaiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 26:5</span></span>

The lofty city, he layeth it low - The city of Babylon (see the note at
[Isa 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md); compare Isa. 13, note;
[Isa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001), note.md)

[Isaiah 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 26:6</span></span>

The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor - That is,
evidently, those who had been despised by them, and who had been
overcome and oppressed by them. The obvious reference here is to the
Jews who had been captives there. The idea is not necessarily that the
'poor' referred to here I would be among the conquerors, but that when
the Babylonians should be overcome, and their city destroyed, those who
were then oppressed should be in circumstances of comparative
prosperity. No doubt the Jews, who in subsequent times traveled to the
site of Babylon for purposes of traffic, would trample indignantly on
the remains of the city where their fathers were captives for seventy
years, and would exult in the idea that their own once down-trodden city
Jerusalem was in a condition of comparative prosperity. That there were
many Jews in Babylon after that city began to decline from its
haughtiness and grandeur, we learn expressly from both Philo and
Josephus. Thus Philo (De Legatione ad Caium, p. 792) says, that 'it is
known that Babylon and many other satraps were possessed by the Jews,
not only by rumour, but by experience.' So Josephus (Ant. xv. 2.) says,
that there were in the time of Hyrcanus many Jews at Babylon.

[Isaiah 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 26:7</span></span>

The way of the just is uprightness - The Hebrew is literally, 'The way
to the just is uprightness;' the word 'way' probably refers to God's
way, or his dealings with the righteous. The sentiment is, that his
dealings with them are just; that though they are afflicted and
oppressed, yet that his ways are right, and they will yet perceive it.
This is language supposed to be used by the captive Jews after they had
seen the proud city of Babylon taken, and after God had come forth to
restore them to their own land. The word 'uprightness' in the original
is in the plural number, but is often used in the sense of straightness
[Pro 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md); [Sol
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010.md); of sincerity, or uprightness
[Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); or of righteousness as a
judge [Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md); [Psa
99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004.md).

Thou most upright - Evidently an address to God, as being most just, and
as having now evinced his uprightness in the deliverance of his people.
The same epithet is applied to him in [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); [Psa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md); 92:16.

Dost weigh the path of the just - The word used here (פלס pâlac) may
mean to weigh as in a balance [Psa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md); but it may also mean, and does
usually, to make straight or smooth; to beat a path; to make level [Psa
78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md); [Pro
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md); [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md). Here it probably means, that God
had made the way smooth, or exactly level. He had removed all obstacles,
and had conducted his people in a plain and leveled way (see the notes
at [Isa 40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 26:8</span></span>

Yea, in the way of thy judgements - The word 'judgments' often refers to
the statutes or laws of God. But it may also refer to the afflictions
and trials with which he visits or judges people; the punishments which
they endure for their sins. In which sense the word is used here it is
not easy to determine. Lowth understands it of the 'laws' of Yahweh. So
Kimchi, who says that the sense is, that during their captivity and
trials, they had not remitted anything of their love and piety toward
God. I am inclined to the belief that this is the true interpretation,
because in the corresponding member of the parallelism they are
represented as saying that the desire of their soul was to God, and to
the remembrance of him, implying that they sought by an observance of
his laws to please him, and to secure his favor.

The desire of our soul is to thy name - The word 'name' is used here, as
it is often, to denote God himself. They desired that he would come and
deliver them; they earnestly wished that he would manifest himself to
them as their friend.

And to the remembrance of thee - The word 'remembrance' (זכר zēker) is
often equivalent to name, appellation, or that by which anyone is
remembered, or known. Thus [Exo 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md) :

This is my name for ever;

And this is my memorial זכרי zikeriy unto all generations.

So [Psa 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md) :

Sing unto Yahweh, O ye saints of his;

And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness;

That is, at his holy memorial (Margin,) or name. In the place before us
it seems to be used in the sense of name or appellation; that is, that
by which God would be remembered or known.

[Isaiah 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 26:9</span></span>

With my soul ... in the night - By desiring God in the night, and by
seeking him early, is meant that the desire to seek him was unremitted
and constant. The prophet speaks of the pious Jews who were in captivity
in Babylon; and says that it was the object of their unremitted anxiety
to please God, and to do his will.

For when thy judgments are in the earth - This is given as a reason for
what had just been said, that in their calamity they had sought God
without ceasing. The reason is, that the punishments which he inflicted
were intended to lead people to learn righteousness. The sentiment is
expressed in a general form, though there is no doubt that the immediate
reference is to the calamities which the Jews had suffered in their
removal to Babylon as a punishment for their sins.

Learn righteousness - The design is to warn, to restrain, and to reform
them. The immediate reference here was undoubtedly to the Jews, in whom
this effect was seen in a remarkable manner in their captivity in
Babylon. But it is also true of other nations; and though the effect of
calamity is not always to turn a people to God, or to make them
permanently righteous, yet it restrains them, and leads them at least to
an external reformation, It is also true in regard to nations as well as
individuals, that they make a more decided advance in virtue and piety
in days of affliction than in the time of great external prosperity
(compare [Deu 6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 26:10</span></span>

Let favor be showed to the wicked - This is designed as an illustration
of the sentiment in the previous verse - that judgments were needful in
order that wicked people might be brought to the ways of righteousness.
The truth is general, that though wicked people are favored with success
in their enterprises, yet the effect will not be to lead them to the
ways of virtue and religion. How often is this illustrated in the
conduct of wicked people! How often do they show, when rolling in
wealth, or when surrounded with the comforts of the domestic circle,
that they feel no need of the friendship of God, and that their heart
has no response of gratitude to make for all his mercies! Hence, the
necessity, according to the language of the song before us, that God
should take away their property, remove their friends, or destroy their
health, in order that they may be brought to honor him. To do this, is
benevolence in God, for whatever is needful to bring the sinner to the
love of God and to the ways of virtue, is kindness to his soul.

In the land of uprightness - Even when others are just and pious around
him; when this is so much the general characteristic that it may be
called 'the land of integrity,' yet he will pursue his way of iniquity,
though in it he may be solitary. Such is his love of sin, that neither
the favor of God nor the general piety around him - neither the mercy of
his Maker nor the influence of holy examples, will lead him in the way
of piety and truth.

Will not behold the majesty of the Lord - Will not see that which makes
the Lord glorious in his dealings with people, so as to love and adore
him. He is blind, and sees no evidence of loveliness in the character of
God.

[Isaiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 26:11</span></span>

Lord, when thy hand is lifted up - This is an explanation of the
sentiment expressed in the former verse. The lifting up of the hand here
refers, doubtless, to the manifestations of the majesty and goodness of
the Lord.

They will not see - They are blind to all the exhibitions of power,
mercy, and goodness.

But they shall see - They shall yet be brought to recognize thy hand.
They shall see thy favor toward thy children, and thy judgment on thy
foes. The divine dealings will be such that they shall be constrained to
recognize him, and to acknowledge his existence and perfections.

And be ashamed - Be confounded because they did not sooner recognize the
divine goodness.

For their envy at thy people - The word 'their' is not in the Hebrew,
and the sense is, that they shall see the zeal of Yahweh in behalf of
his people, and shall be ashamed that they did not sooner recognize his
hand. The word rendered 'envy' (קנאה qin'âh) may mean envy [Ecc
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md); [Ecc
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006.md), but it more properly and
frequently means zeal, ardor, [Kg2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#016.md); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

Yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them - Or rather, 'Yea, the
fire in regard to thy enemies shall devour them.' The sense is, that
when his people were delivered, his foes would be destroyed; his zeal
for his people would also be connected with indignation against his
foes. The deliverance of his people from Babylon, and the commencement
of the downfall of that city, were simultaneous, and the cause was the
same.

[Isaiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 26:12</span></span>

Thou wilt ordain peace - The word 'peace' here seems to stand opposed to
the evils of various kinds which they had experienced in the captivity
at Babylon; and to refer net only to peace, but also to prosperity, and
to the continued divine favor.

For thou hast wrought all our works in us - Or rather, 'for us' (לנוּ
lânû). It is owing to thy hand that we are saved.

[Isaiah 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 26:13</span></span>

Other lords beside thee have had dominion - The allusion here is to the
kings of Babylon who had subdued and oppressed them, and who in their
long captivity had held them in subjection to their laws.

But by thee only will we make mention of thy name - This may be better
rendered, 'but only thee, thy name will we henceforward commemorate.'
The words 'by thee,' and 'thy name,' are put in apposition, and denote
the same thing. The word 'make mention' (נזכיר nazekiyr) means literally
to cause to be remembered; to commemorate; to celebrate. The idea is,
that during their long captivity they had been subject to the dominion
of other lords than Yahweh; but now that they were restored to their own
land, they would acknowledge only Yahweh as their Lord, and would
henceforward celebrate only his name.

[Isaiah 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 26:14</span></span>

They are dead - That is, the kings and tyrants to whom reference is made
in [Isa 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md). The principal enemies
of the Jews, who had oppressed them, were slain when Babylon was taken
by Cyrus (see the notes at Isa. 13; 14)

They shall not live - They shall not again live, and be permitted to
harass and enslave us.

They are deceased - Hebrew, רפאים repâ'iym - a name given to the shades
or manes of the dead, from an idea that they were weak and powerless
(see the notes at [Isa 14:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md);
compare [Psa 88:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#011.md); [Pro
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018.md); [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018.md); [Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016).md). The sense here is, that they
had died and gone to the land of shades, and were now unable anymore to
reach or injure the people of God.

Therefore - Or rather, "for"; the word לכן lākên being used evidently in
the sense of because that, as in [Gen
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026.md); [Num
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md); [Num
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md); [Psa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md). The declaration that follows is
given as the reason why they were dead, and incapable of again injuring
or annoying them.

Hast thou visited ... - (see the note at [Isa
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022).md) The word 'visit' here is used
in the sense of to punish.

And made all their memory to perish - Hast blotted out their name; hast
caused their celebrity to cease.

[Isaiah 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 26:15</span></span>

Thou hast increased the nation - That is, the Jewish nation (see the
note at [Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md). The nation was not
only enlarged by its regular increase of population, but many converts
attended them on their return from Babylon, and probably many came in
from surrounding nations on the rebuilding of their capital.

Thou hadst removed it far ... - Or rather, thou hast extended far all
the borders of the land. The word rendered 'removed' (רחק râchaq) means
usually to put far away, and here it may mean to put far away the
borders or boundaries of the nation; that is, to extend them far. The
word 'unto' is not in the original; and the phrase rendered 'ends of the
earth,' may mean the borders. or boundaries of the land. The parallelism
requires this construction, and it is indeed the obvious one, and has
been adopted by Lowth and Noyes.

[Isaiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 26:16</span></span>

Poured out a prayer - Margin, 'Secret speech.' The Hebrew word לחשׁ
lachash means properly a whispering, muttering; and thru a sighing, a
calling for help. This is the sense here. In their calamity they sighed,
and called on God for help.

Like as a woman with child ... - This verse is designed to state their
griefs and sorrows during the time of their oppression in Babylon. The
comparison used here is one that is very frequent in the sacred writings
to represent any great suffering (see [Psa
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md); [Jer

[Isaiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 26:18</span></span>

We have been ... - This refers to sorrows and calamities which they had
experienced in former times, when they had made great efforts for
deliverance, and when those efforts had proved abortive. Perhaps it
refers to the efforts of this kind which they had made during their
painful captivity of seventy years. There is no direct proof indeed,
that during that time they attempted to revolt, or that they organized
themselves for resistance to the Babylonian power; but there can be no
doubt that they earnestly desired deliverance, and that their condition
was one of extreme pain and anguish - a condition that is strikingly
represented here by the pains of childbirth. Nay, it is not improbable
that during that long period there may have been abortive efforts made
at deliverance, and that here they refer to those efforts as having
accomplished nothing.

We have as it were brought forth wind - Our efforts have availed
nothing. Michaelis, as quoted by Lowth, explains this figure in the
following manner: 'Rariorem morbum describi, empneumatosin, aut ventosam
molam dictum; quo quae laborant diu et sibi, et peritis medicis gravidae
videntur, tandemque post omnes verae gravitatis molestias et labores
ventum ex utero emittant; quem morbum passim describunt medici.'
(Syntagma Comment. vol. ii. p. 165.) Grotius thinks that the reference
is to birds, 'Quae edunt ova subventanea,' and refers to Pliny x. 58.
But the correct reference is, doubtless, that which is mentioned by
Michaelis.

Neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen - We had no power to
subdue them; and notwithstanding all our exertions their dominion was
unbroken. This refers to the Babylonians who had dominion over the
captive Jews.

[Isaiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 26:19</span></span>

Thy dead men shall live - Very various interpretations have been given
of this verse, which may be seen at length by comparing Vitringa,
Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and Poole's Synopsis. In [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md), the chorus is represented as
saying of the dead men and tyrants of Babylon that had oppressed the
captive Jews, that they should not rise, and should no more oppress the
people of God. In contradistinction from this fate of their enemies, the
choir is here introduced as addressing Yahweh (compare [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016).md), and saying 'thy dead shall
live;' that is, thy people shall live again shall be restored to to
vigor, and strength, and enjoyment. They had been dead; that is, civilly
dead in Babylon; they were cut off from their privileges, torn away from
their homes, made captives in a foreign land. Their king had been
dethroned; their temple demolished; their princes, priests, and people
made captive; their name blotted from the list of nations; and to all
intents and purposes, as a people, they were deceased. This figure is
one that is common, by which the loss of privileges and enjoyments, and
especially of civil rights, is represented as death. So we speak now of
a man's being dead in law; dead to his country; spiritually dead; dead
in sins. I do not understand this, therefore, as referring primarily to
the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead; but to the captives in
Babylon, who were civilly dead, and cut off by their oppressors from
their rights and enjoyments as a nation.

Shall live - Shall be restored to their country. and be reinstated in
all their rights and immunities as a people among the nations of the
earth. This restoration shall be as striking as would be the
resurrection of the dead front their graves. Though, therefore, this
does not refer primarily to the resurrection of the dead, yet the
illustration is drawn from that doctrine, and implies that that doctrine
was one with which they were familiar. An image which is employed for
the sake of illustration must be one that is familiar to the mind, and
the reference here to this doctrine is a demonstration that the doctrine
of the resurrection was well known.

Together with my dead body shall they arise - The words 'together with'
are not in the original. The words rendered 'my dead body' (נבלתי
nebēlâthiy) literally means, 'my dead body,' and may be applied to a
man, or to a beast [Lev 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md); [Lev
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024.md). It is also applied to the dead
in general; to the deceased; to carcasses, or dead bodies (see [Lev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011.md); [Psa
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md); [Jer
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033.md); [Jer
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md); [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md); [Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023.md); [Jer
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020).md). It may, therefore, be
rendered, 'My deceased, my dead;' and will thus be parallel with the
phrase 'thy dead men,' and is used with reference to the same species of
resurrection. It is not the language of the prophet Isaiah, as if he
referred to his own body when it should be dead, but it is the language
of the choir that sings and speaks in the name of the Jewish people.
"That people" is thus introduced as saying "my" dead, that is, "our"
dead, shall rise. Not only in the address to Yahweh is this sentiment
uttered when it is said 'thy dead shall rise,' but when the attention is
turned to themselves as a people, they say 'our dead shall rise;' those
that pertain to our nation shall rise from the dust, and be restored to
their own privileges and land.

Awake and sing - In view of the cheering and consolatory fact just
stated that the dead shall rise, the chorus calls on the people to awake
and rejoice. This is an address made directly to the dejected and
oppressed people, as if the choir were with them.

Ye that dwell in dust - To sit in dust, or to dwell in the dust, is
emblematic of a state of dejection, want, oppression, or poverty [Psa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025.md); [Psa
119:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#025.md); [Isa
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md); [Isa
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md); [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md). Here it is supposed to be
addressed to the captives in Babylon, as oppressed, enslaved, dejected.
The "language" is derived from the doctrine of the resurrection of the
body, and proves that that doctrine was understood and believed; the
sense is, that those wire were thus dejected and humbled should be
restored to their former elevated privileges.

For thy dew - This is evidently an address to Yahweh. "His" dew is that
which he sends down from heaven, and which is under his direction and
control. Dew is the emblem of that which refreshes and vivifies. In
countries where it rains but seldom, as it does in the East, the copious
dews at night supply in some sense the want of rain. "Thence dew" is
used in Scripture as an emblem of the graces and influences of the
Spirit of God by which his people are cheered and comforted, as the
parched earth and the withered herbs are refreshed by the copious dews
at night. Thus in [Hos 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005.md) :

I will be as the dew unto Israel;

He shall grow as the lily,

And cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

The prophet here speaks of the captivity in Babylon. Their state is
represented as a state of death - illustrated by the parched earth, and
the decayed and withered herbs. But his grace and favor would visit
them, and they would be revived.

As the dew of herbs - As the dew that falls on herbs. This phrase has,
however, been rendered very variously. The Vulgate renders it, 'Thy dew
is as the dew of light.' The Septuagint: 'Thy dew shall be healing (ἴαμα
iama) unto them.' The Chaldee, 'Thy dew shall be the dew of light.' But
the most correct and consistent translation is undoubtedly that which
renders the word אורת 'ôroth, herbs or vegetables (compare [Kg2
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#019).md).

And the earth shall cast out the dead - This is language which is
derived from the doctrine of the resurrection of the body; and shows
also that that doctrine was understood by the Hebrews in the time of
Isaiah. The sense is, that as the earth shall cast forth its dead in the
resurrection, so the people of God in Babylon should be restored to
life, and to their former privileges in their own land.

[Isaiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 26:20</span></span>

Come, my people - This is an epilogue (Rosenmuller), in which the choir
addresses the people, and entreats them to be tranquil during that
convulsion by which their oppressors would be punished, and the way made
for their deliverance. The image is taken from seeking a shelter when a
storm rages, until its fury is spent. The address is to the captive Jews
in Babylon. The tempest that would rage would be the wars and commotions
by which Babylon was to be overthrown. While that storm raged, they were
exhorted to be calm and serene.

Enter thou into thy chambers - Into places of retirement, where the
storm of indignation on your enemies shall not reach or affect you.

Hide thyself as it were ... - Do not mingle in the scenes of battle,
lest you should partake of the general calamity.

For a little moment - Implying that the war would not rage long. Babylon
was taken in a single night (see the notes at Isa. 13; 14), and the call
here is for the people of God to be calm while this battle should rage
in which the city should be taken.

Until the indignation ... - Not, as Lowth supposes, the indignation of
God against his people, but the storm of his indignation against their
enemies the Babylonians. That would be soon 'overpast,' the city would
be taken, the storms of war would cease to rage, and then they would be
delivered, and might safely return to their own land.

[Isaiah 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 26:21</span></span>

For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place - That is, from heaven,
which is the dwelling-place or residence of God [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md); [Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md). When God executes vengeance, he
is represented as coming from his abode, his dwelling-place, his
capitol, as a monarch goes forth to war to destroy his foes.

To punish the inhabitants of the earth - The land of Chaldea, or of
Babylon.

The earth also shall disclose her blood - Blood, in the Scriptures,
often denotes "guilt." The sense here is, that the land of Chaldea would
reveal its guilt; that is, the punishment which God would inflict would
be a revelation of the crimes of the nation. There is a resemblance here
to the language which was used respecting the blood of Abel, [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md) : 'The voice of thy brother's
blood (Hebrew as here, "bloods") crieth unto me from the ground.

And shall no more cover her slain - Shall no more be able to conceal its
guilt in slaying the people of God. By these hopes, the Jews were to be
comforted in their calamity; and no doubt this song was penned by Isaiah
long before that captivity, in order that, in the midst of their
protracted and severe trials, they might be consoled with the hope of
deliverance, and might know what to do when the storms of war should
rage around the place of their captivity, and when the proud city was to
fall. They were not to mingle in the strife; were to take no part with
either their foes or their deliverers; but were to be calm, gentle,
peaceful, and to remember that all this was to effect their deliverance.
Compare [Exo 14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md) : 'Fear ye not,
stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh; Yahweh shall fight for
you, and ye shall hold your peace.' There are times when the children of
God should look calmly on the conflicts of the people of this world.
They should mingle with neither party, for they should remember that
Yahweh presides over these agitations, and that their ultimate end is to
bring deliverance to his church, and to advance the interests of his
kingdom on the earth. Then they should be mild, gentle, prayerful; and
should look up to God to make all these agitations and strifes the means
of advancing the interests of his kingdom.
