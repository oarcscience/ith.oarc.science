### [Micah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 6:0</span></span>

The foregoing prophecy closed with the final cleansing of the Church and
the wrath of God resting on the wicked, when, as Paul saith, "The Lord
Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming
fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
power; when He shall come to be glorified in His Saints, and to be
admired in all them that believe" [Th2
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md). The prophet here begins his
third and last summons to judgment, in the Name, as it were, of the
All-Holy Trinity, against whom they had sinned.

[Micah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 6:1</span></span>

Hear ye now what the Lord saith - If ye will not hear the rebuke of man,
hear now at last the word of God. "Arise thou, Micah." The prophet was
not willing to be the herald of woe to his people; but had to arise at
the bidding of God, that he might not "be rebellious like that
rebellious house" [Eze 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md). Stand up;
as one having all authority to rebuke, and daunted by none. He muses the
hearer, as shewing it to be a very grave urgent matter, to be done
promptly, urgently, without delay. "Contend thou before (better, as in
the English margin with) the mountains." Since man, who had reason,
would not use his reason, God calls the mountains and hills, who [Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md) unwillingly, as it were, had been
the scenes of their idolatry, as if he would say (Lap.), "Insensate
though ye be, ye are more sensible than Israel, whom I endowed with
sense; for ye feel the voice and command of God your Creator and obey
Him; they do not. I cite you, to represent your guilty inhabitants,
that, through you, they may hear My complaint to be just, and own
themselves guilty, repent, and ask forgiveness." "The altars and idols,
the blood of the sacrifices, the bones and ashes upon them, with
unuttered yet clear voice, spoke of the idolatry and guilt of the Jews,
and so pronounced God's charge and expostulation to be just. Ezekiel is
bidden, in like way, to prophesy against "the mountains of Israel [Eze
6:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002.md), "I will bring a sword upon you,
and I will destroy your high places, and your altars shall be desolate."
: "Lifeless nature without voice tells the glory of God; without ears it
hears what the Lord speaks." [Psa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md); [Luk
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040.md).

[Micah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 6:2</span></span>

Hear, ye strong (or, it may be, ye enduring,) foundations of the earth -
Mountains and rocks carry the soul to times far away, before and after.
They change net, like the habitable, cultivated, surface of the earth.
There they were, before the existence of our short-lived generations;
there they will be, until time shall cease to be. They have witnessed so
many vicissitudes of human things, themselves unchanging. The prophet is
directed to seize this feeling of simple nature. "They have seen so much
before me," Yes! "then they have seen all which befell my forefathers;
all God's benefits, all along, to them and to us, all their and our
unthankfulness."

He will plead with Israel - God hath a strict severe judgment with His
people, and yet vouchsafes to clear Himself before His creatures, to
come down from His throne of glory and place Himself on equal terms with
them. He does not plead only, but mutually (such is the force of the
word) impleads with His people, hears if they would say aught against
Himself, and then gives His own judgment . But this willingness to hear,
only makes us condemn ourselves, so that we should be without excuse
before Him. We do owe ourselves wholly to Him who made us and hath given
us all things richly to enjoy.

If we have withdrawn ourselves from His Service, unless He dealt hardly
with us, we dealt rebelliously and ungratefully with Him. God brings all
pleas into a narrow space. The fault is with Him or with us. He offers
to clear Himself. He sets before us His good deeds, His Loving kindness,
Providence, Grace, Long-suffering, Bounty, Truth, and contrasts with
them our evil deeds, our unthankfulness, despitefulness, our breach of
His laws, and disorderings of His creation. And then, in the face of His
Goodness, He asks, "What evil have I done, what good have I left
undone?" so that our evil and negligences should be but a requital of
His. For if it is evil to return evil for evil, or not to return good
for good, what evil is it to return evil for His exceeding good! As He
says by Isaiah, "What could have been done more to My vineyard and I
have not done in it. Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth
grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?" [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md).

And our Blessed Lord asks; "Many good works have I shewed you from My
Father. For which of those works do ye stone Me?" [Joh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md). "Which of you convinceth Me of
sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe Me?" [Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046.md). Away from the light of God, we
may plead excuses, and cast the blame of our sins upon our temptations,
or passions, or nature, that is, on Almighty God Himself, who made us.
When His light streams in upon our conscience, we are silent. Blessed if
we be silenced and confess to Him then, that we be not first silenced in
the Day of Judgment [Job 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008.md); [Job
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#003.md); [Eze
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020.md). Righteous Job said, "I desire
to reason with God" [Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md); but
when his eye saw Him, he said, "wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in
dust and ashes" [Job 42:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md).

[Micah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 6:3</span></span>

O My people - This one tender word, twice repeated , contains in one a
whole volume of reproof. It sets before the eyes God's choice of them of
His free grace, and the whole history of His loving-kindness, if so they
could be ashamed of their thanklessness and turn to Him. "Mine," He
says, "ye are by creation, by Providence, by great deliverances and by
hourly love and guardianship, by gifts of nature, the world, and grace;
such things have I done for thee; what against thee? 'what evil have I
done unto thee?'" "Thy foot did not swell these forty years" [Deu
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md), for He upbears in all ways where
He leads. Wherein have I wearied thee? for "His commandments are not
grievious" [Jo1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md). Thou hast been
weary of Me, O Israel, God says by Isaiah, "I have not wearied thee with
incense; thou hast wearied Me with thine iniquities" [Isa
43:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md).

[Micah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 6:4</span></span>

For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of
the hoarse of servants - What wert thou? What art thou? Who made thee
what thou art? God reminds them. They were slaves; they are His people
in the heritage of the pagan, and that by His outstretched arm. God
mentions some heads of the mercies which tie had shown them, when He had
made them His people, His redemption of them from Egypt, His guidance
through the wilderness, His leading them over the last difficulty to the
proraised land. The use of the familiar language of the Pentateuch is
like the touching of so many key-notes, recalling the whole harmony of
His love. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam together, are Lawgiver, to deliver
and instruct; Priest, to atone; and prophetess [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md) to praise God; and the name of
Miriam at once recalled the mighty works at the Red Sea and how they
then thanked God.

[Micah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 6:5</span></span>

Remember now - The word translated now is a very tender one, like our
"do now remember" or "do remember," beseeching instead of commanding.
Dionysius: "I might command, but I speak tenderly, that I may lead thee
to own the truth." "What Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam
the son of Beor answered him." God did not only raise up Moses, Aaron,
Miriam, out of their brethren, but He turned the curse of the alien
Balaam into a blessing; and that, not for their righteousness, (for even
then they were rebellious,) but against their deserts, out of His own
truth and righteousness. Not that the curse of Balaam could in itself
have hurt them; but, in proportion to his reputation, it would have
infused great energy into their enemies: and its reversal must have
struck a great panic into them and into others. Human might having
failed in Sihon and Og, Balak sought superhuman. God showed them by
their own diviner, that it was against them. Even after they had seduced
Israel, through Balaam's devilish counsel, Midian seems to have been
stricken by God with panic, and not to have struck a blow [Num
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049.md).

From Shittim unto Gilgal - The words are separated by the Hebrew accent
from what went before. It is then probably said in concise energy for,
"Remember too front Shittim to Gilgal," that is, all the great works of
God "from Shittim" , the last encampment of Israel out of the promised
land, where they so sinned in Baal-peor, "unto Gilgal," the first in the
promised land, which they entered by miracle, where the Ark rested amid
the victories given them, where the Covenant was renewed, and "the
reproach of Egypt was rolled away" [Jos
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md). Remember all, from your own deep
sin and rebellion to the deep mercy of God.

That ye may know the righteousness - (righteousnesses) of the Lord His
Faithfulness in performing His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
God speaketh of His promises, not as what they were in themselves, mere
mercy, but as what they became, through that gracious and free promise,
righteousness, in that He had bound Himself to fulfill what He had, out
of mere grace, promised. So in the New Testament He saith, "God is not
unrighteous that He should forget your works and labor which proeeedeth
of love" [Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md); and, "He is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins" [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md). Micah speaks, by a rare idiom, of
the righteousnesses of the Lord, each act of mercy being a separate
effluence of His Righteousness. The very names of the places suggest the
righteous acts of God, the unrighteous of Israel. : "But we too, who
desire with unveiled face to behold the glory of the Lord, and have
Abraham really for our father, let us, when we have sinned, hear God
pleading against us, and reproving us for the multitude of His benefits.
For we too once served Pharaoh and the people of Egypt, laboring in
works of mire and clay; and He redeemed us who gave Himself a Redemption
for all; that we, the redeemed of the Lord, "whom He redeemed out of the
hand of the enemy and gathered from the lands, might say, His mercy
endureth forever" [Psa 107:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md). He
sent also before our face Moses, the spiritual Law, and Aaron the High
Priest, not bearing the typical Ephod and Urim, but having in His
Forehead the seal of holiness which God the Father sealed; and Miriam,
the foreshewing of prophets. Recollect we too what he thought against us
who willed to devour us, the true Balak, Satan, who laid snares for us
through Balaam, the destroyer of the people, fearing lest we should
cover his land and occupy it, withdrawing the earthly-minded from his
empire."

[Micah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 6:6</span></span>

Wherewith shall I come before the Lord? - The people, thus arraigned,
bursts in, as men do, with professions that they would be no more
ungrateful; that they will do anything, everything - but what they
ought. With them it shall be but "Ask and have." They wish only to know,
with what they shall come? They would be beforehand with Him,
anticipating His wishes; they would, with all the submission of a
creature, bow, prostrate themselves before God; they acknowledge His
High Majesty, who dwelleth on high, the most High God, and would abase
themselves before His lofty greatness, if they but knew, "how" or
"wherewith."

They would give of their best; sacrifices the choicest of their kind,
which should be wholly His, whole-burnt-offerings, offered exactly
according to the law, "bullocks of a year old" [Lev
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002.md); then too, the next choice
offering, the rams; and these, as they were offered for the whole people
on very solemn occasions, in vast multitudes, thousands or ten thousands
; the oil which accompanied the burnt sacrifice, should flow in rivers ;
nay, more still; they would not withhold their sons, their first born
sons, from God, part, as they were, of themselves, or any fruit of their
own body.

They enhance the offering by naming the tender relation to themselves
[Deu 28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md). They would offer
everything, (even what God forbade) excepting only what alone He asked
for, their heart, its love and its obedience . The form of their offer
contains this; they ask zealously, "with what shall I come." It is an
outward offering only, a thing which they would bring. Hypocritical
eagerness! a sin against light. For to enquire further, when God has
already revealed anything, is to deny that He has revealed it. It comes
from the wish that He had not revealed what lie has revealed. : "whose,
after he hath found the truth, discusseth anything further, seeketh a
lie." God had told them, long before, from the time that He made them
His people, what he desired of them; So Micah answers,

[Micah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 6:8</span></span>

He hath shewed thee - Micah does not tell them now, as for the first
time; which would have excused them. He says, "He hath shewed thee;" He,
about whose mind and will and pleasure they were pretending to enquire,
the Lord their God. He had shewn it to them. The law was full of it. He
shewed it to them, when He said, "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord
thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all
His ways, and to love Him and to serve the Lord, thy God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of the Lord and
His statutes which I command thee this day for thy good?" [Deu
10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md). They had asked, "with what
outward thing shall I come before the Lord;" the prophet tells them,
"what thing is good," the inward man of the heart, righteousness, love,
humility.

And what doth the Lord require (search, seek) of thee? - The very word
implies an earnest search within. He would say (Rup.), "Trouble not
thyself as to any of these things, burnt-offerings, rams, calves,
without thee. For God seeketh not thine, but thee; not thy substance,
but thy spirit; not ram or goat, but thy heart." : "Thou askest, what
thou shouldest offer for thee? Other thyself. For what else doth the
Lord seek of thee, but thee? Because, of all earthly creatures, He hath
made nothing better than thee, He seeketh thyself from thyself, because
thou hadst lost thyself."

To do judgment - are chiefly all acts of equity; "to love mercy," all
deeds of love. Judgment, is what right requires; mercy, what love. Yet,
secondarily, "to do judgment" is to pass righteous judgments in all
cases; and so, as to others, "judge not according to the appearance, but
judge righteous judgment" [Joh 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md);
and as to one's self also. Judge equitably and kindly of others, humbly
of thyself. : "Judge of thyself in thyself without acceptance of thine
own person, so as not to spare thy sins, nor take pleasure in them,
because thou hast done them. Neither praise thyself in what is good in
thee, nor accuse God in what is evil in thee. For this is wrong
judgment, and so, not judgment at all. This thou didst, being evil;
reverse it, and it will be right. Praise God in what is good in thee;
accuse thyself in what is evil. So shalt thou anticipate the judgment of
God, as He saith, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged
of the Lord" [Co1 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md). He addeth,
love mercy; being merciful, out of love, "not of necessity, for God
loveth a cheerful giver" [Co2 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md).
These acts together contain the whole duty to man, corresponding with
and formed upon the mercy and justice of God [Psa
101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md); [Psa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007.md). All which is due, anyhow or in
any way, is of judgment; all which is free toward man, although not free
toward God, is of mercy. There remains, walk humbly with thy God; not,
bow thyself only before Him, as they had offered [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), nor again walk with Him only, as
did Enoch, Noah Abraham, Job; but walk humbly (literally, bow down the
going) yet still with thy God; never lifting up thyself, never sleeping,
never standing still, but ever walking on, yet ever casting thyself
down; and the more thou goest on in grace, the more cast thyself down;
as our Lord saith, "When ye have done all these things which are
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that
which was our duty to do" [Luk 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md).

It is not a "crouching before God" displeased, (such as they had thought
of,) but the humble love of the forgiven; "walk humbly," as the creature
with the Creator, but in love, with thine own God. Humble thyself with
God, who humbled himself in the flesh: walk on with Him, who is thy Way.
Neither humility nor obedience alone would be true graces; but to cleave
fast to God, because He is thine All, and to bow thyself down, because
thou art nothing, and thine All is He and of Him. It is altogether a
Gospel-precept; bidding us, "Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in
Heaven is perfect" [Mat 5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md); "Be
merciful, as your Father also is merciful;" [Luk
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036.md); and yet, in the end, have "that
same mind which was also in Christ Jesus, who made Himself of no
reputation" [Phi 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md), [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md).

The offers of the people, stated in the bare nakedness in which Micah
exhibits them, have a character of irony. But it is the irony of the
truth and of the fact itself. The creature has nothing of its own to
offer; "the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin" [Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md); and the offerings, as they rise
in value, become, not useless only but, sinful. Such offerings would
bring down anger, not mercy. Micah's words then are, for their
vividness, an almost proverbial expression of the nothingness of all
which we sinners could offer to God. : "We, who are of the people of
God, knowing that "in His sight shall no man living be justified" [Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md), and saying, "I am a beast with
Thee" [Psa 73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022.md), trust in no pleas
before His judgment-seat, but pray; yet we put no trust in our very
prayers. For there is nothing worthy to be offered to God for sin, anal
no humility can wash away the stains of offences.

In penitence for our sins, we hesitate and say, Wherewith shall I come
before the Lord? how shall I come, so as to be admitted into familiar
intercourse with my God? One and the same spirit revolveth these things
in each of us or of those before us, who have been pricked to
repentance, 'what worthy offering can I make to the Lord?' This and the
like we revolve, as the Apostle saith; "We know not what to pray for as
we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with
groanings which cannot be uttered" [Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md). "Should I offer myself wholly as
a burnt-offering to Him?' If, understanding spiritually all the
Levitical sacrifices, I should present them in myself, and offer my
first-born, that is, what is chief in me, my soul, I should find nothing
worthy of His greatness. Neither in ourselves, nor in ought earthtly,
can we find anything worthy to be offered to reconcile us with God. For
the sin of the soul, blood alone is worthy to be offered; not the blood
of calves, or rams, or goats, but our own; yet our own too is not
offered, but given back, being due already [Psa
116:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008.md). The Blood of Christ alone
sufficeth to do away all sin." Dionysius: "The whole is said, in order
to instruct us, that, without the shedding of the Blood of Christ and
its Virtue and Merits, we cannot please God, though we offered ourselves
and all that we have, within and without; and also, that so great are
the benefits bestowed upon us by the love of Christ, that we can repay
nothing of them."

But then it is clear that there is no teaching in this passage in Micah
which there is not in the law . The developments in the prophets relate
to the Person and character of the Redeemer. The law too contained both
elements:

\(1\) the ritual of sacrifice, impressing on the Jew the need of an
Atoner;

\(2\) the moral law, and the graces inculcated in it, obedience, love of
God and man, justice, mercy, humility, and the rest.

There was no hint in the law, that half was acceptable to God instead of
the whole; that sacrifice of animals would supersede self-sacrifice or
obedience. There was nothing on which the Pharisee could base his
heresy. What Micah said, Moses had said. The corrupt of the people
offered a half-service, what cost them least, as faith without love
always does. Micah, in this, reveals to them nothing new; but tells them
that this half-service is contrary to the first principles of their law.
"He bath shewed thee, O man, what is good." Sacrifice, without love of
God and man, was not even so much as the body without the soul. It was
an abortion, a monster. For one end of sacrifice was to inculcate the
insufficiency of all our good, apart from the Blood of Christ; that, do
what we would, "all came short of the glory of God" [Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md). But to substitute sacrifice,
which was a confession that at best we were miserable sinners, unable,
of ourselves, to please God, for any efforts to please Him or to avoid
displeasing Him, would be a direct contradiction of the law,
antinomianism under the dispensation of the law itself.

Micah changes the words of Moses, in order to adapt them to the crying
sins of Israel at that time. He then upbraids them in detail, and that,
with those sins which were patent, which, when brought home to them,
they could not deny, the sins against their neighbor.

[Micah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 6:9</span></span>

The voice of the Lord crieth unto the city - that is, Jerusalem, as the
metropolis of their wealth and their sin, the head and heart of their
offending. "Crieth," aloud, earnestly, intently, so that all might hear.
So God says, "Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding pat forth her
voice? She crieth at the gates, - unto you, O men, I cry, and my voice
is to the sons of men" [Pro 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md), [Pro
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003.md); and Isaiah prophesied of John
the Immerser, "the voice of one crying in the wilderness" [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md); and our Lord saith, "He that
heareth you, heareth Me. And the man of wisdom shall see Thy Name" [Luk
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md). The voice of God is in the
hearing of all, but the wise only seeth the Name of God. The word
rendered "wisdom" means, "that which is," "See ye the word of the
Lord.") They shall see His power and majesty and all which His Name
expresses, as they are displayed severally in each work of His: He shall
speak to them by all things wherein He is; and so seeing Him now in a
glass darkly, they shall hereafter see all, His Glory, His Goodness, His
Love, Himself, "face to face."

Hear ye the rod - that is, the scourge of the wrath of God. The name and
the image recall the like propecies of Isaiah, so that Micah in one word
epitomises the prophecies of Isaiah, or Isaiah expands the word of
Micah. "The rod in thine hand is My indignation" [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); "As if the rod lifted up Him,
who is not wood" [Isa 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md); "He
lifteth up his rod against thee" [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md); "Thou hast broken the rod
(which is) on his shoulder" ([Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md),
Hebrew); "The Lord hath broken the rod of the wicked" [Isa
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005.md); "wheron the grounded (that is,
fixed by the decree of God) staff shall pass" [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md).

And who hath appointed it - that is, beforehand, fixing the time and
place, when and where it should come. So Jeremiah says, "How canst thou
(sword of the Lord) be quiet, and the Lord hath given it a charge to
Ashkelon and to the seashore? there hath He appointed it" [Jer
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007.md). He who has "appointed it,"
changeth not His decree, unless man changeth; nor is He lacking in power
to fulfill it. He will surely bring it to pass. All which can be thought
of, of fear, terror, motives to repentance, awe, hope, trust, is in that
word "who." It is God; hopes and fears may be infinite.

[Micah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 6:10</span></span>

Are there yet - Still after all the warnings and long-suffering of God,
"the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked?" "Treasures of
wickedness" are treasures gotten by wickedness; yet it means too that he
wicked shall have no treasure, no fruit, but his wickedness. He
treasureth up treasures, but of wickedness; as James saith, "Ye have
heaped treasure together for the last days" [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md), that is, of the miseries that
shall come upon them James 1. The words stand over against one another;
"house of the wicked, treasures of wickedness;" as though the whole
house of the wicked was but a "treasure-house of wickedness." Therein it
began; therein and in its rewards it shall end. "Are there yet?" the
prophet asks. There shall soon cease to be. The treasure shall be
spoiled; the iniquity alone shall remain.

And the scant ephah - (Literally, "ephah of leanness" the English
margin) which is abominable? Scant itself, and, by the just judgment of
God, producing scantness, emaciated and emaciating (See [Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014).md); as He says, "He gave them their
desire, and sent leanness withal into their soul" [Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md); and James, "it shall eat your
flesh as it were fire" [Jam 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md). Even
a pagan said, , "Gain gotten by wickedness is loss;" and that, as being
"abominable" or "accursed" or, one might say, "bewrathed," lying under
the wrath and curse of God. Rib.: "What they minish from the measure,
that they add to the wrath of God and the vengeance which shall come
upon them; what is lacking to the measure shall be supplied out of the
wrath of God." The Ephah was a corn-measure [Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md), containing about six bushels; the
rich, in whose house it was, were the sellers; they were the necessaries
of life then, which the rich retailers of corn were selling dishonestly,
at the price of the lives of the poor . Our subtler ways of sin cheat
ourselves, not God. In what ways do not competitive employers use the
scant measure which is accursed? What else is all our competitive trade,
our cheapness, our wealth, but scant measure to the poor, making their
wages lean, full and overflowing with the wrath of God?

[Micah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 6:11</span></span>

Shall I count them pure? - Rather, (as the English margin) "Shall I be
pure?" The prophet takes for the time their person and bids them judge
themselves in him. If it would defile me, how are ye, with all your
other sins, not defiled? All these things were expressly forbidden in
the law. "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in mete-yard, in
weight or in measure. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah and a
just him, shall ye have" [Lev
19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md); and, "Thou shalt not have in
thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. Thou shalt not have in
thine house divers measures, a great and a small. For all that do such
things, and all that do unrighteousness are an abomination unto the Lord
thy God" ([Deu 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md), [Deu
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#015.md), add [Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md); [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md); [Pro
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010).md). Yet are not these things
common even now?

[Micah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 6:12</span></span>

For the rich men thereof - that is, "of the city, [Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md) are full of violence." It bad been
little, had thieves and robbers lived by violence, but now, (as Isaiah
at the same time upbraids them,) "her princes were become companions of
thieves" [Isa 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023.md). Not the poor out
of distress, but the rich, out of wantonness and exceeding covetousness
and love of luxury, not only did wrong but were filled, not so much with
riches, as with violence. Violence is the very meat and drink wherewith
they are filled, yea, and wherewith they shall be filled, when it is
returned upon their heads.

And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies - Fraud is itself lying,
and lying is its inseparable companion. Jerome: "Lying followeth the
gathering together of riches, and the hard custom to lay up riches hath
a deceitful tongue." The sin, he saith, is spread throughout all her
inhabitants; that is, all of them, as their custom, have spoken lies,
and, even when they speak not, the lie is ready; "their tongue is
deceitful (literally, deceit) in their mouth." It is deceit, nothing but
deceit, and that, deceit which should "overthrow" and ruin others. One
intent on gain has the lie ever ready to be uttered, even when he speaks
not. It lurks concealed, until it is needed.

[Micah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 6:13</span></span>

Therefore also will I - (Literally, And I too,) that is, this dost thou,
and thus will I too do. Pococke: "As thou madest sick the heart of the
poor oppressed, so will I, by My grievous and severe punishments, make
thee sick," or make thy wound incurable, as in Nahum, "thy wound is
grievous," ([Nah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md) literally, made
sick. In making thee desolate because of thy sins. The heaping up riches
shall itself be the cause of thy being waste, deserted, desolate.

[Micah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 6:14</span></span>

Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied - The correspondence of the
punishment with the sin shall shew that it is not by chance, but from
the just judgment of God. The curse of God shall go with what they eat,
and it shall not nourish them. The word, thou, is thrice repeated . As
God had just said, I too, so here, Thou. Thou, the same who hast
plundered others, shalt thyself eat, and not be satisfied; "thou shalt
sow, and not reap; thou shalt tread the olive, and thou shalt not anoint
thee with oil." "Upon extreme but ill-gotten abundance, there followeth
extreme want. And whose," adds one, , "seeth not this in our ways and
our times is absolutely blind. For in no period have we ever read that
there was so much gold and silver, or so much discomfort and indigence,
so that those most true words of Christ Jesus seem to have been
especially spoken of us, "Take heed, for a man's life consisteth not in
the abundance of the things which he possesseth" [Luk
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md). And is not this true of us now?

Thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee - Where thou hast laid up
thy treasures, or rather thy wickedness, there thou shalt sink down, or
give way, from inward decay, in the very center of thy wealth and thy
sin. They had said, "Is not the Lord in the midst of us? None evil can
come upon us" [Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md). Micah tells
them of a different indweller. God had departed from them, and left them
to their inherent nothingness. God had been their stay; without God,
human strength collapses. Scarcely any destruction is altogether
hopeless save that which cometh from within. Most storms pass over, tear
off boughs and leaves, but the stem remains. inward decay or excision
alone are humanly irrecoverable. The political death of the people was,
in God's hands, to be the instrument of their regeneration.

Morally too, and at all times, inward emptiness is the fruit of
unrighteous fullness. It is disease, not strength; as even pagan
proverbs said; "the love of money is a dropsy; to drink increaseth the
thirst," and "amid mighty wealth, poor;" and Holy Scripture, "The rich
He sendeth empty away" ([Luk 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053.md),
compare [Sa1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005).md). "And truly they
must be empty. For what can fill the soul, save God?" Rib.: "This is
true too of such as, like the Bishop of Sardis, 'have a name that they
live and are dead' [Rev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md),"
Dionysius, "such as do some things good, feed on the word of God, but
attain to no fruit of righteousness;" "who corrupt natural and seeming
good by inward decay; who appear righteous before men, are active and
zealous for good ends, but spoil all by some secret sin or wrong end, as
vain-glory or praise of men, whereby they lose the praise of God. Their
casting down shall be in the midst of them. The meaning of the whole is
the same, whether the word be rendered casting down, that is, downfall
(literally, sinking down) or emptiness, especially of the stomach,
perhaps from the feeling of "sinking."

Thou shalt take hold - To rescue or remove to a safe place from the
enemy, those whom he would take from thee, "but shalt not" wholly
deliver; "and that which thou deliverest for a time, will I give up to
the sword," that is, the children for whose sake they pleaded that they
got together this wealth; as, now too, the idols, for whose sake men
toil wrongly all their life, are often suddenly taken away. Their goods
too may be said to be given to the sword, that is, to the enemy.

[Micah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 6:15</span></span>

Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap - Micah renews the threatenings
of the law [Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md); [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038.md), which they had been
habitually breaking. Those prophecies had been fulfilled before,
throughout their history; they have been fulfilled lately in Israel for
the like oppression of the poor [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011.md). Their frequent fulfillment spoke
as much of a law of God's righteousness, punishing sin, as the yearly
supply in the ordinary course of nature spoke of His loving Providence.
It is the bitterest punishment to the covetous to have the things which
they coveted, taken away before their eyes; it was a token of God's
Hand, that He took them away, when just within their grasp. The prophet
brings it before their eyes, that they might feel beforehand the
bitterness of forgetting them. Montanus: "They should lose, not only
what they gained unjustly, but the produce of their labor, care,
industry, as, in agriculture, it is said that there is mostly much
labor, little fraud, much benefit."

Harvest is a proverb for joy; "they joy before Thee according to the joy
in, harvest" [Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md); "wine maketh
glad the heart of man, and oil is to make him a cheerful countenance"
[Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md). But the harvest shall be
turned into sorrow, the oil and wine shall be taken away, when all the
labor had been employed (Compare [Isa
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009.md); [Jer
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md); [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037).md). Yet, since all these
operations in nature are adapted to be, and are used as, symbols of
things spiritual, then the words which describe them are adapted to be
spiritual proverbs. Spiritually, , "he soweth and reapeth not, who
soweth to the flesh, and of the flesh reapeth corruption" [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md), things corruptible, and inward
decay and condemnation. He treadeth the olive, who, by shameful deeds
contrary to the law, "grieveth the Holy Spirit of God" [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md), and therefore obtaineth not
gladness of spirit; "he maketh wine, yet drinketh not wine, who teacheth
others, not himself." They too take hold but do not deliver, who for
awhile believe and in time of temptation fall away, who repent for a
while and then fall back into old sins, or in other ways bring no fruit
to perfection; taking up the Cross for awhile and then wearying; using
religious practices, as, more frequent prayer or fasting, and then
tiring; cultivating some graces and then despairing because they see not
the fruits. These tread the olive, but are not anointed with the oil of
the Holy Spirit of grace, who (Rib.), "end by doing for the sake of man,
what they had thought to do out of the love for God, and abandon, for
some fear of man, the good which they had begun."

[Micah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 6:16</span></span>

For the statutes of Omri are kept - Rather, (like the English margin he
doth much keep,) And he doth keep diligently for himself. Both ways
express much diligence in evil . To "keep God's commandments" was the
familiar phrase, in which Israel was exhorted, by every motive of hope
and fear, to obedience to God. "I know him," God says of Abraham, "that
he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall
keep the way of the Lord, to do judgment and justice" [Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md). This was the fundamental
commandment immediately after the deliverance from Eyypt upon their
first murmuring. "The Lord made there" (at Marah) "for them a statute
and ordinance, and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt
give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none
of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians"
[Exo 15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#025.md).

In this character Ha revealed Himself on Mount Sinai, as "shewing mercy
unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments" [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006.md). This was their covenant, "Thou
hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in His ways,
and to keep His statutes and His commandments and His judgments and to
hearken unto His voice" [Deu 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017.md).
This was so often enforced upon them in the law, as the condition upon
which they should hold their land, if they kept the covenant ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); the words of this covenant, [Deu
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#009).md), the commmandments [Lev
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031.md); [Lev

18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md), [Lev

8:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#011.md); [Deu
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md), the statutes ([Lev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md), [Lev
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026.md); [Lev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#008.md), [Lev
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022.md); [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040.md); [Deu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017.md); [Deu
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#011.md); [Deu
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#013.md); [Deu
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md); [Deu
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#010).md), the testimonies [Deu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017.md), the charge [Lev
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md); [Deu
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md) of the Lord. Under this term all
the curses of the law were threatened, if they "hearkened not unto the
voice of the Lord their God, to keep His commandments and His statutes
which He commanded them" [Deu 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015.md).

Under this again the future of good and evil was, in Solomon, set before
the house of David; of unbroken succession on his throne, if "thou wilt
keep My commandments; but contrariwise, if ye or your children will not
keep My commandments and My statutes" [Kg1
9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004.md), banishment, destruction of the
temple, and themselves to be "a proverb and a byword among all people"
This was the object of their existence, [Kg1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007.md). "that they might keep His
statutes and observe His laws" [Psa
105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045.md). This was the summary of their
disobedience, "they kept not the covenant of God" [Psa
78:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#011.md). And now was come the contrary
to all this. They had not kept the commandments of God; and those
commandments of man which were the most contrary to the commandments of
God, they had kept and did keep diligently. Alas! that the Christian
world should be so like them! What iron habit or custom of man, what
fashion, is not kept, if it is against the law of God? How few are not
more afraid of man than God? Had God's command run, Speak evil one of
another, brethren, would it not have been the best kept of all His
commandments? God says, speak not evil; custom, the conversation around,
fear of man, say, speak evil; man's commandment is kept; God's is not
kept. And no one repents or makes restitution; few even cease from the
sin.

Scripture does not record, what was the special aggravation of the sin
of Omri, since the accursed worship of Baal was brought in by Ahab , his
son. But, as usual, "like father, like son." The son developed the sins
of the father. Some special sinfulness of Omri is implied, in that
Athaliah, the murderess of her children, is called after her
grandfather, Omri, not after her father, Ahab [Kg2
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md); [Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md). Heresiarchs have a deeper guilt
than their followers, although the heresy itself is commonly developed
later. Omri settled for a while the kingdom of Israel, after the anarchy
which followed on the murder of Elah, and slew Zimri, his murderer.

Yet before God, he did worse than all before him, and be walked in all
the way of Jeroboam [Kg1 16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md). Yet
this too did not suffice Judah; for it follows, And all the doings of
the house of Ahab, who again "did evil in the sight of the Lord above
all that were before him and served Baal" 1 Kings 30-33; Ahab, to whom
none "was like in sin, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the
sight of the Lord" [Kg1 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025.md). These
were they, whose statutes Judah now kept, as diligently and accurately
as if it had been a religious act. They kept, not the statutes of the
Lord, "but the statutes of Omri;" they kept, as their pattern before
their eyes, all the doings of the house of Ahab, his luxury, oppression,
the bloodshedding of Naboth; and they walked onward, not, as God bade
them, humbly with Him, but in their counsels. And what must be the end
of all this? that I should make thee a desolation. They acted, as though
the very end and object of all their acts were that, wherein they ended,
their own destruction and reproach .

Therefore ye shall bear the reproach of My people - The title of the
people of God must be a glory or a reproach. Judah had gloried in being
God's people, outwardly, by His covenant and protection; they Were
envied for the outward distinction. They refused to be so inwardly, and
gave themselves to the hideous, desecrating, worship of Baal. Now then
what had been their pride, should be the aggravation of their
punishment. Now too we hear of people everywhere zealous for a system,
which their deeds belie. Faith, without love, (such as their character
had been,) feels any insult to the relation to God, which by its deeds
it disgraces. Though they had themselves neglected God, yet it was a
heavy burden to them to bear the triumph of the pagan over them, that
God was unable to help them, or had cast them off "These are the people
of the Lord and are gone forth, out of His land" [Eze
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#020.md). "Wherefore should they say
among the pagan, where is their God?" (see the notes at [Joe
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md). "We are confounded, because we
have heard reproach, shame hath covered our faces, for strangers are
come into the sanctuaries of the Lord's house" [Jer
51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md). "We are become a reproach to
our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us"
[Psa 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md). "Thou makest us a reproach
to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Thou makest us a byword among the pagan, a shaking of the head among the
people. My confusion is daily before me, and the shame of my face hath
covered me, for the voice of him that slandereth and blasphemeth, by
reason of the enemy and the avenger" [Psa
44:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013.md).

The words, "the reproach of My people," may also include "the reproach
wherewith God in the law [Deu 28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036.md)
threatened His people if they should forsake Him," which indeed comes to
the same thing, the one being the prophecy, the other the fulfillment.
The word hissing in itself recalled the threat to David's house in
Solomon; "At this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
shall be astonished and hiss" [Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md). Micah's phrase became a favorite
expression of Jeremiah . So only do God's prophets denounce. It is a
marvelous glimpse into man's religious history, that faith, although it
had been inoperative and was trampled upon without, should still
survive; nay, that God, whom in prosperity they had forsaken and
forgotten, should be remembered, when He seemed to forget and to forsake
them. Had the captive Jews abandoned their faith, the reproach would
have ceased. The words, "ye shall bear the reproach" of My people are,"
at once, a prediction of their deserved suffering for the profanation of
God's Name by their misdeeds, and of their persverance in that faith
which, up to that Time, they had mostly neglected.
