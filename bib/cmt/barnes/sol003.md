### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles)](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sol 3:0</span></span>

The bride relates to the chorus what appears to be an imaginary
occurrence transacted in a dream (like that of [Sol
5:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002)). The Targum takes this section
to be typical of the wanderings of Israel after the Holy One in the
wilderness, as the next [Sol 3:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006) is
made to represent their entrance into the land.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 3:1</span></span>

By night - i. e., In the night-hours.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 3:3</span></span>

The city - One near the bride's native home, possibly Shunem.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 3:4</span></span>

I held him - This begins the fourth stanza. The bride's mother is
mentioned again in [Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009); [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 3:5</span></span>

See [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007) note.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 3:6</span></span>

The principal and central action of the Song; the bride's entry into the
city of David, and her marriage there with the king. Jewish interpreters
regard this part of the poem as symbolizing the "first" entrance of the
Church of the Old Testament into the land of promise, and her spiritual
espousals, and communion with the King of kings, through the erection of
Solomon's Temple and the institution of its acceptable worship.
Christian fathers, in a like spirit, make most things here refer to the
espousals of the Church with Christ in the Passion and Resurrection, or
the communion of Christian souls with Him in meditation thereon.

[Sol 3:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)

Two or more citizens of Jerusalem, or the chorus of youths, companions
of the bridegroom, describe the magnificent appearance of the bride
borne in a royal litter, and then that of the king in festive joy
wearing a nuptial crown.

[Sol 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)

"wilderness" is here pasture-land in contrast with the cultivated
districts and garden-enclosures round the city. Compare [Jer
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010); [Joe
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#022); [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011); [Psa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012).

Pillars of smoke - Here an image of delight and pleasure. Frankincense
and other perfumes are burned in such abundance round the bridal
equipage that the whole procession appears from the distance to be one
of moving wreaths and columns of smoke.

All powders of the merchant - Every kind of spice forming an article of
commerce.

[Sol 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007)

Bed - Probably the royal litter or palanquin in which the bride is
borne, surrounded by his own body-guard consisting of sixty mighties of
the mighty men of Israel.

[Sol 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008)

Because of fear in the night - i. e., Against night alarms. Compare [Psa
91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005).

[Sol 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#009), [Sol
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010)

A stately bed hath king Solomon made for himself of woods (or trees) of
the Lebanon. The word rendered "bed" occurs nowhere else in Scripture,
and is of doubtful etymology and meaning. It may denote here

\(1\) the bride's car or litter; or

\(2\) a more magnificent vehicle provided for her reception on her
entrance into the city, and in which perhaps the king goes forth to meet
her.

It has been made under Solomon's own directions of the costliest woods
(ceda and pine) of the Lebanon; it is furnished with "pillars of silver"
supporting a "baldachin" or "canopy of gold" (not "bottom" as in the
King James Version), and with "a seat (not 'covering') of purple
cushions," while "its interior is paved with (mosaic work, or tapestry
of) love from (not 'for') the daughters of Jerusalem;" the meaning being
that this part of the adornment is a gift of love, whereby the female
chorus have testified their goodwill to the bride, and their desire to
gratify the king.

[Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011)

Daughters of Zion - So called here to distinguish them from the bride's
companions, who are always addressed by her as "daughters of Jerusalem."

His mother - Bathsheba [Kg1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011). This
is the last mention of her in sacred history.
