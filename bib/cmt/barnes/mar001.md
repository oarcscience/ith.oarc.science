Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mark Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

[Mark 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 1:1</span></span>

The beginning of the gospel - The word "gospel" literally signifies good
news, and particularly the good tidings respecting the way of salvation
by the Lord Jesus Christ. Some have understood the word "gospel" here to
mean "history" or "life - the beginning of the history," etc.; but Mark
says nothing of the early life of the Saviour. The word "gospel" here
has reference rather to the preaching of John, an account of which
immediately follows, and means the beginning of the good news, or
annunciation respecting the Messiah. It was very customary thus to
prefix a title to a book.

The Son of God - This title was used here to attract attention, and
secure the respect of those who should read the gospel. It is no common
history. It does not recount the deeds of man - of a hero or a
philosopher - but the doctrines and doings of the Son of God. The
history, therefore, "commands" respect.

[Mark 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 1:2</span></span>

As it is written in the prophets - Mark mentions "prophets" here without
specifying which. The places are found in [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md), and in [Isa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#003.md). See the notes at [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md).

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md), [Mat
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md), [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

[Mark 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 1:9</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md).

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

Here Mark relates concisely what Matthew has recorded more at length in
Mark 4.

The Spirit driveth - The word "driveth" does not mean that he was
compelled forcibly against his will to go there, but that he was
inclined to go there by the Spirit, or was led there. The Spirit of God,
for important purposes, caused him to go. Compare [Mat
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025.md), where the same word is used in
the original: "And when they were all put forth" in Greek, "all driven
out."

And was with the wild beasts - This is added to show the desolation and
danger of his dwelling there. In this place, surrounded by such dangers,
the temptations offered by Satan were the stronger. Amid want and
perils, Satan might suppose that he would be more easily seduced from
God. But he trusted in his Father, and was alike delivered from dangers,
from the wild beasts, and from the power of temptation, thus teaching us
what to do in the day of danger and trial.

And the angels ministered unto him - From [Luk
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#002.md) we learn that in those days he did
eat nothing. When Mark says, therefore, that the angels ministered to
him, it means after the days of temptation had expired, as is said by
[Mat 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md).

[Mark 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 1:14</span></span>

Now after that John was put in prison - John was imprisoned by Herod,
[Mat 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003.md).

Jesus came into Galilee - He left Judea and went into the more retired
country of Galilee. He supposed that if he remained in Judea, Herod
would also persecute him and attempt to take his life. His time of death
had not come, and he therefore prudently sought safety in retirement.
Hence, we may learn that when we have great duties to perform for the
church of God, we are not to endanger our lives wantonly. When we can
secure them without a sacrifice of principle, we are to do it. See [Mat
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016.md).

[Mark 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 1:15</span></span>

The time is fulfilled - That is, the time for the appearance of the
Messiah, the time so long foretold, has come. "The kingdom of God is at
hand." See the notes at [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

Repent ye - Exercise sorrow for sins, and turn from them.

And believe the gospel - Literally, trust in the gospel, or believe the
good tidings - to wit, respecting salvation. See the notes at [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md).

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

[Mark 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 1:21</span></span>

See also [Luk 4:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031.md).

[Mar 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021.md)

And they went into Capernaum - For the situation of Capernaum see the
notes at [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md).

Straightway - Immediately. On the following Sabbath.

The synagogue - See the notes at [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md).

And taught - In the synagogue, the presiding elder, after reading the
Scriptures, invited anyone who chose to address the people, [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md). Though our Saviour was not a
"priest" of the Levitical order or an "officer" of the synagogue, yet we
find him often availing himself of this privilege, and delivering his
doctrines to the Jews.

[Mar 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#022.md)

He taught them as one that had authority ... - See the notes at [Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029.md).

[Mar 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023.md)

A man with an unclean spirit - See [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md). It is probable that this man had
lucid intervals, or he would not have been admitted into the synagogue.
When there, one of his fits came on, and he suddenly cried out.

[Mar 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md)

Let us alone - Though only one impure spirit is mentioned as possessing
this man, yet that spirit speaks also in the name of others.

They were leagued together in the work of evil, and this one knew that
if he was punished, others would also share the same fate.

What have we to do with thee? - See the notes at [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md). By this the spirit meant to say
that, if Jesus cast him out, he would use an improper interference. But
this was untrue. The possession of the man was a direct assault upon God
and his works. Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil, and Jesus
had a right, therefore, to liberate the captive, and to punish him who
had possessed him. So Satan still considers it an infringement of his
rights when God frees a "sinner" from bondage and destroys his influence
over the soul. So he still asks to be let alone, and to be suffered to
lead people captive at his will.

Art thou come to destroy us? - Implying that this could not be the
intention of the "benevolent" Messiah; that to be cast out of that man
would, in fact, be his destruction, and that therefore he might be
suffered still to remain. Or it may imply, as in [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md), that the time of their
destruction had not come, and that he ought not to destroy them before
that.

I know thee who thou art - Evil spirits seem to have been acquainted at
once with the Messiah. Besides, they had learned from his miracles that
he was the Messiah, and had power over them.

The Holy One of God - The Messiah. See [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). Jesus is called "the Holy One of
God" because:

1\. Jesus was eminently pure.

2\. Because Jesus was the only begotten Son of God - equal with the
Father. And,

3\. Because Jesus was anointed (set apart) to the work of the Messiah,
the mediator between God and man.

[Mar 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025.md)

And Jesus rebuked him - Chided him, or commanded him, with a
threatening.

This was not the man that Jesus rebuked, but the spirit, for he
instantly commanded the same being to come out of the man. In all this,
Jesus did not once address the man. His conversation was with the evil
spirit, proving conclusively that it was not a mere disease or mental
derangement - for how could the Son of God hold converse with "disease"
or "insanity?" - but that he conversed with a "being" who also
conversed, reasoned, cavilled, felt, resisted, and knew him. There are,
therefore, evil spirits, and those spirits have taken possession of
human beings.

Hold thy peace - Greek, "Be muzzled." "Restrain thyself." "Cease from
complaints, and come out of the man." This was a very signal proof of
the power of Jesus, to be able by a word to silence an evil angel, and,
against his will, to compel him to leave a man whom he delighted to
torment.

[Mar 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026.md)

And when the unclean spirit ... - Still malignant, though doomed to obey
- submitting because he was obliged to, not because he chose - he
exerted his last power, inflicted all the pain he could, and then bowed
to the Son of God and came out.

This is the nature of an evil disposition. Though compelled to obey,
though prevented by the command and providence of God from doing what it
"would," yet, in seeming to obey, it does all the ill it can, and makes
even the appearance of obedience the occasion for increased crime and
mischief.

[Mar 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027.md), [Mar
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028.md)

And they were all amazed ... - The power of casting out devils was new
to them.

It was done by a word. Jesus did it in his own name and by his own
authority. This proved that he was superior to all the unclean spirits.
In consequence, Jesus' fame spread throughout all the country, and the
impression became prevalent that he was the Messiah.

[Mark 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 1:29</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md).

[Mark 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 1:32</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 8:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#016.md).

And at even, when the sun did set - See the notes at [Mat
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#016.md).

[Mar 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#033.md)

All the city - A great part of the city. A great multitude from the
city.

[Mar 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md)

And suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him - They knew
that he was the Messiah.

If they had spoken, they would have made that known to the people. Jesus
was not desirous at that time that that should be publicly known, or
that his name should be blazoned abroad. The time had not come when he
wished it to be promulgated that he was the Messiah, and he therefore
imposed silence on the evil spirits.

[Mark 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 1:35</span></span>

And in the morning, rising up a great while before day - Luke says [Luk
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042.md), "when it was day." The passage
in Mark means, in the original, not literally "a great while before
day," but very early, or while there was yet "much appearance of night."
The place in Luke means "at daybreak," at the beginning of day. Then,
also, there is much appearance of night; and Luke and Mark therefore
refer to the same time before it was fully light, or just at daybreak.

And departed into a solitary place, and there prayed - Observe here:

1\. that the Saviour, though perfectly holy, regarded the duty of secret
prayer as of great importance.

2\. that he, sought a solitary place for it - far away from the world
and even from his disciples.

3\. that it was early in the morning - always the best time, and a time
when it should not be omitted.

4\. if Jesus prayed, how much more important is it for us!

If Jesus did it in the morning, how much more important is it for us,
before the world gets possession of our thoughts; before Satan fills us
with unholy feelings; when we rise fresh from beds of repose, and while
the world around us is still! David also thus prayed, [Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md); [Psa
119:147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147.md). He that wishes to enjoy
religion will seek a place of secret prayer in the morning. If that is
omitted, all will go wrong, our piety will wither. The world will fill
our thoughts. Temptations will be strong. Through the day, we shall find
it impossible to raise our feelings to a state of proper devotion. It
will be found to be true universally, "that the religious enjoyment
through the day will be according to the state of the heart in the
morning, and can therefore be measured by our faithfulness in early
secret prayer." How different, too, was the conduct of the Saviour from
those who spend the precious hours of the morning in sleep! He knew the
value of the morning hours; he rose while the world was still; he saw
the light as it spread abroad in the east with fresh tokens of his
Father's presence, and joined with the universal creation in offering
praise to the everywhere present God.

[Mar 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#036.md)

And Simon - Simon Peter.

They that were with him - The other apostles.

[Mar 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#037.md)

All men seek for thee - That is, many men, or multitudes. The inquiry
after him was general. They told him this, evidently, with a view to
induce him to leave his place of retirement, and to prevail upon him to
appear publicly to instruct the multitudes.

[Mark 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 1:38</span></span>

And he said unto them ... - This was said in answer to their "implied"
request that he would go and meet the multitudes. "Since the anxiety to
hear the truth is so great, since such multitudes are waiting to hear
the word, let us go into the next towns," etc.

Next towns - Towns in the neighborhood or vicinity of Capernaum. He
proposed to carry the gospel to them, rather than that multitudes should
leave their homes and attend him in his ministry. The word here rendered
"towns" denotes places in size between "cities" and "villages," or large
places, but without walls.

For therefore came I forth - That is, came forth from God, or was sent
by God. Luke, says [Luk 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#043.md), "for
therefore am I sent." Compare [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md); "I came forth from the Father,
and am come into the world." The meaning of this verse therefore is,
"Since multitudes press to hear the word, let us not remain here, but go
into the neighboring towns also: for I was sent by God not to preach at
Capernaum only, but "throughout Judea," and it is therefore improper to
confine my labors to this place."

[Mark 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 1:39</span></span>

And he preached in their synagogues - See [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md).

All Galilee - See [Mat 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md).

And cast out devils - See [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

[Mark 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 1:40</span></span>

And there came a leper ... - See the notes at [Mat
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md).

Kneeling down to him - He kneeled and inclined his face to the ground,
in token of deep humiliation and earnest entreaty. Compare [Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md).

If thou wilt - This was an acknowledgment of the almighty power of
Jesus, and an appeal to his benevolence.

Make me clean - You (Jesus) can heal me of this loathsome and offensive
disease, in the eye of the law justly regarded as "unclean," and render
me "legally" clean, and restore me to the privileges of the
congregation.

And Jesus ...touched him - It was by the law considered as unclean to
touch a leprous man. See [Num 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002.md). The
fact that Jesus touched him was evidence that the requisite power had
been already put forth to heal him; that Jesus regarded him as already
clean.

I will - Here was a most manifest proof of his divine power. None but
God can work a miracle; yet Jesus does it by his "own will" - by an
exertion of his own power. Therefore, Jesus is divine.

See thou say nothing to any man - The law of Moses required that a man
who was healed of the leprosy should be pronounced clean by the priest
before he could be admitted again to the privileges of the congregation,
Lev. 14. Christ, though he had cleansed him, yet required him to be
obedient to the law of the land - to go at once to the priest, and not
to make delay by stopping to converse about his being healed. It was
also possible that, if he did not go at once, evil-minded men would go
before him and prejudice the priest, and prevent his declaring the
healing to be thorough because it was done by Jesus. It was of further
importance that "the priest" should pronounce it to be a genuine cure,
that there might be no cavils among the Jews against its being a real
miracle.

Offer for thy cleansing those things ... - Two birds, and cedar-wood,
and scarlet, and hyssop; and after eight days, two he-lambs, without
blemish, and one ewe-lamb, and fine flour, and oil, [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), [Lev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010.md).

For a testimony unto them - Not to the priest, but to the people, that
they may have evidence that it is a real cure. The testimony of the
priest on the subject would be decisive.

[Mar 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045.md)

Began to publish it much - That is, he made known his own cure. He was
so deeply affected with it, and so much rejoiced, that he followed the
natural dictates of his own feelings rather than the command of the
Saviour.

Jesus could no more enter openly into the city - The word "could," here,
does not refer to any natural inability, or to any physical obstacle in
his way, but only denotes that there was difficulty, inconvenience, or
impropriety in his doing it then; that he judged it best not then to
enter into the city. The difficulty was, probably, that his being in the
city drew such crowds of people as rendered it difficult to accommodate
them, or so as to excite the opposition of civil rulers.

The city - The city or large town where the leper was cured. The same
reason for not entering that city applied also to others, so that he
remained in the deserts, where the multitudes could come to him without
any difficulty or opposition.
