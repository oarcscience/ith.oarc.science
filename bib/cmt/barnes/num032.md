### [Numbers Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 32:0</span></span>

The record of the last war to the east of the Jordan is followed by the
assignment of the lands already conquered to the tribes of Reuben and
Gad and to certain families of the tribe of Manasseh.

[Numbers 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 32:1</span></span>

Jazer - Compare the marginal reference. This district, although included
in the land of Gilead, seems to have had special attractions for the
Israelite settlers. All travelers in Gilead, the modern Belka, bear
witness to its richness as compared with the country to the west of the
Jordan. Its general character is that of an upland pasture, undulating
and thickly timbered. In the last respect its northern portions excel
its southern; but for fertility of soil the southern province is
preferred by the Arabs, in whose lips it has passed into a proverb:
"Thou canst not find a country like the Belka."

[Numbers 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 32:3</span></span>

See [Num 32:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034) notes.

[Numbers 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 32:8</span></span>

Your fathers - The generation of the Exodus was now substantially
extinct. Compare [Num 26:64-65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064).

Kadesh-barnea - See [Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026).

[Numbers 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 32:12</span></span>

The Kenezite - Kenaz [Gen 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011) was
the name of one of the "dukes of Edom:" but Israel and Edom were of
kindred origin, and the use of similar names by the two peoples is not
surprising.

[Numbers 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 32:23</span></span>

Be sure your sin will find you out - literally, "know ye your sin that
it will find you out." Moses implies that their sin would eventually
bring its own punishment along with it.

[Numbers 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 32:27</span></span>

Before the Lord - i. e., immediately in front of the sacred tokens of
the Lord's presence; compare [Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017) note.

[Numbers 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 32:33</span></span>

Half the tribe of Manasseh - That is, (compare [Num
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039); [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001)) the families of Machir. Moses,
when assigning to the pastoral tribes the inheritance which they
desired, appropriated to these Manassites especially the district they
had already subdued, as a reward for their valour and exploits. Thus the
whole of the conquered country was provisionally disposed of, and the
forwardness anti valour of the Machirites rewarded. It seems clear from
[Num 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039) and [Jos
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001), that the claims of the
Machirites arose simply out of their exploits.

[Numbers 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 32:34</span></span>

The cities here named fall into three groups. On Dibon, compare [Num
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#019). The Moabite stone was
discovered here in 1868. This city, occupied on the first acquisition of
the territory by the Gadites, and assigned by Joshua to the Reubenites,
was eventually recaptured by the Moabites, in whose hands it remained.
Ataroth, i. e., "crowns" (Attarus?) was seven miles northwest of Dibon.
Aroer (Arair) lay between Dibon and the Arnon.

Atroth, Shophan - , was Atroth-Shophan, i. e., Atroth, or Ataroth of
Shophan, or "of the burrow;" thus distinguished from the Ataroth named
in the verse preceding from which it was probably not far distant. These
four cities may be styled the Dibon settlement.

[Num 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#035)

Jaazer - (compare [Num 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001)) with the
neighboring "Jogbehah" (Jebeiha), seven miles to the northeast, formed
the second group.

[Num 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#036)

The third Gadite settlement lay in the valley of the Jordan, to the west
of the preceding. It comprised the cities of Bethnimrah (Nimrun) and
"Beth-haran" (Beit-ha-ran).

[Numbers 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 32:37</span></span>

The Reubenites established themselves more compactly than the Gadites.
Elcalch (el-'Al) a mile to the northeast; Nebo (Nebbeh) probably three
miles to the southwest; Baal-meon (Main) nearly two miles to the south;
Kirjathaim (Kureiyat?): and Shibmah, more properly Sibmah, famous at a
later period for its vines (compare [Isa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008)), four miles east of Heshbon; all
clustered round the old Amorite Capital. The Reubenites probably
retained at the partition all these cities with the exception of
Heshbon, which, passing to the Levites, were thenceforth reckoned as
within the tribe of Gad.

Neither the Reubenites nor the Gadites were "builders" in the sense of
founders of the cities of which they thus took possession. They probably
fortified them, for the first time or afresh, so as to render them
places of safety for their families during the campaigns on the other
side of the Jordan; and provided them with all conveniences for their
flocks and herds.

[Numbers 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 32:39</span></span>

The children of Machir - Machir, the son of Manasseh, was long since
dead: even his sons had been brought up upon Joseph's knees [Gen
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023). But the renown acquired by his
descendants raised his family almost to the dignity of a tribe; and the
Machirites are in the next verse styled Machir, just as the children of
Judah or of Ephraim are often spoken of as Judah or Ephraim. So in [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014) Machir is coupled with Ephraim
and Zebulun.

Went - i. e., "had gone:" the statement is preparatory to the ensuing
record of the grant to them of the land they had won.

Gilead - More strictly part of north Gilead; which, though inhabited by
the Amorites, had belonged to the kingdom of Og. Gilead was the district
from which had sprung the ancestress of the Machirites (compare [Ch1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014)).

[Numbers 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 32:41</span></span>

The exploits of Jair - he was the conqueror of Argob [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014) - gave new. luster to his name;
and the fame of the family is attested by the history of Jair the
Israelite judge, doubtless a descendant; perhaps also by the mention of
Jairus [Luk 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041), the ruler of the
synagogue at the neighboring city of Capernaum.

Havoth-jair - That is, the villages, or rather groups of tents, or
"kraals," of Jair. Originally they were twenty-three in number [Ch1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#022) : in the days of the youuger
Jair, to whom they probably descended by inheritance, they either had
increased to thirty, or were reckoned at that round number [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004).

[Numbers 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">num 32:42</span></span>

Kenath - Now Kenawat, an important site near the southern extremity of
the tract el-Lejah, and on the western slopes of the mountains of the
Hauran. The name given to it by its conqueror, as in other cases, fell
ere long into disuse, and the old name has held its ground to this day.

The notices, both Scriptural and traditional, of the conquest of
northeastern Gilead and Bashan by the Machirites, plainly intimate that
it was effected by a few chiefs of great military prowess, who overran
rapidly a far larger district than they could colonize. The father of
Jair, however, Segub, was of the tribe of Judah (compare [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001), and note; [Ch1
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021)), and it is likely that the
Manassite leaders induced many of the more adventurous of this tribe,
and some possibly of other tribes, to join them in their enterprise
against Bashan (see [Jos 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034)).

The Machirites did not exterminate the whole population of this district
(see [Jos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015), etc.). The conquest
of the district east of Jordan seems never to have been so effectually
accomplished as that on the other side.

During the troublous times of the Judges the eastern Manassites rendered
good service to the nation; compare [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014). Gideon, and probably Jephthah,
were of this tribe, and reflect in a later generation the warlike and
adventurous spirit which Jair and Nobah exhibited in the days of Moses.
