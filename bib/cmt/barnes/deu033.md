### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 33:0</span></span>

The Blessing contains:

\(1\) an Introduction, [Deu 33:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001);

\(2\) the Benedictions pronounced on the tribes individually, Deut.
33:6-25;

\(3\) a Conclusion, [Deu 33:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026).

It was no doubt spoken by Moses, probably on the same day and to the
same assembly as the Song Deut. 32:1-43, as soon as lie received the
reviewed notice of his approaching decease [Deu
32:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#048), and just before he ascended
Mount Nebo. Like the Blessing of Jacob Gen. 49, to, which it has an
intimate though independent correspondence throughout, it is the solemn
farewell of the earthly head of the race. A comparison with Genesis (see
the marginal references) will show how the blessings uttered by Moses
over the several tribes partly repeat, partly enlarge and supplement,
and sometimes modify or even reverse, the predictions of the dying
Jacob.

This chapter, in striking contrast with the last, is pervaded by a tone
of happy augury; and the total absence of warning and reproof has been
rightly noted as indicating that Moses is here speaking of the ideal
Israel, of the people of God as they might and would have been but for
their perverseness, rather than foretelling what would in fact be the
fate and fortunes of the twelve tribes. As the Song sets forth the
calamities with which God's justice will visit Israel's fall, so does
the Blessing describe the glory and greatness which would from His mercy
crown Israel's faithfulness. The Song and the Blessing are therefore
correspondent, and mutually supplementary. The form into which the
Blessing is thrown exhibits the several tribes cooperating, each
according to its special characteristics and circumstances, for the
accomplishment of the national mission.

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

The title "the man of God" in the Old Testament is one who is favored
with direct revelations, but not necessarily an official prophet. The
occurrence of the title here is no doubt a token that the Blessing was
not, as was the Song, transcribed by Moses himself. Compare [Deu
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027).

[Deuteronomy 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 33:2</span></span>

By "Seir" is to be understood the mountain-land of the Edomites, and by
"mount Paran" the range which forms the northern boundary of the desert
of Sinai (compare [Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006) note).
Thus the verse forms a poetical description of the vast arena upon which
the glorious manifestation of the Lord in the giving of the covenant
took place.

With ten thousands of saints - Render, from amidst ten thousands of holy
ones: literally from myriads of holiness, i. e., holy Angels (compare
[Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005)). God is represented as
leaving heaven where He dwells amidst the host of the Angels [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019) and descending in majesty to
earth [Mic 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003).

A fiery law - more literally as in the margin, with perhaps an allusion
to the pillar of fire [Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021). The
word is much disputed.

[Deuteronomy 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 33:3</span></span>

"The people" are the twelve tribes, not the Gentiles; and his saints
refer to God's chosen people just before spoken of. Compare [Deu
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#018), [Deu
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021); [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006); [Dan
7:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).

[Deuteronomy 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 33:5</span></span>

He was king - i. e., not Moses but the Lord became king.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

Let not his men be few - literally, "a number," i. e., "a small number,"
such as could be easily counted (compare [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030) note). While the verse promises
that the tribe shall endure and prosper, yet it is so worded as to carry
with it a warning. The Reubenites, occupied with their herds and flocks,
appear, soon after the days of Joshua, to have lost their early energy,
until in later times its numbers, even when counted with the Gadites and
the half of Manasseh, were fewer than that of the Reubenites alone at
the census of Num. 1 (Compare [Ch1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018) with [Num
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020).) No judge, prophet, or national
hero arose out of this tribe.

The tribe of Simeon, which would according to the order of birth come
next, is not here named. This omission is explained by reference to the
words of Jacob concerning Simeon [Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007). This tribe with Levi was to he
"scattered in Israel." The fulfillment of this prediction was in the
case of Levi so ordered as to carry with it honor and blessing; but no
such reversal of punishment was granted to Simeon. Rather had this
latter tribe added new sins to those which Jacob denounced (compare [Num
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005) note). Accordingly, though very
numerous at the Exodus, it had surprisingly diminished before the death
of Moses (compare [Num 1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#022) with
[Num 26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012)); and eventually it
found territory adequate for its wants within the limits of another
tribe, Judah. Compare [Jos 19:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#002).

[Deuteronomy 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 33:7</span></span>

Bring him unto his people - Moses, taking up the promise of Jacob, prays
that Judah, marching forth at the head of the tribes, might ever be
brought back in safety and victory; arm intimates that God would grant
help to accomplish this.

[Deuteronomy 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 33:8</span></span>

Thy holy one - i. e., Levi, regarded as the representative of the whole
priestly and Levitical stock which sprang from him. The contrast between
the tone of this passage and that of [Gen
49:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005) is remarkable. Though the
prediction of Jacob respecting the dispersion of this tribe held good,
yet it was so overruled as to issue in honor and reward. The recovery of
God's favor is to be traced to the faithfulness with which Moses and
Aaron, who came of this tribe, served God in their high offices; and to
the zeal and constancy which conspicuous persons of the tribe (e. g.
Phinehas, [Num 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011) ff), and the
whole tribe itself (compare [Exo
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026)), manifested on critical
occasions in supporting the leaders of the people. The same reasons led
to Levi's being selected for the special service of God in the sanctuary
([Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008) ff, and [Num
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#005) ff); and for the office of
instructing their brethren in the knowledge of the Law. The events at
Massah and Meribah, the one occurring at the beginning, the other toward
the end, of the forty years' wandering, serve to represent the whole
series of trials by which God proved and exercised the faith and
obedience of this chosen tribe.

[Deuteronomy 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 33:9</span></span>

Who said unto his father and to his mother - Compare [Mat
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026).

[Deuteronomy 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 33:11</span></span>

Smite through the loins - Rather, strike the loins, i. e., the seat of
their strength.

[Deuteronomy 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 33:12</span></span>

He shall dwell between his shoulders - i. e., be supported by God as a
son who is carried by his father (compare [Deu
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031)). Benjamin was especially beloved
of his father [Gen 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018); [Gen
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#020); Moses now promises no less love
to him from God Himself.

[Deuteronomy 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 33:13</span></span>

Comparing the words of Moses with those of Jacob, it will be seen that
the patriarch dwells with emphasis on the severe conflicts which Joseph,
i. e., Ephraim and Manasseh, would undergo (compare [Gen
49:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023)); while the lawgiver seems to
look beyond, and to behold the two triumphant and established in their
power.

[Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017)

Rather: "The first-born of his" (i. e. Joseph's) "bullock is his glory":
the reference being to Ephraim, who was raised by Jacob to the honors of
the firstborn ([Gen 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020), and is here
likened to the firstling of Joseph's oxen, i. e., of Joseph's offspring.
The ox is a common emblem of power and strength.

[Deuteronomy 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 33:18</span></span>

Zebulun possessed a commodious sea-shore and the fisheries of the Lake
of Tiberias: and was therefore to thrive by commerce, and to rejoice in
his "going out," i. e., in his mercantile enterprises. Issachar
possessed a fertile inland district, and would therefore dwell at home
and prosper in agriculture. Both tribes distinguished themselves in the
contest with Jabin (compare [Jdg
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014), [Jdg
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#018)): and of Zebulun it is
particularly noted that it produced the officers and tacticians who led
and marshalled the host which vanquished Sisera (see [Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014), and compare [Ch1
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033)).

[Deu 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019)

Unto the mountain - Compare [Exo
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#017).

Sacrifices of righteousness - Sacrifices offered in a righteous spirit,
and therefore well pleasing to God (compare [Psa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005); [Psa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019)).

Treasures hid in the sand - The riches of the seas in general. However,
it is noteworthy that the sand of these coasts was especially valuable
in the manufacture of glass; and glass was a precious thing in ancient
times (compare [Job 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017)). The murex
from which the highly-prized purple dye was extracted, was also found
here. A typical reference to the conversion of the Gentiles is strongly
suggested by [Isa 60:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016); [Isa
66:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011).

[Deuteronomy 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 33:20</span></span>

i\. e., Blessed be God who shall grant to Gad a spacious territory.
Compare the blessing of Shem [Gen
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#026).

With the crown - Rather, yea, the crown. The warlike character of this
tribe is shown by their leading the van in the long campaigns of Joshua
(compare [Jos 4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#012); [Jos
22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001)). Compare also [Ch1
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018); [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008) ff, and the acts of Jehu, the
Gadite, in 2 Kings 9; 10.

[Deuteronomy 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 33:21</span></span>

The first fruits of the conquest made by Israel were assigned to Gad and
Reuben by Moses, at their own request.

Because ... seated - Render, because there was the leader's portion
reserved, i. e., there was reserved the fitting portion for Gad as a
leader in war.

And he came ... - i. e., he joined the other leaders to fulfill the
commands of God respecting the conquest of Canaan (compare [Num
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#017), [Num
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#021), [Num
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#032); [Jos
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014)). Moses regards the promise of
the Gadites to do this as already redeemed.

[Deuteronomy 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 33:22</span></span>

Dan shall be like a lion which leaps forth from his covert in Bashan.
Compare [Sol 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008).

[Deuteronomy 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 33:23</span></span>

Satisfied with favor - Compare [Gen
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021) and note.

The west and the south - i. e., taking the words as referring not to
geographical position but to natural characteristics, "the sea and the
sunny district." The possession of Naphtali included nearly the whole
west coast of the Sea of Galilee, the Lake of Merom, the modern Bahr el
Hulch, and the well watered district near the springs of Jordan. It
contained some of the grandest scenery and some of the most fertile land
in Palestine. Josephus speaks of the shore of Gennesaret as "an earthly
paradise;" and Porter describes it as "the garden of Palestine." The
modern name for this district, "land of good tidings," is significant.

[Deuteronomy 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 33:24</span></span>

Rather, "Blessed above the sons" (i. e. of Jacob-most blessed among the
sons of Jacob) "be Asher; let him he the favored one of his brethren,"
i. e., the one favored of God. The plenty with which this tribe should
be blessed is described under the figure of dipping the foot in oil
(compare the marginal reference).

[Deuteronomy 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 33:25</span></span>

The strength and firmness of Asher is as if he were shod with iron and
brass (compare [Rev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015)). The
territory of this tribe probably contained iron and copper. Compare the
marginal reference.

As thy days, so shall thy strength be - i. e., "thy strength" (some
prefer "thy rest") "shall be continued to thee as long as thou shalt
live: thou shalt never know feebleness and decay."

[Deuteronomy 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 33:26</span></span>

Rather, There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun! See marginal reference
and note.

[Deuteronomy 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 33:27</span></span>

Thy refuge - Rather, "dwellingplace." Compare [Psa
90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001); [Psa
91:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009).

[Deuteronomy 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 33:28</span></span>

The fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine - The King
James Version does not preserve the symmetry of the clauses. Render it:
"Israel shall dwell in safety; alone shall the fountain of Jacob be"
(compare [Psa 68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026); [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001)); "in a land," etc.

[Deuteronomy 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 33:29</span></span>

Be found liars unto thee - Perhaps rather, "cringe before thee." The
verb means to show a feigned or forced obedience: see the marginal
references.

Tread upon their high places - i. e., occupy the commanding positions in
their land, and so have it in subjection.
