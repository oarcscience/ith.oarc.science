### [Proverbs Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001)

[Proverbs 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 7:1</span></span>

The harlot adulteress of an Eastern city is contrasted with the true
feminine ideal of the Wisdom who is to be the "sister" and "kinswoman"
[Pro 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004) of the young man as he goes
on his way through life. See Prov. 8 in the introduction.

[Proverbs 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 7:6</span></span>

Casement - The latticed opening of an Eastern house, overlooking the
street (compare [Jdg 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028)).

[Proverbs 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 7:7</span></span>

Simple - In the bad sense of the word ([Pro
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#022) note); "open" to all impressions
of evil, empty-headed and empty-hearted; lounging near the house of
ill-repute, not as yet deliberately purposing to sin, but placing
himself in the way of it at a time when the pure in heart would seek
their home. There is a certain symbolic meaning in the picture of the
gathering gloom [Pro 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009). Night is
falling over the young man's life as the shadows deepen.

[Proverbs 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 7:11</span></span>

Loud and stubborn - Both words describe the half-animal signs of a
vicious nature. Compare [Hos 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).

[Proverbs 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 7:14</span></span>

This pretence of a religious feast gives us an insight into some strange
features of popular religion under the monarchy of Judah. The harlot
uses the technical word [Lev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001) for
the "peace-offerings," and makes them the starting-point for her sin.
They have to be eaten on the same day that they are offered [Lev
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015), and she invites her victim to
the feast. She who speaks is a "foreigner" who, under a show of
conformity to the religion of Israel, still retains her old notions (see
[Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016) note), and a feast-day to
her is nothing but a time of self-indulgence, which she may invite
another to share with her. If we assume, as probable, that these harlots
of Jerusalem were mainly of Phoenician origin, the connection of their
worship with their sin would be but the continuation of their original
"cultus."

[Proverbs 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 7:16</span></span>

The words point to the art and commerce which flourished under Solomon.

Carved works - Most commentators take the original as meaning "striped
coverlets of linen of Egypt."

[Proverbs 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 7:17</span></span>

The love of perfumes is here, as in [Isa
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024), a sign of luxurious vice.

Cinnamon - The Hebrew word is identical with the English. The spice
imported by the Phoenician traders from the further East, probably from
Ceylon, has kept its name through all changes of language.

[Proverbs 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 7:19</span></span>

The reference to the husband is probably a blind. The use of the word
"goodman" is due to the wish of the English translators to give a
colloquial character to this part of their Version. The Hebrew is merely
"the man." A touch of scorn may be noticed in the form of speech: not
"my husband," but simply "the man."

[Proverbs 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 7:21</span></span>

Fair speech - The Hebrew word is usually translated "doctrine," or
"learning" [Pro 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005); [Pro
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002); [Pro
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009); possibly it is used here in keen
irony.

[Proverbs 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 7:22</span></span>

As a fool ... - literally, "As a fetter to the correction of a fool,"
the order of which is inverted in the King James Version The Septuagint,
followed by the Syriac Version, has another reading, and interprets the
clause: "As a dog, enticed by food, goes to the chain that is to bind
him, so does the youth go to the temptress." None of the attempts of
commentators to get a meaning out of the present text are in any degree
satisfactory.

[Proverbs 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 7:23</span></span>

The first clause does not connect itself very clearly with the
foregoing, and is probably affected by the corrupt text which makes it
perplexing.

[Proverbs 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 7:26</span></span>

The house of the harlot is now likened to a field of battle strewn with
the corpses of the many slain.
