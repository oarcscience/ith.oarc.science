### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 23:0</span></span>

This chapter enjoins sanctity and purity in the congregation of Israel
as a whole, and lays down certain rights and duties of citizenship.

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

Compare [Lev 21:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017.md). Such persons,
exhibiting a mutilation of that human nature which was made in God's
image, were rejected from the covenant entirely. However, they could be
proselytes (compare [Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027).md). The
Old Testament itself foretells [Isa
56:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md) the removal of this ban when
under the kingdom of Messiah the outward and emblematic perfection and
sanctity of Israel should be fulfilled in their inner meaning by the
covenanted presence and work of the Holy Spirit in the Church.

[Deuteronomy 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 23:2</span></span>

A bastard - Probably, a child born of incest or adultery.

Even to his tenth generation - i. e. (see the next verse and [Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001).md), forever. Ten is the number of
perfection and completeness.

[Deuteronomy 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 23:3</span></span>

This law forbids only the naturalization of those against whom it is
directed. It does not forbid their dwelling in the land; and seems to
refer rather to the nations than to individuals. It was not understood
at any rate to interdict marriage with a Moabitess; compare [Rut
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#004.md); [Rut
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md). Ruth however, and her sister
were doubtless proselytes.

[Deu 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md)

Compare the marginal reference. The Moabites and the Ammonites are to be
regarded as clans of the same stock rather than as two independent
nations, and as acting together. Compare [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md).

[Deuteronomy 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 23:6</span></span>

i\. e. "thou shalt not invite them robe on terms of amity with thee
(compare [Deu 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010) ff.md), nor make
their welfare thy care": compare [Ezr
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#012.md). There is no injunction to hatred
or retaliation (compare [Deu 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019).md); but later history contains
frequent record of hostility between Israel and these nations.

[Deuteronomy 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 23:7</span></span>

The Edomite, as descended from Esau the twin brother of Jacob (compare
[Deu 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004).md), and the Egyptian, as of
that nation which had for long shown hospitality to Joseph and his
brethren, were not to be objects of abhorrence. The oppression of the
Egyptians was perhaps regarded as the act of the Pharaohs rather than
the will of the people [Exo 11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002.md);
and at any rate was not to cancel the memory of preceding hospitality.

[Deu 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008.md)

In their third generation - i. e. the great grandchildren of the Edomite
or Egyptian alien: compare the similar phrase in [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md).

[Deuteronomy 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 23:9</span></span>

The whole passage refers not to the encampments of the nation while
passing from Egypt through the wilderness, but to future warlike
expeditions seat out from Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

The case in question is that of a slave who fled from a pagan master to
the holy land. It is of course assumed that the refugee was not flying
from justice, but only from the tyranny of his lord.

[Deuteronomy 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 23:17</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Prostitution was a common part of
religious observances among idolatrous nations, especially in the
worship of Ashtoreth or Astarte. Compare [Mic
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007.md); Baruch 6:43.

[Deuteronomy 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 23:18</span></span>

Another Gentile practice, connected with the one alluded to in the
preceding verse, is here forbidden. The word "dog" is figurative
(compare [Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015).md), and equivalent
to the "sodomite" of the verse preceding.
