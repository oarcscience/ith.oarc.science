### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 27:5</span></span>

David, with characteristic Oriental subtlety (compare [Sa1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002).md), suggests as a reason for
leaving Gath that his presence was burdensome and expensive to the king.
His real motive was to be more out of the way of observation and
control, so as to act the part of an enemy of Saul, without really
lifting up his hand against him and his own countrymen of Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006.md)

Ziklag - This was properly one of the cities of Simeon within the tribe
of Judah (marginal references), but it had been taken possession of by
the Philistines. The exact situation of it is uncertain.

Unto this day - This phrase, coupled with the title the kings of Judah,
implies that this was written after the revolt of Jeroboam, and before
the Babylonian captivity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 27:8</span></span>

The Geshurites bordered upon the Philistines, and lived in the
mountainous district which terminates the desert on the northeast
(marginal reference). They were a different tribe, or, at least, a
different branch of it, from the Geshurites who lived on the northeast
border of Bashan, and were Arameans [Sa2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008.md). The Gezrites, or Gerzites, may
be connected with those who gave their name to Mount Gerizim.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 27:10</span></span>

The Jerahmeelites - i. e. the descendants of Jerahmeel, the son of
Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah (marginal references). They
were therefore a portion of the "south of Judah."

The Kenites - See [Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021.md) note;
[Num 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#011.md); and for their near
neighborhood to Amalek, see [Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 27:11</span></span>

Tidings - The word is not in the original. The sense rather is "to bring
them to Gath," as captives and slaves. The prisoners taken would
naturally have been part of the spoil, but David dared not to bring them
to Gath lest his deceit should be discovered. Obviously these tribes
were allies of the Philistines.
