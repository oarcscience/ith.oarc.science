### [Jeremiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 40:1</span></span>

As what follows is mainly a historical narrative, it seems that the
title "The word ..." was appropriate not merely to a prediction of the
future, but to an account of the past, if written by a prophet. The Jews
regarded history as inspired if written by a seer, and thus their
historical books are called "the early prophets."

Ramah - Probably all the prisoners of note were collected at Ramah
indiscriminately, and examined there.

Bound in chains - The prisoners were probably fastened together in
couples by one hand, and a rope passed down the center to bind them in a
long line, and prevent attempts at escape.

[Jeremiah 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 40:5</span></span>

Now while he was not yet gone back - Most modern commentators render
"And as he yet answered nothing, Return then, he said, to Gedaliah ..."

Victuals - A ration of food.

A reward - A present.

[Jeremiah 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 40:7</span></span>

The men would be the old and infirm: the women those whose husbands and
protectors had perished in the wars (e. g. [Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010)). The word children includes all
the inferior members of a household.

[Jeremiah 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 40:9</span></span>

To serve the Chaldeans - literally, as margin; to be their minister and
lieutenant. Gedaliah supposed that officers of high rank would come from
time to time from Babylon to look after the king's interests. But
whatever was ordered would be done through him, as being the prime
minister.

Gather ye wine - As Jerusalem was captured in the fifth month, August,
it would now be autumn, and there would be fruit upon the trees, enough
to maintain the scanty population during the winter.

Taken - Or, seized. Every captain had probably occupied some place by
force as his head quarters, and Gedaliah bids them retain them. He
frankly accepts the whole existing state of things, as a necessary step
toward re-establishing confidence.

[Jeremiah 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 40:14</span></span>

It is difficult to say what object Baalis can have had in murdering
Gedaliah. As an ally of Zedekiah [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003), he may have had a spite against
the family of Ahikam for opposing, as most probably they did at
Jeremiah's instigation, the league proposed Jer. 27. Ishmael's motive
was envy and spite at seeing a subject who had always opposed the war
now invested with kingly power, in place of the royal family.
