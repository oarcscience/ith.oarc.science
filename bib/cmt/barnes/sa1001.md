### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 1:1</span></span>

Ramathaim-zophim may signify "the two hills [Sa1
9:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011.md) of the watchmen," so called
from its being a post from which the watchmen looked out. But since Zuph
is the name of the head of the family, it is more probable that Zophin
means the Zuphites, the sons of Zuph (see Zophai, [Ch1
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#026).md), from whom the land about Ramah
was called "the land of Zuph," [Sa1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005.md).

There is reason to believe that Elkanah - an Ephrathite, or inhabitant
of Bethlehem [Sa1 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012.md); [Rut
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002.md) and of the territory of the tribe
of Ephraim [Kg1 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md) - the father of
Samuel, represents the fifth generation of settlers in Canaan, and
therefore that Samuel was born about 130 years after the entrance into
Canaan - four complete generations, or 132 years - and about 40 years
before David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 1:2</span></span>

He had two wives - Compare [Gen 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#019.md).
This was permitted by the law [Deu
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md), and sanctioned by the practice
of Jacob Gen. 29, Ashur [Ch1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#005.md),
Shaharaim [Ch1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md), David [Sa1
25:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#043.md), Joash [Ch2
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#003.md), and others.

Hannah - i. e. "Beauty or charm," is the same as "Anna" [Luk
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md).

Peninnah - i. e. "a Pearl," is the same name in signification as
"Marqaret."

The frequent recurrence of the mention of barrenness in those women who
were afterward famous through their progeny (as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel)
coupled with the prophetic language of Hannah's song in 1 Sam. 2,
justifies us in seeking a mystical sense. Besides the apparent purpose
of marking the children so born as raised up for special purposes by
divine Providence, the weakness and comparative barrenness of the Church
of God, to be followed at the set time by her glorious triumph and
immense increase, is probably intended to be foreshadowed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 1:3</span></span>

It is likely that during the unsettled times of the Judges [Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025.md) the attendance of Israelites at
the three Festivals [Exo 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md); [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md) fell into desuetude or great
irregularity, and this one feast (see the marginal reference), which may
have coincided with the Feast of Pentecost or tabernacles, may have been
substituted for them.

The Lord of Hosts - This title of Yahweh which, with some variations, is
found upward of 260 times in the Old Testament, occurs here for the
first time. The meaning of the word "hosts" is doubtless the same as
that of "army" [Dan 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035.md) and includes
all the myriads of holy Angels who people the celestial spheres [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md). It is probably with reference
to the idolatrous worship of the Host of heaven that the title the "Lord
of Hosts" was given to the true God, as asserting His universal
supremacy (see [Neh 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006).md). In the New
Testament the phrase only occurs once [Jam
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md).

And the two sons ... - It should be, "and there the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the Lord," i. e. performed the
functions of priests, in the old age of Eli [Sa1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018.md), who is represented [Sa1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md) as sitting on a seat in the
temple. The reading of the Greek Version "Eli was there, and his two
sons, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord," is quite unnecessary,
and indeed destroys the sense. The information here given concerning the
sons of Eli is followed up in [Sa1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md) ff.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 1:5</span></span>

A worthy portion - Probably as in the margin. Naturally she would have
had a single portion of the sacrifice (compare [Sa1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#023).md), but because of his love to her
he gave her a double portion, enough for two people (compare [Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 1:7</span></span>

And as he did so ... - It should rather be "And so she did year by year,
as often as she went up to the House of the Lord, so she provoked her."
Though the verb is masculine, Peninnah must be the subject, because as
often as SHE went up follows. The Vulgate has "they went up."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 1:9</span></span>

After they had eaten ... - Rather, "after she had eaten and after she
had drunk," which is obviously right. Hannah, in the bitterness of her
spirit, could not enjoy her feast, and so, after eating and drinking a
little, she arose and went to the temple, leaving her husband and
Peninnah and her children at table, where she still found them on her
return [Sa1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018.md).

Upon a seat ... - Rather, "upon the throne," the pontifical chair of
state [Sa1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#013.md), which was probably
set at the gate leading into the inner court of the tabernacle.

The temple of the Lord - The application of the word temple to the
tabernacle is found only here, [Sa1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md); and [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md); and the use of this word here is
thought by some an indication of the late date of the composition of
this passage.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 1:11</span></span>

vows are characteristic of this particular age of the Judges. (Compare
[Jdg 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#030.md); [Jdg
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md); [Sa1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024)..md) For the law of vows in the
case of married women, see [Num
30:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#006.md); and for the nature of the
vow, see the marginal references.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 1:15</span></span>

See [Sa1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#002.md) and note. She means that
wine was not the cause of her present discomposure, but grief of heart.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 1:18</span></span>

A beautiful example of the composing influence of prayer. Hannah had
cast her burden upon the Lord, and so her own spirit was relieved of its
load. She now returned to the family feast, and ate her portion with a
cheerful heart. [Act 2:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md).

The word "sad" is not in the Hebrew text, but it fairly supplies the
meaning intended.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 1:20</span></span>

Samuel - i. e. heard of God, because given in answer to prayer. The
names "Ishmael" and "Elishama" have the same etymology.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 1:22</span></span>

Until the child be weaned - Hebrew mothers, as elsewhere in the East,
usually suckled their children until the age of two complete years,
sometimes until the age of three.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 1:26</span></span>

As thy soul liveth - This oath is unique to the Books of Samuel, in
which it occurs six times, and to the Books of Kings, in which however,
it is found only once. See the note to [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md).
