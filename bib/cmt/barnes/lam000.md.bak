Introduction to Lamentations

The prophecy of Jeremiah is immediately followed in the English Version
by five lyric poems, the title of which in the versions is taken from
the general nature of the contents; thus the Septuagint called these
poems Θρῆνοι Thrēnoi, Threni, i. e. Dirges, and the Syriac and Vulgate
"Lamentations." In the Hebrew Bible the "Lamentations" are arranged
among the Kethubim, or (holy) writings, because of the nature of their
contents: the Lamentations as being lyrical poetry are classed not with
prophecies, but with the Psalms and Proverbs. This classification is
probably later than the translation of the Septuagint, who have appended
the Lamentations to Jeremiah's prophecy, inserting between them the
apocryphal book of Baruch, and in fact counting the three as only one
book. Although no name is attached to these poems in the Hebrew, yet
both ancient tradition (Septuagint, Josephus, the Targum of Jonathan,
the Talmud, etc.) and internal evidence point to Jeremiah as the author.
The time of the composition of these poems is certainly the period
immediately after the capture of Jerusalem, and probably during the
month which intervened between the capture of Jerusalem and its
destruction.

Their subject is the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldaeans. In the
"first" of these poems the prophet dwells upon the miseries of hunger,
of death in battle, of the profanation and plundering of the sanctuary,
and of impending exile, oppressed by which the city sits solitary. In
the "second," these same sufferings are described with more intense
force, and in closer connection with the national sins which had caused
them, and which had been aggravated by the faithlessness of the
prophets. In the "third," Jeremiah acknowledges that chastisement is for
the believer's good, and he dwells more upon the spiritual aspect of
sorrow, and the certainty that finally there must be the redeeming of
life for God's people, and vengeance for His enemies. In the "fourth,"
Judah's sorrows are confessed to have been caused by her sins. Finally,
in the "fifth," Jeremiah prays that Zion's reproach may be taken away,
and that Yahweh will grant repentance unto His people, and renew their
days as of old.

The structure of the first four poems is highly artificial. They are
arranged in 22 portions, according to the number of the letters of the
Hebrew alphabet; but in the first three poems each portion is again
subdivided into three double clauses, the third differing from the first
and second in that each also of these divisions begins with the same
letter. In Lam. 4, again we have 22 verses beginning with the letters of
the alphabet in order, but each verse is divided into only two portions.
In Lam. 5, though there are again 22 verses, the alphabetical initials
are discontinued. Hence, some have thought that this prayer was added by
the prophet to his Lamentations when he was in Egypt at a somewhat later
time.

The Book of Lamentations has always been much used in liturgical
services as giving the spiritual aspect of sorrow. It is recited in the
Jewish synagogues on the ninth of Ab, the day on which the temple was
destroyed. In the Church of England the whole of Lam. 3, and portions of
Lam. 1; Lam. 2; Lam. 4 are read on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in
holy week. For this choice two chief reasons may be given; the first,
that in the wasted city and homeless wanderings of the chosen people we
see an image of the desolation and ruin of the soul cast away - because
of sin - from God's presence into the outer darkness; the second and
chief, because the mournful words of the prophet, set Him before us who
has borne the chastisement due to human sin, and of whom we think
instinctively as we pronounce the words of [Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md).
