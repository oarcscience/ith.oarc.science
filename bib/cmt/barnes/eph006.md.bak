### [Ephesians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 6:0</span></span>

This chapter Eph. 6 comprises the following subjects:

\(1\) An exhortation to children to obey their parents, with a promise
of the blessing that would follow from obedience; [Eph
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md).

\(2\) an exhortation to fathers to manifest such a character that
children could properly obey them, and to train them up in a proper
manner; [Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md).

\(3\) the duty of servants; [Eph
6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md).

\(4\) the duty of masters toward their servants; [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md).

\(5\) an exhortation to put on the whole armor of God, with a
description of the Christian soldier, and of the Christian panoply; [Eph
6:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md).

\(6\) the duty of prayer, and especially of prayer for the apostle
himself, that he might be enabled to speak with boldness in the cause of
his Master; [Eph 6:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md).

\(7\) in the conclusion [Eph 6:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md),
he informs them that if they wished to make any inquiries about his
condition, Tychicus, who conveyed this letter, could acquaint them with
his circumstances; and then closes the Epistle with the usual
benedictions.

[Ephesians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 6:1</span></span>

Children - τέκνα tekna This word usually signifies those who are young;
but it is used here, evidently, to denote those who were under the care
and government of their parents, or those who were not of age.

Obey your parents - This is the first great duty which God has enjoined
on children. It is, to do what their parents command them to do. The God
of nature indicates that this is duty; for he has impressed it on the
minds of all in every age; and the Author of revelation confirms it. It
is particularly important:

\(1\) Because the good order of a family, and hence of the community,
depends on it; no community or family being prosperous where there is
not due subordination in the household.

\(2\) because the welfare of the child depends on it; it being of the
highest importance that a child should be early taught obedience to
"law," as no one can be prosperous or happy who is not thus obedient.

\(3\) because the child is not competent as yet; to "reason" on what is
right, or qualified to direct himself; and, while that is the case, he
must be subject to the will of some other person.

\(4\) because the parent, by his age and experience, is to be presumed
to be qualified to direct and guide a child. The love which God has
implanted in the heart of a parent for a child secures, in general, the
administration of this domestic government in such a way as not to
injure the child. A father will not, unless under strong passion or the
excitement of intoxication, abuse his authority. He loves the child too
much. He desires his welfare; and the placing of the child under the
authority of the parent is about the same thing in regard to the welfare
of the child, as it would be to endow the child at once with all the
wisdom and experience of the parent himself.

\(5\) it is important, because the family government is designed to be
an imitation of the government of God. The government of God is what a
perfect family government would be; and to accustom a child to be
obedient to a parent, is designed to be one method of leading him to be
obedient to God. No child that is disobedient to a parent will be
obedient to God; and that child that is most obedient to a father and
mother will be most likely to become a Christian, and an heir of heaven.
And it may be observed, in general, that no disobedient child is
virtuous, prosperous, or happy. Everyone foresees the ruin of such a
child; and most of the cases of crime that lead to the penitentiary, or
the gallows, commence by disobedience to parents.

In the Lord - That is, as far as their commandments agree with those of
God, and no further. No parent can have a right to require a child to
steal, or lie, or cheat, or assist him in committing murder, or in doing
any other wrong thing. No parent has a right to forbid a child to pray,
to read the Bible, to worship God, or to make a profession of religion.
The duties and rights of children in such cases are similar to those of
wives (see the notes on [Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022).md);
and in all cases, God is to be obeyed rather than man. When a parent,
however, is opposed to a child; when he expresses an unwillingness that
a child should attend a particular church, or make a profession of
religion, such opposition should in all cases be a sufficient reason for
the child to pause and re-examine the subject. he should pray much, and
think much, and inquire much, before, in any case, he acts contrary to
the will of a father or mother; and, when he does do it, he should state
to them, with great gentleness and kindness, that he believes he ought
to love and serve God.

For this is right - It is right:

\(1\) because it is so appointed by God as a duty;

\(2\) because children owe a debt of gratitude to their parents for what
they have done for them;

\(3\) because it will be for the good of the children themselves, and
for the welfare of society.

[Ephesians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 6:2</span></span>

Honour thy father and mother - see [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md); compare notes on [Mat
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md).

Which is the first commandment with promise - With a promise annexed to
it. The promise was, that their days should be long in the land which
the Lord their God would give them. It is not to be supposed that the
observance of the four first commandments would not be attended with a
blessing, but no particular blessing is promised. It is true, indeed,
that there is a "general declaration" annexed to the second commandment,
that God would show mercy to thousands of generations of them that loved
him and that kept his commandments. But that is rather a declaration in
regard to all the commands of God than a promise annexed to that
specific commandment. It is an assurance that obedience to the law of
God would be followed with blessings to a thousand generations, and is
given in view of the first and second commandments together, because
they related particularly to the honor that was due to God. But the
promise in the fifth commandment is a "special promise." It does not
relate to obedience to God in general, but it is a particular assurance
that they who honor their parents shall have a particular blessing as
the result of that obedience.

[Ephesians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 6:3</span></span>

That it may be well with thee - This is found in the fifth commandment
as recorded in [Deu 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016.md). The whole
commandment as there recorded is, "Honour thy father and thy mother, as
the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged,
and that it may go well with thee in the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee." The meaning here is, that they would be more happy,
useful, and virtuous if they obeyed their parents than if they disobeyed
them.

And thou mayest live long on the earth - In the commandment as recorded
in [Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md), the promise is, "that
thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee."
This referred to the promised land - the land of Canaan. The meaning
doubtless, is, that there would be a special providence, securing to
those who were obedient to parents length of days. Long life was
regarded as a great blessing; and this blessing was promised. The
apostle here gives to the promise a more general form, and says that
obedience to parents was connected at all times with long life. We may
remark here:

\(1\) that long life is a blessing. It affords a longer space to prepare
for eternity; it enables a man to be more useful; and it furnishes a
longer opportunity to study the works of God on earth. It is not
improper to desire it; and we should make use of all the means in our
power to lengthen out our days, and to preserve and protect our lives.

\(2\) it is still true that obedience to parents is conducive to length
of life, and that those who are most obedient in early life, other
things being equal, have the best prospect of living long. This occurs
because:

\(a\) obedient children are saved from the vices and crimes which
shorten life. No parent will command his child to be a drunkard, a
gambler, a spendthrift, a pirate, or a murderer. But these vices and
crimes, resulting in most cases from disobedience to parents, all
shorten life; and they who early commit them are certain of on early
grave. No child who disobeys a parent can have any "security" that he
will not fall a victim to such vices and crimes.

\(b\) Obedience to parents is connected with virtuous habits that are
conducive to long life. It will make a child industrious, temperate,
sober; it will lead him to restrain and govern his wild passions; it
will lead him to form habits of self-government which will in future
life save him from the snares of vice and temptation.

\(c\) Many a life is lost early by disobeying a parent. A child disobeys
a father and goes into a dramshop; or he goes to sea; or he becomes the
companion of the wicked - and he may be wrecked at sea, or his character
on land may be wrecked forever. Of disobedient children there is perhaps
not one in a hundred that ever reaches an honored old age.

\(d\) We may still believe that God, in his providence, will watch over
those who are obedient to a father and mother. If he regards a falling
sparrow [Mat 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md), he will not be
unmindful of an obedient child; if he numbers the hairs of the head [Mat
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#030.md), he will not be regardless of
the little boy that honors him by obeying a father and mother.

[Ephesians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 6:4</span></span>

And ye fathers - A command addressed particularly to "fathers," because
they are at the head of the family, and its government is especially
committed to them. The object of the apostle here is, to show parents
that their commands should be such that they can be easily obeyed, or
such as are entirely reasonable and proper. If children are required to
"obey," it is but reasonable that the commands of the parent should be
such that they can be obeyed, or such that the child shall not be
discouraged in his attempt to obey. This statement is in accordance with
what he had said [Eph 5:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md) of the
relation of husband and wife. It was the duty of the wife to obey - but
it was the corresponding duty of the husband to manifest such a
character that it would be pleasant to yield obedience - so to love her,
that his known wish would be law to her. In like manner it is the duty
of children to obey a parent; but it is the duty of a parent to exhibit
such a character, and to maintain such a government, that it would be
proper for the child to obey; to command nothing that is unreasonable or
improper, but to train up his children in the ways of virtue and pure
religion.

Provoke not your children to wrath - That is, by unreasonable commands;
by needless severity; by the manifestation of anger. So govern them, and
so punish them - if punishment is necessary - that they shall not lose
their confidence in you, but shall love you. The apostle here has hit on
the very danger to which parents are most exposed in the government of
their children. It is that of souring their temper; of making them feel
that the parent is under the influence of anger, and that it is right
for them to be so too. This is done:

\(1\) when the commands of a parent are unreasonable and severe. The
spirit of a child then becomes irritated, and he is "discouraged;" [Col
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021.md).

\(2\) when a parent is evidently "excited" when he punishes a child. The
child then feels:

\(a\) that if his "father" is angry, it is not wrong for him to be
angry; and,

\(b\) the very fact of anger in a parent kindles anger in his bosom -
just as it does when two men are contending.

If he submits in the case, it is only because the parent is the
"strongest," not because he is "right," and the child cherishes "anger,"
while he yields to power. There is no principle of parental government
more important than that a father should command his own temper when he
inflicts punishment. He should punish a child not because he is "angry,"
but because it is "right;" not because it has become a matter of
"personal contest," but because God requires that he should do it, and
the welfare of the child demands it. The moment when a child seem that a
parent punishes him under the influence of anger, that moment the child
will be likely to be angry too - and his anger will be as proper as that
of the parent. And yet, how often is punishment inflicted in this
manner! And how often does the child feel that the parent punished him
simply because he was the "strongest," not because it was "right;" and
how often is the mind of a child left with a strong conviction that
wrong has been done him by the punishment which he has received, rather
than with repentance for the wrong that he has himself done.

But bring them up - Place them under such discipline and instruction
that they shall become acquainted with the Lord.

In the nurture - ἐν παιδεία en paideia. The word used here means
"training of a child;" hence education, instruction, discipline. Here it
means that they are to train up their children in such a manner as the
Lord approves; that is, they are to educate them for virtue and
religion.

And admonition - The word used here - νουθεσία nouthesia means
literally, "a putting in mind," then warning, admonition, instruction.
The sense here is, that they were to put them in mind of the Lord - of
his existence, perfections, law, and claims on their hearts and lives.
This command is positive, and is in accordance with all the requirements
of the Bible on the subject. No one can doubt that the Bible enjoins on
parents the duty of endeavoring to train up their children in the ways
of religion, and of making it the grand purpose of this life to prepare
them for heaven. It has been often objected that children should be left
on religious subjects to form their own opinions when they are able to
judge for themselves. Infidels and irreligious people always oppose or
neglect the duty here enjoined; and the plea commonly is, that to teach
religion to children is to make them prejudiced; to destroy their
independence of mind; and to prevent their judging as impartially on so
important a subject as they ought to. In reply to this, and in defense
of the requirements of the Bible on the subject, we may remark:

\(1\) That to suffer a child to grow up without any instruction in
religion, is about the same as to suffer a garden to lie without any
culture. Such a garden would soon be overrun with weeds, and briars, and
thorns - but not sooner, or more certainly, than the mind of a child
would.

\(2\) people do instruct their children in a great many things, and why
should they not in religion? They teach them how to behave in company;
the art of farming; the way to make or use tools; how to make money; how
to avoid the arts of the cunning seducer. But why should it not be said
that all this tends to destroy their independence, and to make them
prejudiced? Why not leave their minds open and free, and suffer them to
form their own judgments about farming and the mechanic arts when their
minds are matured?

\(3\) people do inculcate their own sentiments in religion. An infidel
is not usually "very" anxious to conceal his views from his children.
People teach by example; by incidental remarks; by the "neglect" of that
which they regard as of no value. A man who does not pray, is teaching
his children not to pray; he who neglects the public worship of God, is
teaching his children to neglect it; he who does not read the Bible, is
teaching his children not to read it. Such is the constitution of
things, that it is impossible for a parent not to inculcate his own
religious views on his children. Since this is so, all that the Bible
requires is, that his instructions should be right.

\(4\) to inculcate the truths of religion is not to make the mind
narrow, prejudiced, and indisposed to perceive the truth. Religion makes
the mind candid, conscientious, open to conviction, ready to follow the
truth. Superstition, bigotry, infidelity, and "all" error and falsehood,
make the mind narrow and prejudiced.

\(5\) if a man does not teach his children truth, others will teach them
"error." The young sceptic that the child meets in the street; the
artful infidel; the hater of God; the unprincipled stranger; "will"
teach the child. But is it not better for a parent to teach his child
the "truth" than for a stranger to teach him error?

\(6\) Religion is the most important of all subjects, and "therefore" it
is of most importance that children on that subject should he taught
truth. Of whom can God so properly require this as of a parent? If it be
asked "in what way" a parent is to bring up his children in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord, I answer:

1\. By directly inculcating the doctrines and duties of religion - just
as he does anything else that he regards as of value.

2\. By placing them in the Sunday school, where he may have a guarantee
that they will be taught the truth.

3\. By "conducting" them - not merely "sending" them - to the sanctuary,
that they may be taught in the house of God.

4\. By example - all teaching being valueless without that.

5\. By prayer for the divine aid in his efforts, and for the salvation
of their souls. These duties are plain, simple, easy to be performed,
and are such as a man "knows" he ought to perform. If neglected, and the
soul of the child be lost, a parent has a most fearful account to render
to God.

[Ephesians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 6:5</span></span>

Servants - οἵ δοῦλοι hoi douloi. The word used here denotes one who is
bound to render service to another, whether that service be free or
voluntary, and may denote, therefore, either a slave, or one who binds
himself to render service to another. It is often used in these senses
in the New Testament, just as it is elsewhere. It cannot be demonstrated
that the word here necessarily means "slaves;" though, if slavery
existed among those to whom this Epistle was written - as there can be
little doubt that it did - it is a word which would apply to those in
this condition; compare notes on [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md), note. On the general subject of
slavery, and the Scripture doctrine in regard to it; see notes on [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md). Whether the persons here
referred to were slaves, or were those who had bound themselves to
render a voluntary servitude, the directions here given were equally
appropriate. It was not the design of the Christian religion to produce
a rude sundering of the ties which bind man to man, but to teach all to
perform their duties aright in the relations in which Christianity found
them, and gradually to modify the customs of society, and to produce
ultimately the universal prevalence of that which is right.

Be obedient to them - This is the uniform direction in the New
Testament; see [Pe1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); [Ti1
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md); notes [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md). The idea is that they were to
show in that relation the excellence of the religion which they
professed. If they could be made free, they were to prefer that
condition to a state of bondage [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md), but while the relation remained,
they were to be kind, gentle, and obedient, as became Christians. In the
parallel place in Colossians [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md), it is said that they were to
obey their masters "in all things." But evidently this is to be
understood with the limitations implied in the case of wives and
children (see the notes on [Eph 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md);
[Eph 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001), note.md), and a master would
have no right to command that which was morally wrong.

According to the flesh - This is designed, evidently, to limit the
obligation to obedience. The meaning is, that they had control over "the
body, the flesh." They had the power to command the service which the
body could render; but they were not lords of the spirit. The soul
acknowledged God as its Lord, and to the Lord they were to be subject in
a higher sense than to their masters.

With fear and trembling - With reverence and with a dread of offending
them. They have authority and power over you, and you should be afraid
to incur their displeasure. Whatever might be true about the propriety
of slavery, and whatever might be the duty of the master about setting
the slave free, it would be more to the honor of religion for the
servant to perform his task with a willing mind than to be contumacious
and rebellions. He could do more for the honor of religion by patiently
submitting to even what he felt to be wrong, than by being punished for
what would be regarded as rebellion. It may be added here, that it was
presumed that servants then could read. These directions were addressed
to them, not to their masters. Of what use would be directions like
these addressed to American slaves - scarce any of whom can read?

In singleness of your heart - With a simple, sincere desire to do what
ought to be done.

As unto Christ - Feeling that by rendering proper service to your
masters, you are in fact serving the Lord, and that you are doing that
which will be well-pleasing to him; see the notes on [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md). Fidelity, in whatever situation
we may be in life, is acceptable service to the Lord. A Christian may as
acceptably serve the Lord Jesus in the condition of a servant, as if he
were a minister of the gospel, or a king on a throne. Besides, it will
greatly lighten the burdens of such a situation, and make the toils of
an humble condition easy, to remember that we are then "serving the
Lord."

[Ephesians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 6:6</span></span>

Nor with eye-service - That is, not with service rendered only under the
eye of the master, or when his eye is fixed on you. The apostle has here
adverted to one of the evils of involuntary servitude as it exists
everywhere. It is, that the slave will usually obey only when the eye of
the master is upon him. The freeman who agrees to labor for stipulated
wages may be trusted when the master is out of sight; but not the slave.
Hence the necessity where there are slaves of having "drivers" who shall
attend them, and who shall compel them to work. This evil it is
impossible to avoid, except where true religion prevails - and the
extensive prevalence of true religion would set the slave at liberty.
Yet as long as the relation exists, the apostle would enjoin on the
servant the duty of performing his work conscientiously, as rendering
service to the Lord. This direction, moreover, is one of great
importance to all who are employed in the service of others. They are
bound to perform their duty with as much fidelity as though the eye of
the employer was always upon them, remembering that though the eye of
man may be turned away, that of God never is.

As men-pleasers - As if it were the main object to please people. The
object should be rather to please and honor God.

But as the servants of Christ - see the notes on [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md).

Doing the will of God from the heart - That is, God requires industry,
fidelity, conscientiousness, submission, and obedience in that rank of
life. We render acceptable service to God when, from regard to his will,
we perform the services which are demanded of us in the situation in
life where we may be placed, however humble that may be.

[Ephesians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 6:7</span></span>

As to the Lord, and not to men - That is, he should regard his lot in
life as having been ordered by Divine Providence for some wise and good
purpose; and until he may be permitted to enjoy his liberty in a quiet
and peaceable manner (notes, [Co1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021).md), he should perform his duties
with fidelity, and feel that he was rendering acceptable service to God.
This would reconcile him to much of the hardships of his lot. The
feeling that "God" has ordered the circumstances of our lives, and that
he has some wise and good ends to answer by it, makes us contented
there; though we may feel that our fellowman may be doing us injustice.
It was this principle that made the martyrs so patient under the wrongs
done them by people; and this may make even a slave patient and
submissive under the wrongs of a master. But let not a master think,
because a pious slave shows this spirit, that, therefore, the slave
feels that the master is right in withholding his freedom; nor let him
suppose, because religion requires the slave to be submissive and
obedient, that, therefore, it approves of what the master does. It does
this no more than it sanctioned the conduct of Nero and Mary, because
religion required the martyrs to be unresisting, and to allow themselves
to be led to the stake. A conscientious slave may find happiness in
submitting to God, and doing his will, just as a conscientious martyr
may. But this does not sanction the wrong, either of the slave-owner or
of the persecutor.

[Ephesians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 6:8</span></span>

Knowing that whatsoever good thing - Whatever a man does that is right,
for that he shall be appropriately rewarded. No matter what his rank in
life, if he discharges his duty to God and man, he will be accepted. A
man in a state of servitude may so live as to honor God; and, so living,
he should not be greatly solicitous about his condition. A master may
fail to render suitable recompense to a slave. But, if the servant is
faithful to God, he will recompense him in the future world. It is in
this way that religion would make the evils of life tolerable, by
teaching those who are oppressed to hear their trials in a patient
spirit, and to look forward to the future world of reward. Religion does
not approve of slavery. It is the friend of human rights. If it had full
influence on earth, it would restore every man to freedom, and impart to
each one his rights. Christianity nowhere requires its friends to make
or to own a slave. No one under the proper influence of religion ever
yet made a man a slave; there is no one under its proper influence who
would not desire that all should be free; and just in proportion as true
religion spreads over the world, will universal freedom be its
attendant. But Christianity would lighten the evils of slavery even
while it exists, and would comfort those who are doomed to so hard a
lot, by assuring them that there they may render acceptable service to
God, and that they soon will be admitted to a world where galling
servitude will be known no more. If they may not have freedom here, they
may have contentment if they feel that wrong is done them by men, they
may feel that right will be done them by God; if their masters do not
reward them for their services here, God will; and if they may not enjoy
liberty here, they will soon be received into the world of perfect
freedom - heaven.

[Ephesians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 6:9</span></span>

And, ye masters - The object of this is, to secure for servants a proper
treatment. It is evident, from this, that there were in the Christian
church those who were "masters;" and the most obvious interpretation is,
that they were the owners of slaves. Some such persons would be
converted, as such are now. Paul did not say that they could not be
Christians. He did not say that they should he excluded at once from the
communion. He did not hold them up to reproach, or use harsh and severe
language in regard to them. He taught them their duty toward those who
were under them, and laid down principles which, if followed, would lead
ultimately to universal freedom.

Do the same things unto them - τὰ αὐτὰ ta auta. The "same things," here
seem to refer to what he had said in the previous verses. They were, to
evince toward their servants the same spirit which he had required
servants to evince toward them - the same kindness, fidelity, and
respect for the will of God. He had required servants to act
conscientiously; to remember that the eye of God was upon them, and that
in that condition in life they were to regard themselves as serving God,
and as mainly answerable to him. The same things the apostle would have
masters feel. They were to be faithful, conscientious, just, true to the
interests of their servants, and to remember that they were responsible
to God. They were not to take advantage of their power to oppress them,
to punish them unreasonably, or to suppose that they were freed from
responsibility in regard to the manner in which they treated them. In
the corresponding passage in Colossians ([Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001).md), this is, "Masters, give unto
your servants that which is just and equal;" see the note on that place.

Forbearing threatening - Margin, "moderating." The Greek word means to
"relax, loosen;" and then, to "omit, cease from." This is evidently the
meaning here The sense is, that they were to be kind, affectionate,
just. It does not mean that they were to remit punishment where it was
deserved; but the object is to guard against that to which they were so
much exposed in their condition - a fretful, dissatisfied temper; a
disposition to govern by terror rather than by love. Where this unhappy
state of society exists, it would be worth the trial of those who
sustain the relation of masters, to see whether it would not be
"possible" to govern their servants, as the apostle here advises, by the
exercise of love. Might not kindness, and confidence, and the fear of
the Lord, be substituted for threats and stripes?

Knowing that your Master also is in heaven - Margin, "Some read, both
your and their." Many mss. have this reading; see Mill. The sense is not
materially affected, further than, according to the margin, the effect
would be to make the master and the servant feel that, in a most
important sense, they were on an equality. According to the common
reading, the sense is, that masters should remember that they were
responsible to God, and this fact should be allowed to influence them in
a proper manner. This it would do in two ways:

\(1\) By the fact that injustice toward their servants would then be
punished as it deserved - since there was no respect of persons with
God.

\(2\) it would lead them to act toward their servants as they would
desire God to treat them. Nothing would be better adapted to do this
than the feeling that they had a common Master, and that they were soon
to stand at his bar.

Neither is there respect of persons with him - see this expression
explained in the notes on [Rom 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md).
The meaning here is, that God would not be influenced in the
distribution of rewards and punishments, by a regard to the rank or
condition of the master or the slave. He would show no favor to the one
because he was a master; he would withhold none from the other because
he was a slave. He would treat both according to their character. In
this world they occupied different ranks and conditions; at his bar they
would be called to answer before the same Judge. It follows from this:

\(1\) that a slave is not to be regarded as a "chattel," or a "thing,"
or as "property." He is a man; a redeemed man; an immortal man. He is
one for whom Christ died. But Christ did not die for "chattels" and
"things."

\(2\) the master and the servant in their great interests are on a
level. Both are sinners; both will soon die; both will moulder back in
the same manner to dust; both will stand at the tribunal of God; both
will give up their account. The one will not be admitted to heaven
because he is a master; nor will the other be thrust down to hell
because he is a slave. If both are Christians, they will be admitted to
a heaven where the distinctions of rank and color are unknown. If the
master is not a Christian and the servant is, he who has regarded
himself as superior to the servant in this life, will see "him" ascend
to heaven while he himself will be thrust down to hell.

\(3\) Considerations like these will if they have their proper
influence, produce two effects:

\(a\) They will lighten the yoke of slavery while it continues, and
while it may be difficult to remove it at once. If the master and the
slave were both Christians, even if the relation continued, it would be
rather a relation of mutual confidence. The master would become the
protector, the teacher, the guide, the friend; the servant would become
the faithful helper - rendering service to one whom he loved, and to
whom he felt himself bound by the obligations of gratitude and
affection.

\(b\) But this state of feeling would soon lead to emancipation. There
is something shocking to the feelings of all, and monstrous to a
Christian, in the idea of holding "a Christian brother" in bondage. So
long as the slave is regarded as a "chattel" or a mere piece of
"property," like a horse, so long people endeavor to content themselves
with the feeling that he may be held in bondage. But the moment it is
felt that he is a "Christian brother" - a redeemed fellow-traveler to
eternity, a joint heir of life - that moment a Christian should feel
that there is something that violates all the principles of his religion
in holding him as A slave; in making a "chattel" of that for which
Christ died, and in buying and selling like a horse, an ox, or an ass, a
child of God, and an heir of life. Accordingly, the prevalence of
Christianity soon did away the evil of slavery in the Roman empire; and
if it prevailed in its purity, it would soon banish it from the face of
the earth.

[Ephesians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 6:10</span></span>

Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord - Paul had now stated to the
Ephesians the duties which they were to perform. He had considered the
various relations of life which they sustained, and the obligations
resulting from them. He was not unaware that in the discharge of their
duties they would need strength from above. He knew that they had great
and mighty foes, and that to meet them, they needed to be clothed in the
panoply of the Christian soldier. He closes, therefore, by exhorting
them to put on all the strength which they could to meet the enemies
with which they had to contend; and in the commencement of his
exhortation he reminds them that it was only by the strength of the Lord
that they could hope for victory. To be "strong in the Lord," is:

\(1\) to be strong or courageous in his cause;

\(2\) to feel that he is our strength, and to rely on him and his
promises.

[Ephesians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 6:11</span></span>

Put on the whole armor of God - The whole description here is derived
from the weapons of an ancient soldier. The various parts of those
weapons - constituting the "whole panoply" - are specified in [Eph
6:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md). The word rendered "whole
armor" πανοπλίαν panoplian, "panoply"), means "complete armor,"
offensive and defensive; see [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022.md); [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md) note; [Co2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md) note. "The armor of God" is not
that which God wears, but that which he has provided for the Christian
soldier. The meaning here is:

\(1\) that we are not to provide in our warfare such weapons as people
employ in their contests, but such as God provides; that we are to
renounce the weapons which are carnal, and put on such as God has
directed for the achievement of the victory.

\(2\) we are to put on the "whole armor." We are not to go armed partly
with what God has appointed, and partly with such weapons as people use;
nor are we to put on "a part" of the armor only, but the "whole" of it.
A man needs "all" that armor if he is about to fight the battles of the
Lord; and if he lacks "one" of the weapons which God has appointed,
defeat may be the consequence.

That ye may be able to stand - The foes are so numerous and mighty, that
unless clothed with the divine armor, victory will be impossible.

Against the wiles of the devil - The word rendered "wiles" (μεθοδεία
methodeia), means properly that which is traced out with "method;" that
which is "methodized;" and then that which is well laid - art, skill,
cunning. It occurs in the New Testament only in [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md), and in this place. It is
appropriately rendered here as "wiles," meaning cunning devices, arts,
attempts to delude and destroy us. The wiles "of the devil" are the
various arts and stratagems which he employs to drag souls down to
perdition. We can more easily encounter open force than we can cunning;
and we need the weapons of Christian armor to meet the attempts to draw
us into a snare, as much as to meet open force. The idea here is, that
Satan does not carry on an open warfare. He does not meet the Christian
soldier face to face. He advances covertly; makes his approaches in
darkness; employs cunning rather than power, and seeks rather to delude
and betray than to vanquish by mere force. Hence, the necessity of being
constantly armed to meet him whenever the attack is made. A man who has
to contend with a visible enemy, may feel safe if he only prepares to
meet him in the open field. But far different is the case if the enemy
is invisible; if he steals upon us slyly and stealthily; if he practices
war only by ambushes and by surprises. Such is the foe that we have to
contend with - and almost all the Christian struggle is a warfare
against stratagems and wiles. Satan does not openly appear. He
approaches us not in repulsive forms, but comes to recommend some
plausible doctrine, to lay before us some temptation that shall not
immediately repel us. He presents the world in an alluring aspect;
invites us to pleasures that seem to be harmless, and leads us in
indulgence until we have gone so far that we cannot retreat.

[Ephesians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 6:12</span></span>

For we wrestle - Greek, "The wrestling to us;" or, "There is not to us a
wrestling with flesh and blood." There is undoubtedly here an allusion
to the ancient games of Greece, a part of the exercises in which
consisted in wrestling; see the notes on [Co1
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md). The Greek word used here -
πάλη palē - denotes a "wrestling;" and then a struggle, fight, combat.
Here it refers to the struggle or combat which the Christian has to
mainrain - the Christian warfare.

Not against flesh and blood - Not with people; see the notes on [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md). The apostle does not mean to say
that Christians had no enemies among men that opposed them, for they
were exposed often to fiery persecution; nor that they had nothing to
contend with in the carnal and corrupt propensities of their nature,
which was true of them then as it is now; but that their main
controversy was with the invisible spirits of wickedness that sought to
destroy them. They were the source and origin of all their spiritual
conflicts, and with them the warfare was to be maintained.

But against principalities - There can be no doubt whatever that the
apostle alludes here to evil spirits. Like good angels, they were
regarded as divided into ranks and orders, and were supposed to be under
the control of one mighty leader; see the notes on [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md). It is probable that the allusion
here is to the ranks and orders which they sustained before their fall,
something like which they may still retain. The word "principalities"
refers to principal rulers, or chieftains.

Powers - Those who had power, or to whom the name of "powers" was given.
Milton represents Satan as addressing the fallen angels in similar
language:

"Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers."

Against the rulers of the darkness of this world - The rulers that
preside over the regions of ignorance and sin with which the earth
abounds, compare notes on [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md).
"Darkness" is an emblem of ignorance, misery, and sin; and no
description could be more accurate than that of representing these
malignant spirits as ruling over a dark world. The earth - dark, and
wretched and ignorant, and sinful - is just such a dominion as they
would choose, or as they would cause; and the degradation and woe of the
pagan world are just such as foul and malignant spirits would delight
in. It is a wide and a powerful empire. It has been consolidated by
ages. It is sustained by all the authority of law; by all the
omnipotence of the perverted religious principle; by all the reverence
for antiquity; by all the power of selfish, corrupt, and base passions.
No empire has been so extended, or has continued so long, as that empire
of darkness; and nothing on earth is so difficult to destroy.

Yet the apostle says that it was on that kingdom they were to make war.
Against that, the kingdom of the Redeemer was to be set up; and that was
to be overcome by the spiritual weapons which he specifies. When he
speaks of the Christian warfare here, he refers to the contest with the
powers of this dark kingdom. He regards each and every Christian as a
soldier to wage war on it in whatever way he could, and wherever he
could attack it. The contest therefore was not primarily with people, or
with the internal corrupt propensities of the soul; it was with this
vast and dark kingdom that had been set up over mankind. I do not regard
this passage, therefore, as having a primary reference to the struggle
which a Christian maintains with his own corrupt propensities. It is a
warfare on a large scale with the entire kingdom of darkness over the
world. Yet in maintaining the warfare, the struggle will be with such
portions of that kingdom as we come in contact with and will actually
relate:

\(1\) to our own sinful propensities - which are a part of the kingdom
of darkness;

\(2\) with the evil passions of others - their pride, ambition, and
spirit of revenge - which are also a part of that kingdom;

\(3\) with the evil customs, laws, opinions, employments, pleasures of
the world - which are also a part of that dark kingdom;

\(4\) with error, superstition, false doctrine - which are also a part
of that kingdom; and,

\(5\) with the wickedness of the pagan world - the sins of benighted
nations - also a part of that kingdom. Wherever we come in contact with
evil - whether in our own hearts or elsewhere - there we are to make
war.

Against spiritual wickedness - Margin, "or wicked spirits." Literally,
"The spiritual things of wickedness;" but the allusion is undoubtedly to
evil spirits, and to their influences on earth.

In high places - ἐν τοῖς ἐπουράνιοις - "in celestial or heavenly
places." The same phrase occurs in [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md), where it is translated, "in
heavenly places." The word (ἐπουράνιος epouranios) is used of those that
dwell in heaven, [Mat 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#035.md); [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md); of those who come from heaven,
[Co1 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#048.md); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md); of the heavenly bodies, the sun,
moon, and stars, [Co1 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040.md). Then the
neuter plural of the word is used to denote the heavens; and then the
"lower" heavens, the sky, the air, represented as the seat of evil
spirits; see the notes on [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md).
This is the allusion here. The evil spirits are supposed to occupy the
lofty regions of the air, and thence to exert a baleful influence on the
affairs of man. What was the origin of this opinion it is not needful
here to inquire. No one can "prove," however, that it is incorrect. It
is against such spirits, and all their malignant influences, that
Christians are called to contend. In whatever way their power is put
forth - whether in the prevalence of vice and error; of superstition and
magic arts; of infidelity, atheism, or antinomianism; of evil customs
and laws; of pernicious fashions and opinions, or in the corruptions of
our own hearts, we are to make war on all these forms of evil, and never
to yield in the conflict.

[Ephesians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 6:13</span></span>

In the evil day - The day of temptation; the day when you are violently
assaulted.

And having done all, to stand - Margin, "or overcome." The Greek word
means, to work out, effect, or produce; and then to work up, to make an
end of, to vanquish. Robinson, Lexicon. The idea seems to be, that they
were to overcome or vanquish all their foes, and thus to stand firm. The
whole language here is taken from war; and the idea is, that every foe
was to be subdued - no matter how numerous or formidable they might be.
Safety and triumph could be looked for only when every enemy was slain.

[Ephesians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 6:14</span></span>

Stand therefore - Resist every attack - as a soldier does in battle. In
what way they were to do this, and how they were to be armed, the
apostle proceeds to specify; and in doing it, gives a description of the
ancient armor of a soldier.

Having your loins girt about - The "girdle, or sash," was always with
the ancients an important part of their dress, in war as well as in
peace. They wore loose, flowing robes; and it became necessary to gird
them up when they traveled, or ran, or labored. The girdle was often
highly ornamented, and was the place where they carried their money,
their sword, their pipe, their writing instruments, etc.; see the notes
on [Mat 5:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md). The "girdle" seems
sometimes to have been a cincture of iron or steel, and designed to keep
every part of the armor in its place, and to gird the soldier on every
side.

With truth - It may not be easy to determine with entire accuracy the
resemblance between the parts of the armor specified in this
description, and the things with which they are compared, or to
determine precisely why he compared truth to a girdle, and
"righteousness" to a breast-plate, rather than why he should have chosen
a different order, and compared righteousness to a girdle, etc. Perhaps
in themselves there may have been no special reason for this
arrangement, but the object may have been merely to specify the
different parts of the armor of a soldier, and to compare them with the
weapons which Christians were to use, though the comparison should be
made somewhat at random. In some of the cases, however, we can see a
particular significancy in the comparisons which are made; and it may
not be improper to make suggestions of that kind as we go along. The
idea here may be, that as the girdle was the bracer up, or support of
the body, so truth is suited to brace us up, and to gird us for
constancy and firmness. The girdle kept all the parts of the armor in
their proper place, and preserved firmness and consistency in the dress;
and so truth might serve to give consistency and firmness to our
conduct. "Great," says Grotius, "is the laxity of falsehood; truth binds
the man." Truth preserves a man from those lax views of morals, of duty
and of religion, which leave him exposed to every assault. It makes the
soul sincere, firm, constant, and always on its guard. A man who has no
consistent views of truth, is just the man for the adversary
successfully to assail.

And having on the breast-plate - The word rendered here as "breastplate"
θώρἀξ thōrax denoted the "cuirass," Lat.: lorica, or coat of mail; i.
e., the armor that covered the body from the neck to the thighs, and
consisted of two parts, one covering the front and the other the back.
It was made of rings, or in the form of scales, or of plates, so
fastened together that they, would be flexible, and yet guard the body
from a sword, spear, or arrow. It is referred to in the Scriptures as a
"coat of mail" [Sa1 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md); an
"habergeon" [Neh 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md), or as a
"breast-plate." We are told that Goliath's coat of mail weighed five
thousand shekels of brass, or nearly one hundred and sixty pounds. It
was often formed of plates of brass, laid one upon another, like the
scales of a fish. The following cuts will give an idea of this ancient
piece of armor.

Of righteousness - Integrity, holiness, purity of life, sincerity of
piety. The breast-plate defended the vital parts of the body; and the
idea here may be that the integrity of life, and righteousness of
character, is as necessary to defend us from the assaults of Satan, as
the coat of mail was to preserve the heart from the arrows of an enemy.
It was the incorruptible integrity of Job, and, in a higher sense, of
the Redeemer himself, that saved them from the temptations of the devil.
And it is as true now that no one can successfully meet the power of
temptation unless he is righteous, as that a soldier could not defend
himself against a foe without such a coat of mail. A want of integrity
will leave a man exposed to the assaults of the enemy, just as a man
would be whose coat of mail was defective, or some part of which was
missing. The king of Israel was smitten by an arrow sent from a bow,
drawn at a venture, "between the joints of his harness" or the
"breast-plate" (margin), [Kg1 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034.md);
and many a man who thinks he has on the "Christian" armor is smitten in
the same manner. There is some defect of character; some want of
incorruptible integrity; some point that is unguarded - and that will be
sure to be the point of attack by the foe. So David was tempted to
commit the enormous crimes that stain his memory, and Peter to deny his
Lord. So Judas was assailed, for the want of the armor of righteousness,
through his avarice; and so, by some want of incorruptible integrity in
a single point, many a minister of the gospel has been assailed and has
fallen. It may be added here, that we need a righteousness which God
alone can give; the righteousness of God our Saviour, to make us
perfectly invulnerable to all the arrows of the foe.

[Ephesians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 6:15</span></span>

And your feet shod - There is undoubtedly an allusion here to what was
worn by the ancient soldier to guard his feet. The Greek is, literally,
"having underbound the feet;" that is, having bound on the shoes, or
sandais, or whatever was worn by the ancient soldier. The protection of
the feet and ankles consisted of two parts:

\(1\) The sandals, or shoes, which were probably made so as to cover the
foot, and which often were fitted with nails, or armed with spikes, to
make the hold firm in the ground: or.

\(2\) with "greaves" that were fitted to the legs, and designed to
defond them from any danger. These "greaves," or boots [Sa1
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md), were made of brass, and were in
almost universal use among the Greeks and Romans.

With the preparation - Prepared with the gospel of peace. The sense is,
that the Christian soldier is to be prepared with the gospel of peace to
meet attacks similar to those against which the ancient soldier designed
to guard himself by the sandals or greaves which he wore. The word
rendered "preparation" - (ἑτοιμασία hetoimasia) - means properly
readiness, fitness for, alacrity; and the idea, according to Robinson
(Lexicon), is, that they were to be ever ready to go forth to preach the
gospel. Taylor (Fragments to Calmet's Dic., No. 219) supposes that it
means, "Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel; not iron, not
steel - but patient investigation, calm inquiry, assiduous, laborious,
lasting; or with "firm footing" in the gospel of peace." Locke supposes
it to mean," with a readiness to walk in the gospel of peace." Doddridge
supposes that the allusion is to "greaves," and the spirit recommended
is that peaceful and benevolent temper recommended in the gospel, and
which, like the boots worn by soldiers, would bear them safe through
many obstructions and trials that might be opposed to them, as a soldier
might encounter sharp-pointed thorns that would oppose his progress.

It is difficult to determine the exact meaning; and perhaps all
expositors have erred in endeavoring to explain the reference of these
parts of armor by some particular thing in the gospel. The apostle
figured to himself a soldier, clad in the usual manner. Christians were
to resemble him. One part of his dress or preparation consisted in the
covering and defense of the foot. It was to preserve the foot from
danger, and to secure the facility of his march, and perhaps to make him
firm in battle. Christians were to have the principles of the gospel of
peace - the peaceful and pure gospel - to facilitate them; to aid them
in their marches; to make them firm in the day of conflict with their
foes. They were not to be furnished with carnal weapons, but with the
peaceful gospel of the Redeemer; and, sustained by this, they were to go
on in their march through the world. The principles of the gospel were
to do for them what the greaves and iron-spiked sandals did for the
soldier - to make them ready for the march, to make them firm in their
foot-tread, and to be a part of their defense against their foes.

[Ephesians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 6:16</span></span>

Above all - Ἐν πᾶσιν En pasin. Not "above all" in point of importance or
value, but "over" all, as a soldier holds his shield to defend himself.
It constitutes a protection over every part of his body, as it can be
turned in every direction. The idea is, that as the shield covered or
protected the other parts of the armor, so faith had a similar
importance in the Christian virtues.

The shield - note, [Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md). The
shield was usually made of light wood. or a rim of brass, and covered
with several folds or thicknesses of stout hide, which was preserved by
frequent anointing. It was held by the left arm, and was secured by
straps, through which the arm passed, as may be seen in the annexed
figures. The outer surface of the shield was made more or less rounding.
Item the center to the edge, and was polished smooth, or anointed with
oil, so that arrows or darts would glance off, or rebound.

Of faith - On the nature of faith, see the notes on [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md). Faith here is made to occupy a
more important place than either of the other Christian graces. It
bears, to the whole Christian character, the same relation which the
shield does to the other parts of the armor of a soldier. It protects
all, and is indispensable to the security of all, as is the case with
the shield. The shield was an ingenious device by which blows and arrows
might be parried off, and the whole body defended. It could be made to
protect the head, or the heart, or thrown behind to meet all attack
there. As long as the soldier had his shield, he felt secure; and as
long as a Christian has faith, he is safe. It comes to his aid in every
attack that is made on him, no matter from what quarter; it is the
defense and guardian of every other Christian grace; and it secures the
protection which the Christian needs in the whole of the spiritual war.

Wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked -
Or, rather, "of the wicked one" - τοῦ πονηροῦ tou ponērou. The allusion
is undoubtedly to the great enemy of the people of God, called, by way
of eminence, the "wicked one;" compare [Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md). Mr. Locke renders this, "Wherein
you may receive, and so render ineffectual," etc. There seems a little
incongruity in the idea of "quenching" darts by "a shield." But the word
"quench," here, means only that they would be "put out" by being thrown
"against" the shield, as a candle would by being thrown against
anything. "The fiery darts" that were used in war were small, slender
pieces of cane, which were filled with combustible materials, and set on
fire; or darts around which some combustible material was wound, and
which were set on fire, and then shot "slowly" against a foe. The object
was to make the arrow fasten in the body, and increase the danger by the
burning; or, more frequently, those darts were thrown against ships,
forts, tents, etc., with an intention to set them on fire. They were in
common use among the ancients. Arrian (Exped. Alexan. 11) mentions the
πυρφορα βελη purphora belē, the fire-bearing weapons; Thucydides (ii. c.
75), the πυρφοροι ὀΐστοι purphoroi oistoi, the fire-bearing arrows; and
Livy refers to similar weapons as in common use in war; lib. xxi. c. 8.
By the "fiery darts of the wicked," Paul here refers, probably, to the
temptations of the great adversary, which are like fiery darts; or those
furious suggestions of evil, and excitements to sin, which he may throw
into the mind like fiery darts. They are - blasphemous thoughts,
unbelief, sudden temptation to do wrong, or thoughts that wound and
torment the soul. In regard to them, we may observe:

\(1\) that they come suddenly, like arrows sped from a bow;

\(2\) they come from unexpected quarters, like arrows shot suddenly from
an enemy in ambush;

\(3\) they pierce, and penetrate, and torment the soul, as arrows would
that are on fire;

\(4\) they set the soul on fire, and enkindle the worst passions, as
fiery darts do a ship or camp against which they are sent.

The only way to meet them is by the "shield of faith;" by confidence in
God, and by relying on his gracious promises and aid. It is not by our
own strength; and, if we have not faith in God, we are wholly
defenseless. We should have a shield that we can turn in any direction,
on which we may receive the arrow, and by which it may be put out.

[Ephesians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 6:17</span></span>

And take the helmet - The helmet was a cap made of thick leather, or
brass, fitted to the head, and was usually crowned with a plume, or
crest, as an ornament. Its use was to guard the head from a blow by a
sword, or war-club, or battle-axe. The cuts will show its usual form.

Of salvation - That is, "of the hope of salvation;" for so it is
expressed in the parallel place in [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md). The idea is, that a well-founded
hope of salvation will preserve us in the day of spiritual conflict, and
will guard us from the blows which an enemy would strike. The helmet
defended the head, a vital part; and so the hope of salvation will
defend the soul, and keep it from the blows of the enemy. A soldier
would not fight well without a hope of victory. A Christian could not
contend with his foes, without the hope of final salvation; but,
sustained by this, what has he to dread?

And the sword - The sword was an essential part of the armor of an
ancient soldier. His other weapons were the bow, the spear, or the
battle-axe. But, without a sword, no soldier would have regarded himself
as well armed. The ancient sword was short, and usually two-edged, and
resembled very much a dagger.

Of the Spirit - Which the Holy Spirit furnishes; the truth which he has
revealed.

Which is the word of God - What God has spoken - his truth and promises;
see the notes on [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). It was
with this weapon that the Saviour met the tempter in the wilderness;
Matt. 4. It is only by this that Satan can now be met. Error and
falsehood will not put back temptation; nor can we hope for victory,
unless we are armed with truth. Learn, hence:

\(1\) That we should study the Bible, that we may understand what the
truth is.

\(2\) we should have texts of Scripture at command, as the Saviour did,
to meet the various forms of temptation.

\(3\) we should not depend on our own reason, or rely on our own wisdom.

A single text of Scripture is better to meet a temptation, than all the
philosophy which the world contains. The tempter can reason, and reason
plausibly too. But he cannot resist a direct and positive command of the
Almighty. Had Eve adhered simply to the Word of God, and urged his
command, without attempting to "reason" about it, sire would have been
safe. The Saviour [Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md), [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md),[Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md), met the tempter with the Word of
God, and he was foiled. So we shah be safe if we adhere to the simple
declarations of the Bible, and oppose a temptation by a positive command
of God. But, the moment we leave that, and begin to parley with sin,
that moment we are gone. It is as if a man should throw away his sword,
and use his naked hands only in meeting an adversary. Hence,

\(4\) we may seethe importance of training up the young in the accurate
study of the Bible. There is nothing which will furnish a better
security to them in future life, when temptation comes upon them, than
to have a pertinent text of Scripture at command. Temptation often
assails us so suddenly that it checks all "reasoning;" but a text of
Scripture will suffice to drive the tempter from us.

[Ephesians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 6:18</span></span>

Praying always - It would be well for the soldier who goes forth to
battle to pray - to pray for victory; or to pray that he may be prepared
for death, should he fall. But soldiers do not often feel the necessity
of this. To the Christian soldier, however, it is indispensable. Prayer
crowns all lawful efforts with success and gives a victory when nothing
else would. No matter how complete the armor; no matter how skilled we
may be in the science of war; no matter how courageous we may be, we may
be certain that without prayer we shall be defeated. God alone can give
the victory; and when the Christian soldier goes forth armed completely
for the spiritual conflict, if he looks to God by prayer, he may be sure
of a triumph. This prayer is not to be intermitted. It is to be always.
In every temptation and spiritual conflict we are to pray; see notes on
[Luk 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md).

With all prayer and supplication - With all kinds of prayer; prayer in
the closet, the family, the social meeting, the great assembly; prayer
at the usual hours, prayer when we are specially tempted, and when we
feel just like praying (see the notes, [Mat
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006).md) prayer in the form of
supplication for ourselves, and in the form of intercession for others.
This is, after all, the great weapon of our spiritual armor, and by this
we may hope to prevail.

"Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;

Prayer makes the Christian armor bright,

And Satan trembles when he sees.

The meanest saint upon his knees."

In the Spirit - By the aid of the Holy Spirit; or perhaps it may mean
that it is not to be prayer of form merely, but when the spirit and the
heart accompany it. The former idea seems, however, to be the correct
one.

And watching thereunto - Watching for opportunities to pray; watching
for the spirit of prayer; watching against all those things which would
hinder prayer; see the [Mat 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038.md),
note, 41, note; compare [Pe1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md).

With all perseverance - Never becoming discouraged and disheartened;
compare notes, [Luk 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md).

And supplication for all saints - For all Christians. We should do this:

\(1\) because they are our brethren - though they may have a different
skin, language, or name.

\(2\) because, like us, they have hearts prone to evil, and need, with
us, the grace of God.

\(3\) because nothing tends so much to make us love others and to forget
their faults, as to pray for them.

\(4\) because the condition of the church is always such that it greatly
needs the grace of God. Many Christians have backslidden; many are cold
or lukewarm; many are in error; many are conformed to the world; and we
should pray that they may become more holy and may devote themselves
more to God.

\(5\) because each day many a Christian is subjected to some special
temptation or trial, and though he may be unknown to us, yet our prayers
may benefit him.

\(6\) because each day and each night many Christians die. We may
reflect each night as we lie down to rest, that while we sleep, some
Christians are kept awake by the prospect of death, and are now passing
through the dark valley; and each morning we may reflect that "today"
some Christian will die, and we should remember them before God.

\(7\) because we shall soon die, and it will be a comfort to us if we
can remember then that we have often prayed for dying saints, and if we
may feel that they are praying for us.

[Ephesians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 6:19</span></span>

And for me - Paul was then a prisoner at Rome. He specially needed the
prayers of Christians:

\(1\) that he might be sustained in his afflictions; and,

\(2\) that he might be able to manifest the spirit which he ought, and
to do good as he had opportunity. Learn hence that we should pray for
the prisoner, the captive, the man in chains, the slave. There are in
this land (the United States) about ten thousand prisoners - husbands,
fathers, sons, brothers; or wives, mothers, daughters. True, they are
the children of "crime," but they are also the children of sorrow; and
in either case or both they need our prayers. There are in this land not
far from three million of slaves - and they need our prayers. They are
children of misfortune and of many wrongs; they are sunk in ignorance
and want and we; they are subjected to trials, and exposed to
temptations to the lowest vices. But many of them, we trust, love the
Redeemer; and whether they do or do not, they need an interest in the
prayers of Christians.

That utterance may be given unto me - Paul, though a prisoner, was
permitted to preach the gospel; see the notes, [Act
28:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md).

That I may open my mouth boldly - He was in Rome. He was almost alone.
He was surrounded by multitudes of the wicked. He was exposed to death.
Yet he desired to speak boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and to
invite sinners to repentance. A Christians in chains, and surrounded by
the wicked, may speak boldly, and "may" have hope of success - for Paul
was not an unsuccessful preacher even when a captive at Rome; see the
notes on [Phi 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md).

The mystery of the gospel - notes, [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md).

[Ephesians 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 6:20</span></span>

For which I am an ambassador in bonds - In chains (see the margin); or
in confinement. There is something especially touching in this. He was
"an ambassador" - sent to proclaim peace to a lost world. But he was now
in chains. An ambassador is a sacred character. No greater affront can
be given to a nation than to put its ambassadors to death, or even to
throw them into prison. But Paul says here that the unusual spectacle
was witnessed of an ambassador seized, bound, confined, imprisoned; an
ambassador who ought to have the privileges conceded to all such people,
and to be permitted to go everywhere publishing the terms of mercy and
salvation. See the word "ambassador" explained in the notes on [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md).

That therein - Margin, or "thereof." Greek, ἐν αὐτῷ en autō - "in it;"
that is, says Rosenmuller, in the gospel. It means that in speaking the
gospel he might be bold.

I may speak boldly - Openly, plainly, without fear; see the notes on
[Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md); [Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md), note; [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md), note; [Act
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003.md), note; [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md), note; [Act
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md), note; [Act
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026.md), note.

As I ought to speak - Whether in bonds or at large. Paul felt that the
gospel ought always to be Spoken with plainness, and without the fear of
man. It is remarkable that he did not ask them to pray that he might be
released. "Why" he did not we do not know; but perhaps the desire of
release did not lie so near his heart as the duty of speaking the gospel
with boldness It may be of much more importance that we perform our duty
aright when we are afflicted, or are in trouble, than that we should be
released.

[Ephesians 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 6:21</span></span>

But that ye also may know my affairs - May understand my condition, my
feelings, and in what I am engaged. To them it could not but be a
subject of deep interest.

And how I do - Greek, "What I do; that is how I am employed.

Tychicus - Tychicus was of the province of Asia, in Asia Minor, of which
Ephesus was the capital; see [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). It is not improbable that he was
of Ephesus, and that he was well known to the church there. He also
carried the letter to the Colossians [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md), and probably the Second Epistle
to Timothy; [Ti2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md). Paul also
proposed to send him to Crete to succeed Titus; [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md). He was high in the confidence
of: Paul, but it is not known when he was converted, or why he was now
at Rome. The Greeks speak of him as one of the seventy disciples, and
make him bishop of Colophon, in the province of Asia.

[Ephesians 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 6:22</span></span>

Whom I have sent unto you - The churches where Paul had preached, would
feel a great interest in his welfare. He was a prisoner at Rome, and it
was doubtful what the result would be. In this situation, he felt it
proper to despatch a special messenger to give information about his
condition; to state what was doing in Rome; to ask the prayers of the
churches; and to administer consolation to them in their various trials.
The same sentiment in regard to the embassy of Tychicus, is expressed in
the Epistle to the Colossians, [Col
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md). No small part of the
consolation which he would impart to them would be found in these
invaluable letters which he bore to them from the apostle.

[Ephesians 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 6:23</span></span>

Peace be to the brethren - The Epistle is closed with the usual
salutations. The expression "peace to you," was the common form of
salutation in the East (see the [Mat
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013.md) note; [Luk
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md) note; [Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md) note; compare [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md); [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md); [Jo3
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014).md), and is still the "salam" which
is used - the word "salam" meaning "peace."

And love with faith - Love united with faith; not only desiring that
they might have faith, but the faith which worked by love.

From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ - The Father and the Son
are regarded as equally the author of peace and love; compare notes on
[Co2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014.md).

[Ephesians 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 6:24</span></span>

Grace be, ... - note, [Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

That love our Lord Jesus Christ - see the notes on [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md).

In sincerity - Margin, "with incorruption." With a pure heart; without
dissembling; without hypocrisy. There could not be a more appropriate
close of the Epistle than such a wish; there will be nothing more
needful for us when we come to the close of life than the consciousness
that we love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. To writer and reader
may this be equally the inestimable consolation then! Better, far better
then will be the evidence of such sincere love, than all the wealth
which toil can gain, all the honors which the world can bestow - than
the most splendid mansion, or the widest fame. The subscription to this
Epistle, like those affixed to the other epistles, is of no authority,
but in this instance there is every reason to believe that it is
correct. Compare notes at the end of the Epistle to the Romans and 1
Corinthians.
