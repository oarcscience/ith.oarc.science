### [Proverbs Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 6:1</span></span>

Surety - The "pledge," or security for payment, which, for example,
David was to bring back from his brothers [Sa1
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018.md). So the word was used in the
primitive trade transactions of the early Israelites.

In the warnings against this suretyship, in the Book of Proverbs, we may
trace the influence of contact with the Phoenicians. The merchants of
Tyre and Zidon seem to have discovered the value of credit as an element
of wealth. A man might obtain goods, or escape the pressure of a
creditor at an inconvenient season, or obtain a loan on more favorable
terms, by finding security. To give such security might be one of the
kindest offices which one friend could render to another. Side by side,
however, with a legitimate system of credit there sprang up, as in later
times, a fraudulent counterfeit. Phoenician or Jewish money-lenders (the
"stranger") were ready to make their loans to the spendthrift. He was
equally ready to find a companion (the "friend") who would become his
surety. It was merely a form, just writing a few words, just "a clasping
of the hands" (see the marginal reference) in token that the obligation
was accepted, and that was all. It would be unfriendly to refuse. And
yet, as the teacher warns his hearers, there might be, in that moment of
careless weakness, the first link of a long chain of ignominy, galling,
fretting, wearing, depriving life of all its peace. The Jewish law of
debt, hard and stern like that of most ancient nations, aright be
enforced against him in all its rigour. Money and land might go, the
very bed under him might be seized, and his garment torn from his back
[Pro 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md); [Pro
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#027.md), the older and more lenient law
[Exo 22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md) having apparently fallen
into disuse. he might be brought into a life-long bondage, subject only
to the possible relief of the year of jubilee, when the people were
religious enough to remember and observe it. His wives, his sons, his
daughters might be sharers in that slavery [Neh
5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#003.md). It was doubtful whether he
could claim the privilege which under [Exo
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md) belonged to an Israelite slave
that had been bought. Against such an evil, no warnings could be too
frequent or to urgent.

Stricken thy hand - The natural symbol of the promise to keep a
contract; in this case, to pay another man's debts. Compare [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md); [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md); [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003.md); [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md).

[Proverbs 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 6:2</span></span>

Or, "If thou art snared ... if thou art taken," etc.

[Proverbs 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 6:3</span></span>

Better, "Do this now, O my son, and free thyself when thou hast come
into thy friend's house; go, how thyself down (perhaps "stamp with thy
foot," or "hasten"), press hotly upon thy friend. By persuasion, and if
need be, by threats, get back the bond which thou hast been entrapped
into signing:" The "friend" is, as before, the companion, not the
creditor.

[Proverbs 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 6:6</span></span>

The warning against the wastefulness of the prodigal is followed by a
warning as emphatic against the wastefulness of sloth. The point of
comparison with the ant is not so much the foresight of the insect as
its unwearied activity during the appointed season, rebuking man's
inaction at a special crisis [Pro 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004.md).
In [Pro 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025.md), the storing, provident
habit of the ant is noticed.

[Proverbs 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 6:7</span></span>

The words express the wonder with which the Hebrew observer looked on
the phenomena of insect life. "Guide," better captain, as in [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md). The Septuagint introduces here
a corresponding reference to the industry of the bee.

[Proverbs 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 6:11</span></span>

The similitude is drawn from the two sources of Eastern terror: the
"traveler," i. e., "the thief in the night," coming suddenly to plunder;
the "armed man," literally "the man of the shield," the armed robber.
The habit of indolence is more fatally destructive than these marauders.

[Proverbs 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 6:12</span></span>

A naughty person - literally, "a man of Belial," i. e., a worthless man
(see the [Deu 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013) note.md). This is the
portrait of the man who is not to be trusted, whose look and gestures
warn against him all who can observe. His speech is tortuous and crafty;
his wink tells the accomplice that the victim is already snared; his
gestures with foot and hand are half in deceit, and half in mockery.

[Proverbs 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 6:15</span></span>

The duper and the dupe shall share the same calamity.

[Proverbs 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 6:16</span></span>

A new section, but not a new subject. The closing words, "he that soweth
discord" ([Pro 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019.md), compare [Pro
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014).md), lead us to identify the sketch
as taken from the same character. With the recognized Hebrew form of
climax (see [Pro 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md), [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018.md), [Pro
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md); [Amo
1:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); 2; [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019).md), the teacher here enumerates six
qualities as detestable, and the seventh as worse than all (seven
represents completeness), but all the seven in this instance belong to
one man, the man of Belial [Pro 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012.md).

[Proverbs 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 6:21</span></span>

The thought of [Pro 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md) is carried
step further. No outward charm, but the law of obedience, shall give
safety to the traveler, when he sleeps or when he wakes.

[Proverbs 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 6:23</span></span>

Compare [Psa 119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md).

[Proverbs 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 6:24</span></span>

Evil woman - literally, "woman of evil." In reading what follows, it
must be remembered that the warning is against the danger of the sin of
the adulterous wife.

[Proverbs 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 6:25</span></span>

Eyelids - Possibly pointing to the Eastern custom of painting the eyes
on the outside with kohl so as to give brightness and languishing
expression.

[Proverbs 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 6:26</span></span>

The two forms of evil bring, each of them, their own penalty. By the one
a man is brought to such poverty as to beg for "a piece of bread"
(compare [Sa1 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036).md): by the other and
more deadly sin he incurs a peril which may affect his life. The second
clause is very abrupt and emphatic in the original; "but as for a man's
wife; she hunts for the precious life."
