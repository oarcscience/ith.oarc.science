### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 23:1</span></span>

Balaam, after the general custom of the pagan, prefaced his divinations
by sacrifice. In the number of the altars regard was probably had to the
number of the then known planets. Yet Balaam evidently intended his
sacrifice as an offering to the true God.

[Numbers 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 23:3</span></span>

Balaam apparently expected to mark some phenomenon in the sky or in
nature, which he would be able, according to the rules of his art, to
interpret as a portent. It was for such "auguries" (not as the King
James Version "enchantments" [Num
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023).md) that he now departed to watch;
contrast [Num 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001.md).

An high place - Or, "A bare place on the hill," as opposed to the high
place with its grove of trees.

[Numbers 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 23:4</span></span>

God met Balaam - God served His own purposes through the arts of Balaam,
and manifested His will through the agencies employed to seek it,
dealing thus with Balaam in an exceptional manner. To God's own people
auguries were forbidden [Lev 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md).

I have prepared seven altars - And therefore Balaam expected that God on
His part would do what was desired by the donor; compare [Num
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015.md) note.

[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 23:7</span></span>

Aram - Or, "highland." This term denotes the whole elevated region, from
the northeastern frontier of Palestine to the Euphrates and the Tigris.
The country between these streams was especially designated
"Aram-naharaim," or "Aram of the two rivers:" the Greeks called it
Mesopotamia; and here, according to [Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004.md), was Balaam's home. Compare [Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md) note.

[Numbers 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 23:9</span></span>

For from the top of the rocks ... - The "for" indicates the constraint
under which Balaam felt himself. He had been met by God in his own way;
from the cliff he had watched for the expected augury; and by the light
of this he here interprets, according to the rules of his art, the
destiny of Israel.

Dwell alone - i. e., apart from others, undisturbed by their tumults,
and therefore in safety and just security. Compare the same idea in
marginal reference; [Jer 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md); and
[Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md). This tranquility was
realized by the Israelites so long as they clave to God as their shelter
and protection. But the inward "dwelling alone" was the indispensable
condition of the outward "dwelling alone," and so soon as the influence
of the pagan world affected Israel internally, the external power of
paganism prevailed also. Balaam himself, when he eventually counseled
tempting the people into sin, acted upon the knowledge that God's
blessing and Israel's prosperity depended essentially on faithfulness to
God.

[Numbers 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 23:10</span></span>

The fourth part of Israel - i. e., each one of the four camps, into
which the host of Israel was divided (see Num. 2), seemed to swarm with
innumerable multitudes. Possibly Balaam could only see one camp. Balaam
bears testimony in this verse to the fulfillment of the promises in [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md); [Gen
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md).

The righteous - i. e., the ancestors of Israel, who "died in faith, not
having received the promises, but having seen them afar off" [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md). With their histories Balaam was
familiar, particularly with that of Abraham, "the righteous man" whom
God had "raised up from the east (and) called to His foot" [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md).

Let my last end be like his - Render rather, "last estate," for the
reference is not so much to the act of death, as to all that followed
upon it - to the future, in which the name and influence of the deceased
person would be perpetuated.

[Numbers 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 23:13</span></span>

Balak seems to hope that the prophet's words in [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md) reflected the impression
conveyed by the scene before him at the moment of the augury; and so
that the sight of a mere few straggling Israelites in the utmost part of
the camp might induce a different estimate of their resources and
prospects.

[Numbers 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 23:14</span></span>

The field of Zophim - Or, "of watchers." It lay upon the top of Pisgah,
north of the former station, and nearer to the Israelite camp; the
greater part of which was, however, probably concealed from it by an
intervening spur of the hill. Beyond the camp Balaam's eye would pass on
to the bed of the Jordan. It was perhaps a lion coming up in his
strength from the swelling of that stream (compare [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).md) that furnished him with the
augury he awaited, and so dictated the final similitude of his next
parable.

[Numbers 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 23:20</span></span>

I have received commandment to bless - literally, "I have received to
bless." The reason of his blessing lay in the augury which he
acknowledged, and in the divine overruling impulse which he could not
resist, not in any "commandment" in words.

[Numbers 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 23:21</span></span>

"Iniquity" and "perverseness" are found together again in the Hebrew of
[Psa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007.md); [Psa
90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md), and elsewhere; and import
wickedness together with that tribulation which is its proper result.

The shout - The word is used ([Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024) note.md) to describe the sound of
the silver trumpets. The "shout of a king" will therefore refer to the
jubilant sounds by which the presence of the Lord as their King among
them was celebrated by Israel.

[Numbers 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 23:22</span></span>

An unicorn - A wild bull, the now extinct Aurochs, formidable for its
size, strength, speed, and ferocity.

[Numbers 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 23:23</span></span>

Enchantment ... divination - More strictly "augury" and "soothsayer's
token," or the omen that was superstitiously observed. "Soothsayer" is
the term applied to Balaam in [Jos
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#022.md).

The verse intimates that the seer was at last, through the overruling of
his own auguries, compelled to own what, had he not been blinded by
avarice and ambition, he would have discerned before - that there Was an
indisputable interference of God on Israel's behalf, against which all
arts and efforts of man must prove vain. The sense suggested by margin
(i. e., that the soothsayer's art was not practiced in Israel) would be
strictly true (compare the [Num 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md)
note).

According ... - Rather, in due time it shall be told to Jacob, etc. God
will, through His own divinely appointed means (e. g. the Urim and
Thummim), reveal to Israel, as occasion may require, His will and
purposes.

[Numbers 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 23:28</span></span>

The position of Peor northward from Pisgah, along the Abarim heights, is
approximately determined by the extant notices of Beth-peor.

Jeshimon - was the waste, in the great valley below, where stood
Beth-jeshimoth, "the house of the wastes."
