### [Psalms Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 18:0</span></span>

This psalm is found, with some unimportant variations, in 2 Sam. 22. In
that history, as in the inscription of the psalm here, it is said to
have been composed by David on the occasion when the Lord "delivered him
from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul." There can,
therefore, be no doubt that David was the author, nor can there be any
as to the occasion on which it was composed. It is a song of victory,
and is beyond doubt the most sublime ode that was ever composed on such
an occasion. David, long pursued and harassed by foes who sought his
life, at length felt that a complete triumph was obtained, and that he
and his kingdom were safe, and he pours forth the utterances of a
grateful heart for God's merciful and mighty interposition, in language
of the highest sublimity, and with the utmost grandeur of poetic
imagery. Nowhere else, even in the sacred Scriptures, are there to be
found images more beautiful, or expressions more sublime, than those
which occur in this psalm.

From the place which this psalm occupies in the history of the life of
David (2 Sam. 22), it is probable that it was composed in the latter
years of his life, though it occupies this early place in the Book of
Psalms. We have no reason to believe that the principle adopted in the
arrangement of the Psalms was to place them in chronological order; and
we cannot determine why in that arrangement this psalm has the place
which has been assigned to it; but we cannot well be mistaken in
supposing that it was composed at a somewhat advanced period of the life
of David, and that it was in fact among the last of his compositions.
Thus, in the Book of Samuel, it is placed (1 Sam. 22) immediately
preceding a chapter (1 Sam. 23) which professes ([Sa1
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001).md) to record "the last words of
David." And thus in the title it is said to have been composed when "the
Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies," an event
which occurred only at a comparatively late period of his life.

The circumstance which is mentioned in the title - "and out of the hand
of Saul" - does not necessarily conflict with this view, or make it
necessary for us to suppose that it was composed immediately after his
deliverance from the hand of Saul. To David, recording and recounting
the great events of his life, that deliverance would occur as one of the
most momentous and worthy of a grateful remembrance, for it was a
deliverance which was the foundation of all his subsequent successes,
and in which the divine interposition had been most remarkable. At any
time of his life it would be proper to refer to this as demanding
special acknowledgment. Saul had been among the most formidable of all
his enemies. The most distressing and harassing events of his life had
occurred in the time of his conflicts with him. God's interpositions in
his behalf had occurred in the most remarkable manner, in delivering him
from the dangers of that period of his history.

It was natural and proper, therefore, in a general song of praise,
composed in view of all God's interpositions in his behalf, that he
should refer particularly to those dangers and deliverances. This
opinion, that the psalm was composed when David was aged, which seems so
obvious, is the opinion of Jarchi and Kimchi, of Rosenmuller and
DeWette. The strong imagery, therefore, in the psalm, describing mighty
convulsions of nature [Psa 18:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md), is
to be understood, not as a literal description, but as narrating God's
gracious interposition in the time of danger, "as if" the Lord had
spoken to him out of the temple; "as if" the earth had trembled; "as if"
its foundations had been shaken; "as if" a smoke had gone out of his
nostrils; "as if" he had bowed the heavens and come down; "as if" he had
thundered in the heavens, and had sent out hailstones and coals of fire,
etc.

From the fact that there are variations, though not of an essential
character, in the two copies of the psalm, it would seem not improbable
that it had been revised by David himself, or by some other person,
after it was first composed, and that one copy was used by the author of
the Book of Samuel, and the other by the collector and arranger of the
Book of Psalms. These variations are not important, and by no means
change the essential character of the psalm. It is not very easy to see
why they were made, if they were made designedly, or to account for them
if they were not so made. They are such as the following: The
introduction, or the title of it, is adapted, in the psalm before us, to
the purposes for which it was designed, when it was admitted into the
collection. "To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David, the servant of the
Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words," etc. The first verse of Ps.
18, "I will love thee, O Lord, my strength," is not found in the psalm
as it is in the Book of Samuel. The second verse of the psalm is, "The
Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength,
in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my
high tower."

In Samuel, the corresponding passage is, "The Lord is my rock, and my
fortress, and my deliverer; the God of my rock, in him will I trust; he
is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my
refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence." In [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md), the reading is, "The sorrows of
death compassed me" etc.; in Samuel, "The waves of death compassed me."
Similar variations, affecting the words, without materially affecting
the sense, occur in [Psa 18:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), [Psa
18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md), [Psa
18:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md), [Psa
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md), [Psa
18:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md), also in [Psa
18:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md), [Psa
18:32-45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md), and Ps. 18:47-51. See these
passages arranged in Rosenmuller's Scholia, vol. i., pp. 451-458. In no
instance is the sense very materially affected, though the variations
are so numerous.

It is impossible now to account for these variations. Hammond,
Kennicott, and others, suppose that they occurred from the errors of
transcribers. But to this opinion Schultens opposes unanswerable
objections. He refers particularly

\(a\) to the multitude and variety of the changes;

\(b\) to the condition or state of the codices;

\(c\) to the nature of the variations, or to the fact that changes are
made in words, and not merely in letters of similar forms which might be
mistaken for each other.

See his arguments in Rosenmuller, Schol., vol. i., pp. 441-443. It seems
most probable, therefore, that these changes were made by design, and
that it was done either by David, who revised the original composition.
and issued two forms of the poem, one of which was inserted in the
history in Samuel, and the other in the collection of the Psalms; or
that the changes were made by the collector of the Psalms, when they
were arranged for public worship. The former supposition is a possible
one; though, as the psalm was composed near the close of the life of
David, it would seem not to be very probable. The most natural
supposition, therefore, is, that the changes were made by the collector
of the Psalms, whoever he might be, or by the person who presided over
this part of public worship in the temple, and that the changes were
made for some reason which we cannot now understand, as better adapting
the psalm to musical purposes.

Doederlein supposes that the recension was made by some later poet, for
the purpose of "polishing" the language; of giving it a more finished
poetic form; and of adapting it better to public use; and he regards
both forms as "genuine, elegant, sublime; the one more ancient, the
other more polished and refined." It seems most probable that the
changes were made with a view to some rhythmical or musical effect, or
for the purpose of adapting the psalm to the music of the temple
service. Such changes would depend on causes which could be now little
understood, as we are not sufficiently acquainted with the music
employed in public worship by the Hebrews, nor are we now competent to
understand the effect which, in this respect, would be produced by a
slight change of phraseology. Variations of a similar nature now exist
in psalms and hymns which could not be well explained or understood by
one who was not familiar with our language and with our music, and
which, after as long an interval as that between the time when the
Psalms were arranged for musical purposes and the present time, would be
wholly unintelligible.

The psalm embraces the following subjects:

I. A general acknowledgment of God, and thanks to him, as the Deliverer
in the time of troubles, and as worthy to be praised, [Psa
18:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md).

II\. A brief description of the troubles and dangers from which the
psalmist had been rescued, [Psa
18:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md).

III\. A description, conceived in the highest forms of poetic language,
of the divine interposition in times of danger, [Psa
18:6-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md),

IV\. A statement of the psalmist that this interposition was of such a
nature as to vindicate his own character, or to show that his cause was
a righteous cause; that he was right, and that his enemies had been in
the wrong; that God approved his course, and disapproved the course of
his enemies: or, in other words, that these interpositions were such as
to prove that God was just, and would deal with men according to their
character, [Psa 18:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md).

V. A recapitulation of what God had done for him, in enabling him to
subdue his enemies, and a statement of the effect which he supposed
would be produced on others by the report of what God had done in his
behalf, [Psa 18:31-45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md).

VI\. A general expression of thanksgiving to God as the author of all
these blessings, and as worthy of universal confidence and praise, [Psa
18:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md).

Psalm 18:Title

"To the chief Musician." See the notes to the title of [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

A Psalm of David - The words "A Psalm" are not here in the original, and
may convey a slightly erroneous impression, as if the psalm had been
composed for the express purpose of being used publicly in the worship
of God. In the corresponding place in 2 Sam. 22, it is described as a
"Song" of David: "And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song."
It was originally an expression of his private gratitude for God's
distinguishing mercies, and was afterward, as we have seen, probably
adapted to purposes of public worship by some one of a later age.

The servant of the Lord - This expression also is wanting in 2 Sam. 22.
It is undoubtedly an addition by a later hand, as indicating the general
character which David had acquired, or as denoting the national estimate
in regard to his character. The same expression occurs in the title to
[Psa 36:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md). The Aramaic Paraphrase
translates this title: "To be sung over the wonderful things which
abundantly happened to the servant of the Lord, to David, who sang,"
etc. The use of the phrase here - "the servant of the Lord" - by him who
made the collection of the Psalms, would seem to imply that he regarded
the psalm as having a sufficiently public character to make it proper to
introduce it into a collection designed for general worship. In other
words, David was not, in the view of the author of the collection, a
private man, but was eminently a public servant of Yahweh; and a song of
grateful remembrance of God's mercies to him was entitled to be regarded
as expressing the appropriate feelings of God's people in similar
circumstances in all times.

Who spake unto the Lord - Composed it as giving utterance to his
feelings toward the Lord.

The words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him - When the
Lord "had" delivered him; when he felt that he was completely rescued
from "all" his foes. This does not mean that the psalm was composed on a
particular day when God had by some one signal act rescued him from
impending danger, but it refers to a calm period of his life. when he
could review the past, and see that God had rescued him from "all" the
enemies that had ever threatened his peace. This would probably, as has
been suggested above, occur near the close of his life.

From the hand of all his enemies - Out of the hand, or the power. There
is here a "general" view of the mercy of God in rescuing him from all
his foes.

And from the hand of Saul - Saul had been one of his most formidable
enemies, and the wars with him had been among the most eventful periods
of the life of David. In a general review of his life, near its close,
he would naturally recur to the dangers of that period, and to God's
gracious interpositions in his behalf, and it would seem to him that
what God had done for him in those times deserved a special record. The
original word here - כף kaph - is not the same as in the corresponding
place in 2 Sam. 22 - יד yâd - though the idea is substantially the same.
The word used here means properly the "palm" or "hollow" of the hand;
the word used in Samuel means the hand itself. Why the change was made
we have not the means of ascertaining.

And he said - So [Sa2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#002.md). What
follows is what he said.

[Psalms 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 18:1</span></span>

I will love thee, O Lord - This verse is not found in the song in 2 Sam.
22. It appears to have been added after the first composition of the
psalm, either by David as expressive of his ardent love for the Lord in
view of his merciful interpositions in his behalf, and on the most
careful and most mature review of those mercies, or by the collector of
the Psalms when they were adapted to purposes of public worship, as a
proper commencement of the psalm - expressive of the feeling which the
general tenor of the psalm was fitted to inspire. It is impossible now
to determine by whom it was added; but no one can doubt that it is a
proper commencement of a psalm that is designed to recount so many
mercies. It is the feeling which all should have when they recall the
goodness of God to them in their past lives.

My strength - The source of my strength, or from whom all my strength is
derived. So [Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md), "The Lord is
the strength of my life." [Psa 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md),
"he is the saving strength of his anointed." Compare [Psa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md); [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md); [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md); [Psa
81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001.md); [Psa
140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md).

[Psalms 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 18:2</span></span>

The Lord is my rock - The idea in this expression, and in the subsequent
parts of the description, is that he owed his safety entirely to God. He
had been unto him as a rock, a tower, a buckler, etc. - that is, he had
derived from God the protection which a rock, a tower, a citadel, a
buckler furnished to those who depended on them, or which they were
designed to secure. The word "rock" here has reference to the fact that
in times of danger a lofty rock would be sought as a place of safety, or
that men would fly to it to escape from their enemies. Such rocks abound
in Palestine; and by the fact that they are elevated and difficult of
access, or by the fact that those who fled to them could find shelter
behind their projecting crags, or by the fact that they could find
security in their deep and dark caverns, they became places of refuge in
times of danger; and protection was often found there when it could not
be found in the plains below. Compare [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md); [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); [Psa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002.md). Also, Josephus, Ant., b. xiv.,
ch. xv.

And my fortress - He has been to me as a fortress. The word fortress
means a place of defense, a place so strengthened that an enemy could
not approach it, or where one would be safe. Such fortresses were often
constructed on the rocks or on hills, where those who fled there would
be doubly safe. Compare [Job 39:28](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#028.md).
See also the notes at [Isa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016.md).

And my deliverer - Delivering or rescuing me from my enemies.

My God - Who hast been to me a God; that is, in whom I have found all
that is implied in the idea of "God" - a Protector, Helper, Friend,
Father, Saviour. The notion or idea of a "God" is different from all
other ideas, and David had found, as the Christian now does, all that is
implied in that idea, in Yahweh, the living God.

My strength - Margin, "My rock" So the Hebrew, although the Hebrew word
is different from that which is used in the former part of the verse.
Both words denote that God was a refuge or protection, as a rock or crag
is to one in danger (compare [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037).md), though the exact difference
between the words may not be obvious.

In whom I will trust - That is, I have found him to be such a refuge
that I could trust in him, and in view of the past I will confide in him
always.

My buckler - The word used here is the same which occurs in [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md), where it is translated "shield."
See the notes at that verse.

And the horn of my salvation - The "horn" is to animals the means of
their defense. Their strength lies in the horn. Hence, the word is used
here, as elsewhere, to represent that to which we owe our protection and
defense in danger; and the idea here is, that God was to the psalmist
what the horn is to animals, the means of his defense. Compare [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md); [Psa
75:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md); [Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010.md); [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md); [Psa
148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014.md).

And my high tower - He is to me what a high tower is to one who is in
danger. Compare [Pro 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md), "The name
of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is
safe." The word used here occurs in [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md), where it is rendered "refuge."
(Margin, "A high place.") See the notes at that verse. Such towers were
erected on mountains, on rocks, or on the walls of a city, and were
regarded as safe places mainly because they were inaccessible. So the
old castles in Europe - as that at Heidelberg, and generally those along
the Rhine - were built on lofty places, and in such positions as not to
be easily accessible.

[Psalms 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 18:3</span></span>

I will call upon the Lord - The idea here is, that he would constantly
call upon the Lord. In all times of trouble and danger he would go to
him, and invoke his aid. The experience of the past had been such as to
lead him to put confidence in him in all time to come. He had learned to
flee to him in danger, and he had never put his trust in him in vain.
The idea is, that a proper view of God's dealings with us in the past
should lead us to feel that we may put confidence in him in the future.

Who is worthy to be praised - More literally, "Him who is to be praised
I will call upon, Jehovah." The prominent - the leading thought is, that
God is a being every way worthy of praise.

So shall I be saved from my enemies - Ever onward, and at all times. He
had had such ample experience of his protection that he could confide in
him as one who would deliver him from all his foes.

[Psalms 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 18:4</span></span>

The sorrows of death compassed me - Surrounded me. That is, he was in
imminent danger of death, or in the midst of such pangs and sorrows as
are supposed commonly to attend on death. He refers probably to some
period in his past life - perhaps in the persecutions of Saul - when he
was so beset with troubles and difficulties that it seemed to him that
he must die. The word rendered "sorrows" - חבל chebel - means, according
to Gesenius, "a cord, a rope," and hence, "a snare, gin, noose;" and the
idea here is, according to Gesenius, that he was taken as it were in the
snares of death, or in the bands of death. So [Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003.md). Our translators, however, and
it seems to me more correctly, regarded the word as derived from the
same noun differently pointed - הבל chēbel - meaning "writhings, pangs,
pains," as in [Isa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007.md); [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md); [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md); [Job
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#003.md). So the Aramaic Paraphrase,
"Pangs as of a woman in childbirth came around me." So the Vulgate,
"dolores." So the Septuagint, ὠδῖνες ōdines. The corresponding place in
2 Sam. 22 is: "The waves of death." The word which is used there - משׁבר
mishbâr - means properly waves which break upon the shore - "breakers."
See [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md); [Psa
88:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#007.md); [Jon
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#003.md). Why the change was made in the
psalm it is not possible to determine. Either word denotes a condition
of great danger and alarm, as if death was inevitable.

And the floods of ungodly men - Margin, as in Hebrew, "Belial." The word
"Belial" means properly "without use or profit;" and then worthless,
abandoned, wicked. It is applied to wicked men as being "worthless" to
society, and to all the proper ends of life. Though the term here
undoubtedly refers to "wicked" men, yet it refers to them as being
worthless or abandoned - low, common, useless to mankind. The word
rendered floods - נחל nachal - means in the singular, properly, a
stream, brook, rivulet; and then, a torrent, as formed by rain and
snow-water in the mountains, [Job
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015.md). The word used here refers to
such men as if they were poured forth in streams and torrents - in such
multitudes that the psalmist was likely to be overwhelmed by them, as
one would be by floods of water. "Made me afraid." Made me apprehensive
of losing my life. To what particular period of his life he here refers
it is impossible now to determine.

[Psalms 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 18:5</span></span>

The sorrows of hell - Margin, "cords." The word used here is the same
which occurs in the previous verse, and which is there rendered
"sorrows." It is correctly translated here, as in that verse, "sorrows,"
though the parallelism would seem to favor the interpretation in the
margin - cords. If it means "sorrows," the idea is, that such sufferings
encompassed him, or seized upon him, as we associate in idea with the
descent to the under-world, or the going down to the dead. If it means
"cords, or bands," then the idea is, that he was seized with pain as if
with cords thrown around him, and that were dragging him down to the
abodes of the dead. Luther, DeWette, Prof. Alexander, Hengstenberg, and
others render the word, in each of these places, "bands." On the word
here rendered "hell," שׁאול she'ôl, see the notes at [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md). It means here the "under-world,
the regions of the dead." It is a description of one who was overcome
with the dread of death.

The snares of death - The word "snares" refers to the gins, toils, nets,
which are used in taking wild beasts, by suddenly throwing cords around
them, and binding them fast. The idea here is, that "Death" had thus
thrown around him its toils or snares, and had bound him fast.

Prevented me - The word used here in Hebrew, as our word "prevent" did
originally, means to "anticipate, to go before." The idea here is that
those snares had, as it were, suddenly rushed upon him, or seized him.
They came before him in his goings, and bound him fast.

[Psalms 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 18:6</span></span>

In my distress - This refers, most probably, not to any particular case,
but rather indicates his general habit of mind, that when he was in deep
distress and danger he had uniformly called upon the Lord, and had found
him ready to help.

I called upon the Lord - I prayed. That is, he invoked God to help him
in his trouble. He relied not on his own strength; he looked not for
human aid; he looked to God alone.

And cried unto my God - The word used here denotes an earnest cry for
help. Compare [Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md); [Job
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md).

He heard my voice out of his temple - That is, he, being in his temple,
heard my voice. The word rendered temple (compare the notes at [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md) cannot refer here to the temple
at Jerusalem, for that was built after the death of David, but it refers
either to heaven, considered as the temple, or dwelling-place of God, or
to the tabernacle, considered as his abode on earth. The sense is not
materially varied, whichever interpretation is adopted. Compare [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md).

And my cry came before him - He heard my cry. It was not intercepted on
the way, but came up to him.

Even into his ears - Indicating that he certainly heard it. Compare [Gen

[Psalms 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 18:7</span></span>

Then the earth shook and trembled - The description which follows here
is one of the most sublime that is to be found in any language. It is
taken from the fury of the storm and tempest, when all the elements are
in commotion; when God seems to go forth in the greatness of his majesty
and the terror of his power, to prostrate everything before him. We are
not to regard this as descriptive of anything which literally occurred,
but rather as expressive of the fact of the divine interposition, as if
he thus came forth in the greatness of his power. There is no
improbability indeed in supposing that in some of the dangerous periods
of David's life, when surrounded by enemies, or even when in the midst
of a battle, a furious tempest may have occurred that seemed to be a
special divine interposition in his behalf, but we have no distinct
record of such an event, and it is not necessary to suppose that such an
event occurred in order to a correct understanding of the passage. All
that is needful is to regard this as a representation of the mighty
interposition of God; to suppose that his intervention was as direct, as
manifest, and as sublime, as if he had thus interposed. There are
frequent references in the Scriptures to such storms and tempests as
illustrative of the majesty, the power, and the glory of God, and of the
manner in which he interposes on behalf of his people. See [Psa
144:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md); [Psa
46:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006.md); [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md); [Job
37:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md); [Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md); [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md); and particularly [Hab
3:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md). The description in Habakkuk
strongly resembles the passage before us, and both were drawn doubtless
from an actual observation of the fury of a tempest.

The foundations also of the hills moved - The mountains seemed to rock
on their foundations. In the corresponding place in [Sa2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#008.md) the expression is, "The
foundations of heaven moved and shook;" that is, that on which the
heavens seem to rest was agitated. Many suppose that the expression
refers to the mountains as if they bore up the heavens; but DeWette more
properly supposes that the reference is to the heavens as a building or
an edifice resting on foundations. Why the change was made in revising
the psalm from the "foundations of the heavens" to the "foundations of
the hills," it is impossible now to determine.

Because he was wroth - literally," Because it was inflamed (or
enkindled) to him;" that is, because he was angry. Anger is often
compared to a raging flame, because it seems to consume everything
before it. Hence, we speak of it as "heated," as "burning." So we say of
one that he is "inflamed by passion." The expression here is sublime in
the highest degree. God seemed to be angry, and hence, he came forth in
this awful manner, and the very earth trembled before him.

[Psalms 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 18:8</span></span>

There went up a smoke out of his nostrils - Margin, "by his;" that is,
as it is understood in the margin, the smoke seemed to be produced "by"
his nostrils, or to be caused by his breathing. The comparison,
according to Rosenmuller and DeWette, is derived from wild beasts when
excited with anger, and when their rage is indicated by their violent
breathing. Compare [Psa 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md); [Deu
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020.md); [Isa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005.md).

And fire out of his mouth devoured - That is, the clouds seemed to be
poured forth from his nostrils, and the lightning from his mouth. So in
[Hab 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005.md) : "Before him went the
pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet."

Coals were kindled by it - Everything seemed to glow and burn. The
lightning, that appeared to flash from his mouth, set everything on
fire. The heavens and the earth were in a blaze.

[Psalms 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 18:9</span></span>

He bowed the heavens also - He seemed to bend down the heavens - to
bring them nearer to the earth. "He inclines the canopy of the heavens,
as it were, toward the earth; wraps himself in the darkness of night,
and shoots forth his arrows; hurls abroad his lightnings, and wings them
with speed." Herder, Spirit of Hebrew Poetry (Marsh), ii. 157. The
allusion is still to the tempest, when the clouds ran low; when they
seem to sweep along the ground; when it appears as if the heavens were
brought nearer to the earth - as if, to use a common expression, "the
heavens and earth were coming together."

And came down - God himself seemed to descend in the fury of the storm.

And darkness was under his feet - A dark cloud; or, the darkness caused
by thick clouds. Compare [Nah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md),
"The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds
are the dust of his feet." [Deu 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md),
"the mountain burned ... with thick darkness." [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md), "these words the Lord spake out
of the thick darkness." [Psa 97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002.md),
"clouds and darkness are round about him." The idea here is that of
awful majesty and power, as we are nowhere more forcibly impressed with
the idea of majesty and power than in the fury of a storm.

[Psalms 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 18:10</span></span>

And he rode upon a cherub - Compare [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md), note; [Isa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016.md), note. The cherub in the
theology of the Hebrews was a figurative representation of power and
majesty, under the image of a being of a high and celestial nature,
"whose form is represented as composed from the figures of a man, ox,
lion, and eagle," Ezek. 1; 10. Cherubs are first mentioned as guarding
the gates of Paradise, [Gen 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md); then
as bearing the throne of God upon their wings through the clouds, Ezek.
1; 10; and also as statues or images made of wood and overlaid with
gold, over the cover of the ark, in the inner sanctuary of the
tabernacle, and of the temple, [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md) ff; [Kg1
6:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#023.md). Between the two cherubim in
the temple, the Shechinah, or visible symbol of the presence of God,
rested; and hence, God is represented as "dwelling between the
cherubim," [Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md); [Num
7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md); [Psa
99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md). The cherubim are not to be
regarded as real existences, or as an order of angels like the seraphim
[Isa 6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md), but as an imaginary
representation of majesty, as emblematic of the power and glory of God.
Here God is represented as "riding on a cherub;" that is, as coming
forth on the clouds regarded as a cherub (compare Ezek. 1), as if,
seated on his throne, he was borne along in majesty and power amidst the
storm and tempest.

And did fly - He seemed to move rapidly on the flying clouds.

Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind - Rapidly as the clouds
driven along by the wind. The "wings of the wind" are designed to
represent the rapidity with which the wind sweeps along. Rapid motion is
represented by the flight of birds; hence, the term wings is applied to
winds to denote the rapidity of their movement. The whole figure here is
designed to represent; the majesty with which God seemed to be borne
along on the tempest. Herder renders it, "He flew on the wings of the
storm."

[Psalms 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 18:11</span></span>

He made darkness his secret place - Herder has beautifully rendered this
verse,

"Now he wrapped himself in darkness;

Clouds on clouds enclosed him round."

The word rendered "secret place" - סתר sêther - means properly a hiding;
then something hidden, private, secret. Hence, it means a covering, a
veil. Compare [Job 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#014.md); [Job
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#015.md). In [Psa
81:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007.md) it is applied to thunder: "I
answered thee in the secret place of thunder;" that is, in the secret
place or retreat - the deep, dark cloud, from where the thunder seems to
come. Here the meaning seems to be, that God was encompassed with
darkness. He had, as it were, wrapped himself in night, and made his
abode in the gloom of the storm.

His pavilion - His tent, for so the word means. Compare [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md). His abode was in the midst of
clouds and waters, or watery clouds.

Round about him - Perhaps a more literal translation would be, "the
things round about him - his tent (shelter, or cover) - were the
darkness of waters, the clouds of the skies." The idea is that he seemed
to be encompassed with watery clouds.

Dark waters - Hebrew, darkness of waters. The allusion is to clouds
filled with water; charged with rain.

Thick clouds of the skies - The word rendered skies in this place -
שׁחקים shachaqiym - means, in the singular, dust, as being fine; then a
cloud, as a cloud of dust; then, in the plural, it is used to denote
clouds, [Job 38:37](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#037.md); and hence, it is
used to denote the region of the clouds; the firmament; the sky; [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md). Perhaps a not-inaccurate
rendering here would be, "clouds of clouds;" that is, clouds rolled in
with clouds; clouds of one kind rapidly succeeding those of another kind
- inrolling and piled on each other. There are four different kinds of
clouds; and though we cannot suppose that the distinction was accurately
marked in the time of the psalmist, yet to the slightest observation
there is a distinction in the clouds, and it is possible that by the use
of two terms here, both denoting clouds - one thick and dense, and the
other clouds as resembling dust - the psalmist meant to intimate that
clouds of all kinds rolled over the firmament, and that these
constituted the "pavilion" of God.

[Psalms 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 18:12</span></span>

At the brightness that was before him - From the flash - the play of the
lightnings that seemed to go before him.

His thick clouds passed - or, vanished. They seemed to pass away. The
light, the flash, the blaze, penetrated those clouds, and seemed to
dispel, or to scatter them. The whole heavens were in a blaze, as if
there were no clouds, or as if the clouds were all driven away. The
reference here is to the appearance when the vivid flashes of lightning
seem to penetrate and dispel the clouds, and the heavens seem to be
lighted up with a universal flame.

Hail-stones - That is, hailstones followed, or fell.

And coals of fire - There seemed to be coals of fire rolling along the
ground, or falling from the sky. In the corresponding place in [Sa2
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#013.md) the expression is, "Through the
brightness before him were coals of fire kindled." That is, fires were
kindled by the lightning. The expression in the psalm is more terse and
compact, but the reason of the change cannot be assigned.

[Psalms 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 18:13</span></span>

The Lord also thundered in the heavens - Thunder is often in the
Scriptures described as the voice of God. See the magnificent
description in [Psa 29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md); compare
[Job 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#009.md), "Canst thou thunder with a
voice like him?" So [Sa1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md); [Sa1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#018.md); [Psa
77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018.md); [Job
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md).

And the Highest gave his voice - God, the most exalted Being in the
universe, uttered his voice in the thunder; or, the thunder was his
voice.

Hail-stones, and coals of fire - Accompanying the thunder. The
repetition seems to be because these were such striking and constant
accompaniments of the storm.

[Psalms 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 18:14</span></span>

Yea, he sent out his arrows - The word arrows here probably refers to
the lightnings mentioned in the other clause of the verse. Those
lightnings scattered around, and accomplishing such destruction, seemed
to be arrows sent forth from the hand of God.

And scattered them - Herder refers this to the lightnings; DeWette, to
the enemies of the psalmist. The latter seems to be the more correct
interpretation, though the enemies of the psalmist are not here
particularly specified. They seem, however, to have been in his eye
throughout the psalm, for it was the victory achieved over them by the
divine interposition that he was celebrating throughout the poem.

And he shot out lightnings - As arrows; or, as from a bow.

And discomfited them - literally, to impel, to drive; then, to put in
commotion or consternation. The allusion is to an army whose order is
disturbed, or which is thrown into confusion, and which is, therefore,
easily conquered. The idea is that David achieved a victory over all his
enemies, as if God had scattered them by a storm and tempest.

[Psalms 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 18:15</span></span>

Then the channels of waters were seen - In [Sa2
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#016.md) this is, "And the channels of
the sea appeared." The idea is that, by the driving of the storm and
tempest, the waters were driven on heaps, leaving the bottom bare. In
the place before us the word used, "waters" - מים mayim - would denote
waters of any kind - seas, lakes, rivers; in the corresponding place in
2 Samuel, the word used - ים yâm - denotes, properly, the sea or the
ocean. The word rendered channels means a pipe or tube; then a channel,
or bed of a brook or stream, [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md);
[Eze 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md); and then the bottom of the
sea or of a river. The allusion is to the effect of a violent wind,
driving the waters on heaps, and seeming to leave the bed or channel
bare.

The foundations of the world were discovered - Were laid open; were
manifested or revealed. People seemed to be able to look down into the
depths, and to see the very foundations on which the earth rests. The
world is often represented as resting on a foundation, [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md); [Isa
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md); [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md); [Pro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md); see the note at [Job
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md).

At thy rebuke - At the expression of his anger or displeasure; as if
God, in the fury of the tempest, was expressing his indignation and
wrath.

At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils - At the breathing forth of
anger, as it were, from his nostrils. See the note at [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 18:16</span></span>

He sent from above - He interposed to save me. All these manifestations
of the divine interposition were from above, or from heaven; all came
from God.

He took me - He took hold on me; he rescued me.

He drew me out of many waters - Margin, great waters. Waters are often
expressive of calamity and trouble, [Psa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md); [Psa
69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md); [Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md); [Psa
124:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md). The meaning here is, that God
had rescued him out of the many troubles and dangers that encompassed
him, as if he had fallen into the sea and was in danger of perishing.

[Psalms 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 18:17</span></span>

He delivered me from my strong enemy - The enemy that had more power
than I had, and that was likely to overcome me. It is probable that the
allusion here in the mind of the psalmist would be particularly to Saul.

And from them which hated me - From all who hated and persecuted me, in
the time of Saul, and ever onward during my life.

For they were too strong for me - I had no power to resist them, and
when I was about to sink under their opposition and malice, God
interposed and rescued me. David, valiant and bold as he was as a
warrior, was not ashamed, in the review of his life, to admit that he
owed his preservation not to his own courage and skill in war, but to
God; that his enemies were superior to himself in power; and that if God
had not interposed he would have been crushed and destroyed. No man
dishonors himself by acknowledging that he owes his success in the world
to the divine interposition.

[Psalms 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 18:18</span></span>

They prevented me - They anticipated me, or went before me. See the note
at [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md). The idea here is that
his enemies came before him, or intercepted his way. They were in his
path, ready to destroy him.

In the day of my calamity - In the day to which I now look back as the
time of my special trial.

But the Lord was my stay - My support, or prop. That is, the Lord upheld
me, and kept me from falling.

[Psalms 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 18:19</span></span>

He brought me forth also into a large place - Instead of being hemmed in
by enemies, and straitened in my troubles, so that I seemed to have no
room to move, he brought me into a place where I had ample room, and
where I could act freely. Compare the note at [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

He delivered me - He rescued me from my enemies and my troubles.

Because he delighted in me - He saw that my cause was just, and he had
favor toward me.

[Psalms 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 18:20</span></span>

The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness - That is, he saw
that I did not deserve the treatment which I received from my enemies,
and therefore he interposed to save me. Compare the note at [Psa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md).

According to the cleanness of my hands - So far as my fellow-men are
concerned. I have done them no wrong.

Hath he recompensed me - By rescuing me from the power of my enemies. It
is not inconsistent with proper views of piety - with true humility
before God - to feel and to say, that so far as our fellow-men are
concerned, we have not deserved ill-treatment at their hands; and, when
we are delivered from their power, it is not improper to say and to feel
that the interposition in the case has been according to justice and to
truth.

[Psalms 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 18:21</span></span>

For I have kept the ways of the Lord - I have obeyed his laws. I have
not so violated the laws which God has given to regulate my conduct with
my fellow-men as to deserve to be treated by them as a guilty man.

And have not wickedly departed from my God - "I have not been a sinner
from my God;" an apostate; an open violator of his law. The treatment
which I have received, though it would be justly rendered to an open
violator of law, is not that which I have merited from the hand of man.

[Psalms 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 18:22</span></span>

For all his judgments - All his statutes, ordinances, laws. The word
judgment is commonly used in this sense in the Scriptures, as referring
to that which God has judged or determined to be right.

Were before me - That is, I acted in view of them, or as having them to
guide me. They were constantly before my eyes, and I regulated my
conduct in accordance with their requirements.

And I did not put away his statutes from me - I did not reject them as
the guide of my conduct.

[Psalms 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 18:23</span></span>

I was also upright before him - Margin, with. The meaning is that he was
upright in his sight. The word rendered upright is the same which in
[Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md) is rendered perfect. See the
note at that passage.

And I kept myself from mine iniquity - From the iniquity to which I was
prone or inclined. This is an acknowledgment that he was prone to sin,
or that if he had acted out his natural character he would have indulged
in sin - perhaps such sins as had been charged upon him. But he here
says that, with this natural proneness to sin, he had restrained
himself, and had not been deserving of the treatment which he had
received. This is one of those incidental remarks which often occur in
the Scriptures which recognize the doctrine of depravity, or the fact
that the heart, even when most restrained, is by nature inclined to sin.
If this psalm was composed in the latter part of the life of David (see
the introduction), then this must mean either

\(a\) that in the review of his life he felt it had been his general and
habitual aim to check his natural inclination to sin; or

\(b\) that at the particular periods referred to in the psalm, when God
had so wonderfully interposed in his behalf, he felt that this had been
his aim, and that he might now regard that as a reason why God had
interposed in his behalf.

It is, however, painfully certain that at some periods of his life - as
in the matter of Uriah - he did give indulgence to some of the most
corrupt inclinations of the human heart, and that, in acting out these
corrupt propensities, he was guilty of crimes which have forever dimmed
the luster of his name and stained his memory. These painful facts,
however, are not inconsistent with the statement that in his general
character he did restrain these corrupt propensities, and did "keep
himself from his iniquity" So, in the review of our own lives, if we are
truly the friends of God, while we may be painfully conscious that we
have often given indulgence to the corrupt propensities of our natures -
over which, if we are truly the children of God, we shall have repented
- we may still find evidence that, as the great and habitual rule of
life, we have restrained those passions, and have "kept ourselves" from
the particular forms of sin to which our hearts were prone.

[Psalms 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 18:24</span></span>

Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me - By delivering me from my
enemies. The divine interpositions in his behalf had been of the nature
of a reward or recompense.

According to my righteousness - As if I were righteous; or, his acts of
intervention have been such as are appropriate to a righteous life. The
psalmist does not say that it was on account of his righteousness as if
he had merited the favor of God, but that the interpositions in his
behalf had been such as to show that God regarded him as righteous.

According to the cleanness of my hands - See the note at [Psa
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md).

In his eyesight - Margin, as in Hebrew, before his eyes. The idea is
that God saw that he was upright.

[Psalms 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 18:25</span></span>

With the merciful - From the particular statement respecting the divine
dealings with himself the psalmist now passes to a general statement
(suggested by what God had done for him) in regard to the general
principles of the divine administration. That general statement is, that
God deals with men according to their character; or, that he will adapt
his providential dealings to the conduct of men. They will find him to
be such toward them as they have shown themselves to be toward him. The
word merciful refers to one who is disposed to show kindness or
compassion to those who are guilty, or to those who injure or wrong us.

Thou wilt show thyself merciful - Thou wilt evince toward him the same
character which he shows to others. It is in accordance with this that
the Saviour teaches us to pray, "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive
our debtors," [Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md). And in
accordance also with this he said, "For if ye forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses," [Mat 6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

With an upright man - literally, a perfect man. See [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md), where the same word is used in
the original, and rendered perfect. The idea is that of a man who is
consistent, or whose character is complete in all its parts. See the
note at [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md).

Thou wilt show thyself upright - Thou wilt deal with him according to
his character. As he is faithful and just, so will he find that he has
to do with a God who is faithful and just.

[Psalms 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 18:26</span></span>

With the pure - Those who are pure in their thoughts, their motives,
their conduct.

Thou wilt show thyself pure - They will find that they have to deal with
a God who is himself pure; who loves purity, and who will accompany it
with appropriate rewards wherever it is found.

And with the froward - The word used here - עקשׁ ‛iqqêsh - means
properly perverse; a man of a perverse and wicked mind. It is derived
from a verb - עקשׁ ‛âqash - which means, to turn the wrong way, to
wrest, to pervert. It would be applicable to a man who perverts or
wrests the words of others from their true meaning; who prevaricates or
is deceitful in his own conduct; who is not straightforward in his
dealings; who takes advantage of circumstances to impose on others, and
to promote his own ends; who is sour, harsh, crabbed, unaccommodating,
unyielding, unkind. It is rendered perverse in [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md); [Pro
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#008.md); [Pro
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001.md); [Pro
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#006.md); froward here, and in [Sa2
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#027.md); [Psa
101:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#004.md); [Pro
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#020.md); [Pro
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020.md); [Pro
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md); and crooked in [Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md). The word does not occur
elsewhere in the Old Testament.

Thou wilt show thyself froward - Margin, wrestle. In the corresponding
place in [Sa2 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#027.md) it is rendered,
"Thou wilt show thyself unsavory;" though the same word is used in the
original. In the margin in that place, as here, the word is wrestle. The
original word in each place - פתל pâthal - means to twist, to twine, to
spin; and then, to be twisted; to be crooked, crafty, deceitful. In the
form of the word which occurs here (Hithpael), it means, to show oneself
crooked, crafty, perverse. (Gesenius, Lexicon). It cannot mean here that
God would assume such a character, or that he would be crooked, crafty,
perverse in his dealings with men, for no one can suppose that the
psalmist meant to ascribe such a character to God; but the meaning
plainly is, that God would deal with the man referred to according to
his real character: instead of finding that God would deal with them as
if they were pure, and righteous, and merciful, such men would find that
he deals with them as they are - as perverse, crooked, wicked.

[Psalms 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 18:27</span></span>

For thou wilt save the afflicted people - From the particular tokens of
divine favor toward himself in affliction and trouble, the psalmist now
draws the general inference that this was the character of God, and that
others in affliction might hope for his interposition as he had done.

But wilt bring down high looks - Another general inference probably
derived from the dealings of God with the proud and haughty foes of the
psalmist. As God had humbled them, so he infers that he would deal with
others in the same way. "High looks" are indicative of pride and
haughtiness. Compare [Psa 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md); [Pro
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017.md); [Pro
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004.md); [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011) (notes.md); [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md); [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md).

[Psalms 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 18:28</span></span>

For thou wilt light my candle - Margin, lamp. The word lamp best
expresses the idea. In the Scriptures light is an image of prosperity,
success, happiness, holiness, as darkness is the image of the opposite.
See the notes at [Job 29:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002.md); compare
also [Job 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006.md); [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md); [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md); [Pro
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#020.md); [Psa
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md); [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md); [Isa
62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001.md). The meaning here is, that the
psalmist felt assured that God would give him prosperity, as if his lamp
were kept constantly burning in his dwelling.

The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness - Will shed light on my path,
which would otherwise be dark: will impart light to my understanding;
will put peace and joy in my heart; will crown me with his favor.
Compare the note at [Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md).

[Psalms 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 18:29</span></span>

For by thee I have run through a troop - Margin, broken. The word troop
here refers to bands of soldiers, or hosts of enemies. The word rendered
run through means properly to run; and then, as here, to run or rush
upon in a hostile sense; to rush with violence upon one. The idea here
is that he had been enabled to rush with violence upon his armed
opposers; that is, to overcome them, and to secure a victory. The
allusion is to the wars in which he had been engaged. Compare [Psa
115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md).

And by my God - By the help derived from God.

Have I leaped over a wall - Have I been delivered, as if I had leaped
over a wall when I was besieged; or, I have been able to scale the walls
of an enemy, and to secure a victory. The probability is that the latter
is the true idea, and that he refers to his successful attacks on the
fortified towns of his enemies. The general idea is, that all his
victories were to be traced to God.

[Psalms 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 18:30</span></span>

As for God - The declaration in this verse is suggested by the facts
narrated in the previous verses. The contemplation of those facts leads
the thoughts of the author of the psalm up to the Great Source of all
these blessings, and to these general reflections on his character. "As
for God," that is, in respect to that Great Being, who has delivered me,
his ways are all perfect; his word is tried; he is a shield to all those
who trust in him.

His way is perfect - That is, his doings are perfect; his methods of
administration are perfect; his government is perfect. There is nothing
wanting, nothing defective, nothing redundant, in what he does. On the
word perfect, see the note at [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md).

The word of the Lord is tried - Margin, refined. The idea is, that his
word had been tested as silver or any other metal is in the fire. The
psalmist had confided in him, and had found him faithful to all his
promises. Compare the note at [Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md). In a larger sense, using the
phrase the "word of the Lord" as denoting the revelation which God has
made to mankind in the volume of revealed truth, it has been abundantly
tested or tried, and it still stands. It has been tested by the friends
of God, and has been found to be all that it promised to be for support
and consolation in trial; it has been tested by the changes which have
occurred in the progress of human affairs, and has been found fitted to
meet all those changes; it has been tested by the advances which have
been made in science, in literature, in civilization, and in the arts,
and it has shown itself to be fitted to every stage of advance in
society; it has been tested by the efforts which men have made to
destroy it, and has survived all those efforts.

It is settled that it will survive all the revolutions of kingdoms and
all the changes of dynasties; that it will be able to meet all the
attacks which shall be made upon it by its enemies; and that it will be
an unfailing source of light and comfort to all future ages. If
persecution could crush it, it would have been crushed long ago; if
ridicule could drive it from the world, it would have been driven away
long ago; if argument, as urged by powerful intellect, and by learning,
combined with intense hatred, could destroy it, it would have been
destroyed long ago; and if it is not fitted to impart consolation to the
afflicted, to wipe away the tears of mourners, and to uphold the soul in
death, that would have been demonstrated long ago. In all these methods
it has been "tried," and as the result of all, it has been proved as the
only certain fact, in regard to a book as connected with the future -
that the Bible will go down accredited as a revelation from God to the
end of the world.

He is a buckler - Or, a shield, for so the original word means. See the
note at [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 18:31</span></span>

For who is God save the Lord? - Who is God except Yahweh? The idea is,
that no other being has evinced the power, the wisdom, and the goodness
which properly belong to the true God; or, that the things which are
implied in the true nature of God are found in no other being.

Or who is a rock save our God? - See [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md). There is no one who can furnish
such safety or defense; no one under whose protection we can be secure
in danger. Compare [Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031.md).

[Psalms 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 18:32</span></span>

It is God that girdeth me with strength - Who gives me strength. The
word girdeth contains an allusion to the mode of dress among the
orientals, the long flowing robe, which was girded up when they ran or
labored, that it might not impede them; and, probably, with the
additional idea that girding the loins contributed to strength. It is a
common custom now for men who run a race, or leap, or engage in a strife
of pugilism, to gird or bind up their loins. See [Job
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#007.md), note; and [Mat
5:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md), notes.

And maketh my way perfect - Gives me complete success in my
undertakings; or, enables me so to carry them out that none of them
fail.

[Psalms 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 18:33</span></span>

He maketh my feet like hinds' feet - So [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md), "He will make my feet like
hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places." The
hind is the female deer, remarkable for fleetness or swiftness. The
meaning here is, that God had made him alert or active, enabling him to
pursue a flying enemy, or to escape from a swift-running foe.

And setteth me upon my high places - places of safety or refuge. The
idea is, that God had given him security, or had rendered him safe from
danger. Compare [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md). Swiftness
of foot, or ability to escape from, or to pursue an enemy, was regarded
as of great value in ancient warfare. Achilles, according to the
descriptions of Homer, was remarkable for it. Compare [Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018.md); [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 18:34</span></span>

He teacheth my hands to war - Compare [Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md). The skill which David had in
the use of the bow, the sword, or the spear - all of which depends on
the hands - he ascribes entirely to God.

So that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms - This is mentioned as an
instance of extraordinary strength, as if he were able to break a bow
made of metal. The original word rendered steel means properly brass.
Wood was doubtless first used in constructing the bow, but metals came
afterward to be employed, and brass would naturally be used before the
manufacture of steel was discovered. Rosenmuller in loc.

[Psalms 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 18:35</span></span>

Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvations - Thou hast saved
me as with a shield; thou hast thrown thy shield before me in times of
danger. See the note at [Psa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md).

And thy right hand hath holden me up - Thou hast sustained me when in
danger of failing, as if thou hadst upheld me with thine own hand.

And thy gentleness hath made me great - Margin, "or, with thy meekness
thou hast multiplied me." The word here rendered gentleness, evidently
means here favor, goodness, kindness. It commonly means humility,
modesty, as applied to men; as applied to God, it means mildness,
clemency, favor. The idea is, that God had dealt with him in gentleness,
kindness, clemency, and that to this fact alone he owed all his
prosperity and success in life. It was not by any claim which he had on
God; it was by no worth of his own; it was by no native strength or
valor that he had been thus exalted, but it was wholly because God had
dealt kindly with him, or had showed him favor. So all our success in
life is to be traced to the favor - the kindness - of God.

[Psalms 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 18:36</span></span>

Thou hast enlarged my steps under me - The idea here is, "Thou hast made
room for my feet, so that I have been enabled to walk without hindrance
or obstruction. So in [Psa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md), "Thou
hast set my feet in a large room." The idea is, that he was before
straitened, compressed, hindered in his goings, but that now all
obstacles had been taken out of the way, and he could walk freely.

That my feet did not slip - Margin, mine ancles. The Hebrew word here
rendered in the text feet, and in the margin ancles, means properly a
joint; small joint; especially the ancle. The reference here is to the
ancle, the joint that is so useful in walking, and that is so liable to
be sprained or dislocated. The meaning is that he had been enabled to
walk firmly; that he did not limp. Before, he had been like one whose
ancles are weak or sprained; now he was able to tread firmly. The divine
favor given to him was as if God had given strength to a lame man to
walk firmly.

[Psalms 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 18:37</span></span>

I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them - He had not only routed
them, but had had strength to pursue them; he had not only pursued them,
but he had been enabled to come up to them. The idea is that of complete
success and absolute triumph.

Neither did I turn again - I was not driven back, nor was I weary and
exhausted, and compelled to give over the pursuit.

Till they were consumed - Until they were all either slain or made
captive, so that the hostile forces vanished. None of my enemies were
left.

[Psalms 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 18:38</span></span>

I have wounded them ... - I have so weakened them - so entirely
prostrated them - that they were not able to rally again. This does not
refer so much to wounds inflicted on individuals in the hostile ranks as
to the entire host or army. It was so weakened that it could not again
be put in battle array. The idea is that of successful pursuit and
conquest.

They are fallen under my feet - I have completely trodden them down - a
common mode of denoting entire victory, [Psa
119:118](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#118.md); [Isa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010.md); [Lam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md); [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md); [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md).

[Psalms 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 18:39</span></span>

For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle - See the note at
[Psa 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032.md). Compare [Job
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018.md); [Pro
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#017.md).

Thou hast subdued under me - Margin, as in Hebrew, caused to bow. That
is, God had caused them to submit to him; he had enabled him to overcome
them; still acknowledging that all this was from God, and that the
praise was due to Him, and not to the power of his own arm.

[Psalms 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 18:40</span></span>

Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies - Their necks to tread
upon, as the result of victory; or their necks to be subject to me, as
the neck of the ox is to his owner. The phrase is sometimes used in this
latter sense to denote subjection (compare [Jer
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md); but it is more commonly, when
applied to war, used in the former sense, as denoting complete triumph
or conquest. It was not uncommon to trample on the necks of those who
were overcome in battle. See [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md); [Eze
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002.md); [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md). The word used here - ערף ‛ôreph
- means properly neck, nape, the back of the neck; and hence, to give
the neck means sometimes to turn the back, as in flight; and the phrase
would admit of that meaning here. So Gesenius (Lexicon) understands it.
So also DeWette: "Thou turnest my enemies to flight." It seems to me,
however, that the more probable interpretation is that of complete
subjection - as when the conqueror places his foot on the necks of his
foes. This is confirmed by the next member of the sentence, where the
psalmist speaks of the complete destruction of those who hated him.

That I might destroy them that hate me - That have pursued and
persecuted me in this manner. The idea is that of utterly overcoming
them; of putting an end to their power, and to their ability to injure
him.

[Psalms 18:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 18:41</span></span>

They cried - They cried out for help, for mercy, for life. In modern
language, "they begged for quarter." They acknowledged that they were
vanquished, and entreated that their lives might be spared.

But there was none to save them - To preserve their lives. No help
appeared from their own countrymen; they found no mercy in me or my
followers; and God did not interpose to deliver them.

Even unto the Lord - As a last resort. People appeal to everything else
for help before they will appeal to God; often when they come to Him it
is by constraint, and not willingly; if the danger should leave them,
they would cease to call upon Him. Hence, since there is no real
sincerity in their calling upon God - no real regard for his honor or
his commands - their cries are not heard, and they perish. The course of
things with a sinner, however, is often such that, despairing of
salvation in any other way, and seeing that this is the only true way,
he comes with a heart broken, contrite, penitent, and then God never
turns away from the cry. No sinner, though as a last resort, who comes
to God in real sincerity, will ever be rejected.

But he answered them not - He did not put forth his power to save them
from my sword; to keep them alive when they were thus vanquished. Had
they cried unto him to save their souls, he would undoubtedly have done
it; but their cry was for life - for the divine help to save them from
the sword of the conqueror. There might have been many reasons why God
should not interpose to save them from the regular consequences of valor
when they had been in the wrong and had begun the war; but there would
have been no reason why he should not interpose if they had called upon
him to save them from their sins. There may be many reasons why God
should not save sinners from the temporal judgments due to their sins -
the intemperate from the diseases, the poverty, and the wretchedness
consequent on that vice - or the licentious from the woes and sorrows
caused by such a course of life; but there is no reason, in any case,
why God should not save from the eternal consequences of sin, if the
sinner cries sincerely and earnestly for mercy.

[Psalms 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 18:42</span></span>

Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind - As the fine
dust is driven by the wind, so they fled before me. There could be no
more striking illustration of a defeated army flying before a conqueror.
DeWette says correctly that the idea is, "I beat them small, and
scattered them as dust before the wind."

I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets - In the corresponding
place in [Sa2 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#043.md), this is, "I did
stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad." The
idea in the place before us is, that he poured them out, for so the
Hebrew word means, as the dirt or mire in the streets. As that is
trodden on, or trampled down, so they, instead of being marshalled for
battle, were wholly disorganized, scattered, and left to be trodden
down, as the most worthless object is. A similar image occurs in [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md), where God is speaking of
Sennacherib: "I will send him against an hypocritical nation ... to
tread them down like the mire of the streets."

[Psalms 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 18:43</span></span>

Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people - From the
contentions of the people; or, from the efforts which they have made to
overcome and subdue me. The allusion is to the efforts made by the
people, under the guidance of their leaders. It is not "strivings" among
his own followers, but the efforts, the strivings, the contentions of
his enemies, who endeavored to obtain the mastery over him, and to
subdue him.

Thou hast made me the head of the heathen - The head of the nations;
that is, the nations round about. In other words, he had, by the divine
aid, brought them into subjection to him, or so subdued them that they
became tributary to him. The word "heathen" with us expresses an idea
which is not necessarily connected with the original word. That word is
simply nations - גוים gôyim. It is true that those nations were pagans
in the present sense of the term, but that idea is not necessarily
connected with the word. The meaning is, that surrounding nations had
been made subject to him; or that he had been made to rule over them.
David, in fact, thus brought the surrounding people under subjection to
him, and made them tributary. In 2 Sam. 8 he is said to have subdued
Philistia, and Moab, and Syria, and Edom, in all of which countries he
put "garrisons," and all of which he made tributary to himself.

A people whom I have not known shall serve me - People that I had not
before heard of. This is the language of confident faith that his
kingdom would be still further extended, so as to embrace nations before
unknown to him. His past victories, and the fact that his kingdom had
been so established and was already so extended, justified the
expectation that it would still be further enlarged; that the fame of
his conquests would reach other nations, and that they would willingly
yield themselves to him. After the victories which he had achieved, as
celebrated in this psalm, that might be expected to follow as a matter
of course. It is the triumphant exultation of a conqueror, and it seems
to have been his expectation, not that his successors would extend the
empire, but, that other nations would become voluntarily subject to him.

[Psalms 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 18:44</span></span>

As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me - Margin, as in Hebrew,
At the hearing of the ear. That is, their submission will be prompt and
immediate. The fame of my victories will be such as to render resistance
hopeless; my fame, as at the head of a mighty empire, will be such as to
lead them to desire my friendship and protection.

The strangers - Margin, as in Hebrew, The sons of the stranger. The word
refers to foreigners, to those of other nations. His name and deeds
would inspire such respect, or create such a dread of his power, that
they would be glad to seek his friendship, and would readily submit to
his dominion.

Shall submit themselves unto me - Margin, yield feigned obedience. The
Hebrew word used here - כחשׁ kâchash - means properly to lie, to speak
lies; then, to deceive, or disappoint; then, to feign, to flatter, to
play the hypocrite. It is manifestly used in this sense here, as
referring to those who, awed by the terror of his name and power, would
come and profess subjection to him as a conqueror. Yet the use of the
word here implies that he was aware that, in many cases, this would be
only a feigned submission, or that the homage would be hypocritical;
homage inspired by terror, not by love. Undoubtedly, much of the
professed subjection of conquered nations is of this kind, and it would
be well if all conquerors understood this as David did. He accepted,
indeed, the acquiescence and the submission, but he understood the
cause; and this knowledge would only tend to make his throne more
secure, as it would save him from putting confidence or trust where
there was no certainty that it would be well placed.

Toward David as a sovereign there was much real loyalty, but there was
also much professed allegiance that was false and hollow; allegiance
which would endure only while his power lasted, and which would only
wait for an opportunity to throw off the yoke. In respect to God, also,
there are not a few who "feignedly submit" to him, or who yield feigned
obedience. They, too, are awed by his power. They know that he is able
to destroy. They see the tokens of his greatness and majesty, and they
come and profess submission to him - a submission founded on terror, not
on love; a submission which would cease at once could they be assured of
safety if they should renounce their allegiance to him. And as David was
not ignorant of the fact that not a little of the professed submission
to him was false and feigned - so, in a much higher sense - in a much
more accurate manner - God is aware of the fact that many who profess to
be subject to him are subject in profession only; that if they could do
it with safety, they would throw off the very appearance of loyalty, and
carry out in reality what exists in their hearts. It must have been sad
for David to reflect how greatly the number of his professed subjects
might have been diminished, if none had been retained but those who
truly loved his reign, and respected him as a sovereign; it is sad to
reflect how greatly the number of the professed friends of God would be
diminished, if all those should withdraw who have yielded only reigned
obedience to him! Yet the Church would be the better and the stronger
for it.

[Psalms 18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 18:45</span></span>

The strangers shall fade away - Hebrew, "The sons of the stranger." That
is, foreigners. The word rendered fade away - נבל nâbêl - means properly
to wilt, wither, fall away, as applicable to flowers, leaves, or plants,
[Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Psa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md); [Isa
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030.md); [Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md). Here it means that those foreign
nations would diminish in numbers and in power, until they should wholly
disappear. The idea is, that all his foes would vanish, and that he and
his kingdom would be left in peace.

And be afraid out of their close places - The word rendered be afraid
means to tremble - as those do who are in fear. The word rendered close
places means places that are shut up or enclosed, as fortified cities or
fortresses. The reference is to their places of retreat, towns, castles,
fortresses. The meaning is, that they would find such places to be no
security, and would tremble out of them; that is, they would flee out of
them in consternation and alarm. The general thought is that of ultimate
complete security for himself and his kingdom, or entire deliverance
from all his enemies.

[Psalms 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 18:46</span></span>

The Lord liveth - Yahweh - the name used here - is often described as
the living God in contradistinction to idols, who are represented as
without life, [Deu 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026.md); [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md); [Kg2
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004.md); [Psa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002.md); [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md); [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md). Compare [Psa
115:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#005.md); [Psa
135:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016.md). It is probably in allusion to
this idea that the phrase "The Lord liveth" is used here. It is a joyful
exclamation in view of all that God had done; of all the deliverances
which he had performed for the author of the psalm. In the remembrance
of all this the psalmist says that God had shown himself to be the
living, that is, the true God. These interpositions furnished abundant
demonstration that Yahweh existed, and that he was worthy of adoration
and praise as the true God. So, in view of mercy and salvation, the
heart of the redeemed exultingly exclaims, "The Lord lives - there is a
living God."

And blessed be my Rock - God, who has shown himself to be a refuge and a
protector. See the note at [Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md).

And let the God of my salvation be exalted - The God who has saved me
from my enemies. Let him be exalted, be praised, be honored, be adored.
Let his name be exalted above all idol gods; above all the creatures
that he has made. The wish is, that His name might be made prominent;
that all creatures might praise and honor Him.

[Psalms 18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 18:47</span></span>

It is God that avengeth me - Margin, giveth avengements for me. The
marginal reading is a literal translation of the Hebrew. The meaning is,
that God had punished the enemies of the author of the psalm for all the
wrongs which they had done to him. Compare [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).

And subdueth the people under me - Margin, destroyeth. The idea is that
he had subdued the nations so that they became obedient to him. The
primary notion of the word used here - from דבר dâbar - is to set in a
row; to range in order; to connect; to lead; to guide; - then, to reduce
to order; to subdue. This God had done in respect to the nations.
Instead of being rebellious and tumultuous, God had reduced them to
obedience, and had thus set him over a kingdom where all were subject to
order and to law.

[Psalms 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 18:48</span></span>

He delivereth me from mine enemies - From all my foes.

Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me - So that I
triumph over them. Instead of being subdued by them, and trampled under
their feet, I am exalted, and they are humbled.

Thou hast delivered me from the violent man - Margin, as in Hebrew, man
of violence; the man characterized by injustice and wrong; the man who
endeavored to overcome and subdue me by force and arms. There is
probably a special allusion here by the psalmist to Saul as his great
enemy, but perhaps he had also in his eye others of the same kind, and
the meaning may be that he had been delivered from all of that class of
people.

[Psalms 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 18:49</span></span>

Therefore will I give thanks unto thee - Margin, confess. The Hebrew
word - ידה yâdâh - in the form used here, means properly to profess, to
confess, to acknowledge; then especially to acknowledge or recognize
blessings and favors; in other words, to give thanks, to praise. The
idea here is that he would make a public acknowledgment of those
blessings which he had received; or that he would cause the remembrance
of them to be celebrated among the nations.

Among the heathen - Among the nations. See the note at [Psa
18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md). The meaning here is, that he
would cause these blessings to be remembered by making a record of them
in this song of praise; a song that would be used not only in his own
age and in his own country, but also among other nations, and in other
times. He would do all in his power to make the knowledge of these
favors, and these proofs of the existence of the true God, known abroad
and transmitted to other times. The apostle Paul uses this language [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md) as expressing properly the fact
that the knowledge of God was to be communicated to the "Gentiles:" "As
it is written, For this cause will I confess to thee among the
Gentiles." The word "heathen" or nations, in the passage before us,
corresponds precisely with the meaning of the word Gentiles; and Paul
has used the language of the psalm legitimately and properly as showing
that it was a doctrine of the Old Testament that the truths of religion
were not to be confined to the Jews, but were to be made known to other
nations.

And sing praises unto thy name - Unto thee; the name often being used to
denote the person. The meaning is, that he would cause the praises of
God to be celebrated among foreign or pagan nations, as the result of
what God had done for him. Far, probably, very far beyond what David
anticipated when he penned this psalm, this has been done. The psalm
itself has been chanted by million who were not in existence, and in
lands of which the psalmist had no knowledge; and, connected as it has
been with the other psalms in Christian worship, it has contributed in
an eminent degree to extend the praises of God far in the earth, and to
transmit the knowledge of him to generations as they succeeded one
another. What David anticipated is, moreover, as yet only in the
progress of fulfillment. Millions not yet born will make use of the
psalm, as million have done before, as the medium of praise to God; and
down to the most distant times this sacred song, in connection with the
others in the Book of Psalms, will contribute to make God known in the
earth, and to secure for him the praises of mankind.

[Psalms 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 18:50</span></span>

Great deliverance giveth he to his king - To David, as king. The word in
the original, which is rendered "deliverance," means properly
salvations, and is here in the plural number. It refers not to one act
of divine interposition, but to the many acts (referred to in the psalm)
in which God had interposed to save him from danger and from death. The
phrase "to his king" refers to the fact that God had appointed him to
reign, and to administer the government for him. He did not reign on his
own account, but he reigned for God, and with a view to do his will.

And showeth mercy to his anointed - To him who had been set apart to the
kingly office by a solemn act of anointing. Compare [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md); [Sa2
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004.md); [Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md), [Sa2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md); [Sa2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007.md); compare [Kg2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#003.md), [Kg2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006.md),[Kg2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#012.md). It is in allusion to this custom
that the Messiah is called the Anointed, or the Christ. See the note at
[Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

To David, and to his seed - To his descendants, or posterity. There is
an undoubted reference here to the promises made to David in regard to
his successors on the throne. See [Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md), [Sa2
7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025.md), and Ps. 89:19-37.

Forevermore - This expresses the confident expectation of David that the
government would remain in his family to the latest times. This
expectation was founded on such promises as that in [Sa2
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md) : "I will set up thy seed
after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish
his kingdom; he shall build an house for my name, and I will establish
the throne of his kingdom forever." Also [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md) : "And thine house and thy
kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be
established forever." See also [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md) : "His seed shall endure
forever, and his throne as the sun before me." The perpetuity of this
kingdom is found, in fact, in the reign of the Messiah, a descendant of
David, in whose eternal reign these promises will receive an ample
fulfillment. See [Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md). Compare
[Luk 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md). The temporal reign
passed wholly away in the process of time from the descendants of David;
the spiritual reign is perpetual in the Messiah. How far David
understood this it is not important to inquire, and it would be
impossible to determine. It is sufficient for the proper understanding
of the place to remember

\(a\) that there will have been a strict fulfillment of the promise,
according to the full import of the language, in the Messiah, the Son of
David; and

\(b\) that, however this may have been understood by David who recorded
the promise, the real author of the promise was the Holy Spirit, and
that the real meaning of the promise, as thus recorded, was that it
should be fulfilled as it has been.

In this, as in all other cases, the inquiry to be made in interpreting
the language is not how the sacred penman understood it, but what was
meant by the real author, the Spirit of God - and whether the
prediction, according to that meaning, has been fulfilled. When a man
employs an amanuensis, the inquiry in regard to what is written is not
how the amanuensis understood it, but how he who dictated what was
written intended it should be understood. Applying this principle, the
prediction here and elsewhere, in regard to the perpetuity of the reign
of David and his posterity, has been, and is, fulfilled in the most
ample manner. "Great David's greater Son" shall reign forever and ever.
