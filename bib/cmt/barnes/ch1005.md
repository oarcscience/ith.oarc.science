### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

His birthright was given ... - In particular, the right of the
first-born to a double inheritance [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017) was conferred on Joseph, both by
the expressed will of Jacob [Gen 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022)
and in the actual partition of Canaan Josh. 16-17. But though the
birthright, as respecting its material privileges, passed to Joseph, its
other rights, those of dignity and pre-eminence, fell to Judah; of whom
came the chief ruler, an allusion especially to David, though it may
reach further, and include a glance at the Messiah, the true "Ruler" of
Israel [Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).

[1 Chronicles 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 5:4</span></span>

The sons of Joel - The line of succession here given must be broken by
one great gap or several smaller ones, since nine generations before
Tiglath-pileser would carry us back no further than the reign of
Rehoboam.

[1 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 5:9</span></span>

He inhabited - i. e. Reuben. Eastward the Reubenites inhabited as far as
the commencement of the great Syrian Desert, which extended all the way
from the river Euphrates to their borders.

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

The "Hagarites" or "Hagarenes" are generally regarded as descendants of
Hagar, and a distinct branch of the Ishmaelites [Ch1
27:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#030); [Psa
83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006). They appear to have been one of
the most wealthy [Ch1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#021) and
widely-spread tribes of the Syrian Desert, being found on the side of
the Euphrates in contact with the Assyrians, and also in the Hauran, in
the neighborhood of Palestine, in contact with the Moabites and
Israelites. If identical with the Agraei of the Classical writers, their
name may be considered as still surviving in that of the district called
Hejer or Hejera in northeastern Arabia, on the borders of the Persian
Gulf. A full account of the war is given in [Ch1
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018).

[1 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 5:11</span></span>

From this passage and from the subsequent account of the Manassites [Ch1
5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023), the Gadites extended
themselves to the north at the expense of their brethren, gradually
occupying a considerable portion of the tract originally allotted to the
"half tribe."

[1 Chronicles 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 5:17</span></span>

The writer refers here to two registrations, one made under the
authority of Jeroboam II when he was king and Israel flourishing, the
other made under the authority of Jotham, king of Judah, during the
troublous time which followed on the great invasion of Tiglath-pileser.
There is nothing surprising in a king of Judah having exercised a
species of lordship over the trans-Jordanic territory at this period.

[1 Chronicles 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 5:19</span></span>

Jetur no doubt gave his name to the important tribe of the Ituraeans who
inhabited the region southwest of the Damascene plain, between
Gaulonitis (Jaulan) and the Ledjah. This tribe was noted for its
thievish habits, and was regarded as savage and warlike.

[1 Chronicles 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 5:23</span></span>

"Baal-Hermon," "Senir" [Deu 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009), and
"Mount Hermon," are here not so much three names of the one great
snow-clad eminence in which the Anti-Lebanon terminates toward the
south, as three parts of the mountain - perhaps the "three summits" in
which it terminates.

[1 Chronicles 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 5:26</span></span>

"Habor" here seems to be a city or a district, and not a river, as in
marginal reference There is some reason to believe that districts among
the Assyrians were occasionally named from streams.

Hara is probably the same as "Haran" [Gen
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031); [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012); [Eze
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023), being a softening down of the
rugged original "Kharan."
