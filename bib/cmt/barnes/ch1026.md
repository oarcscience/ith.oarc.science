### [1 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 26:1</span></span>

The porters - See [Ch1 9:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md); [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md).

[1 Chronicles 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 26:4</span></span>

Obed-edom and Hosah [Ch1 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#010.md) had
been "porters," or door - keepers, from the time of the bringing up of
the ark into Jerusalem [Ch1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024.md);
[Ch1 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md).

[1 Chronicles 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 26:12</span></span>

This verse is obscure, but its probable meaning is the following: "To
these divisions of the porters, principal men, (were assigned) the
watches, together with their brethren, for service in the house of the
Lord;" i. e., the "chief men" [Ch1
26:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001.md), amounting to no more than 93,
kept the watch and ward of the house, together with a further number of
their brethren (4,000, [Ch1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005).md), who
assisted them from time to time.

[1 Chronicles 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 26:15</span></span>

The house of Asuppim - literally, "the house of collections" (see the
margin and compare [Neh 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#025) margin.md).
A treasure-house of some kind or other is probably intended.

[1 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 26:16</span></span>

All recent commentators seem to be agreed that the words "to Shuppim"
ought to be cancelled, the name having arisen from an accidental
repetition of the preceding word, "Asuppim."

The gate Shallecheth - literally, "the gate of projection" - the gate,
i. e., through which were "thrown out" the sweepings of the temple, the
ashes, the offal of the victims, and the like.

The causeway of the going up - Compare the marginal reference note.

Ward against ward - Or, "watch opposite to watch." Hosah had in charge
both the western gate of the temple, and also the gate Shallecheth,
which was in the outer wall, opposite. Hence, he had to keep two
watches, one over against the other.

[1 Chronicles 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 26:17</span></span>

Toward Asuppim two and two - It is conjectured that the "store-house" in
question ([Ch1 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#015) note.md) had two
doors, to each of which two porters were appointed.

[1 Chronicles 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 26:18</span></span>

"Parbar" must designate here the space between the western wall of the
temple building and the wall of the court, which would be a sort of
"precinct" or "purlieu" of the temple ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011) note.md). Here were two gates, at
one of which two guards were stationed; while at the Shallecheth, which
gave upon the causeway, there were four. In this whole account, the
temple is spoken of as if it were existing, when it was not as yet
built. We must suppose that David formed the whole plan of the temple,
and fixed the stations and numbers of the porters, though it was left
for Solomon to carry out his instructions.

[1 Chronicles 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 26:19</span></span>

The divisions of the porters - The account of the porters here given
makes them only twenty-four in number at any one time; [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md) states that the duty was
discharged by 4,000 persons. Perhaps of the 93 chief porters here spoken
of [Ch1 26:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#008.md), [Ch1
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#011.md), [Ch1
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#024.md) were always on guard as
officers, while of the remaining 3,907, a certain proportion were each
day on duty as their subordinates.

[1 Chronicles 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 26:28</span></span>

The foundations of a sacred treasury had therefore been laid as far back
as the time of Samuel, when the Israelites began to recover from their
last servitude. Such a treasury had been once before established,
namely, under Joshua [Jos 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#024.md); but it
appears to have been soon exhausted, and we hear nothing of it under any
of the later judges until Samuel.

[1 Chronicles 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 26:30</span></span>

The "business of the Lord" in the provinces would consist especially in
the collection of the tithes, the redemption-money, and the free-will
offerings of the people. It may perhaps have included some religious
teaching. Compare [Ch2 17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007.md).

[1 Chronicles 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 26:32</span></span>

Rulers - This term is somewhat too strong. The same kind of office was
assigned to Jerijah and his brethren in the trans-Jordanic region as to
Hashabiah and his brethren in western Palestine [Ch1
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#030.md), namely, a superintendence over
religious matters and over the interests of the king.
