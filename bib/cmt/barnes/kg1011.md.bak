### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 11:1</span></span>

In noticing successively Solomon's excessive accumulation of silver and
gold [Kg1 10:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md), his multiplication
of horses [Kg1 10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md), and his
multiplication of wives, the writer has in mind the warning of Moses
against these three forms of princely ostentation, all alike forbidden
to an Israelite monarch (marginal reference).

Zidonians - i. e., Phoenician women. A tradition states that Solomon
married a daughter of Hiram, king of Tyre.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 11:2</span></span>

Ye shall not go in unto them ... - These words are not a quotation from
the Pentateuch. They merely give the general meaning of the two passages
prohibiting intermarriage with neighboring idolators (marginal
references). Strictly speaking, the prohibition in the Law of
intermarriage was confined to the Canaanite nations. But the principle
of the prohibition applied equally to the Moabites, Ammonites, and
Edomites who all bordered on the holy land; and was so applied by Ezra
[Ezr 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md) and Nehemiah [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 11:3</span></span>

These numbers seem excessive to many critics, and it must be admitted
that history furnishes no parallel to them. In [Sol
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008.md) the number of Solomon's legitimate
wives is said to be sixty, and that of his concubines eighty. It is,
perhaps probable, that the text has in this place suffered corruption.
For "700" we should perhaps read "70."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 11:4</span></span>

Old - About fifty or fifty-five. From his age at his accession ([Kg1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002) note.md) he could not have been more
than about sixty at his death.

The true nature of Solomon's idolatry was neither complete apostasy - an
apostasy from which there could be no recovery; nor a mere toleration,
rather praise-worthy than blameable. Solomon did not ever openly or
wholly apostatize. He continued his attendance on the worship of Yahweh,
and punctually made his offerings three times a year in the temple [Kg1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025.md); but his heart was not "perfect"
with God. The religious earnestness of his younger days was weakened by
wealth, luxury, sensualism, an increasing worldliness leading him to
worldly policy and latitudinarianism arising from contact with all the
manifold forms of human opinion. His lapse into deadly sin was no doubt
gradual. Partly from ostentation, partly from that sensualism which is
the most common failing of Oriental monarchs, he established a harem on
a grand and extraordinary scale. To gratify "strange women," i. e.,
foreigners, admitted either from worldly policy, or for variety's sake,
he built magnificent temples to their false gods, right over against
Jerusalem, as manifest rivals to "the temple." He thus became the author
of a syncretism, which sought to blend together the worship of Yahweh
and the worship of idols - a syncretism which possessed fatal
attractions for the Jewish nation. Finally, he appears himself to have
frequented the idol temples [Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md),
[Kg1 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#010.md), and to have taken part in
those fearful impurities which constituted the worst horror of the
idolatrous systems, thus practically apostatising, though theoretically
he never ceased to hold that Yahweh was the true God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 11:5</span></span>

Went after - This expression is common in the Pentateuch, and always
signifies actual idolatry (see [Deu
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#028.md); [Deu
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002.md); [Deu
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#014), etc..md).

For Ashtoreth, or Astarte, the goddess of the Zidonians, see [Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md), note; [Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md), note. On the tomb of a
Phoenician king, discovered in 1855, on the site of Sidon, mention is
made of a temple of Astarte there, which the monarch built or restored;
and his mother is said to have been a priestess of the goddess.

Milcom or Molech [Kg1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md) are
variants of the term ordinarily used for "king" among the Semitic races
of Western Asia, which appears in melkarth (Phoenic.), Abimelech
(Hebrew), Andrammelek (Assyrian), Abd-ul-malik (Arabic), etc. On the
character and worship of Molech, see [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md) note.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 11:7</span></span>

Chemosh ([Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029) note.md), seems to
have been widely worshipped in Western Asia. His name occurs frequently
on the "Moabite-Stone." Car-Chemish, "the fort of Chemosh," a great city
of the northern Hittites, must have been under his protection. In
Babylon he seems to have been known as Chomus-belus, or Chemosh-Bel.

The hill - Olivet. At present the most southern summit only (the "Mons
Offensionis") is pointed out as having been desecrated by the idol
sanctuaries: but the early Eastern travelers tell us that in their time
the most northern suburb was believed to have been the site of the high
p ace of Chemosh, the southern one that of Moloch only.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 11:13</span></span>

One tribe - i. e., (marginal reference) the tribe of Judah. Benjamin was
looked upon as absorbed in Judah, so as not to be really a tribe in the
same sense as the others. Still, in memory of the fact that the existing
tribe of Judah was a double one [Kg1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#002.md) l, the prophet Ahijah tore his
garment into twelve parts, and kept back two from Jeroboam [Kg1
11:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 11:14</span></span>

The writer has reserved for this place the various troubles of Solomon's
reign, not allowing them to interrupt his previous narrative. He has,
consequently, not followed chronological order. Hadad's [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md) and Rezon's opposition belong to
the early years of Solomon's reign.

Hadad was a royal title (perhaps, the Syriac name for "the Sun") both in
Syria and in Idumaea (compare [Gen
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#035.md); [Ch1
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 11:15</span></span>

The verse gives certain additional particulars of David's conquest of
Edom (marginal references). Joab was left, or sent, to complete the
subjugation of the country, with orders to exterminate all the grown
male inhabitants. It was not very often that David acted with any
extreme severity in his wars; but he may have considered himself
justified by policy, as he certainly was by the letter of the Law [Deu
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#013.md), in adopting this fierce course
against Edom.

Was in Edom - Or, according to another reading, "smote" Edom.

The slain - Probably the Israelites who had fallen in the strnggle.
Translate, "when ... Joab was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten
every male," etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 11:16</span></span>

Every male in Edom - i. e., every male whom he could find. As did Hadad
and his company [Kg1 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#017.md), so others
would escape in various directions. The Edomite nation was not destroyed
on the occasion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 11:18</span></span>

Midian - A town in the south of Judah. Paran is the desert tract
immediately to the south of Judaea, the modern desert of et-Tih.

Pharaoh - King of the twenty-first (Tanite) dynasty; probably he was
Psusennes I, Manetho's second king. It appears to have been the policy
of the Pharaohs about this time to make friends and contract alliances
with their eastern neighbors.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 11:21</span></span>

That Hadad should wait for the death of Joab before requesting leave to
return to Idumaea shows how terrible an impression had been made by the
severe measures which that commander had carried out twenty-five or
thirty years previously [Kg1 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#016.md).
The inability of refugees to depart from an Oriental court without the
king's leave, and his unwillingness ordinarily to grant leave, are
illustrated by many passages in the history of Persia.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 11:23</span></span>

Rezon - Possibly the same as the Hezion of [Kg1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018.md); but probably one who
interrupted the royal line of the Damascene Hadads, which was restored
after his death. We may arrange the Damascus-kings of this period as
follows:

RE-DO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!

Hadadezer (or Hadad I), about 1040 B.C. (conquered by David).

Rezon (usurper) was contemporary with Solomon.

Hezion (Hadad II) was contemporary with Rehoboam.

Tabrimon (Hadad III) was contemporary with Abijam.

Ben-hadad (Hadad IV) was contemporary with Asa.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 11:24</span></span>

And (they) reigned - A very slight emendation gives the sense, "they
made him king at Damascus."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 11:26</span></span>

Zereda - See [Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md).

Lifted up his hand against the king - i. e., "he rebelled." Compare
marginal reference.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 11:27</span></span>

Millo was probably fortified in Solomon's twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth
year.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 11:28</span></span>

A mighty man of valor - Here "a man of strength and activity." It is a
vague term of commendation, the exact force of which must be fixed by
the context. See [Rut 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001.md); [Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md), etc.

Solomon made Jeroboam superintendent of all the forced labor ("the
charge") exacted from his tribe - the tribe of Ephraim - during the time
that he was building Millo and fortifying the city of Jerusalem [Kg1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 11:29</span></span>

At that time - Probably after Jeroboam's return from Egypt (see [Kg1
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040).md).

The Shilonite - An inhabitant of Shiloh in Mount Ephraim, the earliest
and most sacred of the Hebrew sanctuaries ([Jos
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md); [Jdg
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031.md); [Sa1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003), etc..md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 11:30</span></span>

The first instance of the "acted parable." Generally this mode was
adopted upon express divine command (see [Jer
13:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md); [Eze
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001).md). A connection may be traced
between the type selected and the words of the announcement to Solomon
([Kg1 11:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011.md). Compare [Sa1
15:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 11:34</span></span>

Translate - "Howbeit I will not take ought of the kingdom out of his
hand." The context requires this sense.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 11:36</span></span>

That David may have a light - Compare the marginal references. The exact
meaning of the expression is doubtful. Perhaps the best explanation is,
that "light" here is taken as the essential feature of a continuing
"home."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 11:38</span></span>

See the marginal references. To "build a sure house," or "give a house,"
is to give a continuity of offspring, and so secure the perpetuity of a
family. The promise, it will be observed, is conditional; and as the
condition was not complied with, it did not take effect (see [Kg1
14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008).md). The entire house of Jeroboam
was destroyed by Baasha [Kg1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 11:39</span></span>

But not forever - David had been distinctly promised that God should
never fail his seed, whatever their shortcomings [Psa
89:28-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md). The fulfillment of these
promises was seen, partly in the Providence which maintained David's
family in a royal position until Zerubbabel, but mainly in the
preservation of his seed to the time fixed for the coming of Christ, and
in the birth of Christ - the Eternal King - from one of David's
descendants.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 11:40</span></span>

Compare [Kg1 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026.md). The announcement
of Ahijah was followed within a little while by rebellion on the part of
Jeroboam. As Solomon's luster faded, as his oppression became greater
and its objects more selfish, and as a prospect of deliverance arose
from the personal qualities of Jeroboam [Kg1
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028.md), the tribe of Ephraim to which
he belonged, again aspired after its old position (see [Jos
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014) note.md). Jeroboam, active,
energetic, and ambitious, placed himself at their head. The step proved
premature. The power of Solomon was too firmly fixed to be shaken; and
the hopes of the Ephraimites had to be deferred until a fitter season.

The "exact" date of Jeroboam's flight into Egypt cannot be fixed. It was
certainly not earlier than Solomon's twenty-fourth year, since it was
after the building of Millo [Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027.md). But it may have been several
years later.

Shishak - This king is the first Pharaoh mentioned in Scripture who can
be certainly identified with any known Egyptian monarch. He is the
Sheshonk (Sheshonk I) of the monuments, and the Sesonchosis of Manetho.
The Egyptian date for his accession is 980 or 983 B.C., which
synchronizes, according to the ordinary Hebrew reckoning, with Solomon's
32nd or 35th year. Sheshonk I has left a record of his expedition
against Judah, which accords well with what is related of Shishak [Kg1
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md); [Ch2
12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 11:41</span></span>

The book of the acts of Solomon - See the marginal reference and
Introduction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 11:42</span></span>

Josephus gave Solomon a reign of 80 years, either because he wished to
increase the glory of his country's greatest king, or through his having
a false reading in his copy of the Septuagint Version. It is, no doubt,
remarkable that the three successive kings, Saul, David, and Solomon,
should have each reigned forty years [Act
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md); [Sa2
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004.md); but such numerical coincidences
occur from time to time in exact history.
