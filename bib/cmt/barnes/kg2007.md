### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 7:1</span></span>

The division between the chapters is most awkward here. Elisha, in this
verse, replies to the king's challenge in [Kg2
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033.md) - that his God, Yahweh, will give
deliverance in the space of a day. On the morrow, by the same time in
the day, the famine will have ceased, and food will be even cheaper than
usual.

A measure of fine flour - literally, "a seah of fine flour;" about a
peck and a half.

For a shekel - About 2 shillings 8 12 d.

Two measures of burley - Or, "two seahs of barley;" about three pecks.

In the gate - The "gates," or "gateways," of Eastern towns are favorite
places for the despatch of various kinds of business. It would seem that
at Samaria one of the gates was used for the grain market.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 7:2</span></span>

A lord - Rather, "the captain," as in [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md); [Kg1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022.md); etc. The term itself, שׁלישׁ
shâlı̂ysh (derived from שׁלושׁ shâlôsh, "three,") may be compared with
the Latin "tribunus."

Windows - Rather, "sluices" (compare [Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011).md). The "lord" means to say "If
Yahweh were to open sluices in heaven, and pour down grain as He poured
down rain in the time of the Deluge, even then could there be such
abudnance as thou speakest of?"

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 7:3</span></span>

The position of the lepers is in accordance with the Law of Moses
(marginal references); and shows that the Law was still observed to some
extent in the kingdom of Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 7:5</span></span>

The twilight - The evening twilight (see [Kg2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#009).md).

The uttermost part of the camp - The extreme boundary of the camp toward
the city, not its furthest or most distant portion. Compare [Kg2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#008.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 7:6</span></span>

It is a matter of no importance whether we say that the miracle by which
God now performed deliverance for Samaria consisted in a mere illusion
of the sense of hearing (compare [Kg2
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#019).md); or whether there was any
objective reality in the sound (compare the marginal references).

The king of Israel hath hired - The swords of mercenaries had been
employed by the nations bordering on Palestine as early as the time of
David [Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md); [Ch1
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md). Hence, the supposition of the
Syrians was far from improbable.

The kings of the Hittites - The Hittites, who are found first in the
south [Gen 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007.md), then in the center of
Judea [Jos 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md), seem to have retired
northward after the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites. They are
found among the Syrian enemies of the Egyptians in the monuments of the
19th dynasty (about 1300 B.C.), and appear at that time to have
inhabited the valley of the Upper Orontes. In the early Assyrian
monuments they form a great confederacy, as the most powerful people of
northern Syria, dwelling on both banks of the Euphrates, while at the
same time there is a second confederacy of their race further to the
south, which seems to inhabit the anti-Lebanon between Hamath and
Damascus. These southern Hittites are in the time of Benhadad and Hazael
a powerful people, especially strong in chariots; and generally assist
the Syrians against the Assyrians. The Syrians seem now to have imagined
that these southern Hittites had been hired by Jehoram.

The kings of the Egyptians - This is a remarkable expression, since
Egypt elsewhere throughout Scripture appears always as a centralised
monarchy under a single ruler. The probability is that the principal
Pharaoh had a prince or princes associated with him on the throne, a
practice not uncommon in Egypt. The period, which is that of the 22nd
dynasty, is an obscure one, on which the monuments throw but little
light.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 7:9</span></span>

The lepers began to think that if they kept this important matter secret
during the whole night for their own private advantage, when the morning
came they would be found out, accused, and punished (see margin).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 7:10</span></span>

They called unto the porter ... and told them - The word "porter" is
used like our "guard" and the meaning here is, not that the lepers
called to any particular individual, but that they roused the body of
men who were keeping guard at one of the gates.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 7:12</span></span>

His servants - i. e., "high officers of the household," not mere
domestics.

I will shew you what the Syrians have done - Jehoram sees in the
deserted camp a stratagem like that connected with the taking of Ai
Josh. 8:3-19. The suspicion was a very natural one, since the Israelites
knew of no reason why the Syrians should have raised the siege.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 7:13</span></span>

Behold ... - The Septuagint and a large number of the Hebrew MSS. omit
the clause, "behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are
left in it." But the text followed by our translators, which is that of
the best maunscripts, is intelligible and needs no alteration. It is
merely a prolix way of stating that the horsemen will incur no greater
danger by going to reconnoitre than the rest of their countrymen by
remaining in the city, since the whole multitude is perishing.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 7:14</span></span>

Two chariot horses - Translate, "two horse-chariots." They dispatched i.
e. two war-chariots, with their proper complement of horses and men, to
see whether the retreat was a reality or only a feint. The "horses" sent
would be four or six, since chariots were drawn by either two or three
horses.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 7:15</span></span>

The Syrians had fled probably by the great road which led from Samaria
to Damascus through Geba, En-gannim, Beth-shean, and Aphek. It crosses
the Jordan at the Jisr Mejamia, about thirty-five miles northeast of
Samaria.
