### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 20:1</span></span>

In those days - Hezekiah seems to have died 697 B.C.; and his illness
must belong to 713 or 714 B.C. (compare [Kg2
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#006).md), a date which falls early in the
reign of Sargon. The true chronological place of this narrative is
therefore prior to all the other facts related of Hezekiah except his
religious reforms.

The prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz - This full description of Isaiah
(compare [Kg2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002).md), by the addition
of his father's name and of his office, marks the original independence
of this narrative. The writer of Kings may have found it altogether
separate from the other records of Hezekiah, and added it in the state
in which he found it.

This history (compare [Jon 3:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004).md)
shows that the prophetic denunciations were often not absolute
predictions of what was certainly about to happen, but designed
primarily to prove, or to lead to repentance, those against whom they
were uttered, and only obtaining accomplishment if this primary design
failed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 20:2</span></span>

He turned his face to the wall - Contrast [Kg1
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#004.md). Ahab turned in sullenness,
because he was too angry to converse; Hezekiah in devotion, because he
wished to pray undisturbed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 20:3</span></span>

Remember now - The old covenant promised temporal prosperity, including
length of days, to the righteous. Hezekiah, conscious of his
faithfulness and integrity [Kg2
18:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003.md), ventures to expostulate
(compare also [Kg2 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001) note.md).
According to the highest standard of morality revealed up to this time,
there was nothing unseemly in the self vindication of the monarch, which
has many parallels in the Psalms of David ([Psa
7:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md); [Psa
18:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); [Psa
26:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001), etc..md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 20:4</span></span>

The middle court - i. e., of the royal palace. This is preferable to the
marginal reading.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 20:5</span></span>

The captain of my people - This phrase (which does not occur elsewhere
in Kings) is remarkable, and speaks for the authenticity of this full
report of the actual words of the prophet's message (abbreviated in [Isa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001), etc..md). The title, "Captain נגיד
nāgı̂yd of God's people," commonly used of David, is applied to Hezekiah,
as David's true follower [Kg2 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 20:6</span></span>

The king of Assyria in 714 and 713 B.C. was Sargon (B.C. 721-705). If
then the Biblical and Assyrian chronologies which agree exactly in the
year of the taking of Samaria (721 B.C.), are to be depended on, the
king of Assyria here must have been Sargon. It may be conjectured that
he had taken offence at something in the conduct of Hezekiah, and have
threatened Jerusalem about this time (compare [Isa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006).md). There is, however, no evidence
of actual hostilities between Judaea and Assyria in Sargon's reign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 20:7</span></span>

A lump of figs - The usual remedy in the East, even at the present day,
for ordinary boils. But such a remedy would not naturally cure the
dangerous tumor or carbuncle from which Hezekiah suffered. Thus the
means used in this miracle were means having a tendency toward the
result performed by them, but insufficient of themselves to produce that
result (compare [Kg2 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 20:8</span></span>

And Hezekiah said - Previous to the actual recovery, Hezekiah, who at
first may have felt himself no better, asked for a "sign" that he would
indeed be restored to health.

Asking for a sign is a pious or a wicked act according to the spirit in
which it is done. No blame is attached to the requests of Gideon [Jdg
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017.md), [Jdg
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037.md), [Jdg
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#039.md), or to this of Hezekiah, because
they were real wishes of the heart expressed humbly. The "evil
generation" that "sought for a sign" in our Lord's days did not really
want one, but made the demand captiously, neither expecting nor wishing
that it should be granted.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 20:9</span></span>

Ten degrees - literally, "ten steps." It is not, perhaps, altogether
certain whether the "dial of Ahaz" [Kg2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011.md) was really a dial with a gnomon
in the center, and "degrees" marked round it, or a construction fur
marking time by means of "steps." Sundials proper had been invented by
the Babylonians before the time of Herodotus; but the instrument here
was probably an instrument consisting of a set of steps, or stairs, with
an obelisk at the top, the shadow of which descended or ascended the
steps according as the sun rose higher in the heavens or declined.

The question as to the mode whereby the return of the shadow was
produced is one on which many opinions have been held. Recently, it has
been urged that the true cause of the phenomenon was a solar eclipse, in
which the moon obscured the entire upper limb of the sun; and it has
been clearly shown that if such an occurrence took place a little before
mid-day, it would have had the effect described as having taken place -
i. e., during the obscuration of the sun's upper limb shadows would be
sensibly lengthened, and that of the obelisk would descend the stairs;
as the obscuration passed off the reverse would take place, shadows
would shorten, and that of the obelisk would once more retire up the
steps. If this be the true account, the miracle would consist in
Isaiah's supernatural foreknowledge of an event which the astronomy of
the age was quite incapable of predicting, and in the providential
guidance of Hezekiah's will, so that he chose the "sign" which in the
natural course of things was about to be manifested.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 20:10</span></span>

It is a light thing - It seemed to Hezekiah comparatively easy that the
shadow, which had already begun to lengthen, should merely make a sudden
jump in the same direction; but, wholly contrary to all experience that
it should change its direction, advancing up the steps again when it had
once begun to descend them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 20:12</span></span>

Berodach-baladan - The correct form of this name, Merodach-baladan, is
given in Isaiah [Isa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md). It is a
name composed of three elements, Merodach, the well-known Babylonian god
[Jer 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002), but (pal.md) "a son;" and
iddin, or iddina, "has given;" or Baladan may be a form of Beliddin.
This king of Babylon is mentioned frequently in the Assyrian
inscriptions, and he was not unknown to the Greeks. He had two reigns in
Babylon. First of all, he seized the throne in the same year in which
Sargon became king of Assyria, 721 B.C., and held it for 12 years, from
721 B.C. to 709 B.C., when Sargon defeated him, and took him prisoner.
Secondly, on the death of Sargon and the accession of Sennacherib, when
troubles once more arose in Babylonia, be returned there, and had
another reign, which lasted six months, during a part of the year 703
B.C. As the embassy of Merodach-Baladan followed closely on the illness
of Hezekiah, it would probably be in 713 B.C.

The son of Baladan - In the inscriptions Merodach-Baladan is repeatedly
called the son of Yakin or Yagin. This, however, is a discrepancy which
admits of easy explanation. The Assyrians are not accurate in their
accounts of the parentage of foreign kings. With them Jehu is "the son
of Omri." Yakin was a prince of some repute, to whose dominions
Merodach-baladan had succeeded. The Assyrians would call him Yakin's
son, though he might have been his son-in-law, or his grandson.

The embassy was not merely one of congratulation. Its chief object was
to inquire with respect to the going back of the shadow, an astronomical
marvel in which the Chaldaeans of Babylon would feel a keen interest
[Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md). A political purpose is
moreover implied in the next verse. Merodach-baladan was probably
desirous of strengthening himself against Assyria by an alliance with
Judaea and with Egypt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 20:13</span></span>

Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them - The Jewish king lent a
favorable ear to the proposals of the ambassadors, and exhibited to them
the resources which he possessed, in order to induce them to report well
of him to their master.

All the house of his precious things - literally, the "spice-house;" the
phrase had acquired the more generic sense of "treasure-house" from the
fact that the gold, the silver, and the spices were all stored together.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 20:14</span></span>

Hezekiah did not answer Isaiah's first question, "What said these men?"
but only his second. Probably he knew that Isaiah would oppose reliance
on an "arm of flesh."

Babylon now for the first time became revealed to the Jews as an actual
power in the world, which might effect them politically. As yet even the
prophets had spoken but little of the great southern city; up to this
time she had been little more to them than Tyre, or Tarshish, or any
other rich and powerful idolatrous city. Henceforth, all this was wholly
changed. The prophetic utterance of Isaiah on this occasion [Kg2
20:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#016.md) never was, never could be,
forgotten. He followed it up with a burst of prophecy Isa. 40-66, in
which Babylon usurps altogether the place of Assyria as Israel's enemy,
and the captivity being assumed as a matter of certainty, the hopes of
the people are directed onward beyond it to the Return. Other prophets
took up the strain and repeated it [Hab
1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md); [Hab
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md); [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md). Babylon thus became henceforth,
in lieu of Assyria, the great object of the nation's fear and hatred.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 20:18</span></span>

This prophecy had two fulfillments, each complementary to the other.
Manasseh, Hezekiah's actual son, was "carried to Babylon" [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md), but did not become a eunuch in
the palace. Daniel and others, not his actual sons, but of the royal
seed [Dan 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md), and therefore
Hezekiah's descendants, are thought by some to have literally fulfilled
the latter part of the prophecy, being eunuchs in the palace of
Nebuchadnezzar.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 20:19</span></span>

Good is the word ... - The language is, according to some, that of a
true spirit of resignation and humility; according to others, that of a
feeling of relief and satisfaction that the evil was not to come in his
day. Such a feeling would be but natural, and though not according to
the standard of Christian perfectness, would imply no very great defect
of character in one who lived under the old Dispensation.

Peace and truth - Rather, "peace and continuance." The evils threatened
were war and the dissolution of the kingdom.
