### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 17:1</span></span>

The name Elijah means "Yahweh is my God." It is expressive of the truth
which his whole life preached.

The two words rendered "Tishbite" and "inhabitant" are in the original
(setting aside the vowel points) "exactly alike." The meaning
consequently must either be "Elijah the stranger, of the strangers of
Gilead," or (more probably) "Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbi of Gilead."
Of Tishbi in Gilead there is no further trace in Scripture; it is to be
distinguished from another Tishbi in Galilee. In forming to ourselves a
conception of the great Israelite prophet, we must always bear in mind
that the wild and mountainous Gilead, which bordered on Arabia, and was
half Arab in customs, was the country wherein he grew up.

His abrupt appearance may be compared with the similar appearances of
Ahijah [Kg1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029), Jehu [Kg1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001), Shemaiah [Ch2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#002), Azariah [Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001), and others. It is clear that a
succession of prophets was raised up by God, both in faithful Judah and
in idolatrous Israel, to witness of Him before the people of both
countries, and leave them without excuse if they forsook His worship. At
this time, when a grosser and more deadly idolatry than had been
practiced before was introduced into Israel by the authority of Ahab,
and the total apostasy of the ten tribes was consequently imminent, two
prophets of unusual vigour and force of character, endowed with
miraculous powers of an extraordinary kind, were successively raised up,
that the wickedness of the kings might be boldly met and combated, and,
if possible, a remnant of faithful men preserved in the land. The
unusual efflux of miraculous energy at this time, is suitable to the
unusual emergency, and in very evident proportion to the spiritual
necessities of the people.

As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand - This solemn
formula, here first used, was well adapted to impress the king with the
sacred character of the messenger, and the certain truth of his message.
Elisha adopted the phrase with very slight modifications [Kg2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#014); [Kg2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016).

Drought was one of the punishments threatened by the Law, if Israel
forsook Yahweh and turned after other gods ([Deu
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#017); [Deu
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023); [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019), etc.).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 17:3</span></span>

Brook Cherith - Rather, "the torrent course," one of the many which
carry the winter rains from the highlands into that stream.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 17:4</span></span>

The ravens - This is the translation of most of the ancient versions;
others, omitting the points, which are generally allowed to have no
authority, read "Arabians;" others, retaining the present pointing,
translate either "merchants" (compare the original of [Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009), [Eze
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#027)), or "Orbites." Jerome took it
in this last sense, and so does the Arabic Version.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 17:9</span></span>

The dependence of Zarephath (Sarepta) on Sidon is indicated in the
inscriptions of Sennacherib, where it is mentioned as belonging to
Luliya (Elulaeus), king of Sidon, and as submitting to the Assyrian
monarch on Luliya's flight from his capital. Elijah may have been sent
to this place, so near the city of Jezebel's father, as one which it was
most unlikely that he would visit.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 17:12</span></span>

As the Lord thy God liveth - The words do not prove that the woman was
an Israelite, or a worshipper of the true God; any Phoenician,
recognizing in Elijah's appearance the garb and manner of a Jehovistic
prophet, might have thus addressed him: Baal-worshippers would have
admitted Yahweh to be "a" living God. The woman does not say "as the
Lord my God liveth."

That we may eat it and die - Phoenicia always depended for its cereal
supplies on the harvests of Palestine ([Kg1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009) note); and it is evident that the
famine was afflicting the Phoenicians at this time no less than the
Israelites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 17:16</span></span>

This is the first recorded miracle of its kind - a supernatural and
inexplicable multiplication of food (compare [Kg2
4:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042); [Mat
14:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#015); [Mat
15:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032)). The sacred record does not
explain these miracles; but if the explanations sometimes suggested -
that there was a transformation of previously existing matter into meal,
oil, fish, and bread - be the true one, the marvel of the thing would
not be much greater than that astonishing natural chemistry by which, in
the growth of plants, particles of water, air, and earth are transmuted
into fruits and grains of corn, and so fitted to be human food. There
would be a difference in the agency employed and in the time occupied in
the transmutation, but the thing done would be almost the same.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 17:17</span></span>

No breath - Or, "no spirit," "no soul." (Compare [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)). The word used is translated
"spirit" in [Pro 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027); [Ecc
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021); [Job
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004); and elsewhere.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 17:18</span></span>

What have I to do with thee? - i. e., "What have we in common?" -
implying a further question, "Why hast thou not left me in peace?" The
woman imagines that Elijah's visit had drawn God's attention to her, and
so to her sins, which (she feels) deserve a judgment - her son's death.

Thou man of God - In the mouth of the Phoenician woman this expression
is remarkable. Among the Jews and Israelites [Kg1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022); [Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006), [Jdg
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#008) it seems to have become the
ordinary designation of a prophet. We now see that it was understood in
the same sense beyond the borders of the holy land.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 17:19</span></span>

Into a loft - Rather, "into the upper chamber;" often the best apartment
in an Eastern house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 17:21</span></span>

He stretched himself upon the child three times - This action of Elijah
is different from that of Elisha (marginal reference), and does not
imply the use of any natural means for the restoration of suspended
animation. It is nearly parallel to the "touch," through which our Lord
performed similar miracles [Mat 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025);
[Luk 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#014).
