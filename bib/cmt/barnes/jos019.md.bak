### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

The inheritance of Simeon was taken out of the portion of Judah, which
proved on experience to be larger than the numbers of that tribe
required. The Simeonite territory is described by its towns, of which
fourteen were in the Negeb, and four others [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007.md) partly in the Negeb and partly in
"the valley." On the narrow confines here assigned to Simeon, and its
insignificant position altogether among the Twelve tribes, see [Deu
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md) note.

[Jos 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#006.md)

Thirteen - Fourteen names have been given. The error is probably due to
the use of letters for numbers, which has led to many similar mistakes
in other places (see [Jos 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md).

[Joshua 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 19:10</span></span>

Sarid, not yet identified, was evidently a leading topographical point
on the south frontier of Zebulun. The boundary passed westward until it
touched the Kishon, near "Tell Kaimon" ([Jos
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022) note.md), and thence, turned
northward, leaving Carmel, which belonged to Asher, on its west. The
territory of Zebulun accordingly would not anywhere reach to the
Mediterranean, though its eastern side abutted on the sea of Galilee,
and gave the tribe those "outgoings" attributed to it in the Blessing of
Moses ([Deu 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018).md). Daberath ([Jos
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#012).md) is probably "Deburieh."

[Joshua 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 19:13</span></span>

Gittah (or Gath)- hepher, the birthplace of the prophet Jonah [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), is probably the modern village
of El-Meshhad, where the tomb of the prophet is still shown, a short way
from Nazareth, on the road to Tiberias.

Remmon-methoar to Neah - Read "and goeth out to Remmon, which reacheth
to Neah." (See the margin.) Rimmon, a Levitical city [Jos
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#035.md); [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077.md) is probably the modern
"Rummaneh," in the plain of "El Buttauf," about six miles north of
Nazareth.

[Joshua 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 19:14</span></span>

Hannathon, more properly Channathon, has been supposed by some to be the
Cana of Galilee of the New Testament, and Jiphthah-el is probably the
present "Jefat"; the "Jotapata" of Roman times, which was so long and
valiantly defended by Josephus against the legions of Vespasian. The
"Valley" is the "Wady Abilin"; and Bethlehem [Jos
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md) is the present miserable village
of "Beit-Lahin."

[Joshua 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 19:15</span></span>

Twelve cities - Only five have been mentioned, and the names in the
verses preceding are apparently not names of Zebulonite cities, but
merely of points in or near the boundary line. It would therefore appear
that seven names have disappeared from the text, and perhaps also the
definition of the western frontier.

[Joshua 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 19:18</span></span>

Jezreel and its famous and fertile plain are the choicest part of the
inheritance of Issachar [Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md).

Shunem - Here the Philistines pitched before the battle of Gilboa [Sa1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#004.md). The place is also known as the
home of Abishag [Kg1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#003.md), and in
connection with Elisha [Kg2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md); [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md). It is identified with "Solam"
(or, Sulem), a small and poor village on the slope of Little Hermon.

[Joshua 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 19:21</span></span>

En-gannim - i. e. "fountain of gardens;" also a Levitical city [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md), and called Ahem [Ch1
6:73](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#073.md), the modern "Jenin," a place on
the main road from Jerusalem to Nazareth, just where it enters the plain
of Jezreel. Many of the places enumerated in these verses are not known.
Tabor [Jos 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#022.md) is perhaps not the
famous mountain, but the town on it of the same name [Ch1
6:77](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#077.md), given up to the Levites.
Beth-shemesh (perhaps "Bessum") is not the same as Beth-shemesh of Judah
[Jos 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010.md), nor of Naphtali [Jos
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#038.md).

[Joshua 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 19:25</span></span>

Helkath, a Levitical town [Jos 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031.md),
is probably Yerka, a village about seven or eight miles north-west of
Acre, in a Wady of the same name. Alammelech was in the "Wady Melik,"
which joins the Kishon from the northeast, not far from the sea.

Shihor-libnath - i. e. "black-white." The two words are now generally
admitted to be the name of a river, probably the modern "Nahr Zerka," or
Blue River, which reaches the sea about 8 miles south of Dor, and whose
name has a correspondence both to black and white. Possibly we have in
the occurrence of the term Shihor here a trace of the contact, which was
close and continuous in ancient times, between Phoenicia and Egypt [Jos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md). Cabul [Jos
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027.md) still retains its ancient name;
it lies between four and five miles west of Jotapata and about ten miles
southeast of Acre.

[Joshua 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 19:28</span></span>

These verses refer to the northern portion of the territory of Asher, on
the Phoenician frontier. Some names may have dropped out of the text,
the number [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030.md) not tallying
with the catalogue. Ramah still retains its ancient name, and lies about
twelve miles southeast of Tyre. Achzib is the modern "Zib," on the
coast, eight or nine miles north of Acre.

[Joshua 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 19:33</span></span>

From Allon to Zaanannim - Render "from the oak forest at Zaanannim."
From [Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md) it appears that this
oak or oak-forest was near Kedesh.

Adami, Nekeb - Render "Adami of the Pass." Possibly the ancient "Deir el
Ahmar" ("red cloister"), which derives its name from the color of the
soil in the neighborhood, as perhaps Adami did. The spot lies about 8
miles northwest of Baalbek.

[Joshua 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 19:34</span></span>

Aznoth-tabor - This place ("ears of Tabor") was no doubt in the
neighborhood of Mount Tabor - probably on the eastern slope; and Hukkok
on the western slope.

To Judah upon Jordan - i. e. to the "Havoth-jair" [Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md), which were on the opposite side
of Jordan. Jair, from whom these towns or villages were named, traced
his ancestry in the male line through Hezron to Judah [Num
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md); and it is likely that he was
assisted by large numbers of his kinsmen of that tribe in his rapid
conquest of Bashan. Hence, the Havoth-jair were, in all likelihood,
largely colonised by Judahites, especially perhaps that portion of them
nearest the Jordan. Thus, that part of the river and its valley adjacent
to these settlements was spoken of as "Judah upon Jordan," or more
literally "Judah of the Jordan" (compare [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001).md).

[Joshua 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 19:35</span></span>

The number of the fortified cities of Naphtali is remarkable, though it
does not tally with the catalogue. It was no doubt good policy to
protect the northern frontier by a belt of fortresses, as the south was
protected by the fenced cities of Judah. Hammath, a Levitical city
(compare [Jos 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md); [Ch1
6:76](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#076).md), is not to be confounded with
the Hamath on the northeastern frontier of the land [Num
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#021.md). The name (from a root
signifying "to be warm") probably indicates that hot springs existed
here; and is perhaps rightly traced in Ammaus, near Tiberias. Rakkath
was, according to the rabbis, rebuilt by Herod and called Tiberias. The
name ("bank, shore") suits the site of Tiberias very well. Migdal-el,
perhaps the Magdala of [Mat 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039.md), is
now the miserable village of "El Mejdel."

[Joshua 19:46](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jos 19:46</span></span>

Japho (the modern Jaffa, or Yafa), elsewhere (see the margin) called
Joppa, is often mentioned in the history of the Maccabees and was, as it
still is, the leading port of access to Jerusalem both for pilgrims and
for merchandise. It is a very ancient town.

[Joshua 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">jos 19:47</span></span>

The words "too little" are an insertion of the King James Version Render
rather, "the border of the children of Dan was extended." The Hebrew
appears to mean "the children of Dan enlarged their border because they
had not room enough."

The reason of this was that the Danites, a numerous tribe ([Num
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005) note.md), found themselves [Jdg
1:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034.md) cooped up among the hills by
the powerful and warlike Amorites. Hence, the Danite expedition (see the
marginal reference), which surprised the Sidonion inhabitants of Leshem,
an unwarlike and peaceable race, exterminated them, and annexed their
city and territory to the portion of Dan.

[Joshua 19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jos 19:50</span></span>

Nothing is said of any express command of God respecting the inheritance
of Joshua. But as such special portion appears to have been promised to
Caleb at the time when he and Joshua alone out of the twelve spies
remained faithful [Jos 14:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006.md), it is
probable that a like promise was made to Joshua. The name of the place
is also written Timnath-heres [Jdg
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#009.md), by a transposition of the
letters. The rabbinical explanation that the name Timnath-heres (i. e.
"portion of the sun") was given because a representation of the sun was
affixed to the tomb in memory of Joshua's command to the sun to stand
still, appears to be an afterthought. The name Timnath-serah ("portion
that remains") was perhaps conferred on the spot in consequence of its
being allotted to Joshua, the last allotment made in the whole
distribution of his conquests. The site has been conjectured to be
"Tibneh," a village about five miles north-west of Lydda (or, by Conder,
Kerr Hares, nine miles south of Nablous).
