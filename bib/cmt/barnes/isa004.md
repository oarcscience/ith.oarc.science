### [Isaiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 4:1</span></span>

In that day - The time of calamity referred to in the close of the
previous chapter. This is a continuation of that prophecy, and there was
no reason why these six verses should have been made a separate chapter.
That the passage refers to the Messiah, is apparent from what has been
stated in the note at the commencement of the prophecy [Isa
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md), and from the expressions which
occur in the chapter itself; see the notes at [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), [Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md).

Seven women - The number "seven" is used often to denote a "large"
though "indefinite" number; [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028.md); [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016.md); [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md). It means that so great should be
the calamity, so many "men" would fall in battle, that many women would,
contrary to their natural modesty, become suitors to a single man, to
obtain him as a husband and protector.

Shall take hold - Shall apply to. The expression, 'shall take hold,'
denotes the "earnestness" of their application.

We will eat our own bread ... - We do not ask this in order to be
maintained. We will forego that which the law [Exo
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#010.md) enjoins as the duty of the
husband in case he has more than one wife.

Only let us be called by thy name - Let us be regarded as "thy wives."
The wife then, as now, assumed the name of the husband. A remarkably
similar expression occurs in Lucan (B. ii. 342). Marcia there presents a
similar request to Cato:

Da tantum nomen inane

Connubii; liceat tumulo scripsisse, Catonis Marcia.

'Indulge me only with the empty title of wife.

Let there only be inscribed on my tomb, "Marcia, wife of Cato."'

To take away my reproach - The reproach of being unmarried; compare [Gen
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#023.md); [Sa1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 4:2</span></span>

The branch of the Lord - צמח יהוה yehovâh tsemach. "The sprout" of
Yahweh. This expression, and this verse, have had a great variety of
interpretations. The Septuagint reads it, 'In that day God shall shine
in counsel with glory upon the earth, to exalt, and to glorify the
remnant of Israel.' The Chaldee renders it, 'In that day, the Messiah of
the Lord shall be for joy and glory, and the doers of the law for praise
and honor to those of Israel who are delivered.' It is clear that the
passage is designed to denote some signal blessing that was to succeed
the calamity predicted in the previous verses. The only question is, to
what has the prophet reference? The word 'branch' (צמח tsemach) is
derived from the verb (צמח tsâmach) signifying "to sprout, to spring
up," spoken of plants. Hence, the word "branch" means properly that
which "shoots up," or "sprouts" from the root of a tree, or from a
decayed tree; compare [Job 14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md).

The Messiah is thus said to be 'a root of Jesse,' [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md); compare [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), note; [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md), note; and 'the root and
offspring of David,' [Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md), as
being a "descendant" of Jesse; that is, as if Jesse should fall like an
aged tree, yet the "root" would sprout up and live. The word 'branch'
occurs several times in the Old Testament, and in most, if not all, with
express reference to the Messiah; [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md) : 'Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king
shall reign;' [Jer 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md) : 'In those
days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow
up unto David;' [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md). In all these places, there can
be no doubt that there is reference to him who was "to spring up" from
David, as a sprout does from a decayed and fallen tree, and who is,
therefore, called a "root," a "branch" of the royal stock. There is,
besides, a special beauty in the figure.

The family of David, when the Messiah was to come, would be fallen into
decay and almost extinct. Joseph, the husband of Mary, though of the
royal family of David [Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md); [Luk
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md), was poor, and the family had lost
all claims to the throne. In this state, as from the decayed root of a
fallen tree, a "sprout" or "branch" was to come forth with more than the
magnificence of David, and succeed him on the throne. The name 'branch,'
therefore, came to be significant of the Messiah, and to be synonymous
with 'the son of David.' It is so used, doubtless, in this place, as
denoting that the coming of the Messiah would be a joy and honor in the
days of calamity to the Jews. Interpreters have not been agreed,
however, in the meaning of this passage. Grotius supposed that it
referred to Ezra or Nehemiah, but 'mystically to Christ and Christians.'
Vogellius understood it of the "remnant" that should return from the
Babylonian captivity. Michaelis supposed that it refers to the Jews, who
should be a "reformed" people after their captivity, and who should
spring up with a new spirit. Others have regarded it as a poetic
description of the extraordinary fertility of the earth in future times.
The reasons for referring it to the Messiah are plain:

\(1\) The word has this reference in other places, and the
representation of the Messiah under the image of a branch or shoot, is,
as we have seen, common in the Scriptures. Thus, also, in [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md), he is called also שׁרשׁ shoresh,
root, and יונק yônēq, a tender plant, a sucker, sprout, shoot, as of a
decayed tree; compare [Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md); [Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007.md); [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030.md); [Eze
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md). And in reference to the same
idea, perhaps, it is said, [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md),
that he was נגזר nı̂gezar, "cut off," as a branch, sucker, or shoot is
cut off by the vine-dresser or farmer from the root of a decayed tree.
And thus, in [Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md), he is called
ῥίζα Δαβὶδ riza Dabid - the root of David.

\(2\) This interpretation accords best with the "magnificence" of the
description, [Isa 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); and,

\(3\) It was so understood by the Chaldee interpreter, and, doubtless,
by the ancient Jews.

Shall be beautiful and glorious - Hebrew, 'Shall be beauty and glory;'
that is, shall be the chief ornament or honor of the land; shall be that
which gives to the nation its chief distinction and glory. In such times
of calamity, his coming shal be an object of desire, and his approach
shall shed a rich splendor on that period of the world.

And the fruit of the earth - הארץ פרי perı̂y hâ'ârets correctly rendered
"fruit of the earth, or of the land." The word 'earth' is often in the
Scriptures used to denote the land of Judea, and perhaps the article
here is intended to denote that that land is particularly intended. This
is the parallel expression to the former part of the verse, in
accordance with the laws of Hebrew poetry, by which one member of a
sentence expresses substantially the same meaning as the former; see the
Introduction, Section 8. If the former expression referred to the
"Messiah," this does also. The 'fruit of the earth' is that which the
earth produces, and is here not different in signification from the
"branch" which springs out of the ground. Vitringa supposes that by this
phrase the Messiah, according to his human nature, is meant. So
Hengstenberg ("Christology, in loc.") understands it; and supposes that
as the phrase "branch of Yahweh" refers to his divine origin, as
proceeding from Yahweh; so this refers to his human origin, as
proceeding from the earth. But the objections to this are obvious:

\(1\) The second phrase, according to the laws of Hebrew parallelism, is
most naturally an echo or repetition of the sentiment in the first
member, and means substantially the same thing.

\(2\) The phrase 'branch of Yahweh' does not refer of necessity to his
divine nature. The idea is that of a decayed tree that has fallen down,
and has left a living root which sends up a shoot, or sucker; and can be
applied with great elegance to the decayed family of David. But how, or
in what sense, can this be applied to Yahweh? Is Yahweh thus fallen and
decayed? The idea properly is, that this shoot of a decayed family
should be nurtured up by Yahweh; should be appointed by him, and should
thus be "his" branch. The parallel member denotes substantially the same
thing; 'the fruit of the earth' - the shoot which the earth produces -
or which springs up from a decayed family, as the sprout does from a
fallen tree.

\(3\) It is as true that his human nature proceeded from God as his
divine. It was produced by the Holy Spirit, and can no more be regarded
as 'the fruit of the earth' than his divine nature; [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md).

\(4\) This mode of interpretation is suited to bring the whole subject
into contempt. There are plain and positive passages enough to prove
that the Messiah had a divine nature, and there are enough also to prove
that he was a man; but nothing is more adapted to produce disgust in
relation to the whole subject, in the minds of skeptical or of thinking
men, than a resort to arguments such as this in defense of a great and
glorious doctrine of revelation.

Shall be excellent - Shall be "for exaltation," or "honor."

Comely - Hebrew, 'For an ornament;' meaning that "he" would be an honor
to those times.

For them that are escaped of Israel - Margin, 'The escaping of Israel.'
For the remnant, the small number that shall escape the calamities - a
description of the pious portion of Israel which now escaped from all
calamities - would rejoice in the anticipated blessings of the Messiah's
reign, or would participate in the blessings of that reign. The idea is
not, however, that the number who would be saved would be "small," but
that they would be characterized as those who had "escaped," or who had
been rescued.

[Isaiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 4:3</span></span>

He that is left in Zion - This "properly" refers to the remnant that
should remain after the mass of the people should be cut off by wars, or
be borne into captivity. If it refer to the few that would come back
from Babylon, it means that they would be reformed, and would be a
generation different from their fathers - which was undoubtedly true. If
it refer, as the connection seems to indicate, to the times of the
Messiah, then it speaks of those who are 'left,' while the great mass of
the nation would be unbelievers, and would be destroyed. The mass of the
nation would be cut off, and the remnant that was left would be holy;
that is, all true friends of the Messiah would be holy.

Shall be called holy - That is, shall "be" holy. The expression 'to be
called,' is often used in the Scriptures as synonymous with 'to be.'

Every one that is written among the living - The Jews were accustomed to
register the names of all the people. Those names were written in a
catalogue, or register, of each tribe or family. To be written in that
book, or register, meant to be alive, for when a death occurred, the
name was stricken out; [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md);
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md). The expression came also to
denote all who were truly the friends of God; they whose names are
written in "his" book - the book of life. In this sense it is used in
the New Testament; [Phi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md). In this sense it is understood
in this place by the Chaldee Par.: 'Every one shall be called holy who
is written to eternal life; he shall see the consolation of Jerusalem.'
If the reference here is to the Messiah, then the passage denotes that
under the reign of the Messiah, all who should be found enrolled as his
followers, would be holy. An effectual separation would subsist between
them and the mass of the people. They would be "enrolled" as his
friends, and they would be a separate, holy community; compare [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md).

[Isaiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 4:4</span></span>

When the Lord - That is, "after" God has done this, then all that are
written among the living shall be called holy. The prophet in this verse
states the benefits of "affliction" in purifying the people of God. He
had said, in the previous verse, that all who should be left in Zion
should be called holy. He here states that "previous" to that, the
defilement of the people would be removed by judgment.

Shall have washed away - The expression, "to wash," is often used to
denote to "purify" in any way. In allusion to this fact is the beautiful
promise in [Zac 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); see the note at
[Isa 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md).

The filth - This word here refers to their "moral" defilement - their
pride, vanity, haughtiness; and perhaps to the idolatry and general sins
of the people. As the prophet, however, in [Isa
3:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md), had particularly specified
the sins of the female part of the Jewish people, the expression here
probably refers especially to them, and to the judgments which were to
come upon them; [Isa 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md). It is not
departing from the spirit of this passage to remark, that the church is
purified, and true religion is often promoted, by God's humbling the
pride and vanity of females. A love of excessive ornament; a fondness
for dress and display; and an exhibition of great gaiety, often stand
grievously in the way of pure religion.

The daughters of Zion - see [Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md).

And shall have purged - This is synonymous with the expression "to
wash." It means to purify, to remove, as one removes blood from the
hands by washing.

Blood of Jerusalem - Crime, blood-guiltiness - particularly the crime of
"oppression, cruelty," and "robbery," which the prophet [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md) had charged on them.

By the spirit of judgment - This refers, doubtless, to the "calamities,"
or "punishment," that would come upon the nation; principally, to the
Babylonian captivity. After God should have humbled and reformed the
nation by a series of judgments, then they who were purified by them
should be called holy. The word "spirit" here cannot be shown to be the
Holy Spirit; and especially as the Holy Spirit is not represented in the
Scriptures as the agent in executing judgment. It perhaps would be best
denoted by the word "influence," or "power." The word properly denotes
"wind, air, motion" [Gen 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md); [Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019.md); then "breathing, exhalation, or
breath" [Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md); [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md); hence, it means the "soul;" and
it means also God's "influence," or his putting forth his power and
life-giving energy in animating and sustaining the universe; and also,
as here, his putting forth any influence in accomplishing his works and
designs.

And by the spirit of burning - "Fire" is often, in the Scriptures, the
emblem of punishment, and also of purifying; compare the note at [Mat
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md); see [Mal
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md). The Chaldee translates this,
'by the word of judgment, and by the word of consuming.' The reference
is to the "punishments" which would be sent to purify the people
"before" the coming of the Messiah.

[Isaiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 4:5</span></span>

And the Lord will create - The meaning of this verse and the next is,
that God would take his people into his holy care and protection. The
idea is expressed by images drawn, in this verse, from the protection
which he afforded to the Israelites in their journeying from Egypt. The
word "create" means here, he will afford, or furnish, such a defense.

Upon every dwelling-place ... - Upon all the habitations of his people;
that is, they shall be secure, and regarded as under his protection. The
word "upon" refers to the fact that the pillar of cloud stood "over" the
tabernacle in the wilderness, as a symbol of the divine favor and
presence. So his protection should be "on" or "over" the houses of all
his people; compare [Psa 92:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md).

Of mount Zion - compare the note at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md).

And upon her assemblies - Their convocations; their sacred assemblies,
such as were called together on the Sabbath; [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md); [Num
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#018.md). It refers here to their
"future" assemblies, and, therefore, includes the Christian church
assembled to worship God.

A cloud and smoke by day - This refers to the pillar of cloud that went
before the Israelites in their journey in the wilderness; [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md); [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020.md).

By day - By day, this appeared to them as a cloud; by night, as a pillar
of fire; [Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md). That is, it
was always conspicuous, and could be seen by all the people. A pillar of
cloud could not have been seen by night; and God changes the symbols of
his presence and protection, so that at all times his people may see
them. The meaning here is, that as God gave to the Israelites a symbol
of his presence and protection, so he would be the protecter and
defender of his people hereafter.

For upon all the glory - Above all the "glorious object;" that is, his
church, his people. It is here called 'the glory,' as being a glorious,
or an honorable object.

A defense - This word properly means "a covering, a protection," from
the verb "to cover," and means that God will protect, or defend his
people.

[Isaiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 4:6</span></span>

And there shall be a tabernacle - The reference here is to the
"tabernacle," or sacred "tent" that God directed Moses to make in the
wilderness. The image of the cloudy pillar mentioned in the previous
verses, seems to have suggested to the mind of the prophet the idea of
the tabernacle over which that pillar rested. The principal idea here
is, however, not a tabernacle as a symbol of the divine protection, or
of divine worship, but of a place of refuge from a tempest; that is,
that they should be "safe" under his protection. In Eastern countries
they dwelt chiefly in tents. The idea is, therefore, that God would
furnish them a place of shelter, a hiding-place from the storm.

In the daytime from the heat - The heat in those regions was often very
intense, particularly in the vast plains of sand. The "idea" here is,
therefore, one that is very striking. It means, that God would furnish
to them a refuge that would be like the comfort derived from a tent in a
burning desert.

For a place of refuge - A place to which to flee in the midst of a
storm, as a tent would be.

A covert - A place of retreat, a safe place to retire to. The figure
used here is not unfrequently employed in the prophets; [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md). In eastern countries this idea
would be very striking. While traversing the burning sands of a desert,
exposed to the rays of a tropical sun, nothing could be more grateful
than the cool shadow of a rock. Such figures are, therefore, common in
oriental writings, to denote protection and agreeable shelter from
calamities; see the note at [Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md).
The idea in these verses is:

\(1\) That God will be a defender of his people.

\(2\) That he will protect their families, and that his blessing will be
upon their dwelling-places; compare the note at [Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md).

\(3\) They may expect his blessing on their religious assemblies.

\(4\) God, through the promised Messiah, would be a refuge and defense.

The sinner is exposed to the burning wrath of God, and to the storms of
divine vengeance that shall beat forever on the naked soul in hell. From
all this burning wrath, and from this raging tempest, the Messiah is the
only refuge. Through him God forgives sin; and united to him by faith,
the soul is safe. There are few images more beautiful than this. Soon
the storms of divine vengeance will beat on the sinner. God will summon
him to judgment. But then, he who has fled to the Messiah - the Lord
Jesus - as the refuge of his soul, shall be safe. He shall have nothing
to fear, and in his arms shall find defense and salvation.
