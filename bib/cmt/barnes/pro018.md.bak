### [Proverbs Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 18:1</span></span>

The text and the marginal readings indicate the two chief constructions
of this somewhat difficult verse. Other renderings are

\(1\) He who separateth himself from others seeks his own desire, and
rushes forward against all wise counsel: a warning against self-will and
the self-assertion which exults in differing from the received customs
and opinions of mankind.

\(2\) he who separates himself (from the foolish, unlearned multitude)
seeks his own desire (that which is worthy to be desired), and mingleth
himself with all wisdom. So the Jewish commentators generally.

Between (1) blaming and (2) commending the life of isolation, the
decision must be that (1) is most in harmony with the temper of the Book
of Proverbs; but it is not strange that Pharisaism, in its very name,
separating and self-exalting, should have adopted (2).

[Proverbs 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 18:2</span></span>

Another form of egotism. In "understanding," i. e., self-knowledge, the
"fool" finds no pleasure; but self-assertion, talking about himself and
his own opinions, is his highest joy.

[Proverbs 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 18:3</span></span>

With ignominy - Better, "together with baseness comes reproach." The
outer shame follows close upon the inner.

[Proverbs 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 18:4</span></span>

The parallelism of the two clauses is probably one of contrast. If so,
the proverb is a comparison between all teaching from without and that
of the light within. "The words of a man's mouth" are dark as the "deep
waters" of a pool, or tank ("deep waters" being associated in the Old
Testament with the thought of darkness and mystery; compare [Pro
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#005.md); [Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md); [Ecc
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024).md); but "the wellspring of wisdom
is as a flowing brook," bright and clear. The verse presents a contrast
like that of [Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md).

[Proverbs 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 18:6</span></span>

The first verse speaks of the immediate, the others of the remote,
results of the "fool's" temper. First, "contention," then "strokes" or
blows, then "destruction," and last, "wounds."

[Pro 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md)

Wounds - The word so rendered occurs here and in [Pro
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#022.md) only. Others render it
"dainties," and take the verse to describe the avidity with which people
swallow in tales of scandal. They find their way to the innermost
recesses of man's nature.

[Proverbs 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 18:10</span></span>

Safe - literally, as in the margin i. e., is exalted. Compare [Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), [Psa
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md).

[Proverbs 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 18:11</span></span>

What the name of the Lord is to the righteous [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md), that wealth is to the rich. He
flees to it for refuge as to a strong city; but it is so only "in his
own conceit" or imagination.

High - In the Hebrew the same word as "safe" [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md), and manifestly used in
reference to it.

[Proverbs 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 18:12</span></span>

Before - In the sense of priority of time.

[Proverbs 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 18:14</span></span>

Infirmity - Bodily pain or trouble. "Spirit" in the Hebrew text is
masculine in the first clause, feminine in the second, as though used in
the latter as having lost its strength.

[Proverbs 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 18:15</span></span>

With the wise and prudent there is no loss of time. "Heart" and "ear" -
the mind working within, or gathering from without materials for its
thought - are, through this channel or that, ever gaining knowledge.

[Proverbs 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 18:16</span></span>

The "gift" (or, bribe), by a bold personification, appears as the
powerful "friend at court," who introduces another, and makes him
welcome in high places.

[Proverbs 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 18:17</span></span>

A protest against another fault in judging. Haste is hardly less evil
than corruption. "Audi alteram partern "should be the rule of every
judge.

His neighbor - The other party to the suit "searcheth," i. e.,
scrutinizes and detects him.

[Proverbs 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 18:18</span></span>

Compare [Pro 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md) note. A tacit
appeal to the Divine Judge gave a fairer prospect of a just decision
than corruption [Pro 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016.md) or hasty
onesidedness [Pro 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md).

[Proverbs 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 18:19</span></span>

The meaning of the first clause is obtained in the King James Version by
the insertion of the words in italics, and it seems on the whole to be
the best. The Septuagint and Vulgate give an entirely different
rendering, based, apparently, upon a different text.

[Proverbs 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 18:20</span></span>

The general sense is plain. A man must for good or evil take the
consequence of his words, as well as his deeds. Compare the marginal
reference.

[Proverbs 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 18:22</span></span>

The sense seems to require, "Whoso findeth a good wife," as in some
Chaldee manuscripts; but the proverb writer may be looking at marriage
in its ideal aspect, and sees in every such union the hands of God
joining together man and woman for their mutual good. The Septuagint
adds "He who casts out a good wife, casts away that which is good: but
he that keepeth an adulteress is foolish and ungodly."

[Proverbs 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 18:23</span></span>

Note the paradox. The poor man, of whom one might expect roughness,
supplicates; the rich, well nurtured, from whom one might look for
courtesy, answers harshly and brusquely.

[Proverbs 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 18:24</span></span>

Better, "A man of many companions is so to his own destruction, but
there is a friend (the true, loving friend) etc." It is not the
multitude of so called friends that helps us. They may only embarrass
and perplex. What we prize is the one whose love is stronger and purer
even than all ties of kindred.
