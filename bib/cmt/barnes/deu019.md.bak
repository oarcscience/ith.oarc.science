### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 19:1</span></span>

This and the next two chapters contain enactments designed to protect
human life, and to impress its sanctity on Israel.

In [Deu 19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md) the directions
respecting the preparation of the roads to the cities of refuge, the
provision of additional cities in case of an extension of territory, and
the intervention of the elders as representing the congregation, are
unique to Deuteronomy and supplementary to the laws on the same subject
given in the earlier books (compare the marginal reference).

[Deu 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md), [Deu
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002.md)

The three cities of refuge for the district east of Jordan had been
already named. Moses now directs that when the territory on the west of
Jordan had been conquered, a like allotment of three other cities in it
should be made. This was accordingly done; compare [Jos
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001.md) ff,

[Deu 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003.md)

Thou shalt prepare thee a way - It was the duty of the Senate to repair
the roads that led to the cities of refuge annually, and remove every
obstruction. No hillock was left, no river over which there was not a
bridge; and the road was at least 32 cubits broad. At cross-roads there
were posts bearing the words Refuge, Refuge, to guide the fugitive in
his flight. It seems as if in [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) ff the imagery were borrowed from
the preparation of the ways to the cities of refuge.

[Deu 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005.md)

With the axe - literally, "with the iron." Note the employment of iron
for tools, and compare [Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md) note.

[Deu 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#008.md), [Deu
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#009.md)

Provision is here made for the anticipated enlargement of the borders of
Israel to the utmost limits promised by God, from the river of Egypt to
the Euphrates ([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md), note; [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031), note.md). This promise, owing to
the sins of the people, did not receive its fulfillment until after
David had conquered the Philistines, Syrians, etc.; and this but a
transient one, for many of the conquered peoples regained independence
on the dissolution of Solomon's empire.

[Deuteronomy 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 19:14</span></span>

As a man's life is to be held sacred, so are his means of livelihood;
and in this connection a prohibition is inserted against removing a
neighbor's landmark: compare the marginal references.

[Deuteronomy 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 19:16</span></span>

Testify against him that which is wrong - Margin, more literally, "a
falling away." The word is used [Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md) to signify apostasy or revolt;
here it is no doubt to be understood in the wider sense of any departure
from the Law.

[Deuteronomy 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 19:17</span></span>

Both the men, between whom the controversy is - Not the accused and the
false witness, but the plaintiff and defendant (compare [Exo
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001).md) who were summoned before the
supreme court held, as provided in Deut. 17, at the sanctuary. The
judges acted as God's representative; to lie to them was to lie to Him.

[Deuteronomy 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019.md)
