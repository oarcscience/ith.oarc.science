Analysis of Isaiah 13; 14:1-27

The thirteenth chapter of Isaiah commences a new prophecy, and,
according to the division of Vitringa, a new hook or part of his
prophecies. The first book, according to him, extending from Isa. 1 to
the close of [Isa 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md), is occupied
with a series of prophecies respecting the Jews. The second portion,
from Isa. 13 to [Isa 35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)
inclusive, consists of a number of separate predictions respecting other
nations, with which the Jews were in various ways more or less
connected. See Introduction.

The thirteenth and the fourteenth chapters, with the exception of the
last five verses of Isa. 14, contain one entire prophecy foretelling the
destruction of Babylon. The main design is to predict the destruction of
that city: but it is also connected with a design to furnish consolation
to the Jews. They were to be carried captive there; and the purpose of
the prophet was to assure them that the city to which they should yet be
borne as exiles would be completely destroyed.

It is not easy to ascertain with certainty the precise time when this
prophecy was delivered, nor is it very material. It is certain that it
was delivered either during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, or
Hezekiah [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md), the reign of the
last of whom closed 710 years before the Christian era; and, since the
Jews were carried captive to Babylon 586 years before that era, the
prophecy must have been delivered 124 years before that event; and, as
Babylon was taken by Cyrus 536 years before Christ, it must have been
delivered at least 174 years before its accomplishment. Theodoret
supposed that this prophecy was published during the latter part of the
reign of Hezekiah. Cocceius and Lightfoot supposed that it was delivered
about the same period as the former, and this also is the opinion of
Vitringa. All that is of importance, is, that if it was a true prophecy
of Isaiah, as there is the fullest demonstration, it must have been
delivered at least 170 years before the event which it foretells was
accomplished. The material points to settle in regard to the prophecies
are:

\(1\) whether they were delivered before the event;

\(2\) whether the things predicted could have been foreseen by human
sagacity;

\(3\) whether the prediction is so clear, and particular, as to
correspond with the event, or not to be mere vague conjecture; and

\(4\) whether there is such an occurrence of events as to constitute in
fact a fulfillment of the prophecy.

If these things meet, there is the fullest evidence that the prediction
was from God.

At the time when this prophecy was delivered, the Jews were in the
secure possession of their own capital and country. They were harassed,
indeed, by surrounding nations, but they were still free. They had no
controversy with Babylon; nor had they reason to apprehend danger from
that distant people. Their being borne to that land, was itself, in the
time of Isaiah, a distaut event, and one that then was not likely to
occur. It is remarkable that Isaiah does not distinctly "foretell" that
event here, but throws himself to a period of time "beyond" that, when
they "would be" in captivity, and predicts their deliverance. His
prophecy "supposes" that event to have occurred. It is a vision passing
before his mind "after" that event had taken place; when they would be
in Babylon; and when they would be sighing for deliverance [Isa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md). The prophet, therefore, may be
conceived in this vision as taking his "stand" beyond an event which had
not yet occurred - the captivity of the Jews and their removal to
Babylon - and predicting "another" event still more future, which would
result in their deliverance - the complete overthrow of the city, and
the consequent deliverance of the Jewish people. We are to conceive him
standing, as it were, amidst the captive Jews, and directing his eye
onward to the complete recovery of the nation by the destruction of
Babylon itself. [Isa 14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md). See
Introduction, Section 7, III. (4.)

This prophecy of the destruction of Babylon was delivered, we have seen,
at least 174 years before the event occurred. At the time when it was
delivered, nothing was more improbable than the ruin of that city as
described by Isaiah [Isa 13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md). It
was one of the largest, most flourishing, and perhaps the most strongly
fortified city of the world. The prediction that it should be like
'Sodom and Gomorrah;' that it should 'never be inhabited;' that the wild
beast of the desert should lie there; and that dragons should be in
their pleasant palaces, was wholly improbable; and could have been
foreseen only by God. There were no natural causes that were leading to
this which man could perceive, or of which a stranger and a foreigner,
like Isaiah, could have any knowledge. This will appear evident by a
brief description of the condition of this celebrated city. babylon
(derived from babel, and probably built on the same spot as the tower of
Babel) was the capital of Babylonia, or Chaldea, and was probably built
by Nimrod; but it was a long period before it obtained its subsequent
size and splendor.

It was enlarged by Belus, and so greatly beautified and improved by
Semiramis, that she might be called not improperly the foundress of it.
It was subsequently greatly increased and embellished by Nebuchadnezzar.
It stood in the midst of a large plain, and on a very deep and fertile
soil. It was on both sides of the river Euphrates, and of course was
divided by that river into two parts. The two parts were connected by a
bridge near the center of the city; and there is also said to have been
a tunnel, or subterranean passage, made from the palace on the east of
the river to the palace on the west, made under the river. The old city
was on the east, and the new city, built by Nebuchadnezzar, was on the
west. Both these divisions were enclosed by one wall, and the whole
formed a complete square, which Herodotus, who visited it, and who is
the most ancient author who has written on it, says, was 480 furlongs in
compass, or 120 furlongs on each side: that is, it was fifteen miles on
each side, or sixty miles in compass.

Public belief has been greatly staggered by the accounts which are thus
given of the size of Babylon. But the account of the extent of the walls
given, by ancient authors, is nearly uniform. Thus Herodotus says it was
480 stadia, or furlongs, in circumference. Pliny and Solinus make it the
same. Strabo says it was 385 stadia in circumference; Diodorus, 360;
Clitarchus, who accompanied Alexander, says it was 365, and Curtius says
it was 368. According to the lowest of these estimates, it could not
have been less than twelve miles square, or forty-eight miles in
circumference; and was at least eight times as large in extent as London
and its appendages; and somewhat larger than the entire district of
Columbia. - (Calmet, and "Edin. Ency.") It is not to be inferred,
however, that all this vast space was compactly built. It was enclosed
with a wall; but a considerable portion of it might have been occupied
with the public squares, with palaces, and with hanging gardens, or,
possibly, might have been unoccupied.

The walls of Babylon are said by Herodotus to have been eighty-seven
feet thick, and 350 high. They were built of brick, or clay dried in the
sun, and not burned; and were cemented by a kind of glutinous earth, or
bitumen, with which the adjacent region abounded. The whole city was
surrounded by an immense ditch, from which this clay had been taken to
make the walls of the city, and which, being always filled with water,
contributed materially to its defense. There were 100 gates to the city,
twenty-five on each side. These gates were ofsolid brass. Between every
two of them there were three towers, raised ten feet above the walls.
From the gates there were streets, each 151 feet in width, which ran
through the city, so that there were fifty streets in all, cutting each
other at right angles, and forming 676 squares in the city. A bridge
sixty feet in width crossed the Euphrates in the center of the city, and
at the extremities of the bridge were two palaces, the old palace on the
east, and the new palace on the west.

The temple of Belus, which occupied almost a square, was near the old
palace on the east. Babylon was celebrated for its hanging gardens,
built on arches, near 400 feet square, and which were elevated one above
another, by terraces, until they reached the height of the walls of the
city. On the highest terrace was an aqueduct for watering the gardens,
supplied with water by a pump, or probably by the "Persian wheel," by
which the water of the Euphrates was raised to this extraordinary
height. In order to prevent the danger of being overflown by the rise in
the Euphrates, two canals were cut from the river at a considerable
distance above the town, by which the superabundant waters were carried
into the Tigris. It is to be borne in mind, however, in order to a just
view of this prophecy, that Babylon did not attain its highest splendor
and magnificence until "after" the time of Isaiah. It was under
Nebuchadnezzar, who ascended the throne of Babylon about 100 years after
Isaiah died, that it rose to its highest degree of splendor and power.
When Isaiah lived, though it was a city of great wealth and power, and
distinguished for great commercial advantages, yet it was then dependent
on Assyria. It did not become the capital of the vast kingdom of Chaldea
until 680 years before Christ, according to the chronology of Hales,
when Assaradon became master of Babylon, and reunited the empires of
Assyria and Chaldea.

Babylon was the natural seat of empire in the East, and was early
distinguished for its commercial advantages. A simple glance at the map
of Asia will convince anyone that somewhere in the vicinity of Babylon
is the natural seat of power in the East, and that few places on the
globe are more eligibly situated for a vast trade, as it was conducted
before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. The commerce from the
rich regions of Asia naturally passed through Babylon on its way to
Europe, and to Western Asia. It was the center of a vast fertile region,
the productions of which were conveyed to Babylon, and from which they
would naturally be borne down on the Euphrates to the ocean; see the
note at [Isa 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md). The first empire
of which the earliest historians furnish any trace, was in the land of
Shinar, the land of the Chaldeans [Gen
10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008.md); [Gen
11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md). Syria, Arabia, Tyre with all
her wealth, and distant Egypt, were subject and tributary to it.

The natural advantages of that region for a vast capital, are shown by
the fact, that amidst all changes and revolutions, empire has been
disposed to fix her permanent seat somewhere on the banks of the Tigris
or the Euphrates. Thus, Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, was long a
mighty and magnificent commercial city, as well as the proud capital of
a vast empire. Thus, when Babylon fell, Seleucia rose on the banks of
the Tigris, as if prosperity and power were unwilling to leave the
fertile plains watered by those rivers. Thus, near Seleucia, arose
Ctesiphon, the winter residence of the Parthian monarchs. And thus,
under the sway of the Arabians, long after Nineveh, and Babylon, and
Seleucia had fallen, Bagdad and Ormus rivaled Babylon and Seleucia, and
'became, like them, the resort of the merchant, and the home of the
learned.' 'At this time Bagdad and Bussora are faded tokens of the
splendor of these which have faded and fallen.' The fact that there was
in that vicinity such a succession of celebrated cities, demonstrates
that there were there some important commercial advantages.

Among those advantages respecting Babylon, was the fact that it was the
center of a vast fertile region; that it naturally received the
productions of Armenia on the north; and that its midway position
rendered it the natural thoroughfare for the caravan trade between
Eastern and Western Asia. Accordingly, Babylon was early distinguished
for its commerce and manufactures. Babylonian garments, of uncommon
value, had made their way to Palestine as early as the times of Joshua
[Jos 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021.md). Tapestries embroidered with
figures of griffons, and other monsters of Eastern imagination, were
articles of export. Carpets were made there of the finest material and
workmanship, and formed an article of extensive exportation. They were
in high repute in the time of Cyrus, whose tomb at Pasargada was adorned
with them. - (Arrian, "Exped. Alex.," vi. 29.) Babylonian robes were
also highly esteemed for the fineness of their texture and the
brilliancy of their purple, and were used by the royal family of Persia.
The commerce of that city and of Babylonia consisted in the traffic in
emeralds and other precious stones; silver and gold; carpets,
tapestries, and other manufactured cloths; cotton and pearls; cinnamon
and other spicery, obtained from the East; and, in general, of whatever
articles were produced in the eastern parts of Asia, which were
naturally brought to Babylon on the way to Western Asia and to Europe.
For a learned and interesting article on the commerce of Babylon, see
"Bib. Rep." vol. vii. pp. 364-390.

Thus, by the fertility of the soil; by its size and strength; by its
strong and lofty walls; by its commercial advantages; and by everything
that could contribute to the defense of an ancient city, Babylon seemed
to be safe; and if there was any ancient city that appeared to bid
defiance to the attacks of enemies, or to the ravages of time, it was
Babylon. Yet Isaiah said that it should be destroyed; and in the course
of our exposition we shall be greatly struck, not only with the certain
fulfillment of the prediction, but with the wonderful accuracy and
minuteness of the entire prophetic statement.

The vision opens [Isa 13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md), with the
command of God to assemble his forces to go forth, and accomplish his
work in regard to the city. By a beautiful poetic image, the prophet
represents himself as "immediately," on the issuing of this command,
listening to the tumult and noise caused by those who were assembling
for war; by the gathering together of nations; by their assembling from
a far country to destroy the whole land [Isa
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md). He then proceeds to depict the
consternation that would follow; the alarm of the people; and their
distress, when the day of the Lord should come [Isa
13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md). Then, changing the mode of
address from himself to God, he sets forth, in a variety of the most
distressing and appalling images, the destruction that would come upon
the inhabitants of Babylon - the humbling of their pride [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md); the almost entire destruction
of the people [Isa 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012.md); the flight
of the inhabitants [Isa 13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013.md); the
murder of those who should flee; and the destruction of their wives and
children [Isa 13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#015.md). He then
specifies [Isa 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md) the instruments
by which this should be done, and closes the chapter [Isa
13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md) with a minute and most
particular account of the complete and final overthrow of the city; of
its entire and everlasting desolation. The subsequent chapter which is a
continuation of this prophecy, is occupied with an account of the
deliverance of the Jews from their captivity, and with a further
description of the humbling of that proud city and of its monarch. See
an analysis of it at the commencement of the chapter.

The thirteenth chapter 'is one of the most beautiful examples that can
be given of elegance of composition, variety of imagery, and sublimity
of sentiment and diction in the prophetic style.' - (Lowth.) It may be
added, that it is one of the clearest predictions of a future event that
can anywhere be found; and that the exact and minute fulfillment of it
furnishes the highest possible evidence that Isaiah 'spake as he was
moved by the Holy Spirit.'

[Isaiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 13:1</span></span>

The burden of Babylon - Or, the burden "respecting," or "concerning"
Babylon. This prophecy is introduced in a different manner from those
which have preceded. The terms which Isaiah employed in the commencement
of his previous prophecies, were vision (see the note at [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md), or word [Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md). There has been considerable
diversity of opinion in regard to the meaning of the word 'burden,'
which is here employed. The Vulgate renders it, Onus - 'Burden,' in the
sense of load. The Septuagint Ὅρασις Horasis - 'Vision.' The Chaldee,
'The burden of the cup of malediction which draws near to Babylon.' The
Hebrew word משׂא mas's'â', from נשׂא nâs'â', to lift, to raise up, to
bear, to bear away, to suffer, to endure"), means properly that which is
borne; that which is heavy; that which becomes a burden; and it is also
applied to a gift or present, as that which is borne to a man [Ch2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011.md).

It is also applied to a proverb or maxim, probably from the "weight" and
"importance" of the sentiment condensed in it [Pro
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md); [Pro
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md). It is applied to an oracle from
God [Kg2 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#025.md). It is often translated
'burden' [Isa 15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md); [Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md), [Isa
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013.md); [Isa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md); [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md); [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md), [Jer
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#038.md); [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Zac
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md); [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md); [Mal
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md). By comparing these places, it
will be found that the term is applied to those oracles or prophetic
declarations which contain sentiments especially weighty and solemn;
which are employed chiefly in denouncing wrath and calamity; and which,
therefore, are represented as weighing down, or oppressing the mind and
heart of the prophet. A similar useage prevails in all languages. We are
all familiar with expressions like this. We speak of news or tidings of
so melancholy a nature as to weigh down, to sink, or depress our
spirits; so heavy that we can scarcely bear up under it, or endure it.
And so in this case, the view which the prophet had of the awful
judgments of God and of the calamities which were coming upon guilty
cities and nations, was so oppressive, that it weighed down the mind and
heart as a heavy burden. Others, however, suppose that it means merely a
message or prophecy which is taken up, or borne, respecting a place, and
that the word indicates nothing in regard to the nature of the message.
So Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and Cocceius, understand it. But it seems some
the former interpretation is to be preferred. Grotins renders it, 'A
mournful prediction respecting Babylon.'

Did see - Saw in a vision; or in a scenical representation. The various
events were made to pass before his mind in a vision, and he was
permitted to see the armies mustered; the consternation of the people;
and the future condition of the proud city. This verse is properly the
title to the prophecy.

[Isaiah 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 13:2</span></span>

Lift ye up a banner - A military ensign or standard. The vision opens
here; and the first thing which the prophet hears, is the solemn command
of God addressed to the nations as subject to him, to rear the standard
of war, and to gather around it the mighty armies which were to be
employed in the destruction of the city. This command, 'Lift ye up a
banner,' is addressed to the leaders of those armies to assemble them,
and to prepare them for war.

Upon the high mountain - It was customary for military leaders to plant
a standard on a tower, a fortress, a city, a high mountain, or any
elevated spot, in order that it might be seen afar, and be the rallying
point for the people to collect together (see the note at [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010).md). Here, the prophet does not
refer to any particular "mountain," but means simply, that a standard
should be raised, around which the hosts should be assembled to march to
Babylon. The Chaldee renders it, 'Over the city dwelling in security,
lift up the banner.'

Exalt the voice - Raise up the voice, commanding the people to assemble,
and to prepare for the march against Babylon, Perhaps, however, the word
'voice' here (קול qôl) refers to the "clangor," or sound, of a trumpet
used for mustering armies. The word is often used to denote "any" noise,
and is frequently applied to thunder, to the trumpet, etc.

Unto them - That is, to the Medes and Persians, who were to be employed
in the destruction of Babylon.

Shake the hand - In the way of beckoning; as when one is at so great a
distance that the voice cannot be heard, the hand is waved for a sign.
This was a command to beckon to the nations to assemble for the
destruction of Babylon.

That they may go into the gates of the nobles - The word rendered here
'nobles' (נדיבים nedı̂ybı̂ym) means, properly, "voluntary, free, liberal;"
then those who are noble, or liberally-minded, from the connection
between nobleness and liberality; then those who are noble or elevated
in rank or office. In this sense it is used here; compare [Job
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#021.md); [Job
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md); [Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md); [Psa
107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md); and [Pro
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#016.md), where it is rendered 'princes;'
[Num 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#018.md), where it is rendered
'nobles.' Lowth renders it here 'princes.' Noyes renders it 'tyrants ' -
a sense which the word has in [Job
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028) (see the note at that place.md).
There is no doubt that it refers to Babylon; and the prophet designs
probably to speak of Babylon as a magnificent city - a city of princes,
or nobles. The Chaldee renders it, 'That they may enter its gates, which
open to them of their own accord;' retaining the original signification
of "voluntariness" in the Hebrew word, and expressing the idea that the
conquest would be easy. Our common translation has expressed the correct
sense.

[Isaiah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 13:3</span></span>

I have commanded - This is the language of God in reference to those who
were about to destroy Babylon. "He" claimed the control and direction of
all their movements; and though the command was not understood by "them"
as coming from him, yet it was by his direction, and in accordance with
his plan (compare the notes at [Isa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#007.md); [Isa
45:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005).md). The "command" was not given
by the prophets, or by an audible voice; but it was his secret purpose
and direction that led them to this enterprise.

My sanctified ones - The Medes and Persians; not called 'sanctified
because they were holy, but because they were set apart by the divine
intention and purpose to accomplish this. The word 'sanctify' (קדשׁ
qâdash) often means "to set apart" - either to God; to an office; to any
sacred use; or to any purpose of religion, or of accomplishing any of
the divine plans. Thus, it means to dedicate one to the office of priest
[Exo 28:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#041.md); to set apart or dedicate
an altar [Exo 39:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#036.md); to dedicate a
people [Exo 19:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md); to appoint, or
institute a fast [Joe 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md); to sanctify a war [Joe
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009.md), that is, to prepare one's-self
for it, or make it ready. Here it means, that the Medes and Persians
were set apart, in the purpose of God, to accomplish his designs in
regard to Babylon (compare the note at [Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

My mighty ones - Those who are strong; and who are so entirely under my
direction, that they may be called mine.

For mine anger - To accomplish the purposes of my anger against Babylon.

Even them that rejoice in my highness - It cannot be supposed that the
Medes and Persians really exulted, or rejoiced in God or in his plans,
for it is evident that, like Sennacherib Isa. 10, they were seeking to
accomplish their own purposes, and were not solicitous about the plans
of God (compare the note at [Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006).md). The word rendered 'my highness'
(גאותי ga'ăvāthı̂y) means, properly, "my majesty," or "glory." When
applied to people, as it often is, it means pride or arrogance. It means
here, the high and exalted plan of God in regard to Babylon. It was a
mighty undertaking; and one in which the power, the justice, and the
dominion of God over nations would be evinced. In accomplishing this,
the Medes and Persians would rejoice or exult, not as the fulfilling of
the plan of God; but they would exult as if it were their own plan,
though it would be really the glorious plan of God. Wicked people often
exult in their success; they glory in the execution of their purposes;
but they are really accomplishing the plans of God, and executing his
great designs.

[Isaiah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 13:4</span></span>

The noise of a multitude in the mountains - The prophet here represents
himself as hearing the confused tumult of the nations assembling to the
standard reared on the mountains [Isa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002.md). This is a highly beautiful
figure - a graphic and vivid representation of the scene before him.
Nations are seen to hasten to the elevated banner, and to engage in
active preparations for the mighty war. The sound is that of a tumult,
an excited multitude hastening to the encampment, and preparing for the
conquest of Babylon.

Like as of a great people - Hebrew, 'The likeness of a great people.'
That is, such a confused and tumultuous sound as attends a great
multitude when they collect together.

A tumultuous noise - Hebrew, 'The voice of the tumultuous noise of the
kingdoms of nations gathered together.'

The Lord of hosts - Yahweh, the God of hosts, or armies (note [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md).

Mustereth - Collects; puts in military array. Over all this multitude of
nations, hastening with confused sounds and tumult like the noise of the
sea, putting themselves in military array, God, unseen, presides, and
prepares them for his own great designs. It is not easy to conceive a
more sublime image than these mighty hosts of war, unconscious of the
hand that directs them, and of the God that presides over them, moving
as he wills, and accomplishing his plans.

[Isaiah 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 13:5</span></span>

They come - That is, 'Yahweh and the weapons of his indignation' - the
collected armies come. The prophet sees these assembled armies with
Yahweh, as their leader, at their head.

From a far country - The country of the Medes and Persians. These
nations, indeed, bordered on Babylonia, but still they stretched far to
the north and east, and, probably, occupied nearly all the regions to
the east of Babylon which were then known.

From the end of heaven - The Septuagint renders this, Ἀπ ̓ ἄκρου
θεμελίου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ Ap' akrou themeliou tou ouranou - 'From the
"extreme foundation" of the heaven.' The expression in the Hebrew, 'From
the end, or extreme peri of heaven,' means, the distant horizon by which
the earth appears to be bounded, where the sky and the land seem to
meet. In [Psa 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#006.md), the phrase, 'from
the end of the heaven' denotes the east, where the sun appears to rise;
and 'unto the ends of it' denotes the west:

His going forth is from the end of the heaven;

And his circuit unto the ends of it.

It is here synonymous with the phrase, 'the end of the earth,' in [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md).

Even the Lord - The word 'even,' introduced here by the translators,
weakens the three of this verse. The prophet means to say that Yahweh is
coming at the head of those armies, which are the weapons of his
indignation.

The weapons of his indignation - The assembled armies of the Medes and
Persians, called 'the weapons of his indignation,' because by them he
will accomplish the purposes of his anger against the city of Babylon
(see the note at [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

To destroy the whole land - The whole territory of Babylonia, or
Chaldea. Not only the city, but the nation and kingdom.

[Isaiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 13:6</span></span>

Howl ye - Ye inhabitants of Babylon, in view of the approaching
destruction.

The day of the Lord - The time when Yahweh will inflict vengeance on you
draws near (see the note at [Isa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012.md);
compare [Isa 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009).md).

As a destruction from the Almighty - Not as a desolation from man, but
as destruction sent from him who has all power in heaven and on earth.
Destruction meditated by man might be resisted; but destruction that
should come from the Almighty must be final and irresistible. The word
'Almighty' שׁדי shadday, one of the names given to God in the
Scriptures, denotes, properly, "one who is mighty," or who has all
power; and is correctly rendered Almighty, or Omnipotent; [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md); [Gen
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#003.md); [Gen
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#003.md); [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md); [Rut
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020.md); [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md); [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md), [Job
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#014.md); [Job
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003.md), [Job
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005.md); [Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md); [Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md); [Job
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025.md). In the Hebrew here, there is a
paronomasia or "pun" - a figure of speech quite common in the
Scriptures, which cannot be retained in the translation - 'It shall come
as a destruction (כשׁד keshod) from the Almighty (משׁדי mı̂shadday).'

[Isaiah 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 13:7</span></span>

Therefore shall all hands be faint - This is designed to denote the
consternation and alarm of the people. They would be so terrified and
alarmed that they would have no courage, no hope, and no power to make
resistance. They would abandon their plans of defense, and give
themselves up to despair (compare [Jer
50:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#043.md) : 'The king of Babylon hath
heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble; anguish took hold
of him, and pangs as of a Women in travail;' [Eze
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#017.md); [Zep
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#016).md).

And every man's heart shall melt - Or, shall faint, so that he shall
have no courage or strength (compare [Deu
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#008).md). The fact was, that the
destruction of Babylon took place in the night. It came suddenly upon
the city, while Belshazzar was at his impious feast; and the alarm was
so unexpected and produced such consternation, that no defense was
attempted (see [Dan 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md); compare the
notes at [Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 13:8</span></span>

They shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth - This comparison is
often used in the Scriptures to denote the deepest possible pain and
sorrow, as well as the suddenness with which any calamity comes upon a
people [Psa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md); [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md); [Isa
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md); [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md); [Jer
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023.md); [Jer
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#024.md); [Jer
50:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#043.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md); [Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md); [Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021.md); [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md); [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md).

They shall be amazed one at another - They shall stare with a stupid
gaze on one another, indicating a state of great distress, anxiety, and
alarm. They shall look to each other for aid, and shall meet in the
countenances of others the same expressions of wonder and consternation.

Their faces shall be as flames - Their faces shall glow or burn like
fire. When grief and anguish come upon us, the face becomes inflamed.
The face in fear is usually pale. But the idea here is not so much that
of fear as of anguish; and, perhaps, there is mingled also here the idea
of indignation against their invaders.

[Isaiah 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 13:9</span></span>

The day of the Lord cometh - See [Isa
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006.md).

Cruel - (אכזרי 'akezārı̂y). This does not mean that "God" is cruel, but
that the 'day of Yahweh' that was coming should be unsparing and
destructive to them. It would be the exhibition of "justice," but not of
"cruelty;" and the word stands opposed here to mercy, and means that God
would not spare them. The effect would be that the inhabitants of
Babylon would be destroyed.

Fierce anger - Hebrew, (חרון אף 'aph chărôn) 'A glow, or burning of
anger.' The phrase denotes the most intense indignation (compare [Num
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004.md); [Num
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#014.md); [Sa1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#018).md).

To lay the land desolate - Chaldea, [Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 13:10</span></span>

For the stars of heaven - This verse cannot be understood literally, but
is a metaphorical representation of the calamities that were coming upon
Babylon The meaning of the figure evidently is, that those calamities
would be such as would be appropriately denoted by the sudden
extinguishment of the stars, the sun, and the moon. As nothing would
tend more to anarchy, distress, and ruin, than thus to have all the
lights of heaven suddenly and forever quenched, this was an apt and
forcible representation of the awful calamities that were coming upon
the people. Darkness and night, in the Scriptures, are often the emblem
of calamity and distress (see the note at [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md). The revolutions and
destructions of kingdoms and nations are often represented in the
Scriptures under this image. So respecting the destruction of Idumea
[Isa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md) :

And all the hosts of heaven shall be dissolved,

And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll;

And all their host shall fall down,

As the leaf falleth from off the vine,

And as a falling fig from the fig-tree.

So in [Eze 32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md), in a prophecy
respecting the destruction of Pharaoh, king of Egypt:

And when I shall put time out,

I will cover the heavens, and make the stoa thereof dark,

I will cover the sun with a cloud,

And the moon shall not give her light.

And the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee.

And set darkness upon thy land.

(Compare [Joe 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md); [Joe
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015)..md) Thus in [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md) :

I will cause the sun to go down at noon,

And I will darken the earth in a clear day.

See also [Rev 6:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md) :

And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo,

The sun became black as sackcloth of hair,

And the moon became as blood;

And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,

Even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs

When she is shaken of a mighty wind:

And the heaven deputed as a scroll when it is rolled together.

Many have supposed that these expressions respecting the sun, moon, and
stars, refer to kings, and princes, and magistrates, as the "lights" of
the state; and that the sense is, that their power arid glory should
cease. But it is rather a figurative representation, denoting calamity
"in general,' and describing a state of extreme distress, such as would
be if all the lights of heaven should suddenly become extinct.

And the constellations thereof - (וּכסיליהם ûkı̂sı̂ylēyhem). The word
(כסיל kesı̂yl) means properly "a fool;" [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md); [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md), [Pro
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#018.md); [Pro
13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#019.md), "et al." It also denotes
"hope, confidence, expectation" [Job
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#024.md); [Pro
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026.md); [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md); also "the reins, the flanks or
loins" [Lev 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#004.md), [Lev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#010.md), [Lev
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#015.md); [Psa
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007.md). It is also, as here, applied to
a constellation in the heavens, but the connection of this meaning of
the word with the other significations is uncertain. In [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md); [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md), it is translated 'Orion.' In
[Amo 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md), it is translated the 'seven
stars' - the Pleiades. In Arabic, that constellation is called 'the
giant.' According to an Eastern tradition, it was Nimrod, the founder of
Babylon, afterward translated to the skies; and it has been supposed
that the name the "impious" or "foolish one" was thus given to the
deified Nimrod, and thus to the constellation. The rabbis interpret it
"Simis." The word 'constellations' denotes clusters of stars, or stars
that appear to be near to each other in the heavens, and which, on the
celestial globe, are reduced to certain figures for the convenience of
classification and memory, as the bear, the bull, the virgin, the
balance. This arrangement was early made, and there is no reason to
doubt that it existed in the time of Isaiah (compare the notes at [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 13:11</span></span>

And I will punish the world - By the 'world' here is evidently meant the
Babylonian empire, in the same way as 'all the world' in [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md), means Judea; and in [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md), means the Roman empire.
Babylonia, or Chaldea, was the most mighty empire then on earth, and
might be said to comprehend the whole world.

And I will cause the arrogancy - This was the prevailing sin of Babylon,
and it was on account of this pride mainly that it was overthrown (see
the notes at Isa. 14; notes at [Isa
47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md); compare [Dan
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#022.md), [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030).md).

[Isaiah 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 13:12</span></span>

I will make a man ... - I will so cut off and destroy the men of
Babylon, that a single man to defend the city will be more rare and
valuable than fine gold. The expression indicates that there would be a
great slaughter of the people of Babylon.

Than fine gold - Pure, unalloyed gold. The word used here (פז pâz) is
often distinguished from common gold [Psa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md); [Psa
119:127](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#127.md); [Pro
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#019.md).

Than the golden wedge of Ophir - The word (כתם kethem) rendered 'wedge'
means properly "gold;" yellow gold; what is hidden, precious, or
hoarded; and is used only in poetry. It indicates nothing about the
shape of the gold, as the word, wedge would seem to suppose. 'Ophir was
a country to which the vessels of Solomon traded, and which was
particularly distinguished for producing gold; but respecting its
particular situation, there has been much discussion. The 'ships of
Tarshish' sailed from Ezion-geber on the Red Sea, and went to Ophir [Kg1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md); [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md); [Kg1
22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048.md). Three years were required for
the voyage; and they returned freighted with gold, peacocks, apes,
spices, ivory, and ebony ([Kg1 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028.md);
[Kg1 10:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md); compare [Ch2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018).md). The gold of that country was
more celebrated than that of any other country for its purity. Josephus
supposes that it was in the East Indies; Bruce that it was in South
Africa; Rosenmuller and others suppose that it was in Southern Arabia.
It is probable that the situation of Ophir must ever remain a matter of
conjecture. The Chaldee Paraphrase gives a different sense to this
passage. 'I will love those who fear me, more than gold in which people
glory; and those who observe the law more than the tried gold of Ophir.'
(On the situation of Ophir the following works may be consulted: The
"Pictorial Bible," vol. ii. pp. 364-369; Martini Lipenii, "Dissert. de
Ophir;" Joan. Christophori Wichmanshausen "Dissert. de Navig.
Ophritica:" H. Relandi, "Dissert. de Ophir;" Ugolini, "Thes. Sac. Ant."
vol. viii.; and Forster "On Arabia.")

[Isaiah 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 13:13</span></span>

Therefore I will shake the heavens - A strong, but common figure of
speech in the Scriptures, to denote great commotions, judgments, and
revolutions. The figure is taken from the image of a furious storm and
tempest, when the sky, the clouds, the heavens, appear to be in
commotion; compare [Sa1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008.md) :

Then the earth shook and trembled,

The foundation of heaven moved and shook,

Because he was wroth.

See also [Isa 24:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019.md); [Hag
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md).

And the earth shall remove out of her place - A common figure in the
Scriptures to denote the great effects of the wrath of God; as if even
the earth should be appalled at his presence, and should tremble and
flee away from the dread of his anger. It is a very sublime
representation, and, as carried out often by the sacred writers, it is
unequalled in grandeur, probably, in any language. Thus the hills, the
mountains, the trees, the streams, the very heavens, are represented as
shaken, and thrown into consternation at the presence of God; see [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md), [Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md) :

He stood and measured the earth;

He beheld and drove asunder the nations;

And the everlasting mountains were scattered.

The perpetual hills did bow;

His ways are everlasting.

The mountains saw thee and they trembled;

The overflowing of the water passed by;

The deep uttered his voice,

And did lift up his hands on high.

See [Rev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md) : 'And I saw a great
white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the
heaven fled away.' The figure in Isaiah is a strong one to denote the
terror of the anger of God against Babylon.

[Isaiah 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 13:14</span></span>

And it shall be - Babylon shall be.

As the chased roe - Once so proud. lofty, arrogant, and self-confident;
it shall be as the trembling gazelle, or the timid deer pursued by the
hunter, and panting for safety. The word (צבי tsebı̂y) denotes a deer of
the most delicate frame; the species that is most fleet and graceful in
its movements; properly the "gazelle" (see Bochart's "Hieroz." i. 3.
25). 'To hunt the antelope is a favorite amusement in the East, but
which, from its extraordinary swiftness, is attended with great
difficulty. On the first alarm, it flies like an arrow from the bow, and
leaves the best-mounted hunter, and the fleetest dog, far behind. The
sportsman is obliged to call in the aid of the falcon, trained to the
work, to seize on the animal, and impede its motions, to give the dogs
time to overtake it. Dr. Russel thus describes the chase of the
antelope: "They permit horsemen, without dogs, if they advance gently,
to approach near, and do not seem much to regard a caravan that passes
within a little distance; but the moment they take the alarm, they bound
away, casting from time to time a look behind: and if they find
themselves pursued, they lay their horns backward, almost close on the
shoulders, and flee with incredible swiftness. When dogs appear, they
instantly take the alarm, for which reason the sportsmen endeavor to
steal upon the antelope unawares, to get as near as possible before
slipping the dogs; and then, pushing on at full speed, they throw off
the falcon, which being taught to strike or fix upon the cheek of the
game, retards its course by repeated attacks, until the greyhounds have
time to get up."' - (Burder's "Orient. Cus.")

As a sheep - Or like a scattered flock of sheep in the wilderness that
has no shepherd, and no one to collect them together; an image also of
that which is timid and defenseless.

That no man taketh up - That is astray, and not under the protection of
any shepherd. The meaning is, that that people, once so proud and
self-confident, would become alarmed, and scattered, and be afraid of
everything.

They shall every man turn unto his own people - Babylon was the capital
of the pagan world. It was a vast and magnificent city; the center of
many nations. It would be the place, therefore, where numerous
foreigners would take up a temporary residence, as London and other
large cities are now. Jeremiah [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md) describes Babylon as containing
a mingled population - 'and upon all the mingled people that are in the
midst of her' - that is, "the colluvies gentium," as Tacitus describes
Rome in his time. Jeremiah also [Jer
50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028.md) describes this mingled multitude
as fleeing and escaping out of the land of Babylon, when these
calamities should come upon them. The idea in Isaiah is, that this great
and mixed multitude would endeavor to escape the impending calamities,
and flee to their own nations.

[Isaiah 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 13:15</span></span>

Every one that is found - In Babylon, or that is overtaken in fleeing
from it. This is a description of the capture of the city, and of the
slaughter that would ensue, when the invaders would spare neither age
nor sex.

Every one that is joined unto them - Their allies and friends. There
shall be a vast, indiscriminate slaughter of all that are found in the
city, and of those that attempt to flee from it. Lowth renders this,
'And all that are collected in a body;' but the true sense is given in
our translation. The Chaldee renders it, 'And every one who enters into
fortified cities shall be slain with the sword.'

[Isaiah 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 13:16</span></span>

Their children also shall be dashed to pieces - This is a description of
the horrors of the capture of Babylon; and there can be none more
frightful and appalling than that which is here presented. That this is
done in barbarous nations in the time of war, there can be no doubt.
Nothing was more common among American savages, than to dash out the
brains of infants against a rock or a tree, and it was often done before
the eyes of the afflicted and heartbroken parents. That these horrors
were not unknown in Oriental nations of antiquity, is evident. Thus, the
Psalmist implies that it would be done in Babylon, in exact accordance
with this prediction of Isaiah; [Psa
137:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md) :

O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed:

Happy shall he be who rewardeth these as thou hast served us;

Happy shall he be who taketh and dasheth thy little ones

Against the stones.

Thus, also, it is said of Hazael, that when he came to be king of Syria,
he would be guilty of this barbarity in regard to the Jews ([Kg2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013.md); compare [Nah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010).md). It was an evidence of the
barbarous feelings of the times; and a proof that they were far, very
far, from the humanity which is now deemed indispensable even in war.

Their houses shall be spoiled - Plundered. It is implied here, says
Kimchi, that this was to be done also 'before their eyes,' and thus the
horrors of the capture would be greatly increased.

[Isaiah 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 13:17</span></span>

Behold, I will stir up - I will cause them to engage in this enterprise.
This is an instance of the control which God claims over the nations,
and of his power to excite and direct them as he pleases.

The Medes - This is one of the places in which the prophet specified,
"by name," the instrument of the wrath of God. Cyrus himself is
subsequently mentioned [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md);
[Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md) as the agent by which God
would accomplish his purposes. It is remarkable, also, that 'the Medes'
are mentioned here many years before they became a separate and
independent nation. It was elsewhere predicted that the Medes would be
employed in this siege of Babylon; thus, in [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md) : 'Go up, O Elam (that is,
Persia), besiege, O Media;' [Jer 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md)
: 'Jehovah hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, for his
device is against Babylon to destroy it.' Media was a country east of
Assyria, which is supposed to have been populated by the descendants of
Madai, son of Japheth [Gen 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002.md).
Ancient Media extended on the west and south of the Caspian Sea, from
Armenia, on the north, to Faristan or Persia proper, on the south.

It was one of the most fertile regions of Asia. It was an ancient
kingdom. Ninus, the founder of the Assyrian monarchy, is said to have
encountered one of its kings, whom he subdued, and whose province he
made a part of the Assyrian empire. For 520 years, the Medes were
subject to the Assyrians; but, in the time of Tiglath-pileser and
Shalmaneser, they revolted, and, by the destruction of the army of
Sennacherib before Jerusalem - an event which was itself subsequent to
the delivery of this prophecy respecting Babylon - they were enabled to
achieve their independence. At the time when this prophecy was uttered,
therefore, Media was a dependent province of the kingdom of Assyria. Six
years they passed in a sort of anarchy, until, about 700 years b.c.,
they found in Dejoces an upright statesman, who was proclaimed king by
universal consent. His son and successor, Phraortes, subdued the
Persians, and all upper Asia, and united them to his kingdom.

He also attacked Assyria, and laid siege to Nineveh, the capital, but
was defeated. Nineveh was finally taken by his successor, Cyaxares, with
the aid of his ally, the king of Babylon; and Assyria became a province
of Media. This widely-extended empire was delivered by him to his son
Astyages, the father of Cyrus. Astyages reigned about 35 years, and then
delivered the vast kingdom to Cyrus, about 556 years b.c., under whom
the prediction of Isaiah respecting Babylon was fulfilled. In this way
arose the Medo-Persian kingdom, and henceforward "the laws of the Medes
and Persians" are always mentioned together [Est
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#009.md); [Est
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002.md); [Dan
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#008.md), [Dan
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#012.md). From this time, all their
customs, rites, and laws, became amalgamated. - (Herod. i. 95-130). In
looking at this prophecy, therefore, we are to bear in mind:

\(1\) the fact that, when it was uttered, Media was a dependent province
of the kingdom of Assyria;

\(2\) that a long time was yet to elapse before it would become an
independent kingdom;

\(3\) that it was yet to secure its independence by the aid of that very
Babylon which it would finally destroy;

\(4\) that no human foresight could predict these revolutions, and that
every circumstance conspired to render this event improbable.

The great strength and resources of Babylon; the fact that Media was a
dependent province, and that such great revolutions must occur before
this prophecy could be fulfilled, render this one of the most striking
and remarkable predictions in the sacred volume.

Which shall not regard silver ... - It is remarkable, says Lowth, that
Xenophon makes Cyrus open a speech to his army, and, in particular, to
the Medes, who made the principal part of it, with praising them for
their disregard of riches. 'Ye Medes and others who now hear me, I well
know, that you have not accompanied me in this expedition with a view of
acquiring wealth.' - ("Cyrop." v.) That this was the character of the
Medes, is further evident from several circumstances. 'He reckoned, says
Xenophon, that his riches belonged not anymore to himself than to his
friends. So little did he regard silver, or delight in gold, that
Croesus told him that, by his liberality, he would make himself poor,
instead of storing up vast treasures for himself. The Medes possessed,
in this respect, the spirit of their chief, of which an instance,
recorded by Xenophon, is too striking and appropriate to be passed over.

When Gobryas, an Assyrian governor, whose son the king of Babylon had
slain, hospitably entertained him and his army, Cyrus appealed to the
chiefs of the Medes and Hyrcanians, and to the noblest and most
honorable of the Persians, whether, giving first what was due to the
gods, and leaving to the rest of the army their portion, they would not
overmatch his generosity by ceding to him their whole share of the first
and plentiful booty which they had won from the land of Babylon. Loudly
applauding the proposal, they immediately and unanimously consented; and
one of them said, "Gobryas may have thought us poor, because we came not
loaded with coins, and drink not out of golden cups; but by this he will
know, that men can be generous even without gold."' ("See" Keith "On the
Prophecies," p. 198, Ed. New York, 1833.) This is a remarkable
prediction, because this is a very unusual circumstance in the character
of conquerors. Their purpose has been chiefly to obtain plunder, and,
especially, gold and silver have been objects to them of great value.
Few, indeed, have been the invading armies which were not influenced by
the hope of spoil; and the want of that characteristic among the Medes
is a circumstance which no human sagacity could have foreseen.

[Isaiah 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 13:18</span></span>

Their bows also - Bows and arrows were the usual weapons of the ancients
in war; and the Persians were particularly skilled in their use.
According to Xenophon, Cyrus came to Babylon with a great number of
archers and slingers (Cyrop. ii. 1).

Shall dash the young men ... - That is, they shall dash the young men to
pieces, or kill them by their bows and arrows. Vulgate, 'And with their
arrows shall they slay the young.' The meaning of the word here rendered
'dash to pieces,' is to smite suddenly to the ground.

[Isaiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 13:19</span></span>

And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms - That is, the capital or chief
ornament of many nations. Appellations of this kind, applied to Babylon,
abound in the Scriptures. In [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030.md), it is called 'great Babylon;' in
[Isa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004.md), it is called 'the golden
city;' in [Isa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md), 'the lady of
kingdoms;' in [Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md), it is,
spoken of as 'abundant in treasures;' and, in [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md), as 'the praise of the whole
earth.' All these expressions are designed to indicate its immense
wealth and magnificence. It was the capital of a mighty empire, and was
the chief city of the pagan world.

The beauty of the Chaldees' excellency - Hebrew, 'The glory of the pride
of the Chaldees;' or the ornament of the proud Chaldees. It was their
boast and glory; it was that on which they chiefly prided themselves.
How well it deserved these appellations we have already seen.

Shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah - [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md). That is, shall be completely
and entirely overthrown; shall cease to be inhabited, and shall be
perfectly desolate. It does not mean that it shall be overthrown in the
same manner as Sodom was, but that it should be as completely and
entirely ruined. The successive steps in the overthrow of Babylon, by
which this prophecy was so signally fulfilled, were the following:

\(1\) The taking of the city by Cyrus. This was accomplished by his
clearing out the "Pallacopas," a canal that was made for the purpose of
emptying the superfluous waters of the Euphrates into the lakes and
marshes formed by it in the south - west borders of the province toward
Arabia. Into this canal he directed the waters of the Euphrates, and was
thus enabled to enter the city in the channel of the river under the
walls (see the notes at [Isa 45:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md).
He took the city by surprise, and when the inhabitants, confident of
security, had given themselves up to the riot of a grand public
festival; and the king and the nobles were revelling at a public
entertainment. From this cause, also, it happened that the waters, which
were thus diverted from their usual channel, converted the whole country
into a vast, unhealthy morass, that contributed greatly to the decline
of Babylon.

\(2\) The "second" capture of Babylon by Darius Hystaspes. Cyrus was not
the destroyer of the city, but he rather sought to preserve its
magnificence, and to perpetuate its pre-eminence among the nations. He
left it to his successor in all its strength and magnificence. But,
after his death, it rebelled against Darius, and bade defiance to the
power of the whole Persian empire. Fully resolved not to yield, they
adopted the resolution of putting every woman in the city to death, with
the exception of their mothers and one female, the best beloved in every
family, to bake their bread. All the rest, says Herodotus (iii. 150),
were assembled together and strangled. The city was taken at that time
by Darius, by the aid of Zopyrus, son of Megabyzus, who, in order to do
it, mutilated himself beyond the power of recovery. He cut off his nose
and ears, and having scourged himself severely, presented himself before
Darius. He proposed to Darius to enter the city, apparently as a
deserter who had been cruelly treated by Darius, and to deliver the city
into his hands.

He was one of the chief nobles of Persia; was admitted in this manner
within the walls; represented himself as having been punished because he
advised Darius to raise the siege; was admitted to the confidence of the
Babylonians; and was finally entrusted with an important military
command. After several successful conflicts with the Persians, and when
it was supposed his fidelity had been fully tried, he was raised to the
chief command of the army; and was appointed to the responsible office
of τειχοφύλαξ teichophulax, or guardian of the walls. Having obtained
this object, he opened the gates of Babylon to the Persian army, as he
had designed, and the city was taken without difficulty (Herod. iii.
153-160). As soon as Darius had taken the city, he 'leveled the walls,
and took away the gates, neither of which things had Cyrus done before.
Three thousand of the most distinguished of the nobility he ordered to
be crucified; the rest he suffered to remain.' - (Herod. iii. 159.)

\(3\) After its conquest by Darius, it was always regarded by the
Persian monarchs with a jealous eye. Xerxes destroyed the temples of the
city, and, among the rest, the celebrated temple or tower of Belus
(Strabo, xvi. 1, 5.) 'Darius,' says Herodotus, 'had designs upon the
golden statue in the temple of Belus, but did not dare to take it; but
Xerxes, his son, took it, and slew the priest who resisted its removal.'

\(4\) The city was captured a third time, by Alexander the Great.
Mazaeus, the Persian general, surrendered the city into his hands, and
he entered it with his army - "velut in aciem irent" - 'as if they were
marching to battle.' - (Q. Curtius, v. 3.) It was afterward taken by
Antigonus, by Demetrius, by Antiochus the Great, and by the Parthians;
and each successive conquest contributed to its reduction.

\(5\) Cyrus transferred the capital from Babylon to Susa or Shusan [Neh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md); [Ezr
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#008.md); [Ezr
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#016.md); [Ezr
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#011.md), [Ezr
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015.md), which became the capital of the
kingdom of Persia, and, of course, contributed much to diminish the
importance of Babylon itself.

\(6\) Seleucus Nicator founded Seleucia in the neighborhood of Babylon,
on the Tigris, chiefly with a design to draw off the inhabitants of
Babylon to a rival city, and to prevent its importance. A great part of
its population migrated to the new city of Seleucia (Plin. "Nat. Hist."
vi. 30). Babylon thus gradually declined until it lost all its
importance, and the very place where it stood was, for a long time,
unknown. About the beginning of the first century, a small part of it
only was inhabited, and the greater portion was cultivated (Diod. Sic.
ii. 27). In the second century, nothing but the walls remained
(Pausanius, "Arcad." c. 33). It became gradually a great desert; and, in
the fourth century, its walls, repaired for that purpose, formed an
enclosure for wild beasts, and Babylon was converted into a hunting
place for the pastime of the Persian monarchs. After this, there is an
interval of many ages in the history of its mutilated remains, and of
its mouldering decay (Keith, "On the Prophecies," p. 216; Jerome,
"Commentary on Isa." ch. xiv.) Benjamin of Tudela vaguely alludes to the
palace of Nebuchadnezzar, which, he says, could not be entered, on
account of its being the abode of dragons and wild beasts. Sir John
Maundeville, who traveled over Asia, 1322 a.d., says, that 'Babylone is
in the grete desertes of Arabye, upon the waye as men gert towarde the
kyngdome of Caldce. But it is full longe sithe ony man durste neyhe to
the toure, for it is alle deserte and full of dragons and grete
serpentes, and fulle dyverse veneymouse bestes all abouten.'

[Isaiah 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 13:20</span></span>

It shall never be inhabited - This has been completely fulfilled. It is
now, and has been for centuries, a scene of wide desolation, and is a
heap of ruins, and there is every indication that it will continue so to
be. From Rauwolff's testimony it appears, that in the sixteenth century
'there was not a house to be seen;' and now the 'eye wanders over a
barren desert, in which the ruins are nearly the only indication that it
had ever been inhabited. It is impossible to behold this scene and not
be reminded how exactly the predictions of Isaiah and Jeremiah have been
fulfilled, even in the appearance Babylon was doomed to present, "that
she should never be inhabited."' - (Keppel's "Narrative," p. 234.)
'Babylon is spurned alike by the heel of the Ottoman, the Israelites,
and the sons of Ishmael.' - (Mignan's "Travels," p. 108.) 'It is a
tenantless and desolate metropolis.' - (Ibid. p. 235; see Keith "On
Prophecy," p. 221.)

Neither shall it be dwelt in ... - This is but another form of the
expression, denoting that it shall be utterly desolate. The following
testimonies of travelers will show how this accomplished: 'Ruins
composed, like those of Babylon, of heaps of rubbish impregnated with
nitre, cannot be cultivated.' - (Rich's "Memoir," p. 16.) 'The
decomposing materials of a Babylonian structure doom the earth on which
they perish, to lasting sterility. On this part of the plain, both where
traces of buildings are left, and where none stood, all seemed equally
naked of vegetation; the whole ground appearing as if it had been washed
over and over again by the coming and receding waters, until every bit
of genial soil was swept away; its half-clay, half-sandy surface being
left in ridgy streaks, like what is often seen on the flat shores of the
sea after the retreating of the tide.' - (Sir R. K. Porter's "Travels,"
vol. ii. p. 392.) 'The ground is low and marshy, and presents not the
slightest vestige of former buildings, of any description whatever.' -
(Buckingham's "Travels," vol. ii. p. 278.) 'The ruins of Babylon are
thus inundated so as to render many parts of them inaccessible, by
converting the valleys among them into morasses.' - (Rich's "Memoir," p.
13.)

Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there - The Arabians dwelt chiefly
in tents; and were a wandering people, or engaged in traffic which was
conducted in caravans traveling from place to place. The idea here is,
that Babylon, so far from being occupied as a permanent residence for
any people, would be unfit even for a resting place. It would be so
utterly desolate, so forsaken, and so unhealthy, that the caravan would
not even stop there for a night. What a charge this from its former
splendor! How different from the time when it was the place of
magnificent palaces, when strangers flocked to it, and when people from
all nations were collected there!

Neither shall the shepherds ... - This is an additional image of
desolation. Babylon was situated in the midst of a most fertile region.
It might be supposed that, though it was to be destroyed, it would still
furnish pasturage for flocks. But no, says the prophet, it shall be so
utterly and entirely desolate, that it shall not even afford pasturage
for them. The reasons of this are:

\(1\) that the whole region round about Babylon was laid under water by
the Euphrates after the city was taken, and became a stagnant pool, and
of course an unfit place for flocks; and

\(2\) that Babylon was reduced to an extended scene of ruins; and on
those ruins - those extended wastes of broken walls, of bricks and
cement - no grass would grow.

The prophecy has been remarkably fulfilled. It is said that the Arabs
cannot be persuaded to remain there even for a night. They traverse
these ruins by day without fear; but at night the superstitious dread of
evil spirits deters them from remaining there. 'Captain Mignan was
accompanied by six Arabs completely armed, but he "could not induce them
to remain toward night, from the apprehension of evil spirits. It is
impossible to eradicate this idea from the minds of these people, who
are very deeply imbued with superstition ... And when the sun sunk
behind the Mujelibe, and the moon would have lighted his way among the
ruins, it was with infinite regret that he obeyed the summons of his
guides."' - (Mignan's "Travels," as quoted by Keith, pp. 221, 222.) 'All
the people of the country assert that it is extremely dangerous to
approach the mound' (the mound in Babylon called Kasr, or Palad) 'after
nightfall, on account of the multitude of evil spirits by which it is
haunted.' - (Rich's "Memoir on the Ruins of Babylon," p. 27.) The Joseph
Wolff, speaking of his visit to Babylon, says, 'I inquired of them (the
Yezeedes), whether the Arabs ever pitched their tents among the ruins of
Babylon. No, said they, the Arabs believe that the ghost of Nimrod walks
amidst them in the darkness, and no Arab would venture on so hazardous
an experiment.'

[Isaiah 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 13:21</span></span>

But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there - Hebrew, (ציים tsı̂yı̂ym).
This word denotes properly those animals that dwell in dry and desolate
places, from צי tsı̂y "a waste, a desert." The ancient versions have
differed considerably in the interpretation. The Septuagint in different
places renders it, Θηριά Thēria - 'Wild animals;' or δαιμόνια daimonia -
'Demons.' The Syriac, 'Wild animals, spirits, sirens.' Vulgate, 'Beasts,
demons, dragons.' Abarbanel renders it, 'Apes.' This word is applied to
people, in [Psa 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md); [Psa
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md); to animals, [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md); [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md); [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md). Bochart supposes that wild cats
or catamounts are here intended. He has proved that they abound in
eastern countries. They feed upon dead carcasses, and live in the woods,
or in desert places, and are remarkable for their howl. Their yell
resembles that of infants. ("See" Bochart's "Hieroz." i. 3. 14. pp.
860-862.)

And their houses shall be full of doleful creatures - Margin, 'Ochim,'
or 'Ostriches.' אחים 'ochı̂ym. The Septuagint renders this 'Clamours,' or
'Howlings,' without supposing that it refers to any particular animals.
The Hebrew word is found nowhere else. Bochart supposes that the yell or
howl of wild animals is intended, and not animals themselves ("Hieroz."
i. 3. 15).

And owls shall dwell there - Hebrew, 'Daughters of the owl or ostrich.'
The owl is a well-known bird that dwells only in obscure and dark
retreats, giving a doleful screech, and seeking its food only at night.
It is not certain, however, that the owl is intended here. The
Septuagint renders it, Σειρῆνες Seirēnes - 'Sirens.' The Chaldee, 'The
daughter of the ostrich.' Bochart has gone into an extended argument to
prove that the ostrich is intended here ("Hieroz." xi. 2. 14). The
Hebrew does not particularly denote the kind of bird intended, but means
those that are distinguished for their sound - 'the daughters of sound
or clamor.' 'The ostrich is a sly and timorous creature, delighting in
solitary barren deserts. In the night they frequently make a very
doleful and hideous noise; sometimes groaning as if they were in the
greatest agonies.' (Shaw's "Travels," vol. ii. p. 348, 8vo; Taylor's
"Heb. Con.;" see [Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029.md); [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md); [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md); [Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md); [Lev
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#016.md); [Deu
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#015.md); [Lam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003)..md) The word does not elsewhere
occur.

And satyrs shall dance there - (שׂערים s'e‛ı̂rı̂ym). A "satyr," in
mythology, was a sylvan deity or demigod, represented as a monster, half
man and half goat, having horns on his head, a hairy body, with the feet
and tail of a goat (Webster). The word used here properly denotes that
which is "hairy," or "rough," and is applied to "goats" in [Gen
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025.md); [Psa
68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md); [Lev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#010.md), [Lev
13:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#025.md), [Lev
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#030.md), [Lev
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#032.md). It is often rendered "hair."
("see" Taylor). In [Isa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md), it is
rendered 'satyr;' in [Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md), it is
rendered 'the small ram;' in [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md), and [Ch2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015.md), it is rendered 'the devils,'
meaning objects of worship, or idols. Bochart supposes that it refers to
the idols that were worshipped among the Egyptians, who placed "goats"
among their gods. Doderlin supposes that it means either "fawns," or a
species of the monkey tribe, resembling in their rough and shaggy
appearance the wild goat.

They are here represented as 'dancing;' and in [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md), as 'crying to each other.' It
is evident that the prophet intends animals of a rough and shaggy
appearance; such as are quick and nimble in their motions; such as dwell
in deserts, in forests, or in old ruins; and such as answer to each
other, or chatter. The description would certainly seem more applicable
to some of the "simia" or monkey tribe than to any other animals. It is
"possible," indeed, that he means merely to make use of language that
was well known, as describing animals that the ancients "supposed" had
an existence, but which really had not, as the imaginary beings called
satyrs. But it is possible, also, that he means simply wild goats
(compare Bochart's "Hieroz." xi. 6. 7). The Septuagint renders it
Δαιμόνια Daimonia - 'Demons, or devils.' The Vulgate, Pilosi - 'Shaggy,
or hairy animals.' The Chaldee, 'Demons.' The essential idea is, that
such wild animals as are supposed to dwell in wastes and ruins, would
hold their revels in the forsaken and desolate palaces of Babylon. The
following remarks of Joseph Wolff may throw light on this passage: 'I
then went to the mountain of Sanjaar, which was full of Yezeedes. One
hundred and fifty years ago, they believed in the glorious doctrine of
the Trinity, and worshipped the true God; but being severely persecuted
by the neighboring Yezeedes, they have now joined them, and are
worshippers of the devil.

These people frequent the ruins of Babylon, and dance around them. On a
certain night, which they call the Night of Life, they hold their dances
around the desolate ruins, in honor of the devil. The passage which
declares that "satyrs shall dance there," evidently has respect to this
very practice. The original word translated "satyr," literally means,
according to the testimony of the most eminent Jewish rabbis, "devil
worshippers."' 'It is a curious circumstance,' says Mr. Rich, in his
"Memoir on the Ruins of Babylon," p. 30, in describing the Mujelibe,
'that here I first heard the oriental account of satyrs. I had always
imagined the belief of their existence was confined to the mythology of
the west; but a Choadar who was with me when I examined this ruin,
mentioned by accident, that in this desert an animal is found resembling
a man from the head to the waist, but having the thighs and legs of a
sheep or a goat; he said also that the Arabs hunt it with dogs, and eat
the lower parts, abstaining from the upper on account of their
resemblance to the human species.' 'The Arabians call them Sied-as-sad,
and say that they abound in some woody places near Semava on the
Euphrates.'

[Isaiah 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 13:22</span></span>

And the wild beasts of the islands - (איים 'ı̂yı̂ym); see the notes at
[Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md); [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md), on the word rendered 'islands.'
The word denotes islands, or coasts, and as those coasts and islands
were unknown and unexplored, the word seems to have denoted unknown and
uninhabited regions in general. Boehart supposes that by the word here
used is denoted a species of wolves, the jackal, or the "thoes." It is
known as a wild animal, exceedingly fierce, and is also distinguished by
alternate howlings in the night ("see" Bochart's "Hieroz." i. 3. 12).
The word wolf probably will not express an erroneous idea here. The
Chaldee renders it, 'Cats.'

Shall cry - Hebrew, 'Shall answer, or respond to each other.' This is
known to be the custom of wolves and some other wild animals, who send
forth those dismal howls in alternate responses at night. This
alternation of the howl or cry gives an additional impressiveness to the
loneliness and desolation of forsaken Babylon.

And dragons - (תנין tannı̂yn). This word, in its various forms of
"tannim, taninim, tannin, and tannoth," denotes sometimes "jackals or
thoes," as in [Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029.md); [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019.md); [Mic
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md); [Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003.md). But it also denotes a great fish,
a whale, a sea monster, a dragon, a serpent. It is translated 'a whale'
in [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md); [Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md); 'serpents,' [Exo
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009.md), [Exo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012.md); 'dragons,' or 'dragon,' [Deu

properly means a kind of winged serpent much celebrated in the dark
ages. Here it may not improperly be rendered "jackal" ("see" Bochart's
"Hieroz." i. 1. 9, p. 69).

In their pleasant palaces - Hebrew, 'Their palaces of luxury and
pleasure.' The following testimonies from travelers will show how
minutely this was accomplished: 'There are many dens of wild beasts in
various parts.' 'There are quantities of porcupine quills.' 'In most of
the cavities are numberless bats and owls.' 'These caverns, over which
the chambers of majesty may have been spread, are now the refuge of
jackals and other savage animals. The mouths of their entrances are
strewed with the bones of sheep and "goats;" and the loathsome smell
that issues from most of them is sufficient warning not to proceed into
the den.' - (Sir R. K. Porter's "Travels," vol. ii. p. 342.) 'The mound
was full of large holes; we entered some of them, and found them strewed
with the carcasses and skeletons of animals recently killed. The ordure
of wild beasts was so strong, that prudence got the better of curiosity,
for we had no doubt as to the savage nature of the inhabitants. Our
guides, indeed, told us that all the ruins abounded in lions and other
wild beasts; so literally has the divine prediction been fulfilled, that
wild beasts of the deserts should lie there.' - (Keppel's "Narrative,"
vol. i. pp. 179, 180.)

And her time is near to come - This was spoken about 174 years before
the destruction of Babylon. But we are to bear in mind that the prophet
is to be supposed to be speaking to the captive Jews "in" Babylon, and
speaking to them respecting their release (see [Isa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md); compare remarks on the
Analysis of this chapter). Thus considered, supposing the prophet to be
addressing the Jews in captivity, or ministering consolation to them,
the time was near. Or if we suppose him speaking as in his own time, the
period when Babylon was to be destroyed was at no great distance.

On this whole prophecy, we may observe:

\(1\) That it was uttered at least 170 years before it was fulfilled. Of
this there is all the proof that can be found in regard to any ancient
writings.

\(2\) When uttered, there was the strongest improbability that it would
be fulfilled. This improbability arose from the following circumstances:

\(a\) The Jews were secure in their own land, and they had no reason to
dread the Babylonians; they had no wars with them, and it was improbable
that they would be plucked up as a nation and carried there as captives.
Such a thing had never occurred, and there were no circumstances that
made it probable that it would occur.

\(b\) The great strength and security of Babylon rendered it improbable.
It was the capital of the pagan world; and if there was any city that
seemed impregnable, it was this.

\(c\) It was improbable that it would be overthrown by "the Medes."
Media, at the time when the prophecy was uttered, was a dependent
province of Assyria (note, [Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017).md), and it was wholly improbable
that the Medes would revolt; that they would subdue their masters; that
they would be united to the Persians, and that thus a new kingdom would
arise, that should overthrow the most mighty capital of the world.

\(d\) It was improbable that Babylon would become uninhabitable. It was
in the midst of a most fertile country; and by no human sagacity could
it have been seen that the capital would be removed to Susa, or that
Seleucia would be founded, thus draining it of its inhabitants; or that
by the inundation of waters it would become unhealthy. How could mere
human sagacity have foreseen that there would not be a house in it in
the sixteenth century; or that now, in 1839, it would be a wide and
dreary waste? Can any man now tell what London, or Paris, or New York,
or Philadelphia, will be two years hence? Yet a prediction that those
cities shall be the residence of 'wild beasts of the desert,' of
'satyrs' and 'dragons,' would be as probable now as was the prediction
respecting Babylon at the time when Isaiah uttered these remarkable
prophecies.

\(3\) The prophecy is not vague conjecture. It is not a "general"
statement. It is minute, and definite, and particular; and it has been
as definitely, and minutely, and particularly fulfilled.

\(4\) This is one of the evidences of the divine origin of the Bible.
How will the infidel account for this prophecy and its fulfillment? It
will not do to say that it is accident. It is too minute, and too
particular. It is not human sagacity. No human sagacity could have
foretold it. It is not "fancied fulfillment." It is real, in the most
minute particulars. And if so, then Isaiah was commissioned by Yahweh as
he claimed to be - for none but the omniscient jehovah can foresee and
describe future events as the destruction of Babylon was foreseen and
described. And if "this" prophecy was inspired by God, by the same train
of reasoning it can be proved that the whole Bible is a revelation from
heaven. For a very interesting account of the present state of the ruins
of Babylon, furnishing the most complete evidence of the fulfillment of
the Prophecies in regard to it, the reader may consult an article in the
"Amos Bib. Rep.," vol. viii. pp. 177-189. (See also the two "Memoirs on
the Ruins of Babylon," by C. John Rich, Esq. London, 1816 and 1818.) The
frontispiece to this volume, compiled from the sketches of recent
travelers, gives accurate and interesting views of those ruins.
