### [Jeremiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 35:2</span></span>

The house - The family.

The Rechabites - The Rechabites were a nomadic tribe not of Jewish but
of Kenite race, and connected with the Amalekites [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006), from whom however they had
separated themselves, and made a close alliance with the tribe of Judah
[Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016), on whose southern borders
they took up their dwelling [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010). While, however, the main body
of the Kenites gradually adopted settled habits, and dwelt in cities
[Sa1 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029), the Rechabites persisted
in leading the free desert life, and in this determination they were
finally confirmed by the influence and authority of Jonadab, who lived
in Jehu's reign. He was a zealous adherent of Yahweh [Kg2
10:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015), and possibly a religious
reformer; and as the names of the men mentioned in the present narrative
are all compounded with Yah, it is plain that the tribe continued their
allegiance to Him.

The object of Jonadab in endeavoring to preserve the nomad habits of his
race was probably twofold. He wished first to maintain among them the
purer morality and higher feeling of the desert contrasted with the
laxity and effeminacy of the city life; and secondly he was anxious for
the preservation of their freedom. Their punctilious obedience [Jer
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014) to Jonadab's precepts is
employed by Jeremiah to point a useful lesson for his own people.

The date of the prophecy is the interval between the battle of
Carchemish and the appearance of Nebuchadnezzar at Jerusalem, [Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011) at the end of the same year. It
is consequently 17 years earlier than the narrative in [Jer
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008) ff

[Jeremiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 35:3</span></span>

Jaazaniah was the chief of that portion of the tribe which had taken
refuge in Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 35:4</span></span>

The title man of God, i. e., prophet, belongs to Hanan, identified by
many with Hanani [Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007). The sons
of Hanan were probably his disciples. If so, we find a religious school
or sect, regularly established in the precincts of the temple, of whose
views and modes of interpretation we know nothing. Plainly however, the
Hananites were friendly to Jeremiah, and lent him their hall for his
purpose.

The chamber of the princes - Probably the council-chamber in which the
great officers of state met for the despatch of business.

The keeper of the door - There were three of these keepers, answering to
the outer and inner courts of the temple, and the entrance to the temple
itself. They were officers of high rank, having precedence next to the
high priest and his deputy.

[Jeremiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 35:5</span></span>

Pots - "Bowls," to fill the cups.

[Jeremiah 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 35:6</span></span>

Wine is the symbol of a settled life, because the vine requires time for
its growth and care in its cultivation, while the preparation of the
wine itself requires buildings, and it then has to be stored up before
it is ready for use. The drink of nomads consists of the milk of their
herds.

[Jer 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007)

Strangers - Because not of Jewish blood, though wandering in their
territory.

[Jeremiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 35:8</span></span>

Our father - Not merely our ancestor, but the founder of our
institutions.

[Jeremiah 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 35:11</span></span>

The Syrians - The Septuagint substitutes Assyrians for Syrians, but
marauding bands of the Aramaeans are probably meant.

[Jeremiah 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 35:13</span></span>

Jeremiah, accompanied by the main body of the Rechabites, went into one
of the courts of the temple, and there addressed to the people the
rebuke following.

[Jeremiah 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 35:14</span></span>

Are performed - Are established, i. e., are maintained in full force.

Unto this day - i. e., for more than 200 years.

[Jeremiah 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 35:15</span></span>

All ... the prophets - The Rechabites had had but one lawgiver: the Jews
had had a succession of messengers from God.

[Jeremiah 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 35:19</span></span>

Travelers bear witness to the existence of a large tribe who represent
themselves as the descendants of the Rechabites. The prediction was also
literally fulfilled in the Rechabites being in some way incorporated
into the tribe of Levi, whose office especially it was to "stand before"
Yahweh [Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008).
