### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 15:5</span></span>

The Lord smote the king, so that he was a leper - The circumstances
under which this terrible affliction befel one of the greatest of the
Jewish kings, are given at some length by the author of Chronicles
(marginal reference), who supplies us with a tolerably full account of
this important reign, which the writer of Kings dismisses in
half-a-dozen verses.

A several house - "A house of liberation," or, freedom. On the
necessity, under which the Law placed lepers, of living apart from other
men, see marginal reference Jotham became regent in his father's room,
and exercised the functions of judge ([Kg1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009) note.md), from the time that his
father became a leper.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 15:8</span></span>

In the thirty and eighth year - Rather, according to the previous
numbers [Kg2 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md); [Kg2
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#002.md), the 27th year of Azariah. Some
suppose an interregnum between Jeroboam and Zachariah, which, however,
is very improbable.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 15:10</span></span>

Before the people - i. e. openly and publicly. The Septuagint turns the
original of the above words into a proper name, Keblaam, and makes him
the actual assassin, but without much ground.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 15:14</span></span>

Tirzah, the old capital, once more appears as a place of importance,
giving birth to the pretender, who alone of all these later kings died a
natural death, and left the crown to his son [Kg2
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#022.md). It would seem from the present
passage to have been on lower ground than Samaria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 15:16</span></span>

With respect to the supposed inability of Menahem to lead an expedition
to Tiphsah (Thapsacus, see the marginal reference) on the Euphrates, we
may note in the first place that such an expedition was a natural sequel
to Jeroboam's occupation of Hamath [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md); and further, that it would have
been greatly facilitated by the weakness of Assyria at this time, that
empire having fallen into a state of depression about 780 B.C.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 15:19</span></span>

This is the first distinct mention which we find in Scripture of Assyria
as an aggressive power. From the native monuments we learn that she had
been for above a century pushing her conquests beyond the Euphrates, and
seeking to reduce under her dominion the entire tract between that river
and Egypt. Jehu had paid tribute. Some - arguing from the use of the
phrase "confirmed the kingdom" (here, and in [Kg2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005).md) - think that Jehoahaz had
acknowledged Assyrian suzerainty, and consented that her monarchs should
receive their investiture from the hands of the Ninevite king. But
hitherto there had been no hostile invasion of Jewish or Israelite soil
by an Assyrian army. Now, however, the Assyrians are at last formally
introduced into the history. A series of aggressions is related in this
and the four following chapters, culminating, on the one hand, in the
destruction of the northern kingdom, on the other, in the complete
failure of Sennacherib's attempt upon Judaea and Egypt.

With respect to the present expedition, there are certain difficulties.
The name of Pul does not appear among the Assyrian monumental kings, and
it is absent from the copies of the Assyrian Canon, containing the
entire list of monarchs from about 910 B.C. to 670 B.C. Assyria Proper,
moreover, appears to have been in a state of depression for some 40
years before the accession of Tiglath-Pileser [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md). It is probable that, during the
depression of the Ninevite line, Pul, a Chaldaean and not an Assyrian
king, established a second monarchy upon the Euphrates, which claimed to
be the true Assyria, and was recognized as such by the nations of Syria
and Palestine. His invasion was probably provoked by Menahem's conquest
of Thapsacus, which he would view as a wanton aggression upon his
territory.

A thousand talents of silver - Compared with the tribute of Hezekiah
soon afterward [Kg2 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), this seems
a large sum; but it is not beyond the resources of such a State as
Samaria at the period. The tie which had bound Samaria to Assyria from
the reign of Jehu to that of Jeroboam II, had ceased to exist during the
period of Assyrian depression. Menahem now renewed it, undertaking the
duties of a tributary, and expecting the support which Assyria was
accustomed to lend to her dependencies in their struggles with their
neighbors. Hence, the reproaches of Hosea (marginal reference "n").

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 15:20</span></span>

Menahem exacted the money - The kings of Israel had no such ready
resource in difficulties as that possessed by the kings of Judah in the
temple treasury [Kg2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018.md); [Kg2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md). Hence, the forced contribution
from the people, the odium of which was diminished by confining the levy
to the comparatively rich.

Each man fifty shekels - As the silver talent contained 3,000 shekels,
the levy of fifty shekels a head must have extended to 60,000 persons.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 15:21</span></span>

Assyrian inscriptions show that Menahem was subsequently redfaced to
subjection by Tiglath-Pileser [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 15:25</span></span>

A captain of his - A mere "captain," a person, therefore, of very
moderate rank. The low birth of Pekah is probably glanced at in Isaiah's
favorite designation of him as "Remaliah's son" [Isa
7:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md), [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md); [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md).

From the fact that Pekah employed Gileadites to carry out his designs,
it has been conjectured that he himself belonged to the trans-Jordanic
region.

In the palace of the king's house - Rather, "In the tower of the king's
palace;" or possibly "in the harem of the king's palace" ([Kg1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#018) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 15:29</span></span>

Tiglath-Pileser is the first among the Assyrian monarchs of Scripture
whom we can certainly identify with a king mentioned in the monuments.
According to the Assyrian Dr. he reigned from 745 B.C. to 727 B.C.; and
the monuments show us this energetic and powerful prince (though,
probably, an usurper), building and repairing palaces, levying armies,
and carrying on successful wars against Merodach-Baladan in Babylonia,
Rezin at Damascus, Hiram at; Tyre, the Medes, the Armenians, the natives
of Northern Mesopotamia, and the Arabs who bordered upon Egypt. His
Assyrian name, Tiglat-pal-zira, is composed of the elements tiglat,
"adoration," pal, "son," and zira, a word of uncertain meaning.

Ijon and Abel-beth-maachah - On the position of some of the towns
mentioned in this verse see the marginal reference and [Jos
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036.md). Janoah is not the Janohah of
[Jos 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#006.md) (modern Yanun, southeast of
Nablous), but a city (Hunin?) near the Sea of Merom. Gilead is,
probably, to be limited here to a small district of Peraea, lying to the
east of Lake Merom, and in later times known as Gaulanitis (the reading
of Septuagint here). If so, we must suppose two expeditions of
Tiglath-Pileser against Pekah, the first mentioned here, and the second
recorded in Chronicles and Isaiah (see the marginal reference "q;" [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 15:30</span></span>

Hoshea, the son of Elah - One of Pekah's friends, according to Josephus.

The twentieth year of Jotham - According to [Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033.md) and [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md), Jotham reigned only 16 years.
See also the suggestion in the margin. Strangely enough, this first year
of Hoshea is also called, not the fourth, but the twelfth of Ahaz [Kg2
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md). The chronological confusion of
the history, as it stands, is striking.

Uzziah - i. e. Azariah. See [Kg2
15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 15:31</span></span>

The rest of the acts of Pekah - On these, see [Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 15:32</span></span>

The writer here resumes the history of Judah from [Kg2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#007.md), to resume and conclude the
history of Israel in 2 Kings 17.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 15:34</span></span>

Jotham imitated his father in all respects, excepting in his impious
usurpation of the priestly functions ([Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005.md) note; [Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 15:35</span></span>

He built the higher gate - Jotham followed the example of his father in
military, no less than in religious, matters (compare the marginal
reference with [Ch2 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009).md). The
"higher" or "upper gate" of the temple is thought to have been that
toward the north; and its fortification would seem to indicate fear of
an attack from that quarter.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 15:37</span></span>

The recent invasions of Pul and Tiglath-Pileser had effectually alarmed
Pekah and Rezin, and had induced them to put aside the traditional
jealousies which naturally kept them apart, and to make a league
offensive and defensive. Into this league they were anxious that Judaea
should enter; but they distrusted the house of David, which had been so
long hostile both to Damascus and to Samaria. They consequently formed
the design of transferring the Jewish crown to a certain Ben-Tabeal [Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md), probably a Jewish noble, perhaps
a refugee at one of their courts, whom they could trust to join heartily
in their schemes ([Kg2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005) note.md).
