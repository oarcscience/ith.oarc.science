### [Jonah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 1:1</span></span>

Now the word of the Lord - , literally, "And, ..." This is the way in
which the several inspired writers of the Old Testament mark that what
it was given them to write was united onto those sacred books which God
had given to others to write, and it formed with them one continuous
whole. The word, "And," implies this. It would do so in any language,
and it does so in Hebrew as much as in any other. As neither we, nor any
other people, would, without any meaning, use the word, And, so neither
did the Hebrews. It joins the four first books of Moses together; it
carries on the history through Joshua, Judges, the Books of Samuel and
of the Kings. After the captivity, Ezra and Nehemiah begin again where
the histories before left off; the break of the captivity is bridged
over; and Ezra, going back in mind to the history of God's people before
the captivity, resumes the history, as if it had been of yesterday, "And
in the first year of Cyrus." It joins in the story of the Book of Ruth
before the captivity, and that of Esther afterward. At times, even
prophets employ it, in using the narrative form of themselves, as
Ezekiel, "and it was in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the
fifth day of the month, and I was in the captivity by the river of
Chebar, the heavens opened and I saw." If a prophet or historian wishes
to detach his prophecy or his history, he does so; as Ezra probably
began the Book of Chronicles anew from Adam, or as Daniel makes his
prophecy a whole by itself. But then it is the more obvious that a
Hebrew prophet or historian, when he does begin with the word, "And,"
has an object in so beginning; he uses an universal word of all
languages in its uniform meaning in all language, to join things
together.

And yet more precisely; this form, "and the word of the Lord came to -
saying," occurs over and over again, stringing together the pearls of
great price of God's revelations, and uniting this new revelation to all
those which had preceded it. The word, "And," then joins on histories
with histories, revelations with revelations, uniting in one the
histories of God's works and words, and blending the books of Holy
Scripture into one divine book.

But the form of words must have suggested to the Jews another thought,
which is part of our thankfulness and of our being [Act
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018.md), "then to the Gentiles also hath
God given repentance unto life." The words are the self-same familiar
words with which some fresh revelation of God's will to His people had
so often been announced. Now they are prefixed to God's message to the
pagan, and so as to join on that message to all the other messages to
Israel. Would then God deal thenceforth with the pagan as with the Jews?
Would they have their prophets? Would they be included in the one family
of God? The mission of Jonah in itself was an earnest that they would,
for God. Who does nothing fitfully or capriciously, in that He had
begun, gave an earnest that He would carry on what He had begun. And so
thereafter, the great prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, were prophets
to the nations also; Daniel was a prophet among them, to them as well as
to their captives.

But the mission of Jonah might, so far, have been something exceptional.
The enrolling his book, as an integral part of the Scriptures, joining
on that prophecy to the other prophecies to Israel, was an earnest that
they were to be parts of one system. But then it would be significant
also, that the records of God's prophecies to the Jews, all embodied the
accounts of their impenitence. Here is inserted among them an account of
God's revelation to the pagan, and their repentance. "So many prophets
had been sent, so many miracles performed, so often had captivity been
foreannounced to them for the multitude of their sins. and they never
repented. Not for the reign of one king did they cease from the worship
of the calves; not one of the kings of the ten tribes departed from the
sins of Jeroboam? Elijah, sent in the Word and Spirit of the Lord, had
done many miracles, yet obtained no abandonment of the calves. His
miracles effected this only, that the people knew that Baal was no god,
and cried out, "the Lord He is the God." Elisha his disciple followed
him, who asked for a double portion of the Spirit of Elijah, that he
might work more miracles, to bring back the people.

He died, and, after his death as before it, the worship of the calves
continued in Israel. The Lord marveled and was weary of Israel, knowing
that if He sent to the pagan they would bear, as he saith to Ezekiel. To
make trial of this, Jonah was chosen, of whom it is recorded in the Book
of Kings that he prophesied the restoration of the border of Israel.
When then he begins by saying, "And the word of the Lord came to Jonah,"
prefixing the word "And," he refers us back to those former things, in
this meaning. The children have not hearkened to what the Lord
commanded, sending to them by His servants the prophets, but have
hardened their necks and given themselves up to do evil before the Lord
and provoke Him to anger; "and" therefore "the word of the Lord came to
Jonah, saying, Arise and go to Nineveh that great city, and preach unto
her," that so Israel may be shewn, in comparison with the pagan, to be
the more guilty, when the Ninevites should repent, the children of
Israel persevered in unrepentance."

Jonah the son of Amittai - Both names occur here only in the Old
Testament, Jonah signifies "Dove," Amittai, "the truth of God." Some of
the names of the Hebrew prophets so suit in with their times, that they
must either have been given them propheticly, or assumed by themselves,
as a sort of watchword, analogous to the prophetic names, given to the
sons of Hosea and Isaiah. Such were the names of Elijah and Elisha, "The
Lord is my God," "my God is salvation." Such too seems to be that of
Jonah. The "dove" is everywhere the symbol of "mourning love." The side
of his character which Jonah records is that of his defect, his want of
trust in God, and so his unloving zeal against those, who were to be the
instruments of God against his people. His name perhaps preserves that
character by which he willed to be known among his people, one who
moaned or mourned over them.

[Jonah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 1:2</span></span>

Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city - The Assyrian history, as far as
it has yet been discovered, is very bare of events in regard to this
period. We have as yet the names of three kings only for 150 years. But
Assyria, as far as we know its history, was in its meridian. Just before
the time of Jonah, perhaps ending in it, were the victorious reigns of
Shalmanubar and Shamasiva; after him was that of Ivalush or Pul, the
first aggressor upon Israel. It is clear that this was a time Of
Assyrian greatness: since God calls it "that great city," not in
relation to its extent only, but its power. A large weak city would not
have been called a "great city unto God" [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md).

And cry against it - The substance of that cry is recorded afterward,
but God told to Jonah now, what message he was to cry aloud to it. For
Jonah relates afterward, how he expostulated now with God, and that his
expostulation was founded on this, that God was so merciful that He
would not fulfill the judgment which He threatened. Faith was strong in
Jonah, while, like Apostles "the sons of thunder," before the Day of
Pentecost, he knew not" what spirit he was of." Zeal for the people and,
as he doubtless thought, for the glory of God, narrowed love in him. He
did not, like Moses, pray [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md),
"or else blot me also out of Thy book," or like Paul, desire even to be
"an anathema from Christ" [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md) for
his people's sake, so that there might be more to love his Lord. His
zeal was directed, like that of the rebuked Apostles, against others,
and so it too was rebuked. But his faith was strong. He shrank back from
the office, as believing, not as doubting, the might of God. He thought
nothing of preaching, amid that multitude of wild warriors, the stern
message of God. He was willing, alone, to confront the violence of a
city of 600,000, whose characteristic was violence. He was ready, at
God's bidding, to enter what Nahum speaks of as a den of lions [Nah
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011.md); "The dwelling of the lions
and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion did tear in
pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses." He
feared not the fierceness of their lion-nature, but God's tenderness,
and lest that tenderness should be the destruction of his own people.

Their wickedness is come up before Me - So God said to Cain, [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md). "The voice of thy brother's
blood crieth unto Me from the ground:" and of Sodom [Gen
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020.md) :21, "The cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is great, because their sin is very grievous; the cry of it is
come up unto Me." The "wickedness" is not the mere mass of human sin, of
which it is said [Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md), "the whole
world lieth in wickedness," but evil-doing toward others. This was the
cause of the final sentence on Nineveh, with which Nahum closes his
prophecy, "upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?" It bad
been assigned as the ground of the judgment on Israel through Nineveh
[Hos 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md). "So shall Bethel do
unto you, on account of the wickedness of your wickedness." It was the
ground of the destruction by the flood [Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005.md). "God saw that the wickedness of
man was great upon the earth." God represents Himself, the Great Judge,
as sitting on His Throne in heaven, Unseen but All-seeing, to whom the
wickedness and oppressiveness of man against man "goes up," appealing
for His sentence against the oppressor. The cause seems ofttimes long in
pleading. God is long-suffering with the oppressor too, that if so be,
he may repent. So would a greater good come to the oppressed also, if
the wolf became a lamb. But meanwhile, " every iniquity has its own
voice at the hidden judgment seat of God." Mercy itself calls for
vengeance on the unmerciful.

[Jonah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 1:3</span></span>

But (And) Jonah rose up to flee ... from the presence of the Lord -
literally "from being before the Lord." Jonah knew well, that man could
not escape from the presence of God, whom he knew as the Self-existing
One, He who alone is, the Maker of heaven, earth and sea. He did not
"flee" then "from His presence," knowing well what David said [Psa
139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md), [Psa
139:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009.md), "whither shall I go from Thy
Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I take the wings
of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there
shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me." Jonah fled,
not from God's presence, but from standing before him, as His servant
and minister. He refused God's service, because, as he himself tells God
afterward [Jon 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md), he knew what it
would end in, and he misliked it.

So he acted, as people often do, who dislike God's commands. He set
about removing himself as far as possible from being under the influence
of God, and from the place where he "could" fulfill them. God commanded
him to go to Nineveh, which lay northeast from his home; and he
instantly set himself to flee to the then furthermost west. Holy
Scripture sets the rebellion before us in its full nakedness. "The word
of the Lord came unto Jonah, go to Nineveh, and Jonah rose up;" he did
something instantly, as the consequence of God's command. He "rose up,"
not as other prophets, to obey, but to disobey; and that, not slowly nor
irresolutely, but "to flee, from" standing "before the Lord." He
renounced his office. So when our Lord came in the flesh, those who
found what He said to be "hard sayings," went away from Him, "and walked
no more with Him" [Joh 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md). So the
rich "young man went away sorrowful [Mat
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022.md), for he had great possessions."

They were perhaps afraid of trusting themselves in His presence; or they
were ashamed of staying there, and not doing what He said. So men, when
God secretly calls them to prayer, go and immerse themselves in
business; when, in solitude, He says to their souls something which they
do not like, they escape His Voice in a throng. If He calls them to make
sacrifices for His poor, they order themselves a new dress or some fresh
sumptuousness or self-indulgence; if to celibacy, they engage themselves
to marry immediately; or, contrariwise, if He calls them not to do a
thing, they do it at once, to make an end of their struggle and their
obedience; to put obedience out of their power; to enter themselves on a
course of disobedience. Jonah, then, in this part of his history, is the
image of those who, when God calls them, disobey His call, and how He
deals with them, when he does not abandon them. He lets them have their
way for a time, encompasses them with difficulties, so that they shall
"flee back from God displeased to God appeased."

"The whole wisdom, the whole bliss, the whole of man lies in this, to
learn what God wills him to do, in what state of life, calling, duties,
profession, employment, He wills him to serve Him." God sent each one of
us into the world, to fulfill his own definite duties, and, through His
grace, to attain to our own perfection in and through fulfilling them.
He did not create us at random, to pass through the world, doing
whatever self-will or our own pleasure leads us to, but to fulfill His
will. This will of His, if we obey His earlier calls, and seek Him by
prayer, in obedience, self-subdual, humility, thoughtfulness, He makes
known to each by His own secret drawings, and, in absence of these, at
times by His Providence or human means. And then , "to follow Him is a
token of predestination." It is to place ourselves in that order of
things, that pathway to our eternal mansion, for which God created us,
and which God created for us.

So Jesus says [Joh 10:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md), "My sheep
hear My voice and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give unto them
eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of My Hand." In these ways, God has foreordained for us all the
graces which we need; in these, we shall be free from all temptations
which might be too hard for us, in which our own special weakness would
be most exposed. Those ways, which people choose out of mere natural
taste or fancy, are mostly those which expose them to the greatest peril
of sin and damnation. For they choose them, just because such pursuits
flatter most their own inclinations, and give scope to their natural
strength and their moral weakness. So Jonah, disliking a duty, which God
gave him to fulfill, separated himself from His service, forfeited his
past calling, lost, as far as in him lay, his place among "the goodly
fellowship of the prophets," and, but for God's overtaking grace, would
have ended his days among the disobedient. As in Holy Scripture, David
stands alone of saints, who had been after their calling, bloodstained;
as the penitent robber stands alone converted in death; as Peter stands
singly, recalled after denying his Lord; so Jonah stands, the one
prophet, who, having obeyed and then rebelled, was constrained by the
overpowering providence and love of God, to return and serve Him.

"Being a prophet, Jonah could not be ignorant of the mind of God, that,
according to His great Wisdom and His unsearchable judgments and His
untraceable and incomprehensible ways, He, through the threat, was
providing for the Ninevites that they should not suffer the things
threatened. To think that Jonah hoped to hide himself in the sea and
elude by flight the great Eye of God, were altogether absurd and
ignorant, which should not be believed, I say not of a prophet, but of
no other sensible person who had any moderate knowledge of God and His
supreme power. Jonah knew all this better than anyone, that, planning
his flight, he changed his place, but did not flee God. For this could
no man do, either by hiding himself in the bosom of the earth or depths
of the sea or ascending (if possible) with wings into the air, or
entering the lowest hell, or encircled with thick clouds, or taking any
other counsel to secure his flight.

This, above all things and alone, can neither be escaped nor resisted,
God. When He willeth to hold and grasp in His Hand, He overtaketh the
swift, baffleth the intelligent, overthroweth the strong, boweth the
lofty, tameth rashness, subdueth might. He who threatened to others the
mighty Hand of God, was not himself ignorant of nor thought to flee,
God. Let us not believe this. But since he saw the fall of Israel and
perceived that the prophetic grace would pass over to the Gentiles, he
withdrew himself from the office of preaching, and put off the command."
"The prophet knoweth, the Holy Spirit teaching him, that the repentance
of the Gentiles is the ruin of the Jews. A lover then of his country, he
does not so much envy the deliverance of Nineveh, as will that his own
country should not perish. - Seeing too that his fellow-prophets are
sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, to excite the people to
repentance, and that Balaam the soothsayer too prophesied of the
salvation of Israel, he grieveth that he alone is chosen to be sent to
the Assyrians, the enemies of Israel, and to that greatest city of the
enemies where was idolatry and ignorance of God. Yet more he feared lest
they, on occasion of his preaching, being converted to repentance,
Israel should be wholly forsaken. For he knew by the same Spirit whereby
the preaching to the Gentiles was entrusted to him, that the house of
Israel would then perish; and he feared that what was at one time to be,
should take place in his own time." "The flight of the prophet may also
be referred to that of man in general who, despising the commands of
God, departed from Him and gave himself to the world, where
subsequently, through the storms of ill and the wreck of the whole world
raging against him, he was compelled to feel the presence of God, and to
return to Him whom he had fled. Whence we understand, that those things
also which men think for their good, when against the will of God, are
turned to destruction; and help not only does not benefit those to whom
it is given, but those too who give it, are alike crushed. As we read
that Egypt was conquered by the Assyrians, because it helped Israel
against the will of God. The ship is emperiled which had received the
emperiled; a tempest arises in a calm; nothing is secure, when God is
against us."

Tarshish - , named after one of the sons of Javan, [Gen
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004.md). was an ancient merchant city of
Spain, once proverbial for its wealth ([Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010). Strabo iii. 2. 14.md), which
supplied Judaea with silver [Jer 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009.md),
Tyre with "all manner of riches," with iron also, tin, lead. [Eze
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012.md), [Eze
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#025.md). It was known to the Greeks and
Romans, as (with a harder pronunciation) Tartessus; but in our first
century, it had either ceased to be, or was known under some other name.
Ships destined for a voyage, at that time, so long, and built for
carrying merchandise, were naturally among the largest then constructed.
"Ships of Tarshish" corresponded to the "East-Indiamen" which some of us
remember. The breaking of "ships of Tarshish by the East Wind" [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md) is, on account of their size and
general safety, instanced as a special token of the interposition of
God.

And went down to Joppa - Joppa, now Jaffa (Haifa), was the one
well-known port of Israel on the Mediterranean. There the cedars were
brought from Lebanon for both the first and second temple [Ch2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016.md); [Ezr
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#007). Simon the Maccabee (1 Macc. 14:5.md)
"took it again for a haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the
sea." It was subsequently destroyed by the Romans, as a pirate-haven.
(Josephus, B. J. iii. 9. 3, and Strabo xvi. 2. 28.) At a later time, all
describe it as an unsafe haven. Perhaps the shore changed, since the
rings, to which Andromeda was tabled to have been fastened, and which
probably were once used to moor vessels, were high above the sea.
Perhaps, like the Channel Islands, the navigation was safe to those who
knew the coast, unsafe to others. To this port Jonah "went down" from
his native country, the mountain district of Zabulon. Perhaps it was not
at this time in the hands of Israel. At least, the sailors were pagan.
He "went down," as the man who fell among the thieves, is said to "have
gone down from Jerusalem to Jericho." [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md). He "went down" from the place
which God honored by His presence and protection.

And he paid the fare thereof - Jonah describes circumstantially, how he
took every step to his end. He went down, found a strongly built ship
going where he wished, paid his fare, embarked. He seemed now to have
done all. He had severed himself from the country where his office lay.
He had no further step to take. Winds and waves would do the rest. He
had but to be still. He went, only to be brought back again.

"Sin brings our soul into much senselessness. For as those overtaken by
heaviness of head and drunkenness, are borne on simply and at random,
and, be there pit or precipice or whatever else below them, they fall
into it unawares; so too, they who fall into sin, intoxicated by their
desire of the object, know not what they do, see nothing before them,
present or future. Tell me, Fleest thou the Lord? Wait then a little,
and thou shalt learn from the event, that thou canst not escape the
hands of His servant, the sea. For as soon as he embarked, it too roused
its waves and raised them up on high; and as a faithful servant, finding
her fellow-slave stealing some of his master's property, ceases not from
giving endless trouble to those who take him in, until she recover him,
so too the sea, finding and recognizing her fellow-servant, harasses the
sailors unceasingly, raging, roaring, not dragging them to a tribunal
but threatening to sink the vessel with all its unless they restore to
her, her fellow-servant."

"The sinner "arises," because, will he, nill he, toil he must. If he
shrinks from the way of God, because it is hard, he may not yet be idle.
There is the way of ambition, of covetousness, of pleasure, to be
trodden, which certainly are far harder. 'We wearied ourselves (Wisdom
5:7),' say the wicked, 'in the way of wickedness and destruction, yea,
we have gone through deserts where there lay no way; but the way of the
Lord we have not known.' Jonah would not arise, to go to Nineveh at
God's command; yet he must needs arise, to flee to Tarshish from before
the presence of God. What good can he have who fleeth the Good? what
light, who willingly forsaketh the Light? "He goes down to Joppa."
Wherever thou turnest, if thou depart from the will of God, thou goest
down. Whatever glory, riches, power, honors, thou gainest, thou risest
not a whit; the more thou advancest, while turned from God, the deeper
and deeper thou goest down. Yet all these things are not had, without
paying the price. At a price and with toil, he obtains what he desires;
he receives nothing gratis, but, at great price purchases to himself
storms, griefs, peril. There arises a great tempest in the sea, when
various contradictory passions arise in the heart of the sinner, which
take from him all tranquility and joy. There is a tempest in the sea,
when God sends strong and dangerous disease, whereby the frame is in
peril of being broken. There is a tempest in the sea, when, thro' rivals
or competitors for the same pleasures, or the injured, or the civil
magistrate, his guilt is discovered, he is laden with infamy and odium,
punished, withheld from his wonted pleasures. [Psa
107:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md). "They who go down to the
sea of this world, and do business in mighty waters - their soul melteth
away because of trouble; they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken
man, and all their wisdom is swallowed up."

[Jonah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 1:4</span></span>

But (And) the Lord sent out - (literally 'cast along'). Jonah had done
his all. Now God's part began. This He expresses by the word, "And."
Jonah took "his" measures, "and" now God takes "His." He had let him
have his way, as He often deals with those who rebel against Him. He
lets them have their way up to a certain point. He waits, in the
tranquility of His Almightiness, until they have completed their
preparations; and then, when man has ended, He begins, that man may see
the more that it is His doing . "He takes those who flee from Him in
their flight, the wise in their counsels, sinners in their conceits and
sins, and draws them back to Himself and compels them to return. Jonah
thought to find rest in the sea, and lo! a tempest." Probably, God
summoned back Jonah, as soon as he had completed all on his part, and
sent the tempest, soon after he left the shore.

At least, such tempests often swept along that shore, and were known by
their own special name, like the Euroclydon off Crete. Jonah too alone
had gone down below deck to sleep, and, when the storm came, the
mariners thought it possible to put back. Josephus says of that shore,
"Joppa having by nature no haven, for it ends in a rough shore, mostly
abrupt, but for a short space having projections, i. e., deep rocks and
cliffs advancing into the sea, inclining on either side toward each
other (where the traces of the chains of Andromeda yet shown accredit
the antiquity of the fable,) and the north wind beating right on the
shore, and dashing the high waves against the rocks which receive them,
makes the station there a harborless sea. As those from Joppa were
tossing here, a strong wind (called by those who sail here, the black
north wind) falls upon them at daybreak, dashing straightway some of the
ships against each other, some against the rocks, and some, forcing
their way against the waves to the open sea, (for they fear the rocky
shore ...) the breakers towering above them, sank."

The ship was like - (literally 'thought') To be broken Perhaps Jonah
means by this very vivid image to exhibit the more his own dullness. He
ascribes, as it were, to the ship a sense of its own danger, as she
heaved and rolled and creaked and quivered under the weight of the storm
which lay on her, and her masts groaned, and her yard-arms shivered. To
the awakened conscience everything seems to have been alive to God's
displeasure, except itself.

[Jonah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 1:5</span></span>

And cried, every man unto his God - They did what they could. "Not
knowing the truth, they yet know of a Providence, and, amid religious
error, know that there is an Object of reverence." In ignorance they had
received one who offended God. And now God, "whom they ignorantly
worshiped" [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md), while they
cried to the gods, who, they thought, disposed of them, heard them. They
escaped with the loss of their wares, but God saved their lives and
revealed Himself to them. God hears ignorant prayer, when ignorance is
not willful and sin.

To lighten it of them - , literally "to lighten from against them, to
lighten" what was so much "against them," what so oppressed them. "They
thought that the ship was weighed down by its wonted lading, and they
knew not that the whole weight was that of the fugitive prophet." "The
sailors cast forth their wares," but the ship was not lightened. For the
whole weight still remained, the body of the prophet, that heavy burden,
not from the nature of the body, but from the burden of sin. For nothing
is so onerous and heavy as sin and disobedience. Whence also Zechariah
[Zac 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007.md) represented it under the
image of lead. And David, describing its nature, said [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md), "my wickednesses are gone over
my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me." And Christ cried
aloud to those who lived in many sins, [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). "Come unto Me, all ye that
labor and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you."

Jonah was gone down - , probably before the beginning of the storm, not
simply before the lightening of the vessel. He could hardly have fallen
asleep "then." A pagan ship was a strange place for a prophet of God,
not as a prophet, but as a fugitive; and so, probably, ashamed of what
he had completed, he had withdrawn from sight and notice. He did not
embolden himself in his sin, but shrank into himself. The conscience
most commonly awakes, when the sin is done. It stands aghast as itself;
but Satan, if he can, cuts off its retreat. Jonah had no retreat now,
unless God had made one.

And was fast asleep - The journey to Joppa had been long and hurried; he
had "fled." Sorrow and remorse completed what fatigue began. Perhaps he
had given himself up to sleep, to dull his conscience. For it is said,
"he lay down and was fast asleep." Grief produces sleep; from where it
is said of the apostles in the night before the Lord's Passion, when
Jesus "rose up from prayer and was come to His disciples, He found them
sleeping for sorrow" [Luk 22:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#045.md) .
"Jonah slept heavily. Deep was the sleep, but it was not of pleasure but
of grief; not of heartlessness, but of heavy-heartedness. For
well-disposed servants soon feel their sins, as did he. For when the sin
has been done, then he knows its frightfulness. For such is sin. When
born, it awakens pangs in the soul which bare it, contrary to the law of
our nature. For so soon as we are born, we end the travail-pangs; but
sin, so soon as born, rends with pangs the thoughts which conceived it."
Jonah was in a deep sleep, a sleep by which he was fast held and bound;
a sleep as deep as that from which Sisera never woke. Had God allowed
the ship to sink, the memory of Jonah would have been that of the
fugitive prophet. As it is, his deep sleep stands as an image of the
lethargy of sin . "This most deep sleep of Jonah signifies a man torpid
and slumbering in error, to whom it sufficed not to flee from the face
of God, but his mind, drowned in a stupor and not knowing the
displeasure of God, lies asleep, steeped in security."

[Jonah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 1:6</span></span>

What meanest thou? - or rather, "what aileth thee?" (literally "what is
to thee?") The shipmaster speaks of it (as it was) as a sort of disease,
that he should be thus asleep in the common peril. "The shipmaster,"
charged, as he by office was, with the common weal of those on board,
would, in the common peril, have one common prayer. It was the prophet's
office to call the pagan to prayers and to calling upon God. God
reproved the Scribes and Pharisees by the mouth of the children who
"cried Hosanna" [Mat 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md); Jonah by
the shipmaster; David by Abigail; [Sa1
25:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#032.md); Naaman by his servants. Now
too he reproves worldly priests by the devotion of laymen, sceptic
intellect by the simplicity of faith.

If so be that God will think upon us - , (literally "for us") i. e., for
good; as David says, [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md). "I am
poor and needy, the Lord thinketh upon" (literally "for") "me." Their
calling upon their own gods had failed them. Perhaps the shipmaster had
seen something special about Jonah, his manner, or his prophet's garb.
He does not only call Jonah's God, "thy" God, as Darius says to Daniel
"thy God" [Dan 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#020.md), but also "the
God," acknowledging the God whom Jonah worshiped, to be "the God." It is
not any pagan prayer which he asks Jonah to offer. It is the prayer of
the creature in its need to God who can help; but knowing its own
ill-desert, and the separation between itself and God, it knows not
whether He will help it. So David says [Psa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007.md), "Remember not the sins of my
youth nor my transgressions; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me for
Thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

"The shipmaster knew from experience, that it was no common storm, that
the surges were an infliction borne down from God, and above human
skill, and that there was no good in the master's skill. For the state
of things needed another Master who ordereth the heavens, and craved the
guidance from on high. So then they too left oars, sails, cables, gave
their hands rest from rowing, and stretched them to heaven and called on
God."

[Jonah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 1:7</span></span>

Come, and let us cast lots - Jonah too had probably prayed, and his
prayers too were not heard. Probably, too, the storm had some unusual
character about it, the suddenness with which it burst upon them, its
violence, the quarter from where it came, its whirlwind force . "They
knew the nature of the sea, and, as experienced sailors, were acquainted
with the character of wind and storm, and had these waves been such as
they had known before, they would never have sought by lot for the
author of the threatened wreck, or, by a thing uncertain, sought to
escape certain peril." God, who sent the storm to arrest Jonah and to
cause him to be cast into the sea, provided that its character should
set the mariners on divining, why it came. Even when working great
miracles, God brings about, through man, all the forerunning events, all
but the last act, in which He puts forth His might. As, in His people,
he directed the lot to fall upon Achan or upon Jonathan, so here He
overruled the lots of the pagan sailors to accomplish His end. " We must
not, on this precedent, immediately trust in lots, or unite with this
testimony that from the Acts of the Apostles, when Matthias was by lot
elected to the apostolate, since the privileges of individuals cannot
form a common law." "Lots," according to the ends for which they were
cast, were for:

i\) dividing;

ii\) consulting;

iii\) divining.

i\) The lot for dividing is not wrong if not used,

1\) "without any necessity, for this would be to tempt God:"

2\) "if in case of necessity, not without reverence of God, as if Holy
Scripture were used for an earthly end," as in determining any secular
matter by opening the Bible:

3\) for objects which ought to be decided otherwise, (as, an office
ought to be given to the fittest:)

4\) in dependence upon any other than God [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md). "The lot is cast into the lap,
but the whole disposing of it is the Lord's." So then they are lawful
"in secular things which cannot otherwise be conveniently distributed,"
or when there is no apparent reason why, in any advantage or
disadvantage, one should be preferred to another." Augustine even allows
that, in a time of plague or persecution, the lot might be cast to
decide who should remain to administer the sacraments to the people,
lest, on the one side, all should be taken away, or, on the other, the
Church be deserted.

ii.) The lot for consulting, i. e., to decide what one should do, is
wrong, unless in a matter of mere indifference, or under inspiration of
God, or in some extreme necessity where all human means fail.

iii.) The lot for divining, i. e., to learn truth, whether of things
present or future, of which we can have no human knowledge, is wrong,
except by direct inspiration of God. For it is either to tempt God who
has not promised so to reveal things, or, against God, to seek
superhuman knowledge by ways unsanctioned by Him. Satan may readily mix
himself unknown in such inquiries, as in mesmerism. Forbidden ground is
his own province.

God overruled the lot in the case of Jonah, as He did the sign which the
Philistines sought . "He made the heifers take the way to Bethshemesh,
that the Philistines might know that the plague came to them, not by
chance, but from Hilmself" . "The fugitive (Jonah) was taken by lot, not
by any virtue of the lots, especially the lots of pagan, but by the will
of Him who guided the uncertain lots" "The lot betrayed the culprit. Yet
not even thus did they cast him over; but, even while such a tumult and
storm lay on them, they held, as it were, a court in the vessel, as
though in entire peace, and allowed him a hearing and defense, and
sifted everything accurately, as men who were to give account of their
judgment. Hear them sifting all as in a court - The roaring sea accused
him; the lot convicted and witnessed against him, yet not even thus did
they pronounce against him - until the accused should be the accuser of
his own sin. The sailors, uneducated, untaught, imitated the good order
of courts. When the sea scarcely allowed them to breathe, whence such
forethought about the prophet? By the disposal of God. For God by all
this instructed the prophet to be humane and mild, all but saying aloud
to him; 'Imitate these uninstructed sailors. They think not lightly of
one soul, nor are unsparing as to one body, thine own. But thou, for thy
part, gavest up a whole city with so many myriads. They, discovering
thee to be the cause of the evils which befell them, did not even thus
hurry to condemn thee. Thou, having nothing whereof to accuse the
Ninevites, didst sink and destroy them. Thou, when I bade thee go and by
thy preaching call them to repentance, obeyedst not; these, untaught, do
all, compass all, in order to recover thee, already condemned, from
punishment.'"

[Jonah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 1:8</span></span>

Tell us, for whose cause - Literally "for what to whom." It may be that
they thought that Jonah had been guilty toward some other. The lot had
pointed him out. The mariners, still fearing to do wrong, ask him
thronged questions, to know why the anger of God followed him; "what"
hast thou done "to whom?" "what thine occupation?" i. e., either his
ordinary occupation, whether it was displeasing to God? or this
particular business in which he was engaged, and for which he had come
on board. Questions so thronged have been admired in human poetry,
Jerome says. For it is true to nature. They think that some one of them
will draw forth the answer which they wish. It may be that they thought
that his country, or people, or parents, were under the displeasure of
God. But perhaps, more naturally, they wished to "know all about him,"
as people say. These questions must have gone home to Jonah's
conscience. "What is thy business?" The office of prophet which he had
left. "Whence comest thou?" From standing before God, as His minister.
"What thy country? of what people art thou?" The people of God, whom he
had quitted for pagan; not to win them to God, as He commanded; but, not
knowing what they did, to abet him in his flight.

What is thine occupation? - They should ask themselves, who have Jonah's
office to speak in the name of God, and preach repentance . "What should
be thy business, who hast consecrated thyself wholly to God, whom God
has loaded with daily benefits? who approachest to Him as to a Friend?
"What is thy business?" To live for God, to despise the things of earth,
to behold the things of heaven," to lead others heavenward.

Jonah answers simply the central point to which all these questions
tended:

[Jonah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 1:9</span></span>

I am an Hebrew - This was the name by which Israel was known to
foreigners. It is used in the Old Testament, only when they are spoken
of by foreigners, or speak of themselves to foreigners, or when the
sacred writers mention them in contrast with foreigners . So Joseph
spoke of his land [Gen 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#015.md), and the
Hebrew midwives [Exo 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#019.md), and Moses'
sister [Exo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#007.md), and God in His
commission to Moses [Exo 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018.md); [Exo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#016.md); [Exo
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001.md) as to Pharaoh, and Moses in
fulfilling it [Exo 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#003.md). They had the
name, as having passed the River Euphrates, "emigrants." The title might
serve to remind themselves, that they were "strangers" and "pilgrims,"
[Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md). whose fathers had left
their home at God's command and for God , "passers by, through this
world to death, and through death to immortality."

And I fear the Lord - , i. e., I am a worshiper of Him, most commonly,
one who habitually stands in awe of Him, and so one who stands in awe of
sin too. For none really fear God, none fear Him as sons, who do not
fear Him in act. To be afraid of God is not to fear Him. To be afraid of
God keeps men away from God; to fear God draws them to Him. Here,
however, Jonah probably meant to tell them, that the Object of his fear
and worship was the One Self-existing God, He who alone is, who made all
things, in whose hands are all things. He had told them before, that he
had fled "from being before Yahweh." They had not thought anything of
this, for they thought of Yahweh, only as the God of the Jews. Now he
adds, that He, Whose service he had thus forsaken, was "the God of
heaven, Who made the sea and dry land," that sea, whose raging terrified
them and threatened their lives. The title, "the God of heaven," asserts
the doctrine of the creation of the heavens by God, and His supremacy.

Hence, Abraham uses it to his servant [Gen
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#007.md), and Jonah to the pagan mariners,
and Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar [Dan
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037.md), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); and Cyrus in acknowledging God
in his proclamation [Ch2 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023.md); [Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md). After his example, it is used in
the decrees of Darius [Ezr 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#009.md) and
Artaxerxes [Ezr 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012.md), [Ezr
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021.md), [Ezr
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023.md), and the returned exiles use it
in giving account of their building the temple to the Governor [Ezr
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011.md). Perhaps, from the habit of
contact with the pagan, it is used once by Daniel [Dan
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#018.md) and by Nehemiah [Neh
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md); [Neh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004.md), [Neh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020.md). Melchizedek, not perhaps being
acquainted with the special name, Yahweh, blessed Abraham in the name of
"God, the Possessor" or "Creator of heaven and earth" [Gen
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019.md), i. e., of all that is. Jonah,
by using it, at once taught the sailors that there is One Lord of all,
and why this evil had fallen on them, because they had himself with
them, the renegade servant of God. "When Jonah said this, he indeed
feared God and repented of his sin. If he lost filial fear by fleeing
and disobeying, he recovered it by repentance."

[Jonah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 1:10</span></span>

Then were the men exceedingly afraid - Before, they had feared the
tempest and the loss of their lives. Now they feared God. They feared,
not the creature but the Creator. They knew that what they had feared
was the doing of His Almightiness. They felt how awesome a thing it was
to be in His Hands. Such fear is the beginning of conversion, when
people turn from dwelling on the distresses which surround them, to God
who sent them.

Why hast thou done this? - They are words of amazement and wonder. Why
hast thou not obeyed so great a God, and how thoughtest thou to escape
the hand of the Creator ? "What is the mystery of thy flight? Why did
one, who feared God and had revelations from God, flee, sooner than go
to fulfill them? Why did the worshiper of the One true God depart from
his God?" "A servant flee from his Lord, a son from his father, man from
his God!" The inconsistency of believers is the marvel of the young
Christian, the repulsion of those without, the hardening of the
unbeliever. If people really believed in eternity, how could they be
thus immersed in things of time? If they believed in hell, how could
they so hurry there? If they believed that God died for them, how could
they so requite Him? Faith without love, knowledge without obedience,
conscious dependence and rebellion, to be favored by God yet to despise
His favor, are the strangest marvels of this mysterious world.

All nature seems to cry out to and against the unfaithful Christian,
"why hast thou done this?" And what a why it is! A scoffer has recently
said so truthfully : "Avowed scepticism cannot do a tenth part of the
injury to practical faith, that the constant spectacle of the huge mass
of worldly unreal belief does." It is nothing strange, that the world or
unsanctified intellect should reject the Gospel. It is a thing of
course, unless it be converted. But, to know, to believe, and to
DISOBEY! To disobey God, in the name of God. To propose to halve the
living Gospel, as the woman who had killed her child [Kg1
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#026.md), and to think that the poor
quivering remnants would be the living Gospel anymore! As though the
will of God might, like those lower forms of His animal creation, be
divided endlessly, and, keep what fragments we will, it would still be a
living whole, a vessel of His Spirit! Such unrealities and
inconsistencies would be a sore trial of faith, had not Jesus, who (cf.
[Joh 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025).md), "knew what is in man,"
forewarned us that it should be so. The scandals against the Gospel, so
contrary to all human opinion, are only all the more a testimony to the
divine knowledge of the Redeemer.

[Jonah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 1:11</span></span>

What shall we do unto thee? - They knew him to be a prophet; they ask
him the mind of his God. The lots had marked out Jonah as the cause of
the storm; Jonah had himself admitted it, and that the storm was for
"his" cause, and came from "his" God . "Great was he who fled, greater
He who required him. They dare not give him up; they cannot conceal him.
They blame the fault; they confess their fear; they ask "him" the
remedy, who was the author of the sin. If it was faulty to receive thee,
what can we do, that God should not be angered? It is thine to direct;
ours, to obey."

The sea wrought and was tempestuous - , literally "was going and
whirling." It was not only increasingly tempestuous, but, like a thing
alive and obeying its Master's will, it was holding on its course, its
wild waves tossing themselves, and marching on like battalions,
marshalled, arrayed for the end for which they were sent, pursuing and
demanding the runaway slave of God . "It was going, as it was bidden; it
was going to avenge its Lord; it was going, pursuing the fugitive
prophet. It was swelling every moment, and, as though the sailors were
too tardy, was rising in yet greater surges, shewing that the vengeance
of the Creator admitted not of delay."

[Jonah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jon 1:12</span></span>

Take me up, and cast me into the sea - Neither might Jonah have said
this, nor might the sailors have obeyed it, without the command of God.
Jonah might will alone to perish, who had alone offended; but, without
the command of God, the Giver of life, neither Jonah nor the sailors
might dispose of the life of Jonah. But God willed that Jonah should be
cast into the sea - where he had gone for refuge - that (Wisdom 11:16)
wherewithal he had "sinned, by the same also he might be punished" as a
man; and, as a prophet, that he might, in his three days' burial,
prefigure Him who, after His Resurrection, should convert, not Nineveh,
but the world, the cry of whose wickedness went up to God.

For I know that for my sake - o "In that he says, "I know," he marks
that he had a revelation; in that he says, "this great storm," he marks
the need which lay on those who cast him into the sea."

[Jonah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jon 1:13</span></span>

The men rowed hard - , literally "dug." The word, like our "plowed the
main," describes the great efforts which they made. Amid the violence of
the storm, they had furled their sails. These were worse than useless.
The wind was off shore, since by rowing alpine they hoped to get back to
it. They put their oars well and firmly in the sea, and turned up the
water, as men turn up earth by digging. But in vain! God willed it not.
The sea went on its way, as before. In the description of the deluge, it
is repeated [Gen 7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017.md), "the waters
increased and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth; the
waters increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face
of the waters." The waters raged and swelled, drowned the whole world,
yet only bore up the ark, as a steed bears its rider: man was still, the
waters obeyed. In this tempest, on the contrary, man strove, but,
instead of the peace of the ark, the burden is, the violence of the
tempest; "the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them" . "The
prophet had pronounced sentence against himself, but they would not lay
hands upon him, striving hard to get back to land, and escape the risk
of bloodshed, willing to lose life rather than cause its loss. O what a
change was there. The people who had served God, said, Crucify Him,
Crucify Him! These are bidden to put to death; the sea rageth; the
tempest commandeth; and they are careless its to their own safety, while
anxious about another's."

[Jonah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jon 1:14</span></span>

Wherefore (And) they cried unto the Lord - "They cried" no more "each
man to his god," but to the one God, whom Jonah had made known to them;
and to Him they cried with an earnest submissive, cry, repeating the
words of beseeching, as men, do in great earnestness; "we beseech Thee,
O Lord, let us not, we beseech Thee, perish for the life of this man"
(i. e., as a penalty for taking it, as it is said, [Sa2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#007.md). "we will slay him for the life
of his brother," and, [Deu 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021.md).
"life for life.") They seem to have known what is said, [Gen
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005.md). "your blood of your lives will
I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it and at the hand
of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for in
the image of God made He man" , "Do not these words of the sailors seem
to us to be the confession of Pilate, who washed his hands, and said, 'I
am clean from the blood of this Man?' The Gentiles would not that Christ
should perish; they protest that His Blood is innocent."

And lay not upon us innocent blood - innocent as to them, although, as
to this thing, guilty before God, and yet, as to God also, more
innocent, they would think, than they. For, strange as this was, one
disobedience, their whole life, they now knew, was disobedience to God;
His life was but one act in a life of obedience. If God so punishes one
sin of the holy [Pe1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md), "where
shall the ungodly and sinner appear?" Terrible to the awakened
conscience are God's chastenings on some (as it seems) single offence of
those whom He loves.

For Thou, Lord, (Who knowest the hearts of all men,) hast done, as it
pleased Thee - Wonderful, concise, confession of faith in these new
converts! Psalmists said it, [Psa
135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006.md); [Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md). "Whatsoever God willeth, that
doeth He in heaven and in earth, in the sea and in all deep places." But
these had but just known God, and they resolve the whole mystery of
man's agency and God's Providence into the three simple words , as
(Thou) "willedst" (Thou) "didst." "That we took him aboard, that the
storm ariseth, that the winds rage, that the billows lift themselves,
that the fugitive is betrayed by the lot, that he points out what is to
be done, it is of Thy will, O Lord" . "The tempest itself speaketh, that
'Thou, Lord, hast done as Thou willedst.' Thy will is fulfilled by our
hands." "Observe the counsel of God, that, of his own will, not by
violence or by necessity, should he be cast into the sea. For the
casting of Jonah into the sea signified the entrance of Christ into the
bitterness of the Passion, which He took upon Himself of His own will,
not of necessity. [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md). "He was
offered up, and He willingly submitted Himself." And as those who sailed
with Jonah were delivered, so the faithful in the Passion of Christ.
[Joh 18:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008.md). "If ye seek Me, let these
go their way, that the saying might be fulfilled which" Jesus spake, 'Of
them which Thou gavest Me, I have lost none. '"

[Jonah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jon 1:15</span></span>

They took up Jonah - o "He does not say, 'laid hold on him', nor 'came
upon him' but 'lifted' him; as it were, bearing him with respect and
honor, they cast him into the sea, not resisting, but yielding himself
to their will."

The sea ceased (literally "stood") from his raging - Ordinarily, the
waves still swell, when the wind has ceased. The sea, when it had
received Jonah, was hushed at once, to show that God alone raised and
quelled it. It "stood" still, like a servant, when it had accomplished
its mission. God, who at all times saith to it [Job
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md), "Hitherto shalt thou come and
no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed," now unseen, as
afterward in the flesh [Mat 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md),
"rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm" . "If we
consider the errors of the world before the Passion of Christ, and the
conflicting blasts of diverse doctrines, and the vessel, and the whole
race of man, i. e., the creature of the Lord, imperiled, and, after His
Passion, the tranquility of faith and the peace of the world and the
security of all things and the conversion to God, we shall see how,
after Jonah was cast in, the sea stood from its raging" . "Jonah, in the
sea, a fugitive, shipwrecked, dead, sayeth the tempest-tossed vessel; he
sayeth the pagan, aforetime tossed to and fro by the error of the world
into divers opinions. And Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, Joel, who prophesied at
the same time, could not amend the people in Judaea; whence it appeared
that the breakers could not be calmed, save by the death of (Him
typified by) the fugitive."

And the men feared the Lord with a great fear - because, from the
tranquility of the sea and the ceasing of the tempest, they saw that the
prophet's words were true. This great miracle completed the conversion
of the mariners. God had removed all human cause of fear; and yet, in
the same words as before, he says, "they feared a great fear;" but he
adds, "the Lord." It was the great fear, with which even the disciples
of Jesus feared, when they saw the miracles which He did, which made
even Peter say, [Luk 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md). "Depart from
me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." Events full of wonder had thronged
upon them; things beyond nature, and contrary to nature; tidings which
betokened His presence, Who had all things in His hands. They had seen
"wind and storm fulfilling His word" [Psa
148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008.md), and, forerunners of the
fishermen of Galilee, knowing full well from their own experience that
this was above nature, they felt a great awe of God. So He commanded His
people, "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md), for thy good always" [Deu
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#024.md).

And offered a sacrifice - Doubtless, as it was a large decked vessel and
bound on a long voyage, they had live creatures on board, which they
could offer in sacrifice. But this was not enough for their
thankfulness; "they vowed vows." They promised that they would do
thereafter what they could not do then ; "that they would never depart
from Him whom they had begun to worship." This was true love, not to be
content with aught which they could do, but to stretch forward in
thought to an abiding and enlarged obedience, as God should enable them.
And so they were doubtless enrolled among the people of God, firstfruits
from among the pagan, won to God Who overrules all things, through the
disobedience and repentance of His prophet. Perhaps, they were the first
preachers among the pagan, and their account of their own wonderful
deliverance prepared the way for Jonah's mission to Nineveh.

[Jonah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md)

Now the Lord had (literally "And the Lord") prepared - Jonah (as appears
from his thanksgiving) was not swallowed at once, but sank to the bottom
of the sea, God preserving him in life there by miracle, as he did in
the fish's belly. Then, when the seaweed was twined around his head, and
he seemed to be already buried until the sea should give up her dead,
"God prepared the fish to swallow Jonah" . "God could as easily have
kept Jonah alive in the sea as in the fish's belly, but, in order to
prefigure the burial of the Lord, He willed him to be within the fish
whose belly was as a grave." Jonah, does not say what fish it was; and
our Lord too used a name, signifying only one of the very largest fish.
Yet it was no greater miracle to create a fish which should swallow
Jonah, than to preserve him alive when swallowed . "The infant is
buried, as it were, in the womb of its mother; it cannot breathe, and
yet, thus too, it liveth and is preserved, wonderfully nurtured by the
will of God." He who preserves the embryo in its living grave can
maintain the life of man as easily without the outward air as with it.

The same Divine Will preserves in being the whole creation, or creates
it. The same will of God keeps us in life by breathing this outward air,
which preserved Jonah without it. How long will men think of God, as if
He were man, of the Creator as if He were a creature, as though creation
were but one intricate piece of machinery, which is to go on, ringing
its regular changes until it shall be worn out, and God were shut up, as
a sort of mainspring within it, who might be allowed to be a primal
Force, to set it in motion, but must not be allowed to vary what He has
once made? "We must admit of the agency of God," say these men when they
would not in name be atheists, "once in the beginning of things, but
must allow of His interference as sparingly as may be." Most wise
arrangement of the creature, if it were indeed the god of its God! Most
considerate provision for the non-interference of its Maker, if it could
but secure that He would not interfere with it for ever! Acute physical
philosophy, which, by its omnipotent word, would undo the acts of God!
Heartless, senseless, sightless world, which exists in God, is upheld by
God, whose every breath is an effluence of God's love, and which yet
sees Him not, thanks Him not, thinks it a greater thing to hold its own
frail existence from some imagined law, than to be the object of the
tender personal care of the Infinite God who is Love! Poor hoodwinked
souls, which would extinguish for themselves the Light of the world, in
order that it may not eclipse the rushlight of their own theory!

And Jonah was in the belly of the fish - The time that Jonah was in the
fish's belly was a hidden prophecy. Jonah does not explain nor point it.
He tells the fact, as Scripture is accustomed to do so. Then he singles
out one, the turning point in it. Doubtless in those three days and
nights of darkness, Jonah (like him who after his conversion became
Paul), meditated much, repented much, sorrowed much, for the love of
God, that he had ever offended God, purposed future obedience, adored
God with wondering awe for His judgment and mercy. It was a narrow home,
in which Jonah, by miracle, was not consumed; by miracle, breathed; by
miracle, retained his senses in that fetid place. Jonah doubtless,
repented, marveled, adored, loved God. But, of all, God has singled out
this one point, how, out of such a place, Jonah thanked God. As He
delivered Paul and Silas from the prison, when they prayed with a loud
voice to Him, so when Jonah, by inspiration of His Spirit, thanked Him,
He delivered him.

To thank God, only in order to obtain fresh gifts from Him, would be but
a refined, hypocritical form of selfishness. Such a formal act would not
be thanks at all. We thank God, because we love Him, because He is so
infinitely good, and so good to us, unworthy. Thanklessness shuts the
door to His personal mercies to us, because it makes them the occasion
of fresh sins of our's. Thankfulness sets God's essential goodness free
(so to speak) to be good to us. He can do what He delights in doing, be
good to us, without our making His Goodness a source of harm to us.
Thanking Him through His grace, we become fit vessels for larger graces
. "Blessed he who, at every gift of grace, returns to Him in whom is all
fullness of graces; to whom when we show ourselves not ungrateful for
gifts received, we make room in ourselves for grace, and become meet for
receiving yet more." But Jonah's was that special character of
thankfulness, which thanks God in the midst of calamities from which
there was no human exit; and God set His seal on this sort of
thankfulness, by annexing this deliverance, which has consecrated Jonah
as an image of our Lord, to his wonderful act of thanksgiving.
