### [Hosea Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 13:1</span></span>

When Ephraim spake trembling - that is, probably "there was
'trembling.'" : "Ephraim was once very awful, so as, while he spake, the
rest of the tribes were ready to tremble." The prophet contrasts two
conditions of Ephraim, of prosperity, and destruction. His prosperity he
owed to the undeserved mercy of God, who blessed him for Joseph's sake;
his destruction, to his own sin. There is no period recorded, "when
Ephraim spake trembling," i. e., in humility. Pride was his
characteristic, almost as soon as he had a separate existence as a tribe
(see the note at [Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005).md). Under
Joshua, it could not be called out, for Ephraim gained honor, when
Joshua, one of themselves, became the captain of the Lord's people.
Under the Judges, their pride appeared. Yet God tried them, by giving
them their hearts' desire. They longed to be exalted, and He satisfied
them, if so be they would thus serve Him. They had the chief power, and
were a "terror" to Judah. "He exalted himself," (or perhaps "he was
exalted,) in Israel; but when he offended in Baal he died;" literally,
"and he offended in Baal and died."

He abused the goodness of God; his sin followed as a consequence of
God's goodness to him. God raised him, and he offended. The alliance
with a king of Tyre and Sidon, which brought in the worship of Baal, was
a part of the worldly policy of the kings of Israel ([Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031), see Introduction.md). "As if it
had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, he took to wife the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the
Zidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him." The twenty-two
years of Ahab's reign established the worship. The prophets of Baal
became 450; the prophets of the kindred idolatry of Ashtoreth, or
Astarte, became 400; Baal had his one central temple, large and
magnificent [Kg2 10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#021.md), [Kg2
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md), a rival of that of God. The
prophet Elijah thought the apostasy almost universal; God revealed to
him that He had "reserved" to Himself "seven thousand in Israel." Yet
these were "all the knees which had not bowed to Baal, and every mouth
which had not kissed him" [Kg1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md).

And died - Death is the penalty of sin. Ephraim "died" spiritually. For
sin takes away the life of grace, and separates from God, the true life
of the soul, the source of all life. He "died more truly, than he who is
dead and at rest." Of this death, our Lord says, "Let the dead bury
their dead" [Mat 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022.md); and Paul, "She
who liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [Ti1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md). He "died" also as a nation and
kingdom, being sentenced by God to cease to be.

[Hosea 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 13:2</span></span>

And now they sin more and more - Sin draws on sin. This seems to be a
third stage in sin. First, under Jeroboam, was the worship of the
calves. Then, under Ahab, the worship of Baal. Thirdly, the multiplying
of other idols (see [Kg2 17:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009).md),
penetrating and pervading the private life, even of their less wealthy
people. The calves were of gold; now they "made them molten images of
their silver," perhaps plated with silver. In Egypt, the mother of
idolatry, it was common to gild idols, made of wood, stone, and bronze.
The idolatry, then, had become more habitual, daily, universal. These
idols were made of "their silver;" they themselves had had them "molten"
out of it. Avaricious as they were (see the note above [Kg2
12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#007).md), they lavished "their silver,"
to make them their gods. "According to their own understanding," they
had had them formed. They employed ingenuity and invention to multiply
their idols. They despised the wisdom and commands of God who forbad it.
The rules for making and coloring the idols were as minute as those,
which God gave for His own worship. Idolatry had its own vast system,
making the visible world its god and picturing its operations, over
against the worship of God its Creator. But it was all, "their own
understanding:" The conception of the idol lay in its maker's mind. It
was his own creation. He devised, what his idol should represent; how it
should represent what his mind imagined; he debated with himself,
rejected, chose, changed his choice, modified what he had fixed upon;
all "according to his own understanding." Their own understanding
devised it; the labor of the craftsmen completed it.

All of it the work of the craftsmen - What man could do for it, he did.
But man could not breathe into his idols the breath of life; there was
then no spirit, nor life, nor any effluence from any higher nature, nor
any deity residing in them. From first to last it was "all" man's
"work;" and man's own wisdom was its condemnation. The thing made must
be inferior to its maker. made man, inferior to Himself, but lord of the
earth, and all things therein; man made his idol of the things of earth,
which God gave him. It too then was inferior to "its" maker, man. He
then worshiped in it, the conception of his own mind, the work of his
own hands.

They say of them - Strictly, Of them, (i. e., of these things, such
things, as these,) "they, say, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the
calves." The prophet gives the substance or the words of Jeroboam's
edict, when he said, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem,
behold thy gods, O Israel." "Whoever would sacrifice, let him do homage
to the calves." He would have calf-worship to be the only worship of
God. Error, if it is strong enough, ever persecutes the truth, unless it
can corrupt it. Idol-worship was striving to extirpate the worship of
God, which condemned it. Under Ahab and Jezebel, it seemed to have
succeeded. Elijah complains to God in His own immediate presence; "the
children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars,
and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I, only am left, and
they seek my life, to take it away [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md), [Kg1
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014.md). Kissing was an act of homage in
the East, done upon the hand or the foot, the knees or shoulder. It was
a token of divine honor, whether to an idol ([Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018) and here,.md) or to God [Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). It was performed, either by
actually kissing the image, or when the object could not be approached,
(as the moon) kissing the hand [Job
31:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md), and so sending, as it were,
the kiss to it. In the Psalm, it stands as a symbol of worship, to be
shown toward "the" Incarnate "Son," when God should make Him "King upon
His holy hill of Sion."

[Hosea 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 13:3</span></span>

Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud - There is often a fair
show of prosperity, out of God; but it is short-lived. "The third
generation," says the pagan proverb, "never enjoys the ill-gotten gain."
The highest prosperity of an ungodly state is often the next to its
fall. Israel never so flourished, as under Jeroboam II. Bright and
glistening with light is "the early dew;" in an hour it is gone, as if
it had never been. Glowing and gilded by the sun is "the morning cloud;"
while you admire its beauty, its hues have vanished. "The chaff" lay in
one heap "on the floor" with the wheat. Its owner casts the mingled
chaff and wheat against the strong wind; in a moment, it is "driven by
the wind out of the floor." While every gram falls to the ground, the
chaff, light, dry, worthless, unsubstantial, is hurried along,
unresisting, the sport of the viewless wind, and itself is soon seen no
more. The "smoke," one, seemingly solid, full, lofty, column, ascendeth,
swelleth, welleth, vanisheth . In form, it is as solid, when about to be
dispersed and seen no more, as when it first issued "out of the
chimney." : "It is raised aloft, and by that very uplifting swells into
a vast globe; but the larger that globe is, the emptier, for from that
unsolid, unbased, inflated greatness it vanisheth in air, so that its
very greatness injures it. For the more it is uplifted, extended,
diffused on all sides into a larger compass, so much the poorer it
becometh, and faileth, and disappeareth." Such was the prosperity of
Ephraim, a mere show, to vanish forever. In the image of "the chaff,"
the prophet substitutes the "whirlwind" for the wind by which the
Easterns used to winnow, in order to picture the violence with which
they should be whirled away from their own land.

While these four emblems, in common, picture what is fleeting, two, the
"early dew" and the "morning cloud," are emblems of what is in itself
good, but passing ; the two others, the chaff and the smoke, are emblems
of what is worthless. The dew and the cloud were temporary mercies on
the part of God which should cease from them, "good in themselves, but
to their evil, soon to pass away." If the dew have not, in its brief
space, refreshed the vegetation, no trace of it is left. It gives way to
the burning sun. If grace have not done its work in the soul, its day is
gone. Such dew were the many prophets vouchsafed to Israel; such was
Hosea himself, most brilliant, but soon to pass away. The chaff was the
people itself, to be carried out of the Lord's land; the smoke, "its
pride and its errors, whose disappearance was to leave the air pure for
the household of God." : "So it is written; 'As the smoke is driven
away, so shalt thou drive' them 'away; as wax melteth before the fire,
so shall the ungodly perish before the presence of God' [Psa
68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md); and in Proverbs; 'As the
whirlwind passeth' [Pro 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025.md), so is
'the wicked no' more; 'but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.'
Who although they live and flourish, as to the life of the body; yet
spiritually they die, yea, and are brought to nothing, for by sin man
became a nothing. Virtue makes man upright and stable; vice, empty and
unstable. Whence Isaiah says, 'the wicked are like the troubled sea,
which cannot rest' [Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md); and
Job; 'If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away; then shalt thou be
steadfast.' [Job 11:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014.md)."

[Hosea 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 13:4</span></span>

Yet - , (literally, and) I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt
God was still the same God who had sheltered them with His providence,
ever since He had delivered them from Egypt. He had the same power and
will to help them. Therefore their duty was the same, and their
destruction arose, not from any change in Him, but from themselves. "God
is the God of the ungodly, by creation and general providence."

And thou shalt - (i. e., oughtest to) know no God but Me, for
(literally, and) there is not a Saviour but me "To be God and Lord and
Saviour are incommunicable properties of God. Wherefore God often
claimed these titles to Himself, from the time He revealed Himself to
Israel. In the song of Moses, which they were commanded to rehearse, He
says, "See now that I, I am He, and there is no God with Me: I kill, and
I make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver
out of My hand" [Deu 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md). Isaiah
repeats this same, "Is there a God besides Me? yea there is no God; I
know not any" [Isa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008.md); and "There is
no God else besides Me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none else.
Look unto Me and be ye saved, for I am God and there is none else" [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md), [Isa
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002.md); and, "I am the Lord, that is My
Name; and My glory will I not give to another; neither My praise to
graven images" [Isa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md). : "That God
and Saviour is Christ; God, because He created; Saviour, because, being
made Man, He saved. Whence He willed to be called Jesus, i. e., Saviour.
Truly "beside" Him, "there is no Saviour; neither is there salvation in
any other, for there is none other name under heaven, given among men,
whereby we must be saved" [Act 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md).
"It is not enough to recognize in God this quality of a Saviour. It must
not be shared with "any other." Whoso associates with God any power
whatever to decide on man's salvation makes an idol, and introduces a
new God."

[Hosea 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 13:5</span></span>

I did know thee in the wilderness - "God so knew them, as to deserve to
be known by them. By "knowing" them, He shewed how He ought to be
acknowledged by them." "As we love God, because He first loved us," so
we come to know and own God, having first been owned and known of Him.
God showed His knowledge of them, by knowing and providing for their
needs; He knew them "in the wilderness, in the land of great drought,"
where the land yielded neither food nor water. He supplied them with the
"bread from heaven" and with "water from the flinty rock." He knew and
owned them all by His providence; He knew in approbation and love, and
fed in body and soul those who, having been known by Him, knew and owned
Him. : "No slight thing is it, that He, who knoweth all things and men,
should, by grace, know us with that knowledge according to which He says
to that one true Israelite, Moses, "thou hast found grace in My sight,
and I know thee by name" [Exo 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017.md).
This we read to have been said to that one; but what He says to one, He
says to all, whom now, before or since that time, He has chosen, being
foreknown and predestinate, for He wrote the names of all in the book of
life. All these elect are "known in the wilderness," in the land of
loneliness, in the wilderness of this world, where no one ever saw God,
in the solitude of the heart and the secret of hidden knowledge, where
God alone, beholding the soul tried by temptations, exercises and proves
it, and accounting it, when "running lawfully," worthy of His knowledge,
professes that He "knew it." To those so known, or named, He Himself
saith in the Gospel, "rejoice, because your names are written in heaven"
[Luk 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md).

[Hosea 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 13:6</span></span>

According to their pasture, so were they filled - o: "He implies that
their way of being 'filled' was neither good nor praiseworthy, in that
he says, 'they were filled according to their pastures.' What or of what
kind were these "their pastures?" What they longed for, what they
murmured for, and spoke evil of God. For instance, when they said, 'who
wil give us flesh to eat? We remember the flesh which we did eat in
Egypt freely. Our soul is dried up, because our eyes see nothing but
this manna' [Num 11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md). Since they
desired such things in such wise, and, desiring, were filled with them
to loathing, well are they called 'their pastures.' For they sought God,
not for Himself, but for them. They who follow God for Himself, things
of this sort are not called 'their' pastures, but the word of God is
their pasture, according to that, 'Man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word, which proceedeth out of the mouth of God' [Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md).

These words, 'according to their pastures,' convey strong blame. It is
as if he said, 'in their eating and drinking, they received their whole
reward for leaving the land of Egypt and receiving for a time the law of
God.' It is sin, to follow God for such 'pastures.' Blaming such in the
Gospel, Jesus saith, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye seek Me, not
because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and
were filled. Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which
endureth unto everlasting life' [Joh
6:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md). In like way, let all think
themselves blamed, who attend the altar of Christ, not for the love of
the sacraments which they celebrate, but only to 'live of the altar.'
This fullness is like that of which the Psalmist says, 'The Lord gave
them their desire and sent leanness withal into their bones' [Psa
106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md). For such fullness of the belly
generates elation of spirit; such satiety produces forgetfulness of
God." It is more difficult to bear prosperity than adversity. They who,
in the waste howling wilderness, had been retained in a certain degree
of duty, forgat God altogether in the good land which he had given them.
Whence it follows;

They were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
forgotten Me - For they owned not that they had all from Him, therefore
they were puffed up with pride, and forgot Him in and by reason of His
gifts. This was the aggravation of their sin, with which Hosea often
reproaches them [Hos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md); [Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md). They abused God's gifts, (as
Christians do now) against Himself, and did the more evil, the more good
God was to them. God had forewarned them of this peril, "When thou shalt
have eaten and be full, beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought
thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage" ([Deu
6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011.md); add [Deu
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#011), ....md). He pictured it to them
with the song of Moses; "Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked; thou art waxen
fat; thou art grown thick; thou art covered with fatness; then he
forsook God which made him; thou hast forgotten God that formed thee"
[Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md).

They acted (as in one way or other do most Christians now,) as though
God had commanded what he foretold of their evil deeds, or what he
warned them against. "As their fathers did, so did they" [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md). "They walked in the statutes of
the pagan, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel,
and of the kings of Israel which they made. They did wicked things to
provoke the Lord to anger. And the Lord testified against Israel and
against Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers, saying, turn ye
from your evil ways. And they hearkened not, and hardened their necks,
like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord
their God" [Kg2 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#008.md), [Kg2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011.md), [Kg2
17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md). : "The words are true also
of those rich and ungrateful, whom God hath filled with spiritual or
temporal goods. But they, 'being in honor, and having no understanding,'
abuse the gifts of God, and, becoming unworthy of the benefits which
they have received, have their hearts uplifted and swollen with pride,
despising others, 'glorying as though they had not received,' and not
obeying the commands of God. Of such the Lord saith in Isaiah, 'I have
nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against Me. '"

[Hosea 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 13:7</span></span>

I will be unto them as a lion - They had waxen fat, were full; yet it
was, to become themselves a prey. Their wealth which they were proud of,
which they abused, allured their enemies. To cut off all hopes of God's
mercy, He says that he will be to them, as those creatures of His, which
never spare. The fierceness of the lion, and the swiftness of the
leopard, together portray a speedy inexorable chastisement. But what a
contrast I He who bare Israel in the wilderness like a Father, who bare
them on eagle's wings, who drew them with the cords of a man, with bands
of love, He, the God of mercy and of love, their Father, Protector,
Defender, Avenger, He it is who will be their destroyer.

[Hosea 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 13:8</span></span>

As a bear bereaved of her whelps - The Syrian bear is fiercer than the
brown bears to which we are accustomed. It attacks flocks [Sa1
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md), and even oxen . The fierceness
of the she-bear, "bereaved of her whelps," became a proverb ([Sa2
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008.md); [Pro
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012); and here.md). : "They who have
written on the nature of wild beasts, say that none is more savage than
the she-bear, when she has lost her whelps or lacks food." It blends
wonderfully most touching love and fierceness. It tenderly protects its
wounded whelps, reckless of its life, so that it may bring them off, and
it turns fiercely on their destroyer. Its love for them becomes fury
against their injurer. Much more shall God avenge those who destroy His
sons and daughters, leading and enticing them into sin and destruction
of body and soul.

Rend the caul of - (what encloses) their heart that is, the pericardium.
They had closed their hearts against God. Their punishment is pictured
by the rending open of the closed heart, by the lion which is said to go
instinctively straight to the heart, tears it out, and sucks the blood .
Fearful will it be in the Day of Judgment, when the sinner's heart is
laid open, with all the foul, cruel, malicious, defiled, thoughts which
it harbored and concealed, against the will of God. "It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God" [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md).

And there will I devour them - "There," where they sinned, shall they be
punished. "The wild beast shall tear them." What God does, He does
mostly through instruments, and what His instruments do, they do
fulfilling His will through their own blind will or appetite. Hitherto,
He had spoken, as being Himself their punisher, although laying aside,
as it were, all His tenderness; now, lest the thought, that still it was
He, the God of love who punished, should give them hope, He says, "the
wild beast shall devour them." He gives them up, as it were, out of His
own hands to the destroyer.

[Hosea 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 13:9</span></span>

O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in Me is thy help - This is
one of the concise sayings of Hosea, which is capable of many shades of
meaning. The five words, one by one, are literally, "Israel, thy
destruction, for" or "that, in" or "against Me, in" or "against thy
help." Something must be supplied any way; the simplest seems; "O
Israel, thy destruction" is, "that" thou hast been, hast rebelled
"against Me, against thy help" . Yet, in whatever way the words are
filled up, the general sense is the same, that God alone is our help, we
are the sources of our own destruction; and "that," in separating
ourselves from God, or rebelling against Him who is our help until we
depart from Him, who alone could be, and who if we return, will be, our
help. The sum of the meaning is, all our destruction is from ourselves;
all our salvation is from God. : "Perdition, reprobation, obduration,
damnation, are not, properly and in themselves, from God, dooming to
perdition, reprobating, obdurating, damning, but from man sinning, and
obduring or hardening himself in sin to the end of life. Contrariwise,
predestination, calling, grace, are not from the foreseen merits of the
predestinate, but from God, predestinating, calling, and, by His grace,
forecoming the predestinate. Wherefore although the cause or ground, why
they are predestinated, does not lie in the predestinate, yet in the
not-predestinated does lie the ground or cause why they are not
predestinated."

"This saying then, 'O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in Me is
thy help,' may be thus unfolded;

Thy captivity, Israel, is from thee; thy redemption from Me.

Thy perishing is from thee; thy salvation from Me.

Thy death from thee; thy life from Me.

Thy evil from thee; thy good from Me.

Thy reprobation from thee; thy predestination from Me, who ever stand at
the door of thy heart and in mercy knock.

Thy dereliction from thee; thy calling from Me.

Thy misery from thee; thy bliss from Me.

Thy damnation from thee, thy salvation and beatifying from Me."

For " many good things doeth God in man, which man doeth not, but none
doeth man, which God endueth not man to do." : "The first cause of the
defect of grace is from us; but the first cause of the gift of grace is
from God." : "Rightly is God called, not the Father of judgments or of
vengence, but the "Father of mercies," because from Himself is the cause
and origin of His mercy, from us the cause of His judging or avenging."

"Blessed the soul which comprehendeth this, not with the understanding
only, but with the heart. Nothing can destroy us before God, but sin,
the only real evil; and sin is wholly from us, God can have no part in
it. But every aid to withdraw us from sin, or to hinder us from falling
into it, comes from God alone, the sole Source of our salvation. The
soul then must ever bless God, in its ills and its good; in its ills, by
confessing that itself is the only cause of its suffering; in its good,
owning that, when altogether unworthy of it, God prevented it by His
grace, and preserves it each instant by His Almighty goodness."

: "No power, then, of the enemy could harm thee, unless, by thy sins,
thou calledst forth the anger of God against thee to thy destruction.
Ascribe it to thyself, not to the enemy. So let each sinful city or
sinful soul say, which by its guilt draws on it the vengeance of God."

This truth, that in Him alone is help, He confirms by what follows:

[Hosea 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 13:10</span></span>

I will be thy King - (literally, "I would be" thy King) Where is any
other that, etc. A better translation would be: "Where now is thy king,
that he may save thee in all thy cities; and thy judges, of whom thou
saidst, give me a king and princes."

As Israel was under Samuel, such it remained. "Then" it mistrusted God,
and looked to man for help, saying, "Nay, but we will have a king over
us, that we also may be like other nations, and that our king may judge
us, and go out before us, and fight our battles" [Sa1
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#019.md). In choosing man they rejected
God. The like they did, when they chose Jeroboam. In order to rid
themselves of the temporary pressure of Rehoboam's taxes, they demanded
anew "king and princes." First they rejected God as their king; then
they rejected the king whom God appointed, and Him in His appointment.
"In all thy cities." It was then to be one universal need of help. They
had chosen a king "to fight their battles," and had rejected God. Now
was the test, whether their choice had been good or evil. One cry for
help went up from "all their cities." God would have heard it; could
man?

: "This question is like that other, 'Where are their gods, their rock
in whom they trusted, which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and
drink the wine of their drink offerings?' [Deu
32:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md). As there, when no answer
could be made, He adds, 'See now that I, I am He, and that there is no
god with Me,' so here He subjoins;"

[Hosea 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 13:11</span></span>

I gave thee a king in Mine anger - o: "God, when He is asked for ought
amiss, sheweth displeasure, when He giveth, hath mercy, when He giveth
not." "The devil was heard," (in asking to enter into the swine) "the
Apostle was not heard," (when he prayed that the messenger of Satan
might depart from him) , "God heard him whom He purposed to condemn; and
He heard not him whom He willed to heal." : "God, when propitious,
denieth what we love, when we love amiss; when wroth, He giveth to the
lover, what he loveth amiss. The Apostle saith plainly, "God gave them
over to their own hearts' desire." He gave them then what they loved,
but, in giving, condemned them." God did appoint Jeroboam, although not
in the way in which Israel took him. Jeroboam and Israel took, as from
themselves, what God appointed; and, so taking it, marred God's gift.

Taking it to themselves from themselves, they maintained it for
themselves by human policy and sin. As was the beginning, such was the
whole course of their kings. The beginning was rebellion; murder,
intestine commotion, anarchy, was the oft-repeated issue. God was
against them and their kings; but he let them have their way. In His
displeasure with them He allowed them their choice; in displeasure with
their evil kings He took them away. Some He smote in their own persons,
some in their posterity. So often as He gave them, so often He removed
them, until, in Hoshea, He took them away forever. This too explains,
how what God "gave in anger," could be "taken away" also "in anger." The
civil authority was not a thing wrong in itself, the ceasing whereof
must be a mercy. Israel was in a worse condition through its separate
monarchy; but, apart from the calf-worship, it was not sin. The changing
of one king for another did not mend it.

Individual kings were taken away in anger against themselves; their
removal brought fresh misery and bloodshed. Nations and Churches and
individuals may put themselves in an evil position, and God may have
allowed it in His anger, and yet, it may be their wisdom and humility to
remain in it, until God change it, lest He should "take" it away, not in
forgiveness, but in "anger." : "David they neither asked for, nor did
the Lord give him in His anger; but the Lord first chose him in mercy,
gave him in grace, in His supreme good-pleasure He strengthened and
preserved him." : "Let no one who suffereth from a wicked ruler, accuse
"him" from whom he suffereth, for it was from his own ill deserts, that
he became subject to such a ruler. Let him accuse then his own deeds,
rather than the injustice of the ruler, for it is written, "I gave thee
a king in Mine anger." Why then disdain to have as rulers, those whose
rule we receive from the anger of God?" : "When a reprobate people is
allowed to have a reprobate pastor, that pastor is given, neither for
his own sake, nor for that of the people; inasmuch as he so governeth,
and they so obey, that neither the teacher nor the taught are found meet
to attain to eternal bliss. Of whom the Lord saith by Hosea, "I gave
thee a king in Mine anger." For in the anger of God is a king given,
when the bad have a worse appointed as their ruler. Such a pastor is
then given, when he undertakes the rule of such a people, both being
condemned alike to everlasting punishment."

[Hosea 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 13:12</span></span>

The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up - (As in a bag or purse, and so,
"treasured up"), as Job saith, using the same word, "My transgression is
sealed up in a bag, and Thou sewest up mine iniquity." [Job
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017.md). "His sin" is "hid" i. e., as
people lay up hidden treasure, to be brought out in its season. What Job
feared for himself; was to be the portion of Ephraim. All his sins
should be counted, laid by, heaped up. No one of them should escape His
eye who sees all things as they pass, and with whom, when past, they are
present still. One by one, sins enter into the treasure-house of wrath;
silently they are stored up, until the measure is full; to be brought
out and unfolded in the Great Day. Ephraim thought, as do all sinners,
that because God does not punish at once, He never will. They think,
either that God will bear with them always, because He bears with them
so long; or that He does not see, does not regard it, is not so precise
about His laws being broken. "Because sentence against an evil work is
not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully
set in them to do evil" [Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md).

But God had forewarned them; "Is not this laid up in store with Me, and
sealed up among My treasures? To Me belongeth vengeance and recompense;
their foot shall slide in due time" [Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md), [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md); and, "These things hast thou
done, and I kept silence; and thou thoughtest wickedly that I was
altogether such an one as thyself; I will reprove thee, and set them in
order before thine eyes" [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md).
Unrepented sin is an evergrowing store of the wrath of God, hid out of
sight in the depths of the divine judgments, but of which nothing will
be lost, nothing missing. Man treasures it up, lays it up in store for
himself, as the Apostle saith; "Despisest thou the riches of His
goodness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the
goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance; but after thy hardness and
impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render
to every man according to his deeds?" [Rom
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md). : "'Sin is hidden,' when it is
laid open by no voice of confession; yea, when it is covered with a
shield of proud self-defense. Then iniquity is bound up, so that it
cannot be loosed or forgiven. Contrariwise a holy man saith, "I
acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I
will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the
iniquity of my sin" [Psa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md).

But these hide their sin in the sight of people, and since they cannot
hide it in the sight of God, they defend it with impenitent hearts, but
"the pangs of a travailing woman," he saith, "shall come upon him." For
as a woman can conceal her conception for a time, but, at last, the
travail-pangs betraying her, she discloses what was concealed, so these
can dissemble and conceal for a time their sin, but in their time all
the hidden things of their hearts shall, with anguish, be revealed,
according to that, 'There is nothing covered, that shall not be
revealed, and hid, that shall not be known.' [Mat
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026.md)."

[Hosea 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 13:13</span></span>

The sorrows of a travailing woman are come upon him - The travail-pangs
are violent, sudden, irresistible. A moment before they come, all is
seemingly perfect health; they come, increase in vehemence, and, if they
accomplish not that for which they are sent, end in death, both to the
mother and the child. Such are God's chastisements. If they end not in
the repentance of the sinner, they continue on in his destruction. But
never is man more secure, than just before the last and final throe
comes upon him. "The false security of Israel, when Samaria was on the
point of falling into the hands of its enemies, was a picture of that of
the synagogue, when greater evils were coming upon it. Never did the
Jews less think that the axe was laid to the root of the trees." This
blind presumption is ever found in a people whom God casts off. At the
end of the world, amid the awful signs, the fore-runners of the Day of
Judgment, people will be able to reassure themselves, and say, "Peace
and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a
woman with child, and they shall not escape" [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md).

The prophet first compares Israel to the mother, in regard to the
sufferings which are a picture of the sudden overwhelming visitations of
God; then to the child, on whose staying or not staying in the womb, the
welfare of both depends.

He is an unwise son, for he should not stay long - Senseless would be
the child, which, if it had the power, lingered, hesitated, whether to
come forth or no. While it lingers, at one time all but coming forth,
then returning, the mother's strength is wasted, and both perish.
Wonderful picture of the vacillating sinner, acted upon by the grace of
God, but resisting it; at one time all but ready to pour out before his
God the hidden burden which oppresses him, at the next, withholding it;
impelled by his sufferings, yet presenting a passive resistance; almost
constrained at times by some mightier pang, yet still with-held; until,
at the last, the impulses become weaker, the pangs less felt, and he
perishes with his unrepented sin.

: "He had said, that the unwise cannot bring forth, that the wise can.
He had mentioned 'children,' i. e., such as are not still-born; who come
forth perfect into the world. These, God saith, shall by His help be
redeemed from everlasting destruction, and, at the same time, having
predicted the destruction of that nation, He gives the deepest comfort
to those who will to retain firm faith in Him, not allowing them to be
utterly cast down."

[Hosea 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 13:14</span></span>

I will ransom them from the power of the grave - Literally, "from the
hand," i. e., the "grasp of the grave," or "of hell." God, by His
prophets, mingles promises of mercy in the midst of His threats of
punishment. His mercy overflows the bounds of the occasion upon which He
makes it known. He had sentenced Ephraim to temporal destruction. This
was unchangeable. He points to that which turns all temporal less into
gain, their eternal redemption. The words are the fullest which could
have been chosen. The word rendered "ransom," signifies, rescued them by
the payment of a price, the word rendered "redeem," relates to one, who,
as the nearest of kin, had the right to acquire anything as his own, by
paying that price. Both words, in their exactest sense, describe what
Jesus did, buying us "with a price," a full and dear price, "not of
corruptible things, as of silver and gold, but with His precious blood"
[Pe1 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); and that, becoming our
near kinsman, by His Incarnation, "for which cause He is not ashamed to
call us brethren [Heb 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md), and
"little children" [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md).

This was never done by God at any other time, than when, out of love for
our lost world, "He gave His Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); and He "came to give His life a
ransom for many" ([Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md), add [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006).md). Then only was man really
delivered from the "grasp" of the "grave;" so that "the first death"
should only be a freedom from corruption, an earnest, and, to fallen
man, a necessary condition of immortality; man "the second death" should
"have no power over" them [Rev 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006.md). :
Thenceforward "death, the parent of sorrow, ministers to joy; death, our
dishonor, is employed to our glory; the "gate of hell" is the portal to
the kingdom of heaven; the "pit of destruction" is the entrance to
salvation; and that to man, a sinner." At no other time , "were men
freed from death and the grave, so as to make any distinction between
them and others subject to mortality." The words refuse to be tied down
to a temporal deliverance. A little longer continuance in Canaan is not
a redemption from the power of the grave; nor was Ephraim so delivered.
Words of God , "cannot mean so little, while they express so much." Then
and then alone were they, in their literal meaning, fulfilled when God
the Son "took" our flesh, "that, through death, He might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is the devil; and deliver them who,
through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage" [Heb
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md).

The Jews have a tradition wrapped up in their way, that this was to be
accomplished in Christ. : "I went with the angel Kippod, and Messiah son
of David went with me, until I came to the gates of hell. When the
prisoners of hell saw the light of the Messiah, they wished to receive
him, saying, this is he who will bring us out of this darkness, as it is
written, 'I will redeem them from the hand of hell. '"

: "Not without reason is the vouchsafed mercy thus once and again
outspoken to us, "I will ranson them from the power of the grave; I will
redeem them from death." It is said in regard to that twofold death
whereby we all died in Adam, of the body and of the soul." "O death, I
will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." So full is
God's word, that the sense remains the same, amid much difference of
rendering. Christ was the death of death, when He became subject to it;
the destruction of the grave when He lay in the tomb. Yet to render it
in the form of a question is most agreeable to the language. "O death,
where are thy plagues? O grave, where is thy destruction?" It is a burst
of triumph at the promised redemption, then fulfilled to us in earnest
and in hope, when "Christ," being "risen from the dead, became the
First-fruits of them that slept" [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), and we rose in Him. But the
Apostle teaches us, that then it shall be altogether fulfilled, when, at
the Last Day, "this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on immortality" [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md). "Then shall death and hell
deliver up the dead which shall be in them, and themselves be cast into
the lake of fire" [Rev 20:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013.md). "Then
shall there be no sting of death; sorrow and sighing shall flee away;
fear and anxiety shall depart; tears shall be no more, and in place
thereof shall be boundless pleasure, everlasting joy, praise of the
glory of God in most sweet harmony." But now too, through death, the
good man "ceases to die, and begins to live;" he "dies wholly to the
world, that he may live perfectly with God; the soul returns to the
Author of its being, and is hidden in the hidden presence of God" .

Death and hell had no power to resist, and God says that He will not
alter His sentence; "Repentance shall be hid from Mine eyes;" as the
Apostle says, "the gifts and calling of God are with out repentance"
[Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md).

[Hosea 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 13:15</span></span>

Though - (literally, "when") he (shall) be fruitful among his brethren
Fruitfulness was God's promise to Ephraim, and was expressed in his
name. It was fulfilled, abused, and, in the height of its fulfillment,
was taken away. Ephraim is pictured as a fair and fruitful tree. An
"East wind," so desolating in the East, and that, no chance wind, but
"the wind of the Lord," a wind, sent by God and endued by God with the
power to destroy, "shall come up from the wilderness," parching,
scorching, fiery, from the burning sands of "Arabia the desert," from
which it came, "and shall dry up the fountain" of his being. Deep were
the roots of this fair and flourishing tree, great its vigor, ample and
perpetual the fountain of its waters, over which it grew and by which it
was sustained. He calls it "'his' spring, 'his' fountain," as though
this source of its life were made over to it, and made its own. It "was
planted by the water side;" but it was not of God's planting. "The East
wind from the Lord" should dry up the deepest well-spring of its waters,
and the tree should wither. Such are ungodly greatness and prosperity.
While they are fairest in show, their life-fountains are drying up.

He shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels - He, emphatically,
the enemy whom the prophet had ever in his mind, as the instrument of
God's chastisement on His people, and who was represented by the East
wind; the Assyrian, who came from the East, to whom, as to the East
Wind, the whole country between lay open, for the whirlwinds of his
armies to sweep over in one straight course from the seat of his
dominion.

[Hosea 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 13:16</span></span>

Samaria shall become desolate - Or "shall bear her iniquity." Her
iniquity should now find her out, and rest upon her. Of this,
"desolation" was, in God's judgments, the consequence. Samaria, "the
nursery of idolatry and rebellion against God," the chief in pride
should be chief in punishment. "For she hath rebelled against her God."
It aggravated her sin, that He "against" whom "she rebelled," was "her"
own "God." He who had chosen her to be His, and made Himself her God;
who had showed Himself "her" God in the abundance of His
loving-kindness, from the deliverance out of Egypt to that day. This her
desolation, it is again said, should be Complete. Hope remains, if the
people of a generation are cut off; yet not only should these fall by
the sword; those already born were to be dashed in pieces; those as yet
unborn were to be sought out for destruction, even in their mother's
womb. Such atrocities were common then. Elisha foretold to Hazael that
he would perpetrate both cruelties [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md), Shalmaneser clashed the young
children in pieces [Kg2 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014.md), as did
the conqueror of NoAmmon [Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md),
and the Babylonians [Psa 137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009.md)
afterward. The children of Ammon ripped up the women with child in
Gilead [Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md), and the usurper
Menahem in Tiphsah and its coasts [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md). Isaiah prophesies that Babylon
should undergo, in its turn, the same as to its children [Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md), and the Psalmist pronounces
God's blessing on its destroyer who should so requite him [Psa
137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009.md).

Such was to be the end of the pride, the ambition, the able policy, the
wars, the oppressions, the luxury, the self-enjoyment, and, in all, the
rebellion of Samaria against "her" God. She has stood the more in
opposition to God, the nearer she might have been to Him, and "bare her
iniquity." As a city of God's people, it was never restored. The spot,
in its pagan colonists, with which Assyrian policy repopulated it [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md), was still the abode of a
mingled religion. Corruption clung, by inheritance, to its site. This
too was destroyed by John Hyrcanus. "He effaced thee marks that it had
ever been a city" . It was rebuilt by the Romans, after Pompey had taken
Jerusalem . Herod reenclosed a circuit of two miles and a half of the
ancient site, fortified it strongly, as a check on the Jews; repopulated
it, partly with some who had served in his wars, partly with the people
around; gave them lands, revived their idolatry by replacing their poor
temple by one remarkable for size and beauty, in an area of a furlong
and a half; and called the place Sebaste in honor of his pagan patron,
Augustus .

A coin of Nero, struck there, bears the figure (it is thought) of its
old idol, Ashtaroth . Jerome says, that John the Baptist was buried
there . The pagan, who were encouraged in such desecrations by Julian
the Apostate , opened the tomb, burned the bones, and scattered the dust
. The city became a Christian See, and its Bishops were present at the
four first General Councils . It is now but a poor village, connected
with the strongly-fortified town of Herod by its pagan name Sebastieh, a
long avenue of broken pillars, and the tomb of the great Forerunner . Of
the ancient capital of Ephraim, not even a ruin speaks.

The prophet closes this portion of his prophecy, as other prophets so
often do, with the opposite end of the righteous and the wicked. He had
spoken of the victory over death, the irrevocable purpose of God for
good to his own; then he speaks of utter final destruction. Then when
the mercy of God shall be shown to the uttermost, and the victory over
sin and death shall be accomplished, then shall all the pomp of the its
riches, joys, luxuries, elegance, glory, dignity; perish and not a wreck
be left behind of all which once dazzled the eyes of people, for which
they forsook their God, and sold themselves to evil and the evil one.
