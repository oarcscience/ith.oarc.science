### [Exodus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 6:2</span></span>

There appears to have been an interval of some months between the
preceding events and this renewal of the promise to Moses. The
oppression in the meantime was not merely driving the people to
desperation, but preparing them by severe labor, varied by hasty
wanderings in search of stubble, for the exertions and privations of the
wilderness. Hence, the formal and solemn character of the announcements
in the whole chapter.

[Exo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md)

I am the Lord ... - The meaning seems to be this: "I am Jehovah
(Yahweh), and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai, but
as to my name Jehovah, I was not made known to them." In other words,
the full import of that name was not disclosed to them. See [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md).

[Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md)

God Almighty - Rather, "El Shaddai," (שׁדי אל 'êl shadday), it is better
to keep this as a proper name.

[Exodus 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 6:6</span></span>

With a stretched out arm - The figure is common and quite intelligible;
it may have struck Moses and the people the more forcibly since they
were familiar with the hieroglyphic which represents might by two
outstretched arms.

[Exodus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 6:9</span></span>

They hearkened not - The contrast between the reception of this
communication and that recorded in [Exo
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031.md) is accounted for by the change of
circumstances. On the former occasion the people were comparatively at
ease, accustomed to their lot, sufficiently afflicted to long for
deliverance, and sufficiently free in spirit to hope for it.

For anguish - See the margin; out of breath, as it were, after their
cruel disappointment, they were quite absorbed by their misery, unable
and unwilling to attend to any fresh communication.

[Exodus 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 6:11</span></span>

Go out of his land - Moses is now bidden to demand not a permission for
a three days' journey ([Exo 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018.md)
note), which might be within the boundaries of Egypt, but for departure
from the land.

[Exodus 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 6:12</span></span>

Uncircumcised lips - An uncircumcised ear is one that does not hear
clearly; an uncircumcised heart one slow to receive and understand
warnings; uncircumcised lips, such as cannot speak fluently. The
recurrence of the hesitation of Moses is natural; great as was the
former trial this was far more severe; yet his words always imply fear
of failure, not of personal danger (see [Exo
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011).md).

[Exodus 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 6:13</span></span>

Unto Moses and unto Aaron - The final and formal charge to the two
brothers is given, as might be expected, before the plagues are
denounced. With this verse begins a new section of the history.

[Exodus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 6:14</span></span>

These be the heads - We have in the following verses, not a complete
genealogy, but a summary account of the family of the two brothers.
Moses records for the satisfaction of Hebrew readers, to whom
genealogical questions were always interesting, the descent and position
of the designated leaders of the nation. See [Exo
6:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md).

[Exodus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 6:20</span></span>

Amram - This can scarcely be the same person who is mentioned in [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md); but his descendant and
representative in the generation immediately preceding that of Moses.
The intervening links are omitted, as is the rule where they are not
needed for some special purpose, and do not bear upon the history.

Jochebed - The name means "the glory of Jehovah (Yahweh)," one clear
instance of the use of the sacred name before the Exodus.

Father's sister - This was within the prohibited degrees after the law
was given [Lev 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012.md) but not
previously.

[Exodus 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 6:26</span></span>

This emphatic repetition shows the reason for inserting the genealogy.
The names of Moses and Aaron are given twice and in a different order;
used in [Exo 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md) probably to mark
Aaron as the older in the genealogy, and used in [Exo
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#027.md) to denote the leadership of
Moses.

[Exodus 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 6:28</span></span>

This and the following verses belong to the next chapter. They mark
distinctly the beginning of a subdivision of the narrative.

[Exodus 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 6:30</span></span>

See [Exo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md).
