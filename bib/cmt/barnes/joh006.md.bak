### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

Jesus went over - Went to the east side of the sea. The place to which
he went was Bethsaida, [Luk 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md). The
account of this miracle of feeding the five thousand is recorded also in
[Mat 14:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md); [Mar
6:32-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032.md); [Luk
9:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md). John has added a few
circumstances omitted by the other evangelists.

[John 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 6:2</span></span>

Because they saw his miracles ... - They saw that he had the power to
supply their wants, and they therefore followed him. See [Joh
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md). Compare also [Mat
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014.md).

[John 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 6:4</span></span>

The passover - See the notes at [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md), [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md).

A feast of the Jews - This is one of the circumstances of explanation
thrown in by John which show that he wrote for those who were
unacquainted with Jewish customs.

[John 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 6:6</span></span>

To prove him - To try him; to see if he had faith, or if he would show
that he believed that Jesus had power to supply them.

[John 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 6:12</span></span>

Gather up the fragments - This command is omitted by the other
evangelists. It shows the care of Jesus that there should be no waste.
Though he had power to provide any quantity of food, yet he has here
taught us that the bounties of Providence are not to be squandered. In
all things the Saviour set us an example of frugality, though he had an
infinite supply at his disposal; he was himself economical, though he
was Lord of all. If he was thus saving, it becomes us dependent
creatures not to waste the bounties of a beneficent Providence. And it
especially becomes the rich not to squander the bounties of Providence.
They often feel that they are rich. They have enough. They have no fear
of want, and they do not feel the necessity of studying economy. Yet let
them remember that what they have is the gift of God - just as certainly
as the loaves and fishes created by the Saviour were his gift. It is not
given them to waste, nor to spend in riot, nor to be the means of
injuring their health or of shortening life. It is given to sustain
life, to excite gratitude, to fit for the active service of God.
Everything should be applied to its appropriate end, and nothing should
be squandered or lost.

[John 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 6:14</span></span>

That Prophet ... - The Messiah. The power to work the miracle, and the
benevolence manifested in it, showed that he was the long-expected
Messiah.

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

When Jesus perceived ... - They were satisfied by the miracle that he
was the Messiah. They supposed that the Messiah was to be a temporal
prince. They saw that Jesus was retiring, unambitious, and indisposed to
assume the ensigns of office. They thought, therefore, that they would
proclaim him as the long-expected king, and constrain him to assume the
character and titles of an earthly prince. Men often attempt to dictate
to God, and suppose that they understand what is right better than he
does. They are fond of pomp and power, but Jesus sought retirement, and
evinced profound humility. Though he had claims to the honor and
gratitude of the nation, yet he sought it not in this way; nor did it
evince a proper spirit in his followers when they sought to advance him
to a place of external splendor and regal authority.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

See this miracle of walking on the sea explained in the notes at [Mat
14:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md). Compare [Mar
6:45-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md).

[Joh 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md)

Immediately - Quickly. Before a long time. How far they were from the
land we know not, but there is no evidence that there was a miracle in
the case. The word translated "immediately" does not of necessity imply
that there was no interval of time, but that there was not a long
interval. Thus, in [Mat 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#005.md), in the
parable of the sower, "and immediately (the same word in Greek) they
sprung up," etc., [Mar 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#017.md); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Jo3
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md).

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

The people which stood on the other side of the sea - That is, on the
east side, or on the same side with Jesus. The country was called the
region beyond or on, the other side of the sea, because the writer and
the people lived on the west side.

Jesus went not with his disciples - He had gone into a mountain to pray
alone, [Joh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md). Compare [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046.md).

[John 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 6:23</span></span>

There came other boats - After the disciples had departed. This is added
because, from what follows, it appears that they supposed that he had
entered one of those boats and gone to Capernaum after his disciples had
departed.

From Tiberias - This town stood on the western borders of the lake, not
far from where the miracle had been performed. It was so called in honor
of the Emperor Tiberius. It was built by Herod Antipas, and was made by
him the capital of Galilee. The city afterward became a celebrated seat
of Jewish learning. It is now called Tabaria, and is a considerable
place. It is occupied chiefly by Turks, and is very hot and unhealthy.
Mr. Fisk, an American missionary, was at Tiberius (Tabaria) in 1823. The
old town is surrounded by a wall, but within it is very ruinous, and the
plain for a mile or two south is strewed with ruins. The Jordan, where
it issues from the lake, was so shallow that cattle and asses forded it
easily. Mr. Fisk was shown a house called the house of Peter, which is
used as the Greek Catholic church, and is the only church in the place.
The number of Christian families is 30 or 40, all Greek Catholics. There
were two sects of Jews, each of whom had a synagogue.

The Jewish population was estimated at about 1,000. On the 1st of
January, 1837, Tiberius was destroyed by an earthquake. Dr. Thomson (The
Land and the Book, vol. ii. pp. 76, 77) says of this city: "Ever since
the destruction of Jerusalem, it has been chiefly celebrated in
connection with the Jews, and was for a long time the chief seat of
rabbinical learning. It is still one of their four holy cities. Among
the Christians it also early rose to distinction, and the old church,
built upon the spot where our Lord gave his last charge to Peter, is a
choice bit of ecclesiastical antiquity. The present city is situated on
the shore, at the northeast corner of this small plain. The walls
inclose an irregular parallelogram, about 100 rods from north to south,
and in width not more than 40. They were strengthened by ten round
towers on the west, five on the north, and eight on the south. There
were also two or three towers along the shore to protect the city from
attack by sea. Not much more than one-half of this small area is
occupied by buildings of any kind, and the north end, which is a rocky
hill, has nothing but the ruins of the old palace.

The earthquake of 1837 prostrated a large part of the walls, and they
have not yet been repaired, and perhaps never will be. There is no town
in Syria so utterly filthy as Tiberius, or so little to be desired as a
residence. Being 600 feet below the level of the ocean, and overhung on
the west by a high mountain, which effectually shuts off the
Mediterranean breezes, it is fearfully hot in summer. The last time I
was encamped at the Baths the thermometer stood at 100 at midnight, and
a steam went up from the surface of the lake as from some huge,
smouldering volcano. Of course it swarms with all sorts of vermin. What
can induce human beings to settle down in such a place? And yet some
2,000 of our race make it their chosen abode. They are chiefly Jews,
attracted hither either to cleanse their leprous bodies in her baths, or
to purify their unclean spirits by contact with her traditionary and
ceremonial holiness."

[John 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 6:24</span></span>

Took shipping - Went into the boats.

Came to Capernaum - This was the ordinary place of the residence of
Jesus, and they therefore expected to find him there.

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

Ye seek me, not because ... - The miracles which Jesus performed were
proofs that he came from God. To seek him because they had seen them,
and were convinced by them that he was the Messiah, would have been
proper; but to follow him simply because their wants were supplied was
mere selfishness of a gross kind. Yet, alas! many seek religion from no
better motive than this. They suppose that it will add to their earthly
happiness, or they seek only to escape from suffering or from the
convictions of conscience, or they seek for heaven only as a place of
enjoyment, and regard religion as valuable only for this. All this is
mere selfishness. Religion does not forbid our regarding our own
happiness, or seeking it in any proper way; but when this is the only or
the prevailing motive, it is evident that we have never yet sought God
aright. We are aiming at the loaves and fishes, and not at the honor of
God and the good of his kingdom; and if this is the only or the main
motive of our entering the church, we cannot be Christians.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

Labour not - This does not mean that we are to make no effort for the
supply of our wants (compare [Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md);
[Th2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010).md), but that we are not to
manifest anxiety, we are not to make this the main or supreme object of
our desire. See the notes at [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md).

The meat that perisheth - The food for the supply of your natural needs.
It perishes. The strength you derive from it is soon exhausted, and your
wasted powers need to be reinvigorated.

That meat which endureth - The supply of your spiritual wants; that
which supports, and nourishes, and strengthens the soul; the doctrines
of the gospel, that are to a weak and guilty soul what needful food is
to the weary and decaying body.

To everlasting life - The strength derived from the doctrines of the
gospel is not exhausted. It endures without wasting away. It nourishes
the soul to everlasting life. "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
their strength; they shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not
faint," [Isa 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031.md).

Him hath God the Father sealed - To seal is to confirm or approve as
ours. This is done when we set our seal to a compact, or deed, or
testament, by which we ratify it as our act. So God the Father, by the
miracles which had been performed by Jesus, had shown that he had sent
him, that he approved his doctrines, and ratified his works. The
miracles were to his doctrine what a seal is to a written instrument.
See the notes at [Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md).

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? - That is, such
things as God will approve. This was the earnest inquiry of men who were
seeking to be saved. They had crossed the Sea of Tiberias to seek him;
they supposed him to be the Messiah, and they sincerely desired to be
taught the way of life; yet it is observable that they expected to find
that way as other sinners commonly do - by their works. The idea of
doing something to merit salvation is one of the last that the sinner
ever surrenders.

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

This is the work of God - This is the thing that will be acceptable to
God, or which you are to do in order to be saved. Jesus did not tell
them they had nothing to do, or that they were to sit down and wait, but
that there was a work to perform, and that was a duty that was
imperative. It was to believe on the Messiah. This is the work which
sinners are to do; and doing this they will be saved, for Christ is the
end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth, [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md).

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

What sign showest thou? - On the word sign, compare the notes at [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). What miracle dost thou work to
prove that thou art the Messiah? They had just seen the miracle of the
loaves in the desert, which was sufficient to show that he was the
Messiah, and it would seem from the preceding narrative that those who
crossed the lake to see him supposed that he was the Christ. It seems
wonderful that they should so soon ask for further evidence that he was
sent from God; but it is not improbable that this question was put by
other Jews, rulers of the synagogue, who happened to be present, and who
had not witnessed his miracles. Those men were continually asking for
signs and proofs that he was the Messiah. See [Mat
12:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md); [Mar
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011.md); [Luk
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029.md). As Jesus claimed the right of
teaching them, and as it was manifest that he would teach them
differently from what they supposed Moses to teach, it was natural to
ask him by what authority he claimed the right to be heard.

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Our fathers - The Jews who were led by Moses through the wilderness.

Did eat manna - This was the name given by the Jews to the food which
was furnished to them by God in their journey. It means literally, "What
is this?" and was the question which they asked when they first saw it,
[Exo 16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#014.md). It was small like
frost, and of the size of coriander-seed, and had a sweetish taste like
honey. It fell in great quantities, and was regarded by the Jews as
proof of a continued miracle during forty years, and was incontestable
evidence of the interposition of God in favor of their fathers. The
manna which is sold in the shops of druggists is a different substance
from this. It is obtained from the bark of certain trees in Armenia,
Georgia, Persia, and Arabia. It is procured, as resin is, by making an
incision in the bark, and it flows out or distils from the tree.

As it is written - The substance of this is written in [Psa
78:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024.md).

He gave them - This was regarded as a miraculous interference in their
behalf, and an attestation of the divine mission of Moses, and hence
they said familiarly that Moses gave it to them.

Bread from heaven - The word "heaven," in the Scriptures, denotes often
the region of the air, the atmosphere, or that region in which the
clouds are. See [Mat 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md); "The sky
(heaven) is red and lowering." Also [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Luk
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015.md); [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018.md). The Jews, as appears from their
writings (see Lightfoot), expected that the Messiah would provide his
followers with plenty of delicious food; and as Moses had provided for
the Jews in the wilderness, so they supposed that Christ would make
provision for the temporal wants of his friends. This was the sign,
probably, which they were now desirous of seeing.

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not that bread from heaven - This might be translated,
"Moses gave you not the bread of heaven." The word "that," which makes
some difference in the sense, is not necessary to express the meaning of
the original. It does not appear that Jesus intended to call in question
the fact that their fathers were fed by the instrumentality of Moses,
but to state that he did not give them the true bread that was adapted
to the wants of the soul. He fed the Body, although his food did not
keep the body alive [Joh 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md) but he
did not give that which would preserve the soul from death. God gave, in
his Son Jesus, the true bread from heaven which was fitted to man, and
of far more value than any supply of their temporal wants. He tells
them, therefore, that they are not to seek from him any such supply of
their temporal wants as they had supposed. A better gift had been
furnished in his being given for the life of the world.

My father giveth you - In the gospel; in the gift of his Son.

The true bread - The trite or real support which is needed to keep the
soul from death. It is not false, deceitful, or perishing. Christ is
called bread, because, as bread supports life, so his doctrine supports,
preserves, and saves the soul from death. He is the true support, not
only in opposition to the mere supply of temporal wants such as Moses
furnished, but also in opposition to all false religion which deceives
and destroys the soul.

[John 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 6:33</span></span>

The bread of God - The means of support which God furnishes. That which,
in his view, is needful for man.

Is he ... - Is the Messiah who has come from heaven.

And giveth life ... - See the notes at [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md).

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

I am the bread of life - I am the support of spiritual life; or my
doctrines will give life and peace to the soul.

Shall never hunger - See the notes at [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md).

[John 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 6:36</span></span>

But I said unto you - This he said, not in so many words, but in
substance, in [Joh 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md). Though they
saw him, and had full proof of his divine mission, yet they did not
believe. Jesus then proceeds to state that, although they did not
believe on him, yet his work would not be in vain, for others would come
to him and be saved.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All - The original word is in the neuter gender, but it is used,
doubtless, for the masculine, or perhaps refers to his people considered
as a mass or body, and means that every individual that the Father had
given him should come to him.

The Father giveth me - We here learn that those who come to Christ, and
who will be saved, are given to him by God.

1\. God promised him that he should see of the travail of his soul -
that is, "the fruit of his wearisome toil" (Lowth), and should be
satisfied, [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md).

2\. All men are sinners, and none have any claim to mercy, and he may
therefore bestow salvation on whom he pleases.

3\. All people of themselves are disposed to reject the gospel, [Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md).

4\. God enables those who do believe to do it. He draws them to Him by
His Word and Spirit; "He opens their hearts to understand the Scriptures
[Act 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014.md); and He grants to them
repentance, [Act 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018.md); [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md).

5\. All those who become Christians may therefore be said to be given to
Jesus as the reward of his sufferings, for his death was the price by
which they were redeemed. Paul says [Eph
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md) that, "he hath chosen us in him
(that is, in Christ) before the foundation of the world, that we should
be holy and without blame before him in love; having predestinated us
unto the adoption of children to himself, according to the good pleasure
of his will."

Shall come to me - This is an expression denoting that they would
believe on him. To come to one implies our need of help, our confidence
that he can aid us, and our readiness to trust to him. The sinner comes
to Jesus feeling that he is poor, and needy, and wretched, and casts
himself on his mercy, believing that he alone can save him. This
expression also proves that men are not compelled to believe on Christ.
Though they who believe are given to him, and though his Spirit works in
them faith and repentance, yet they are made willing in the day of his
power, [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md). No man is compelled
to go to heaven against his will, and no man is compelled to go to hell
against his will. The Spirit of God inclines the will of one, and he
comes freely as a moral agent. The other chooses the way to death; and,
though God is constantly using means to save him, yet he prefers the
path that leads down to woe.

Him that cometh - Everyone that comes - that is, everyone that comes in
a proper mariner, feeling that he is a lost and ruined sinner. This
invitation is wide, and full, and free. It shows the unbounded mercy of
God; and it shows, also, that the reason, and the only reason, why men
are not saved, is that they will not come to Christ. Of any sinner it
may be said that if he had been willing to come to Christ he might have
come and been saved. As he chooses not to come, he cannot blame God
because he saves others who are willing, no matter from what cause, and
who thus are made partakers of everlasting life.

In no wise - In no manner, or at no time. The original is simply, "I
will not cast out."

Cast out - Reject, or refuse to save. This expression does not refer to
the doctrine of perseverance of the saints, but to the fact that Jesus
will not reject or refuse any sinner who comes to him.

[John 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

For I came down ... - This verse shows that he came for a specific
purpose, which he states in the next verse, and means that, as he came
to do his Father's will, he would be faithful to the trust. Though his
hearers should reject him, yet the will of God would be accomplished in
the salvation of some who should come to Him.

Mine own will - See notes at [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md).

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

Father's will - His purpose; desire; intention. As this is the Father's
will, and Jesus came to execute his will, we have the highest security
that it will be done. God's will is always right, and he has power to
execute it. Jesus was always faithful, and all power was given to him in
heaven and on earth, and he will therefore most certainly accomplish the
will of God.

Of all which - That is, of every one who believes on him, or of all who
become Christians. See [Joh 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md).

I should lose nothing - Literally, "I should not destroy." He affirms
here that he will keep it to life eternal; that, thought the Christian
will die, and his body return to corruption, yet he will not be
destroyed. The Redeemer will watch over him, though in his grave, and
keep him to the resurrection of the just. This is affirmed of all who
are given to him by the Father; or, as in the next verse, "Everyone that
believeth on him shall have everlasting life."

At the last day - At the day of judgment. The Jews supposed that the
righteous would be raised up at the appearing of the Messiah. See
Lightfoot. Jesus directs them to a future resurrection, and declares to
them that they will be raised at the last day - the day of judgment. It
is also supposed and affirmed by some Jewish writers that they did not
believe that the wicked would be raised. Hence, to speak of being raised
up in the last day was the same as to say that one was righteous, or it
was spoken of as the special privilege of the righteous. In accordance
with this, Paul says, "If by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection of the dead," [Phi 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md).

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

Every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him - It was not
sufficient to see him and hear him, but it was necessary, also, to
believe on him. Many of the Jews had seen him, but few believed on him.
Jesus had said in the previous verse that all that the Father had given
him should be saved. But he never left a doctrine so that men must
misunderstand it. Lest it should be supposed that if a man was given to
him this was all that was needful, and lest anyone should say, "If I am
to be saved I shall be, and my efforts will be useless," he states here
that it is necessary that a man should believe on him. This would be the
evidence that he was given to God, and this would be evidence conclusive
that he would be saved. If this explanation of the Saviour had always
been attended to, the doctrine of election would not have been abused as
it has been. Sinners would not sit down in unconcern, saying that if
they are given to Christ all will be well. They would have arisen like
the prodigal, and would have gone to God; and, having believed on the
Saviour, they would then have had evidence that they were given to him -
the evidence resulting from an humble, penitent, believing heart - and
then they might rejoice in the assurance that Jesus would lose none that
were given to him, but would raise it up at the last day. All the
doctrines of Jesus, as he preached them, are safe, and pure, and
consistent; as men preach them, they are, unhappily, often inconsistent
and open to objection, and are either fitted to produce despair on the
one hand, or presumptuous self-confidence on the ether. Jesus teaches
men to strive to enter heaven, as if they could do the work themselves;
and yet to depend on the help of God, and give the glory to him, as if
he had done it all.

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

No man can come to me - This was spoken by Jesus to reprove their
complaints - "Murmur not among yourselves." They objected to his
doctrine, or complained against it, because he claimed to be greater
than Moses, and because they supposed him to be a mere man, and that
what he said was impossible. Jesus does not deny that these things
appeared difficult, and hence he said that if any man believed, it was
proof that God had inclined him. It was not to be expected that of
themselves they would embrace the doctrine. If any man believed, it
would be because he had been influenced by God. When we inquire what the
reasons were why they did not believe, they appear to have been:

1\. Their improper regard for Moses, as if no one could be superior to
him.

2\. Their unwillingness to believe that Jesus, whom they knew to be the
reputed son of a carpenter, should be superior to Moses.

3\. The difficulty was explained by Jesus [Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md) as consisting in the opposition
of their will; and [Joh 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md) when he
said that their love of honor prevented their believing on him. The
difficulty in the case was not, therefore, a want of natural faculties,
or of power to do their duty, but erroneous opinions, pride, obstinacy,
self-conceit, and a deep-felt contempt for Jesus. The word cannot is
often used to denote a strong and violent opposition of the will. Thus
we say a man is so great a liar that he cannot speak the truth, or he is
so profane that he cannot but swear. We mean by it that he is so wicked
that while he has that disposition the other effects will follow, but we
do not mean to say that he could not break off from the habit. Thus it
is said [Gen 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004.md) of the brethren of
Joseph that they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. Thus
[Mat 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md), "How can ye, being evil,
speak good things?" See [Luk 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033.md);
[Sa1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002.md).

Come to me - The same as believe on me.

Draw him - This word is used here, evidently, to denote such an
influence from God as to secure the result, or as to incline the mind to
believe; yet the manner in which this is done is not determined by the
use of the word. It is used in the New Testament six times. Once it is
applied to a compulsory drawing of Paul and Silas to the market-place,
[Act 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md). Twice it is used to denote
the drawing of a net, [Joh 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006.md), [Joh
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011.md). Once to the drawing of a sword
[Joh 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md); and once in a sense
similar to its use here [Joh 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md);
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
What is its meaning here must be determined by the facts about the
sinner's conversion. See the notes at [Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md). In the conversion of the sinner
God enlightens the mind [Joh 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md), he
inclines the will [Psa 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md), and he
influences the soul by motives, by just views of his law, by his love,
his commands, and his threatenings; by a desire of happiness, and a
consciousness of danger; by the Holy Spirit applying truth to the mind,
and urging him to yield himself to the Saviour. So that, while God
inclines him, and will have all the glory, man yields without
compulsion; the obstacles are removed, and he becomes a willing servant
of God.

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

In the prophets - [Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md). A
similar sentiment is found in [Mic
4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md), and [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md); but by the prophets, here, is
meant the book of the prophets, and it is probable that Jesus had
reference only to the place in Isaiah, as this was the usual way of
quoting the prophets.

Shall be all taught of God - This explains the preceding verse. It is by
the teaching of his Word and Spirit that men are drawn to God. This
shows that it is not compulsory, and that there is no obstacle in the
way but a strong voluntary ignorance and unwillingness.

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any man hath seen the Father - Jesus added this, evidently, to
guard against mistake. He had said that all who came to him were taught
of God. The teacher was commonly seen and heard by the pupil; but, lest
it should be supposed that he meant to say that a man to come to him
must see and hear God, visibly and audibly, he adds that he did not
intend to affirm this. It was still true that no man had seen God at any
time. They were not, therefore, to expect to see God, and his words were
not to be perverted as if he meant to teach that.

Save he which is of God - Jesus here evidently refers to himself as the
Son of God. He had just said that no man had seen the Father. When he
affirms that he has seen the Father, it implies that he is more than
man. He is the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); the brightness of his glory, and
the express image of his person, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md); God over all, blessed forever,
[Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md). By his being of God is meant
that he is the only-begotten Son of God, and sent as the Messiah into
the world.

Hath seen - Hath intimately known or perceived him. He knows his nature,
character, plans. This is a claim to knowledge superior to what man
possesses, and it cannot be understood except by supposing that Jesus is
equal with God.

[John 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 6:48</span></span>

I am that bread of life - My doctrines and the benefits of my mediation
are that real support of spiritual life of which the manna in the
wilderness was the faint emblem. See [Joh
6:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md).

[John 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 6:49</span></span>

Your fathers did eat manna - There was a real miracle performed in their
behalf; there was a perpetual interposition of God which showed that
they were his chosen people.

And are dead - The bread which they ate could not save them from death.
Though God interfered in their behalf, yet they died. We may learn,

1\. That that is not the most valuable of God's gifts which merely
satisfies the temporal wants.

2\. That the most distinguished temporal blessings will not save from
death. Wealth, friends, food, raiment, will not preserve life.

3\. There is need of something better than mere earthly blessings; there
is need of that bread which cometh down from heaven, and which giveth
life to the world.

[John 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

The bread that I will give is by flesh - That is, his body would be
offered as a sacrifice for sin, agreeably to his declaration when he
instituted the Supper: "This is my body which is broken for you," [Co1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024.md).

Life of the world - That sinners might, by his atoning sacrifice, be
recovered from spiritual death, and be brought to eternal life. The use
of the word world hero shows that the sacrifice of Christ was full free
ample, and designed for all men, as it is said in [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md), "He is the propitiation for our
sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
In this verse Jesus introduces the subject of his death and atonement.
It may be remarked that in the language which he used the transition
from bread to his flesh would appear more easy than it does in our
language. The same word which in Hebrew means "bread," in the Syriac and
Arabic means also "flesh."

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

In these verses Jesus repeats what he had in substance said before.

Except ye eat the flesh ... - He did not mean that this should be
understood literally, for it was never done, and it is absurd to suppose
that it was intended to be so understood. Nothing can possibly be more
absurd than to suppose that when he instituted the Supper, and gave the
bread and wine to his disciples, they literally ate his flesh and drank
his blood. Who can believe this? There he stood, a living man - his body
yet alive, his blood flowing in his veins; and how can it be believed
that this body was eaten and this blood drunk? Yet this absurdity must
be held by those who hold that the bread and wine at the communion are
"changed into the body, blood, and divinity of our Lord." So it is
taught in the decrees of the Council of Trent; and to such absurdities
are men driven when they depart from the simple meaning of the
Scriptures and from common sense. It may be added that if the bread and
wine used in the Lord's Supper were not changed into his literal body
and blood when it was first instituted, they have never been since.

The Lord Jesus would institute it just as he meant it should be
observed, and there is nothing now in that ordinance which there was not
when the Saviour first appointed it. His body was offered on the cross,
and was raised up from the dead and received into heaven. Besides, there
is no evidence that he had any reference in this passage to the Lord's
Supper. That was not yet instituted, and in that there was no literal
eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood. The plain meaning of the
passage is, that by his bloody death - his body and his blood offered in
sacrifice for sin - he would procure pardon and life for man; that they
who partook of that, or had an interest in that, should obtain eternal
life. He uses the figure of eating and drinking because that was the
subject of discourse; because the Jews prided themselves much on the
fact that their fathers had eaten manna; and because, as he had said
that he was the bread of life, it was natural and easy, especially in
the language which he used, to carry out the figure, and say that bread
must be eaten in order to be of any avail in supporting and saving men.
To eat and to drink, among the Jews, was also expressive of sharing in
or partaking of the privileges of friendship. The happiness of heaven
and all spiritual blessings are often represented under this image, [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md); [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); [Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015.md), etc.

[Joh 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md)

Is meat indeed - Is truly food. My doctrine is truly that which will
give life to the soul.

[John 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 6:56</span></span>

Dwelleth in me - Is truly and intimately connected with me. To dwell or
abide in him is to remain in the belief of his doctrine, and in the
participation of the benefits of his death. Compare [Joh
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md); [Joh
17:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md).

I in him - Jesus dwells in believers by his Spirit and doctrine. When
his Spirit is given them to sanctify them; when his temper, his
meekness, his humility, and his love pervade their hearts; when his
doctrine is received by them and influences their life, and when they
are supported by the consolations of the gospel, it may be said that he
abides or dwells in them.

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

I live by the Father - See the notes at [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md).

[John 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 6:58</span></span>

This is that bread ... - This is the true bread that came down. The word
"that" should not be in the translation.

Shall live for ever - Not on the earth, but in the enjoyments of a
better world.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

Many of his disciples - The word "disciple" means "learner." It was
applied to the followers of Christ because they were taught by him. It
does not imply, of necessity, that those to whom it was given were real
Christians, but simply that they were under his teaching, and were
professed learners in his school. See [Mat
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#016.md); [Mar
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md); [Joh
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#028.md); [Mat
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md). It is doubtless used in this
sense here. It is, however, often applied to those who are real
Christians.

This is an hard saying - The word "hard" here means "offensive,
disagreeable" - that which they could not bear. Some have understood it
to mean "difficult to be understood," but this meaning does not suit the
connection. The doctrine which he delivered was opposed to their
prejudices; it seemed to be absurd, and they therefore rejected it.

Saying - Rather doctrine or speech - Greek, λόγος logos. It does not
refer to any particular part of the discourse, but includes the whole.

Who can hear it? - That is, who can hear it patiently - who can stay and
listen to such doctrine or believe it. The effect of this is stated in
[Joh 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md). The doctrines which Jesus
taught that were so offensive appear to have been:

1\. that he was superior to Moses.

2\. that God would save all that he had chosen and those only.

3\. that he said he was the bread that came from heaven.

4\. that it was necessary to partake of that; that it was necessary that
an atonement should be made, and that they should be saved by that.

These doctrines have always been among the most offensive that men have
been called on to believe, and many, rather than trust in them, have
chosen to draw back to perdition.

[John 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">joh 6:62</span></span>

What and if ... - Jesus does not say that those who were then present
would see him ascend, but he implies that he would ascend. They had
taken offence because he said he came down from heaven. Instead of
explaining that away, he proceeds to state another doctrine quite as
offensive to them - that he would reascend to heaven. The apostles only
were present at his ascension, [Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009.md). As Jesus was to ascend to heaven,
it was clear that he could not have intended literally that they should
eat his flesh.

[John 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">joh 6:63</span></span>

It is the Spirit that quickeneth - These words have been understood in
different ways. The word "Spirit," here, evidently does not refer to the
Holy Spirit, for he adds, "The words that I speak unto you, they are
spirit." He refers here, probably, to the doctrine which he had been
teaching in opposition to their notions and desires. "My doctrine is
spiritual; it is fitted to quicken and nourish the soul. It is from
heaven. Your doctrine or your views are earthly, and may be called
flesh, or fleshly, as pertaining only to the support of the body. You
place a great value on the doctrine that Moses fed the body; yet that
did not permanently profit, for your fathers are dead. You seek also
food from me, but your views and desires are gross and earthly."

Quickeneth - Gives life. See the notes at [Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md).

The flesh - Your carnal views and desires, and the literal understanding
of my doctrine. By this Jesus shows them that he did not intend that his
words should be taken literally.

Profiteth nothing - Would not avail to the real needs of man. The bread
that Moses gave, the food which you seek, would not be of real value to
man's highest wants.

They are spirit - They are spiritual. They are not to be understood
literally, as if you were really to eat my flesh, but they are to be
understood as denoting the need of that provision for the soul which God
has made by my coming into the world.

Are life - Are fitted to produce or give life to the soul dead in sins.

[John 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">joh 6:64</span></span>

Jesus knew from the beginning ... - As this implied a knowledge of the
heart, and of the secret principles and motives of men, it shows that he
must have been omniscient.

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

Many of his disciples - Many who had followed him professedly as his
disciples and as desirous of learning of him. See the notes at [Joh
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md).

Went back - Turned away from him and left him. From this we may learn,

1\. Not to wonder at the apostasy of many who profess to be followers of
Christ. Many are induced to become his professed followers by the
prospect of some temporal benefit, or under some public excitement, as
these were; and when that temporal benefit is not obtained, or that
excitement is over, they fall away.

2\. Many may be expected to be offended by the doctrines of the gospel.
Having no spirituality of mind, and really understanding nothing of the
gospel, they may be expected to take offence and turn back. The best way
to understand the doctrines of the Bible is to be a sincere Christian,
and aim to do the will of God, [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

3\. We should examine ourselves. We should honestly inquire whether we
have been led to make a profession of religion by the hope of any
temporal advantage, by any selfish principle, or by mere excited animal
feeling. If we have it will profit us nothing, and we shall either fall
away of ourselves, or be cast away in the great day of judgment.

[John 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">joh 6:67</span></span>

The twelve - The twelve apostles.

Will ye also go away? - Many apostatized, and it was natural now for
Jesus to submit the question to the twelve. "Will you, whom I have
chosen, on whom I have bestowed the apostleship, and who have seen the
evidence of my Messiahship, will you now also leave me?" This was the
time to try them; and it is always a time to try real Christians when
many professed disciples become cold and turn back; and then we may
suppose Jesus addressing us, and saying, Will ye also go away! Observe
here, it was submitted to their choice. God compels none to remain with
him against their will, and the question in such trying times is
submitted to every man whether he will or will not go away.

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

Simon Peter answered him - With characteristic ardor and promptness.
Peter was probably one of the oldest of the apostles, and it was his
character to be first and most ardent in his professions.

To whom shall we go - This implied their firm conviction that Jesus was
the Messiah, and that he alone was able to save them. It is one of
Peter's noble confessions - the instinctive promptings of a pious heart
and of ardent love. There was no one else who could teach them. The
Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the scribes were corrupt, and unable to
guide them aright; and, though the doctrines of Jesus were mysterious,
yet they were the only doctrines that could instruct and save them.

Thou hast ... - The meaning of this is, thou teachest the doctrines
which lead to eternal life. And from this we may learn:

1\. that we are to expect that some of the doctrines of the Bible will
be mysterious.

2\. that, though they are difficult to be understood, yet we should not
therefore reject them.

3\. that nothing would be gained by rejecting them. The atheist, the
infidel - nay, the philosopher, believes, or professes to believe,
propositions quite as mysterious as any in the Bible.

4\. that poor, lost, sinful man has nowhere else to go but to Jesus. He
is the way, the truth, and the life, and if the sinner betakes himself
to any other way he will wander and die.

5\. We should, therefore, on no account forsake the teachings of the Son
of God. The words that he speaks are spirit and are life.

[John 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">joh 6:69</span></span>

We are sure ... - See a similar confession of Peter in [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md), and the notes at that place.
Peter says we are sure, in the name of the whole of the apostles. Jesus
immediately cautions him, as he did on other occasions, not to be too
confident, for one of them actually had no such feelings, but was a
traitor.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

Have not I chosen you twelve? - There is much emphasis in these words.
Have not I - I, the Saviour, the Messiah, chosen you in mercy and in
love, and therefore it will be a greater sin to betray me? Chosen.
Chosen to the apostolic office; conferred on you marks of special favor,
and treason is therefore the greater sin. You twelve. So small a number.
Out of such a multitude as follow for the loaves and fishes, it is to be
expected there should be apostates; but when the number is so small,
chosen in such a manner, then it becomes every one, however confident he
may be, to be on his guard and examine his heart.

Is a devil - Has the spirit, the envy, the malice, and the treasonable
designs of a devil. The word "devil" here is used in the sense of an
enemy, or one hostile to him.

[John 6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">joh 6:71</span></span>

He spake of Judas ... - There is no evidence that Jesus designated Judas
so that the disciples then understood that it was he. It does not appear
that the apostles even suspected Judas, as they continued to treat him
afterward with the same confidence, for he carried the bag, or the purse
containing their little property [Joh
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md); [Joh
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#029.md); and at the table, when Jesus
said that one of them would betray him, the rest did not suspect Judas
until Jesus pointed him out particularly, [Joh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md). Jesus spoke of one, to put them
on their guard, to check their confidence, and to lead them to
self-examination. So in every church, or company of professing
Christians, we may know that it is probable that there may be some one
or more deceived; but we may not know who it may be, and should
therefore inquire prayerfully and honestly, "Lord, is it I?"

Should betray - Would betray. If it be asked why Jesus called a man to
be an apostle who he knew had no love for him, who would betray him, and
who had from the beginning the spirit of a "devil," we may reply:

1\. It was that Judas might be an important witness for the innocence of
Jesus, and for the fact that he was not an impostor. Judas was with him
more than three years. He was treated with the same confidence as the
others, and in some respects even with superior confidence, as he had
"the bag" [Joh 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md), or was the
treasurer. He saw the Saviour in public and in private, heard his public
discourses and his private conversation, and he would have been just the
witness which the high priests and Pharisees would have desired, if he
had known any reason why he should be condemned. Yet he alleged nothing
against him. Though he betrayed him, yet he afterward said that he was
innocent, and, under the convictions of conscience, committed suicide.
If Judas had known anything against the Saviour he would have alleged
it. If he had known that he was an impostor, and had alleged it, he
would have saved his own life and been rewarded. If Jesus was an
impostor, he ought to have made it known, and to have bean rewarded for
it.

2\. It may have been, also, with a foresight of the necessity of having
such a man among his disciples, in order that his own death might be
brought about in the manner in which it was predicted. There were
several prophecies which would have been unfulfilled had there been no
such man among the apostles.

3\. It showed the knowledge which the Saviour had of the human heart,
that he could thus discern character before it was developed, and was
able so distinctly to predict that he would betray him.

4\. We may add, what benevolence did the Saviour evince - what patience
and forbearance - that he had with him for more than three years a man
who he knew hated him at heart, and who would yet betray him to be put
to death on a cross, and that during all that time he treated him with
the utmost kindness!
