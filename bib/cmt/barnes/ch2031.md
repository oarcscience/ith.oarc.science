### [2 Chronicles Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 31:1</span></span>

Jerusalem had been cleansed [Ch2
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014.md); now the land had to be purged.
Hezekiah therefore gave his sanction to a popular movement directed as
much against the "high places" which had been maintained since the times
of the patriarchs, as against the remnants of the Baal-worship, or the
innovations of Ahaz. See [Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md)
note. The invasion of the northern kingdom "Ephraim and Manasseh" by a
tumultuous crowd from the southern one, and the success which attended
the movement, can only be explained by the state of weakness into which
the northern kingdom had fallen (see the note at [Ch2
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024).md).

[2 Chronicles 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 31:2</span></span>

The tents - literally, "the camps." The temple is called the "camp of
Yahweh" by an apt metaphor: the square enclosure, with its gates and
stations, its guards and porters, its reliefs, its orderly arrangement,
and the tabernacle, or tent, of the great commander in the midst, very
much resembled a camp.

[2 Chronicles 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 31:3</span></span>

The king's portion - Amid the general neglect of the observances
commanded by the Law, the tithe system had naturally fallen into disuse.
Hezekiah revived it; and, to encourage the people to give what was due,
cheerfully set the example of paying the full proportion from his own
considerable possessions (compare [Ch2
32:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#028).md). His tithe was, it seems,
especially devoted to the purposes mentioned in this verse (compare the
marginal reference). There were needed for these purposes in the course
of the year nearly 1,100 lambs, 113 bullocks, 37 rams, and 30 goats,
besides vast quantities of flour, oil, and wine for the accompanying
meat and drink offerings.

[2 Chronicles 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 31:4</span></span>

That they might be encouraged ... - i. e. to devote themselves wholly to
their proper work, the service of the sanctuary and the teaching of
God's Law [Ch2 17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007.md), and not engage
in secular occupations. Compare [Neh
13:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md).

[2 Chronicles 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 31:5</span></span>

Honey - See the margin. It is doubtful whether bee-honey was liable to
first-fruits. The sort here intended may therefore be that which,
according to Josephus, was manufactured from dates.

[2 Chronicles 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 31:6</span></span>

By "the children of Israel" in [Ch2
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005.md), seem to be intended the
inhabitants of Jerusalem only (see [Ch2
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004).md); by "the children of Israel and
Judah that dwelt in the cities of Judah" in this verse, seem to be meant
the Jews of the country districts and the Israelites who dwelt among
them [Ch2 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#025.md). Of these two classes,
the first brought both first-fruits and tithes of "all things;" while
the others, who had not been included in the command [Ch2
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004.md), brought in first-fruits and paid
the tithe of sheep and oxen only, and of the things which they had vowed
to God.

[2 Chronicles 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 31:7</span></span>

The third month - Compare [Ch2 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md);
[Ch2 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md), [Ch2
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013.md). The events hitherto described -
the destruction of the high places, the re-appointment of the courses,
and the re-establishment of the tithes followed so closely upon the
Passover, that a month had not elapsed from the conclusion of the Feast
before the gifts began to pour in. In the seventh month the harvest was
completed; and the last tithes and first-fruits of the year would
naturally come in then.

[2 Chronicles 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 31:9</span></span>

"Hezekiah questioned" in order to know whether the ministering priests
and Levites had had their maintenance out of the tithes, and whether the
accumulation which he saw was clear surplus.

[2 Chronicles 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 31:10</span></span>

If this Azariah was the same as he who resisted Uzziah [Ch2
26:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), he must have held his office
at least 33 years. Compare [Ch2 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001.md);
[Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001.md).

The Lord hath blessed his people - i. e. God has made the harvest
unusually abundant, and hence the great amount of tithes and
first-fruits.

[2 Chronicles 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 31:14</span></span>

The porter toward the east - i. e. the chief door-keeper at the east
gate, where the proper number of the porters was six [Ch1
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md).

The most holy things - The sin-offerings and trespass-offerings [Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025.md); [Lev
7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 31:15</span></span>

The cities of the priests - i. e. the Levitical cities (compare marginal
reference). Of these, some had gone to decay, while others, as Libnah
and Beth-shemesh [Ch2 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#010.md); [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md), had been lost, so that the
original number, thirteen, was now, apparently, reduced to six.

In their set office - Rather, as in marg. These six Levites were
stationed at the Levitical cities, with the trust following committed to
them.

[2 Chronicles 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 31:16</span></span>

Beside their genealogy of males ... - Some translate it: "Excepting the
list of males," etc. i. e. they distributed to all the members of the
priestly families, excepting to those who at the time were performing
the duties of their office at Jerusalem. These persons no doubt obtained
their share at the temple itself.

[2 Chronicles 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 31:17</span></span>

Both to the genealogy of the priests ... - Some prefer: "And as for the
list of the priests, it was according to the houses of their fathers,
and that of the Levites was from twenty years," etc. The writer states
the nature of the lists which guided the officers who made the
distributions. Three lists are enumerated one of the priests made out
according to families; one of the Levites, including all above 20 years
of age (see the marginal reference), and made out according to courses;
and a third [Ch2 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#018.md) of the priestly
and Levitical families.

[2 Chronicles 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 31:18</span></span>

And to the genealogy of all their little ones ... - Or, "And as to the
list of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their
daughters, it extended to the whole body, for they dealt with the holy
things faithfully."

[2 Chronicles 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 31:19</span></span>

The country priests and Levites are here distinguished from those who
dwelt in the towns. The writer means to note that not even were they
neglected.
