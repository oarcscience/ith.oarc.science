### [2 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 9:1</span></span>

The narrative here is parallel with that in marginal reference, from
which it varies but little, and to which it adds nothing.

[Ch2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011)

Terraces - Rather, as in the margin, "stairs" (see the [Kg1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012) note).

[Ch2 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#012)

Beside that which she had brought unto the king - It is difficult to
assign any sense to these words as they now stand in the Hebrew text. A
slight alteration will give the meaning: "Beside that which the king had
brought for her;" which is in conformity with [Kg1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013).

Comparing [Kg1 10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016), it follows
from the two passages together that the "pound of gold" was equal to 100
shekels.

[2 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 9:18</span></span>

The footstool (not mentioned in Kings) was an essential appendage to an
Oriental throne; it appears everywhere in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and
Persian sculptures.

[2 Chronicles 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 9:23</span></span>

All the kings of the earth - Rather, "all the kings of the land:" all
the monarchs, that is, whose dominions were included in So omon's empire
(see [Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021)).

[2 Chronicles 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch2 9:28</span></span>

And out of all lands - An addition to the words in Kings. The principal
countries would no doubt be Arabia and Armenia - the former always
famous for its excellent breed; the latter mentioned in Ezekiel [Eze
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#014) as trading with horses in the
fairs of Tyre.

[2 Chronicles 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 9:29</span></span>

The book of Nathan ... - On the "books" here mentioned, see the
introduction to Chronicles, the second note.

We hear nothing of Iddo in Kings: but he is mentioned below twice [Ch2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015); [Ch2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022). In the latter of these passages
he is called not "the seer," but "the prophet." He seems to have been
the author of three works:

\(1\) Visions against Jeroboam;

\(2\) A book of genealogies; and

\(3\) A commentary or history.

According to some, he was identical with Oded, the father of Azariah,
who prophesied in the reign of Asa (see the [Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001) note).
