### [Luke Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md)

[Luke 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 2:1</span></span>

In those days - About the time of the birth of John and of Christ.

A decree - A law commanding a thing to be done.

Caesar Augustus - This was the Roman emperor. His first name was
Octavianus. He was the nephew of Julius Caesar, and obtained the empire
after his death. He took the name "Augustus - i. e., august," or
honorable - as a compliment to his own greatness; and from him the month
"August," which was before called "Sextilis," received its name.

That all the world - There has been much difficulty respecting this
passage, from the fact that no such taxing of "all the world" is
mentioned by ancient writers. It should have been rendered "the whole
land" - that is, the whole land of Palestine. The "whole land" is
mentioned to show that it was not "Judea" only, but that it included
also "Galilee," the place where Joseph and Mary dwelt. That the passage
refers only to the land of Palestine, and not to the whole world, or to
all the Roman empire, is clear from the following considerations:

1\. The fact that no such taxing is mentioned as pertaining to any other
country.

2\. The account of Luke demands only that it should be understood of
Palestine, or the country where the Saviour was born.

3\. The words "world" and "whole world" are not unfrequently used in
this limited sense as confined to a single country.

See [Mat 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md), where Satan is said to
have shown to Christ all the kingdoms of "the world," that is, of the
land of Judea. See also [Jos 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#003.md); [Luk
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025) (Greek.md); [Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026.md); [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md).

Should be taxed - Our word "tax" means to levy and raise money for the
use of the government. This is not the meaning of the original word
here. It means rather to "enroll," or take a "list" of the citizens,
with their employments, the amount of their property, etc., equivalent
to what was meant by census. Judea was at that time tributary to Rome.
It paid taxes to the Roman emperor; and, though Herod was "king," yet he
held his appointment under the Roman emperor, and was subject in most
matters to him. Farther, as this "enrollment" was merely to ascertain
the numbers and property of the Jews, it is probable that they were very
willing to be enrolled in this manner; and hence we hear that they went
willingly, without tumult - contrary to the common way when they were
"to be taxed."

[Luke 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 2:2</span></span>

And this taxing was first made ... - This verse has given as much
perplexity, perhaps, as any one in the New Testament. The difficulty
consists in the fact that "Cyrenius," or "Quirinius," was not governor
of Syria until 12 or 15 years after the birth of Jesus. Jesus was born
during the reign of Herod. At that time "Varus" was president of Syria.
Herod was succeeded by "Archelaus," who reigned eight or nine years; and
after he was removed, Judea was annexed to the province of Syria, and
Cyrenius was sent as the governor (Josephus, "Ant.," b. xvii. 5). The
difficulty has been to reconcile this account with that in Luke. Various
attempts have been made to do this. The one that seems most satisfactory
is that proposed by Dr. Lardner. According to his view, the passage here
means, "This was the "first" census of Cyrenius, governor of Syria." It
is called the "first" to distinguish it from one "afterward" taken by
Cyrenius, [Act 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md). It is said to be
the census taken by "Cyrenius; governor of Syria; "not that he was
"then" governor, but that it was taken by him who was afterward
familiarly known as governor. "Cyrenius, governor of Syria," was the
name by which the man was known when Luke wrote his gospel, and it was
not improper to say that the taxing was made by Cyrenius, the governor
of Syria," though he might not have been actually governor for many
years afterward. Thus, Herodian says that to Marcus "the emperor" were
born several daughters and two sons," though several of those children
were born to him "before" he was emperor. Thus, it is not improper to
say that General Washington saved Braddock's army, or was engaged in the
old French war, though he was not actually made "general" until many
years afterward. According to this Augustus sent Cyrenius, an active,
enterprising man, to take the census. At that time he was a Roman
senator. Afterward, he was made governor of the same country, and
received the title which Luke gives him.

Syria - The region of country north of Palestine, and lying between the
Mediterranean and the Euphrates. "Syria," called in the Hebrew "Aram,"
from a son of Shem [Gen 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md), in its
largest acceptation extended from the Mediterranean and the river Cydnus
to the Euphrates, and from Mount Taurus on the north to Arabia and the
border of Egypt on the south. It was divided into "Syria Palestina,"
including Canaan and Phoenicia; "Coele-Syria," the tract of country
lying between two ridges of Mount Lebanon and Upper Syria. The last was
known as "Syria" in the restricted sense, or as the term was commonly
used.

The leading features in the physical aspect of Syria consist of the
great mountainous chains of Lebanon, or Libanus and Anti-Libanus,
extending from north to south, and the great desert lying on the
southeast and east. The valleys are of great fertility, and yield
abundance of grain, vines, mulberries, tobacco, olives, excellent
fruits, as oranges, figs, pistachios, etc. The climate in the inhabited
parts is exceedingly fine. Syria is inhabited by various descriptions of
people, but Turks and Greeks form the basis of the population in the
cities. The only tribes that can be considered as unique to Syria are
the tenants of the heights of Lebanon. The most remarkable of these are
the Druses and Maronites. The general language is Arabic; the soldiers
and officers of government speak Turkish. Of the old Syriac language no
traces now exist.

[Luke 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 2:4</span></span>

The city of David - Bethlehem, called the city of David because it was
the place of his birth. See the notes at [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md).

Because he was of the house - Of the family.

And lineage - The "lineage" denotes that he was descended from David as
his father or ancestor. In taking a Jewish census, families were kept
distinct; hence, all went to the "place" where their family had resided.
Joseph was of the "family" of David, and hence he went up to the city of
David. It is not improbable that he might also have had a small paternal
estate in Bethlehem that rendered his presence there more desirable.

[Luke 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 2:7</span></span>

Her first-born son - Whether Mary had any other children or not has been
a matter of controversy. The obvious meaning of the Bible is that she
had; and if this be the case, the word "firstborn" is here to be taken
in its common signification.

Swaddling clothes - When a child among the Hebrews was born, it was
washed in water, rubbed in salt, and then wrapped in swaddling clothes;
that is, not garments regularly made, as with us, but bands or blankets
that confined the limbs closely, [Eze
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md). There was nothing special in the
manner in which the infant Jesus was treated.

Laid him in a manger - The word rendered "inn" in this verse means
simply a place of halting, a lodging-place; in modern terms, a khan or
caravanserai (Robinson's "Biblical Research in Palestine," iii. 431).
The word rendered "manger" means simply a crib or place where cattle
were fed. "Inns," in our sense of the term, were anciently unknown in
the East, and now they are not common. Hospitality was generally
practiced, so that a traveler had little difficulty in obtaining shelter
and food when necessary. As traveling became more frequent, however,
khans or caravanserais were erected for public use - large structures
where the traveler might freely repair and find lodging for himself and
his beast, he himself providing food and forage. Many such khans were
placed at regular intervals in Persia. To such a place it was, though
already crowded, that Joseph and Mary resorted at Bethlehem. Instead of
finding a place in the "inn," or the part of the caravanserai where the
travelers themselves found a place of repose, they were obliged to be
contented in one of the stalls or recesses appropriated to the beasts on
which they rode.

The following description of an Eastern inn or caravanserai, by Dr.
Kitto, will well illustrate this passage: "It presents an external
appearance which suggests to a European traveler the idea of a fortress,
being an extensive square pile of strong and lofty walls, mostly of
brick upon a basement of stone, with a grand archway entrance. This
leads ...to a large open area, with a well in the middle, and surrounded
on three or four sides with a kind of piazza raised upon a platform 3 or
4 feet high, in the wall behind which are small doors leading to the
cells or oblong chambers which form the lodgings. The cell, with the
space on the platform in front of it, forms the domain of each
individual traveler, where he is completely secluded, as the apparent
piazza is not open, but is composed of the front arches of each
compartment. There is, however, in the center of one or more of the
sides a large arched hall quite open in front ... The cells are
completely unfurnished, and have generally no light but from the door,
and the traveler is generally seen in the recess in front of his
apartment except during the heat of the day ... Many of these
caravanserais have no stables, the cattle of the travelers being
accommodated in the open area; but in the more complete establishments
...there are ...spacious stables, formed of covered avenues extending
between the back wall of the lodging apartments and the outer wall of
the whole building, the entrance being at one or more of the corners of
the inner quadrangle.

The stable is on the same level with the court, and thus below the level
of the tenements which stand on the raised platform. Nevertheless, this
platform is allowed to project behind into the stable, so as to form a
bench ... It also often happens that not only this bench exists in the
stable, forming a more or less narrow platform along its extent, but
also recesses corresponding to these "in front" of the cells toward the
open area, and formed, in fact, by the side-walls of these cells being
allowed to project behind to the boundary of the platform. These, though
small and shallow, form convenient retreats for servants and muleteers
in bad weather ... Such a recess we conceive that Joseph and Mary
occupied, with their ass or mule - if they had one, as they perhaps had
tethered - in front ... It might be rendered quite private by a cloth
being stretched across the lower part."

It may be remarked that the fact that Joseph and Mary were in that
place, and under a necessity of taking up their lodgings there, was in
itself no proof of poverty; it was a simple matter of necessity there
was "no room" at the inn. Yet it is worthy of our consideration that
Jesus was born "poor." He did not inherit a princely estate. He was not
cradled, as many are, in a palace. He had no rich friends. He had
virtuous, pious parents, of more value to a child than many riches. And
in this we are shown that it is no dishonor to be poor. Happy is that
child who, whether his parents be rich or poor, has a pious father and
mother. It is no matter if he has not as much wealth, as fine clothes,
or as splendid a house as another. It is enough for him to be as "Jesus"
was, and God will bless him.

No room at the inn - Many people assembled to be enrolled, and the
tavern was filled before Joseph and Mary arrived.

[Luke 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 2:8</span></span>

The same country - Round about Bethlehem.

Shepherds - Men who tended flocks of sheep.

Abiding in the field - Remaining out of doors, under the open sky, with
their flocks. This was commonly done. The climate was mild, and, to keep
their flocks from straying, they spent the night with them. It is also a
fact that the Jews sent out their flocks into the mountainous and desert
regions during the summer months, and took them up in the latter part of
October or the first of November, when the cold weather commenced. While
away in these deserts and mountainous regions, it was proper that there
should be someone to attend them to keep them from straying, and from
the ravages of wolves and other wild beasts. It is probable from this
that our Saviour was born before the 25th of December, or before what we
call "Christmas." At that time it is cold, and especially in the high
and mountainous regions about Bethlehem. But the exact time of his birth
is unknown; there is no way to ascertain it. By different learned men it
has been fixed at each month in the year. Nor is it of consequence to
"know" the time; if it were, God would have preserved the record of it.
Matters of moment are clearly revealed; those which "he" regards as of
no importance are concealed.

Keeping watch ... - More literally, "tending their flocks "by turns"
through the night watches."

[Luke 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 2:9</span></span>

The glory of the Lord - This is the same as a "great" glory - that is, a
splendid appearance or "light." The word "glory" is often the same as
light, [Co1 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041.md); [Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md); [Act
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011.md). The words "Lord" and "God" are
often used to denote "greatness" or "intensity." Thus, "trees of God"
mean great trees; "hills of God," high or lofty hills, etc. So "the
glory of the Lord" here means an exceedingly great or bright luminous
appearance perhaps not unlike what Paul saw on the way to Damascus.

[Luke 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 2:12</span></span>

This shall be a sign ... - The evidence by which you shall know the
child is that you will find him wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying
in a manger.

[Luke 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 2:14</span></span>

Glory to God - Praise be to God, or honor be to God. That is, the praise
of redeeming man is due to God. The plan of redemption will bring glory
to God, and is designed to express his glory. This it does by evincing
his love to people, his mercy, his condescension, and his regard to the
honor of his law and the stability of his own government. It is the
highest expression of his love and mercy. Nowhere, so far as we can see,
could his glory be more strikingly exhibited than in giving his
only-begotten Son to die for people.

In the highest - This is capable of several meanings:

1\. In the highest "strains," or in the highest possible manner.

2\. "Among" the highest that is, among the angels of God; indicating
that "they" felt a deep interest in this work, and were called on to
praise God for the redemption of man.

3\. In the highest heavens - indicating that the praise of redemption
should not be confined to the "earth," but should spread throughout the
universe.

4\. The words "God in the highest" may be equivalent to "the Most High
God," and be the same as saying, "Let the most high God be praised for
his love and mercy to people."

Which of these meanings is the true one it is difficult to determine;
but in this they all agree, that high praise is to be given to God for
his love in redeeming people. O that not only "angels," but "men," would
join universally in this song of praise!

On earth peace - That is, the gospel will bring peace. The Saviour was
predicted as the Prince of peace, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). The world is at war with God;
sinners are at enmity against their Maker and against each other. There
is no peace to the wicked. But Jesus came to make peace; and this he
did,

1\. By reconciling the world to God by His atonement.

2\. By bringing the sinner to a state of peace with his Maker; inducing
him to lay down the weapons of rebellion and to submit his soul to God,
thus giving him the peace which passeth all understanding.

3\. By diffusing in the heart universal good-will to people -
"disposing," people to lay aside their differences, to love one another,
to seek each other's welfare, and to banish envy, malice, pride, lust,
passion, and covetousness - in all ages the most fruitful causes of
difference among people. And,

4\. By diffusing the principles of universal peace among nations. If the
gospel of Jesus should universally prevail, there would be an end of
war. In the days of the millennium there will be universal peace; all
the causes of war will have ceased; people will love each other and do
justly; all nations will be brought under the influence of the gospel. O
how should each one toil and pray that the great object of the gospel
should be universally accomplished, and the world be filled with peace!

Good will toward men - The gift of the Saviour is an expression of
good-will or love to people, and therefore God is to be praised. The
work of redemption is uniformly represented as the fruit of the love of
God, [Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md). No words can express the
greatness of that love. It can only be measured by the "misery,
helplessness," and "danger" of man; by the extent of his sufferings here
and in the world of woe if he had not been saved; by the condescension,
sufferings, and death of Jesus; and by the eternal honor and happiness
to which he will raise his people. All these are beyond our full
comprehension. Yet how little does man feel it! and how many turn away
from the highest love of God, and treat the expression of that love with
contempt! Surely, if God so loved us "first," we ought also to love him,
[Jo1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019.md).

[Luke 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 2:15</span></span>

Unto Bethlehem - The city of David, where the angel had told them they
would find the Saviour. These shepherds appear to have been pious
people. They were waiting for the coming of the Messiah. On the first
intimation that he had actually appeared they went with haste to find
him. So all people should without delay seek the Saviour. When told of
him by the servants of God, they should, like these shepherds, forsake
all, and give no rest to their eyes until they have found him. We may
"always" find him. We need not travel to Bethlehem. We have only to cast
our eyes to heaven; to look to him and to believe on him, and we shall
find him ever near to us, and forever our Saviour and friend.

[Luke 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 2:17</span></span>

When they had see it - When they had satisfied themselves of the truth
of the coming of the Messiah, and had ascertained that they could not
have been mistaken in the appearance of the angels. There was evidence
enough to satisfy "them" that what the angels said was true, or they
would not have gone to Bethlehem. Having seen the child themselves, they
had now evidence that would satisfy others; and accordingly they became
the first preachers of the "gospel," and went and proclaimed to others
that the Messiah had come. One of the first duties of those who are
newly converted to God, and a duty in which they delight, is to proclaim
to others what they have seen and felt. It should be done in a proper
way and at the proper time; but nothing can or should prevent a
Christian recently converted from telling his feelings and views to
others - to his friends, to his parents, to his brothers, and to his old
companions. And it may be remarked that often more good may be done then
than during any other period of their life. Entreaties then make an
impression; nor can a sinner well resist the appeals made to him by one
who was just now with him in the way to ruin, but who now treads the way
to heaven.

[Luke 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 2:19</span></span>

Mary kept all these things - All that happened, and all that was said
respecting her child. She "remembered" what the angel had said to "her;"
what had happened to Elizabeth and to the shepherds - all the
extraordinary circumstances which had attended. the birth of her son.
Here is a delicate and beautiful expression of the feelings of a mother.
A "mother" forgets none of those things which occur respecting her
children. Everything they do or suffer - everything that is said of
them, is treasured up in her mind; and often she thinks of those things,
and anxiously seeks what they may indicate respecting the future
character and welfare of her child.

Pondered - Weighed. This is the original meaning of the word "weighed."
She kept them; she revolved them; she "weighed" them in her mind, giving
to each circumstance its just importance, and anxiously seeking what it
might indicate respecting her child.

In her heart - In her mind. She "thought" of these things often and
anxiously.

[Luke 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 2:20</span></span>

The shepherds returned - To their flocks.

Glorifying ... - Giving honor to God, and celebrating his praises.

[Luke 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 2:21</span></span>

Eight days ... - This was the regular time for performing the rite of
circumcision, [Gen 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md).

Called Jesus - See the notes at [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

[Luke 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 2:22</span></span>

Days of her purification - Among the Hebrews a mother was required to
remain at home for about forty days after the birth of a male child and
about eighty for a female, and during that time she was reckoned as
impure - that is, she was not permitted to go to the temple or to engage
in religious services with the congregation, [Lev
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md).

To Jerusalem - The place where the temple was, and where the ordinances
of religion were celebrated.

To present him to the Lord - Every first-born male child among the Jews
was regarded as "holy" to the Lord, [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md). By their being ""holy unto the
Lord" was meant that unto them belonged the office of "priests." It was
theirs to be set apart to the service of God - to offer sacrifice, and
to perform the duties of religion. It is probable that at first the
duties of religion devolved on the "father," and that, when he became
infirm or died, that duty devolved on the eldest son; and it is still
manifestly proper that where the father is infirm or has deceased, the
duty of conducting family worship should be performed by the eldest son.
Afterward, God chose "the tribe of Levi in the place" of the eldest
sons, to serve him in the sanctuary, [Num
8:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#013.md). Yet still it was proper to
present the child to God, and it was required that it should be done
with an offering.

[Luke 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 2:23</span></span>

As it is written ... - [Exo 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md).

[Luke 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 2:24</span></span>

And to offer a sacrifice ... - Those who were able on such an occasion
were required to offer a lamb for a burnt-offering, and a pigeon or a
turtle-dove for a sin-offering. If not able to bring a "lamb," then they
were permitted to bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, [Lev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md), [Lev
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008.md).

Turtle-doves - Doves distinguished for having a plaintive and tender
voice. By Mary's making this offering she showed her poverty; and our
Saviour, by coming in a state of poverty, has shown that it is not
dishonorable to be poor. No station is dishonorable where "God" places
us. He knows what is best for us, and he often makes a state of poverty
an occasion of the highest blessings. If "with" poverty he grants us, as
is often the case, peace, contentment, and religion, it is worth far
more than all the jewels of Golconda or the gold of Mexico. If it be
asked why, since the Saviour was pure from any moral defilement in his
conception and birth, it was necessary to offer such a sacrifice: why
was it necessary that he should be circumcised, since he had no sin, it
may be answered:

1\. That it was proper to fulfil all righteousness, and to show
obedience to the law, [Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md).

2\. It was necessary for the future usefulness of Christ. Unless he had
been circumcised, he could not have been admitted to any synagogue or to
the temple. He would have had no access to the people, and could not
have been regarded as the Messiah.

Both he and Mary, therefore, yielded obedience to the laws of the land,
and thus set us an example that we should walk in their steps. Compare
the notes at [Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md).

[Luke 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 2:25</span></span>

Whose name was Simeon - Some have supposed that this Simeon was a son of
the famous "Hillel," a distinguished teacher in Jerusalem, and president
of the Sanhedrin; but nothing is certainly known of him but what is here
related. He was an aged man, of distinguished piety and reputation, and
was anxiously expecting the coming of the Messiah. Such an "old age" is
especially honorable. No spectacle is more sublime than an old man of
piety and high character looking for the appearing of the Lord, and
patiently waiting for the time to come when he may be blessed with the
sight of his Redeemer.

Just - Righteous before God and man; approved by God as a righteous man,
and discharging faithfully his duty to man.

Devout - This word means "a religious man," or a "pious" man. The
original expresses the idea of "good reputation, well received," or of
high standing among the people.

Waiting for the consolation of Israel - That is, waiting for the
"Messiah," who is called "the consolation of Israel" because he would
give comfort to them by his appearing. This term was often applied to
the Messiah before he actually appeared. It was common to swear, also,
by "the consolation of Israel" - that is, by the Messiah about to come.
See Lightfoot on this place.

The Holy Ghost ... - He was a holy man, and was "divinely inspired"
respecting the Messiah about to appear.

[Luke 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 2:26</span></span>

And it was revealed unto him - In what way this was done we are not
informed. Sometimes a revelation was made by a dream, at others by a
voice, and at others by silent suggestion. All we know of this is that
it was by the Holy Spirit.

Not see death - Should not die. To "see" death and to "taste" of death,
was a common way among the Hebrews of expressing death itself. Compare
[Psa 89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048.md).

The Lord's Christ - Rather "the Lord's Anointed." The word "Christ"
means "anointed," and it would have been better to use that word here.
To an aged man who had been long waiting for the Messiah, how grateful
must have been this revelation - this solemn assurance that the Messiah
was near! But this revelation is now given to every man, that he need
not taste of death until, by the eye of faith, he may see the Christ of
God. He is offered freely. He has come. He waits to manifest himself to
the world, and he is not willing that any should die forever. To us also
it will be as great a privilege in our dying hours to have seen Christ
by faith as it was to Simeon. It will be the only thing that can support
us then - the only thing that will enable us to depart in peace.

[Luke 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 2:27</span></span>

By the Spirit - By the direction of the Spirit.

Into the temple - Into that part of the temple where the public worship
was chiefly performed - into the court of the women. See the notes at
[Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md).

The custom of the law - That is, to make an offering for purification,
and to present him to God.

[Luke 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 2:28</span></span>

Blessed God - Thanked or praised God.

[Luke 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 2:29</span></span>

Now lettest - Now thou "dost" let or permit. This word is in the
indicative mood, and signifies that God was permitting him to die in
peace, by having relieved his anxieties, allayed his fears, fulfilled
the promises, and having by the appearing of the Messiah, removed every
reason why he should live any longer, and every wish to live.

Depart - Die.

According to thy word - Thy promise made by revelation. God never
disappoints. To many it might have appeared improbable, when such a
promise was made to an old man, that it should be fulfilled. But God
fulfils all his word, keeps all his promises, and never disappoints
those who trust in him.

[Luke 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 2:30</span></span>

Thy salvation - Him who is to procure salvation for his people; or, the
Saviour.

[Luke 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 2:31</span></span>

Before the face of all people - Whom thou hast provided for all people,
or whom thou dost design to "reveal" to all people.

[Luke 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 2:32</span></span>

A light to lighten the Gentiles - This is in accordance with the
prophecies in the Old Testament, Isa. 49; [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). The Gentiles are represented as
sitting in darkness that is, in ignorance and sin. Christ is a "light"
to them, as by him they will be made acquainted with the character of
the true God, his law, and the plan of redemption. As the darkness rolls
away when the sun arises, so ignorance and error flee away when Jesus
gives light to the mind. Nations shall come to his light, and kings to
the brightness of his rising, [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md).

And the glory ... - The first offer of salvation was made to the Jews,
[Joh 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md); [Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md). Jesus was born among the Jews;
to them had been given the prophecies respecting him, and his first
ministry was among them. Hence, he was their glory, their honor, their
light. But it is a subject of special gratitude to us that the Saviour
was given also for the Gentiles; for:

1\. We are Gentiles, and if he had not come we should have been shut out
from the blessings of redemption.

2\. It is he only that now.

"Can make our dying bed.

Feel soft as downy pillows are,

While on his breast we lean our head,

And breathe our life out sweetly there."

Thus our departure may be like that of Simeon. Thus we may die in peace.
Thus it will be a blessing to die. But,

3\. In order to do this, our life must be like that of Simeon. We must
wait for the consolation of Israel. We must look for his coming. We must
be holy, harmless, undefiled, "loving" the Saviour. Then death to us,
like death to Simeon, will have no terror; we shall depart in peace, and
in heaven see the salvation of God, [Pe2
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md). But,

4\. Children, as well as the hoary-headed Simeon, may look for the
coming of Christ. They too must die; and "their" death will be happy
only as they depend on the Lord Jesus, and are prepared to meet him.

[Luke 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 2:34</span></span>

Simeon blessed them - Joseph and Mary. On them he sought the blessing of
God.

Is set - Is appointed or constituted for that, or such will be the
effect of his coming.

The fall - The word "fall" here denotes "misery, suffering,
disappointment," or "ruin." There is a plain reference to the passage
where it is said that he should be "a stone of stumbling and a rock of
offence," [Isa 8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md). Many expected
a temporal prince, and in this they were disappointed. They loved
darkness rather than light, and rejected him, and fell unto destruction.
Many that were proud were brought low by his preaching. They fell from
the vain and giddy height of their own self-righteousness, and were
humbled before God, and then, through him, rose again to a better
righteousness and to better hopes. The nation also rejected him and put
him to death, and, as a judgment, "fell" into the hands of the Romans.
Thousands were led into captivity, and thousands perished. The nation
rushed into ruin, the temple was destroyed, and the people were
scattered into all the nations. See [Rom
9:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md); [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008.md); [Co1
1:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md).

And rising again - The word "again" is not expressed in the Greek. It
seems to be supposed, in our translation, that the "same persons would
fall and rise again; but this is not the meaning of the passage. It
denotes that many would be ruined by his coming, and that many "others"
would be made happy or be saved. Many of the poor and humble, that were
willing to receive him, would obtain pardon of sin and peace - would
"rise" from their sins and sorrows here, and finally ascend to eternal
life.

And for a sign ... - The word "sign" here denotes a conspicuous or
distinguished object, and the Lord Jesus was such an object of contempt
and rejection by all the people. He was despised, and his religion has
been the common "mark" or "sign" for all the wicked, the profligate, and
the profane, to curse, and ridicule, and oppose. Compare [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md), and [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md). Never was a prophecy more
exactly fulfilled than this. Thousands have rejected the gospel and
fallen into ruin; thousands are still falling of those who are ashamed
of Jesus; thousands blaspheme him, deny him, speak all manner of evil
against him, and would crucify him again if he were in their hands; but
thousands also "by" him are renewed, justified, and raised up to life
and peace.

[Luke 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 2:35</span></span>

Yea, a sword ... - The sufferings and death of thy Son shall deeply
afflict thy soul. And if Mary had not been thus forewarned and sustained
by strong faith, she could not have borne the trials which came upon her
Son; but God prepared her for it, and the holy mother of the dying
Saviour was sustained.

That the thoughts ... - This is connected with the preceding verse: "He
shall be a sign, a conspicuous object to be spoken against, that the
thoughts of many hearts may be made manifest - that is, that they "might
show" how much they hated holiness. Nothing so "brings out" the feelings
of sinners as to tell them of Jesus Christ. Many treat him with silent
contempt; many are ready to gnash their teeth; many curse him; all show
how much by nature the heart is opposed to religion, and thus are
really, in spite of themselves, fulfilling the scriptures and the
prophecies. So true it that "none can say that Jesus is Lord but by the
Holy Ghost," [Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md).

[Luke 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 2:36</span></span>

Of the tribe of Aser - The tribe of Aser, or Asher, dwelt in the
northern part of the land of Canaan. Why Anna was called a prophetess is
not known. It might be because she had been the wife of a prophet, or
because she was employed in celebrating the praises of God (compare [Ch1
25:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md), [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md); [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005).md), or because she herself had
foretold future events, being inspired.

[Luke 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 2:37</span></span>

And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years - That is, she was
about 84 years of age. It does not mean that she had been a widow for
that long time.

Fastings and prayers - Constant religious service. pending her time in
prayer, and in all the ordinances of religion.

Night and day - Continually - that is, at the usual times of public
worship and in private. When it is said that she departed not from the
temple, it is meant that she was "constant" and "regular" in all the
public services at the temple, or was never absent from those services.
God blesses those who wait at his temple gates.

[Luke 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 2:39</span></span>

They returned into Galilee - Not immediately, but after a time. Luke has
omitted the flight into Egypt recorded by Matthew; but he has not denied
it, nor are his words to be pressed as if he meant to affirm that they
went immediately to Nazareth. A parallel case we have in the life of
Paul. When he was converted it is said that he came to Jerusalem, as if
he had gone there immediately after his conversion [Act
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md); yet we learn in another place
that this was after an interval of three years, [Gal
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md). In the case before us there
is no improbability in supposing that they returned to Bethlehem, then
went to Egypt, and then to Galilee.

[Luke 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 2:40</span></span>

Strong in spirit - In mind, intellect, understanding. Jesus had a human
soul, and that soul was subject to all the proper laws of a human
spirit. It therefore increased in knowledge, strength, and character.
Nor is it any more inconsistent with his being God to say that his soul
expanded, than to say that his body grew.

Filled with wisdom - Eminent for wisdom when a child - that is,
exhibiting an extraordinary understanding, and "wise" to flee from
everything sinful and evil.

And the grace of God ... - The word "grace" in the New Testament
commonly means unmerited favor shown "to sinners." Here it means no more
than favor. God showed him favor, or was pleased with him and blessed
him.

It is remarkable that this is all that is recorded of the infancy of
Jesus; and this, with the short account that follows of his going to
Jerusalem, is all that we know of him for thirty years of his life. The
design of the evangelists was to give an account of his "public
ministry," and not his private life. Hence, they say little of him in
regard to his first years. What they do say, however, corresponds
entirely with what we might expect. He was wise, pure, pleasing God, and
deeply skilled in the knowledge of the divine law. He set a lovely
example for all children; was subject to his parents, and increased in
favor with God and man.

[Luke 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 2:42</span></span>

Twelve years old - All males among the Hebrews were required to appear
three times a year before God, to attend on the ordinances of religion
in the temple, and it is probable that this was the age at which they
first went up to Jerusalem, [Exo
23:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014.md); [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md).

To Jerusalem - Where the feasts of the Jews were all held. This was a
journey from Nazareth of about 70 miles.

After the custom of the feast - According to the usual manner of the
feast.

[Luke 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 2:43</span></span>

Had fulfilled the days - The days of the Passover. These were eight days
in all - one day for killing the paschal lamb, and seven days for the
observance of the feast of unleavened bread, [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md); [Lev
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005.md).

[Luke 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 2:44</span></span>

Supposing him to have been in the company - It may seem very remarkable
that parents should not have been more attentive to their only son, and
that they should not have been assured of his presence with them when
they left Jerusalem; but the difficulty may be explained by the
following considerations:

1\. In going to these great feasts, families and neighbors would join
together, and form a large collection.

2\. It is not improbable that Jesus was "with" them when they were about
to start from Jerusalem and were making preparations. Seeing him then,
they might have been certain as to his presence.

3\. A part of the company might have left before the others, and Joseph
and Mary may have supposed that he was with them, until they overtook
them at night and ascertained their mistake.

Kinsfolk - Relatives.

Acquaintances - Neighbors who had gone up with them in the same company
to Jerusalem.

[Luke 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 2:46</span></span>

After three days - This means, probably, "on the third day" after they
had left Jerusalem - that is, the first day they went toward Galilee, on
the second they returned to Jerusalem, and on the third they found him.
Compare [Mat 27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063.md); [Mar
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031.md).

In the temple - In the "court" of the temple, for Jesus, not being a
Levitical priest, could not enter into the temple itself. See [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md).

In the midst of the doctors - The "teachers," the "rabbis," who were the
instructors of the people in matters of religion.

Asking them questions - Proposing questions to them respecting the law
and the prophets. There is no reason to suppose that this was for the
purpose of perplexing or confounding them. The questions were doubtless
proposed in a respectful manner, and the answers listened to with proper
deference to their age and rank. Jesus was a child, and religion does
not teach a child to be rude or uncivil, even though he may really know
much more than more aged persons. Religion teaches all, and especially
the young, to treat others with respect, to show them the honor that is
due, to venerate age, and to speak kindly to all, [Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017.md); [Pe1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md), [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009.md); [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md); [Mat
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md); [Rom
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md).

[Luke 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 2:48</span></span>

Why hast thou thus dealt with us? - Why hast thou given us all this
trouble and anxiety, in going so far and returning with so much
solicitude?

Thy father - Joseph was not the "real" father of Jesus, but he was
"legally" so; and as the secret of his birth was not commonly known, he
was called his father. Mary, in accordance with that usage, also called
him so.

Sorrowing - Anxious, lest in the multitude he might not be found, or
lest some accident might have happened to him.

[Luke 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 2:49</span></span>

How is it ... - "Why" have ye sought me with so much anxiety? "Mary"
should have known that the Son of God was safe; that his heavenly Father
would take care of him, and that he could do nothing amiss.

Wist ye not - "Know ye not." You had reason to know. You knew my design
in coming into the world, and that design was "superior" to the duty of
obeying earthly parents, and they should be willing always to give me up
to the proper business for which I live.

My Father's business - Some think that this should be translated "in my
Father's house" - that is, in the temple. Jesus reminded them here that
he came down from heaven; that he had a higher Father than an earthly
parent; and that, even in early life, it was proper that he should be
engaged in the work for which he came. He did not enter, indeed, upon
his public work for eighteen years after this; yet still the work of God
was "his" work, and always, even in childhood, it was proper for him to
be engaged in the great business for which he came down from heaven.

[Luke 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 2:50</span></span>

They understood not ... - It is remarkable that they did not understand
Jesus in this, but it shows how slow persons are to believe. Even his
parents, after all that had taken place, did not seem to comprehend that
"he" was to be the Saviour of people, or if they did, they understood it
in a very imperfect manner.

[Luke 2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 2:51</span></span>

Went down with them - Down from Jerusalem, which was in a high,
mountainous region.

Was subject unto them - Performed the duty of a faithful and obedient
child, and not improbably was engaged in the trade of Joseph - that of a
carpenter. Every Jew was required to learn some trade, and there is
every reason to think that our Saviour followed that of his reputed
father. And from this we learn:

1\. That obedience to parents is a duty. Jesus has set an example in
this that all children should follow. Though he was the Son of God, and
on proper occasions was engaged in the great work of redemption, yet he
was also the "son of Mary," and he loved and obeyed his mother, and was
"subject" to her.

2\. It is no dishonor to be a mechanic, or to be brought up in an
obscure employment. Jesus has conferred honor on virtuous industry, and
no man should be ashamed of industrious parents, though poor, or of a
condition of life that is far from ease and affluence. Industry is
honorable, and virtuous poverty should not be regarded as a matter of
reproach. The only thing to be ashamed of, in regard to this matter, is
when people are idle, or when children are too proud to hear or speak of
the occupation of their parents, or to follow the same occupation.

[Luke 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 2:52</span></span>

In favour with God - That is, in proportion to his advance in wisdom.
This does not imply that he ever lacked the favor of God, but that God
regarded him with favor in proportion as he showed an understanding and
spirit like his own. Happy are those children who imitate the example of
Jesus - who are obedient to parents who increase in wisdom - who are
sober, temperate, and industrious, and who thus increase in favor with
God and people.
