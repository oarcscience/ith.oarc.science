### [Numbers Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 14:5</span></span>

Already Caleb had endeavored to still the people before Moses [Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md); already Moses himself ([Deu
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029) ff.md) had endeavored to recall the
people to obedience. After the failure of these efforts Moses and Aaron
cast themselves down in solemn prayer before God (compare [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022).md); and the appearance of the
glory of the Lord in the "tabernacle of the congregation" [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md) was the immediate answer.

[Numbers 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 14:9</span></span>

Their defense - literally, "their shadow," i. e. their shelter as from
the scorching sun: an Oriental figure. Compare the marginal references.

[Numbers 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 14:12</span></span>

And disinherit them - By the proposed extinction of Israel the blessings
of the covenant would revert to their original donor.

[Numbers 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 14:13</span></span>

The syntax of these verses is singularly broken. As did Paul when deeply
moved, so Moses presses his arguments one on the other without pausing
to ascertain the grammatical finish of his expressions. He speaks here
as if in momentary apprehension of an outbreak of God's wrath, unless he
could perhaps arrest it by crowding in every topic of deprecation and
intercession that he could mention on the instant.

[Numbers 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 14:21</span></span>

Render: But as truly as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled
with the glory of the Lord; [Num 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md)
all those men, etc.; [Num 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023.md) shall
not see, etc.

[Num 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022.md)

These ten times - Ten is the number which imports completeness. Compare
[Gen 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md). The sense is that the
measure of their provocation was now full: the day of grace was at last
over. However, some enumerate 10 different occasions on which the people
had tempted God since the exodus.

Ps. 90, which is entitled "a Prayer of Moses," has been most
appropriately regarded as a kind of dirge upon those sentenced thus
awfully by God to waste away in the wilderness.

[Numbers 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 14:24</span></span>

My servant Caleb - Caleb only is mentioned here as also in [Num
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#030.md) ff. Both passages probably form
part of the matter introduced at a later period into the narrative of
Moses, and either by Joshua or under his superintendence. Hence, the
name of Joshua is omitted, and his faithfulness together with its reward
are taken for granted. In [Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030.md),
[Num 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#038.md), both names are mentioned
together; and these verses in all likelihood belong to the same original
composition as [Num 14:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006.md).

[Numbers 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 14:25</span></span>

Render: And now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling (or
abiding) in the valley: wherefore turn you, etc. (that so ye be not
smitten before them). The Amalekites were the nomad bands that roved
through the open pastures of the plain [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md) : the Canaanites, a term here
taken in its wider sense, were the Amorites of the neighboring cities
(compare [Num 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md) with [Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044).md), who probably lived in league
with the Amalekites.

Tomorrow - Not necessarily the next day, but an idiom for "hereafter,"
"henceforward" (compare the marginal reading in [Exo
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#014.md); [Jos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#006).md).

By the way of the Red sea - That is, apparently, by the eastern or
Elanitic gulf.

[Numbers 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 14:33</span></span>

Your whoredoms - Their several rebellions had been so many acts of
faithless departure from the Lord who had taken them unto Himself. And
as the children of the unchaste have generally to bear in their earthly
careers much of the disgrace and the misery which forms the natural
penalty of their parents' transgression; so here the children of the
Israelites, although suffered to hope for an eventual entry into Canaan,
were yet to endure, through many long years' wandering, the appropriate
punishment of their fathers' willfulness.

[Numbers 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 14:34</span></span>

My breach of promise - In the original, a word, found elsewhere only in
[Job 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010.md), and meaning "my
withdrawals" "my turning away." See the margin.

[Numbers 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">num 14:45</span></span>

Unto Hormah - literally, "the Hormah:" i. e. "the banning," or
"ban-place." Compare [Num 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003.md); [Jos
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014.md). According to the view taken of
Kadesh (see [Num 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026).md), Hormah is
identified, through its earlier name, Zephath [Jdg
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md), with es-Safah on the
southeastern frontier of Canaan, by which the Israelites quitted the
Arabah for the higher ground, (or with Sebaita, which lies further to
the west, about 25 miles north of Ain Gadis).
