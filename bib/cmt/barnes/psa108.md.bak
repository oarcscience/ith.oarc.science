### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 108:0</span></span>

This psalm is ascribed to David, and there is no reason to doubt the
correctness of the title in this respect. The psalm is not an original
composition, but is made up, with slight alterations, of parts of two
other psalms, [Psa 57:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md); [Psa
60:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md).

When the psalm was so arranged, or why the parts of two former psalms
were thus brought together to form a new composition, it is impossible
now to determine. It "may" have been for a mere purpose of art; or it
may, more probably, have occurred when the two parts of psalms already
in use might be so combined as to be adapted to some new event. It may
have been, also, that what had been expressed "on two different
occasions" might now be fulfilled or accomplished "on some one
occasion," and that thoughts which had been expressed separately before
might now be unitedly uttered in praise. Rosenmuller supposes that the
psalm in its present form was arranged on the return from the captivity
at Babylon, and that the parts of the two separate psalms were found to
be suitable for a national song at that time, and were therefore thus
brought together. This supposition would have much probability if the
psalm were not ascribed to David; and perhaps this fact need not be an
insuperable objection - since, if the two psalms from which this is
compiled were the work of David, the author of the arrangement might
without impropriety attribute the composition itself to David.

There are some slight variations in the psalm, as here arranged, from
the original psalms; but why these were made cannot now be determined.
Substantially all that will be necessary in the exposition of the psalm
will be to notice these variations.

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

O God, my heart is fixed - Prepared, suited, ready. See the notes at
[Psa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md). In [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md), this is repeated: "My heart is
fixed; O God, my heart is fixed:" indicating that there "might" have
been some doubt or vacillation caused by the circumstances then
existing, and the repetition would have respect to that, as if the
psalmist had been unsettled and wavering for a time, but was at last
firm. In such circumstances it would not be unnatural to "repeat" the
assertion, as if there were no longer any doubt. In the beginning of a
psalm, however, where there had been no previous expression or feeling
of doubt so far as appears, there would be no propriety in repeating the
assertion.

I will sing and give praise - See the notes at [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007.md).

Even with my glory - This is not in [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md). It is literally here, "truly
my glory." In [Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md), however, the
expression, "Awake up, my glory," occurs, and this seems to correspond
with that language. It means here that it was his glory - his honor -
thus to be employed in giving praise to God. It was worthy of all that
there was elevated in his nature; of all that constituted his glory; of
his highest powers. At no time is man employed in a more noble and lofty
work than praise.

[Psalms 108:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 108:2</span></span>

Awake, psaltery and harp ... - This is copied without change from [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 108:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 108:3</span></span>

I will praise thee, O Lord ... - This is taken from [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009.md). The only change is the
substitution here of the name יהוה Yahweh for אדני 'Adonāy. Why that
change was made is unknown.

[Psalms 108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 108:4</span></span>

For thy mercy ... - This is taken from [Psa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010.md). The only change is in the
expression "above the heavens," instead of "unto the heavens." The sense
is essentially the same. The particular idea here, if it differs at all
from the expression in [Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md),
is, that the mercy of God seems to "descend" from heaven upon man, or
"comes down" from on high.

[Psalms 108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 108:5</span></span>

Be thou exalted ... - This is taken from [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md). The only change in the Hebrew
is in the insertion of the word "and," "and thy glory above all the
earth."

[Psalms 108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 108:6</span></span>

That thy beloved may be delivered - The word rendered "beloved," and the
verb rendered "may be delivered," are both in the plural number, showing
that it is not an individual that is referred to, but that the people of
God are intended. This is taken without any alteration from [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md). In that psalm the prayer for
deliverance is grounded on the afflictions of the people, and the fact
that God had given them "a banner that it might be displayed because of
the truth," - or, in the cause of truth. See the notes at that psalm. In
the psalm before us, while the prayer for deliverance is the same, the
reason for that prayer is different. It is that God is exalted; that his
mercy is above the heavens; that his glory is above all the earth, and
that he is thus exalted that he may interpose and save his people.

Save with thy right hand, and answer me - The Hebrew here is the same as
in [Psa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005.md), where it is rendered
"and hear me."

[Psalms 108:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 108:7</span></span>

God hath spoken ... - This is taken, without change, from [Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006.md). See the notes at that place.

[Psalms 108:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 108:8</span></span>

Gilead is mine ... - This is taken from [Psa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md). The only change is the omission
of the word and before "Manasseh."

[Psalms 108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 108:9</span></span>

Moab ... - This is fallen from [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008.md). The only change is in the close
of the verse. Instead of "Plilistia, triumph thou because of me" [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008.md), it is here, "Over Philistia will
I triumph." Why the change was made is unknown.

[Psalms 108:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 108:10</span></span>

Who will bring me ... - This is taken, without alteration, from [Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 108:11</span></span>

Wilt not thou, O God ... - This is taken from [Psa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010.md), with no change in the Hebrew,
except that the word "thou" (in the first member of the verse) is
omitted.

[Psalms 108:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 108:12</span></span>

Give us help from trouble ... - This is copied from [Psa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 108:13</span></span>

Through God we shall do ... - This also is taken from [Psa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012.md), without change.

Thus the psalm, though made up of parts of two separate psalms, is
complete and continuous in itself. There is no break or discrepancy in
the current of thought, but the unity is as perfect as though it had
been an original composition. It is to be remarked, also, that though in
the original psalms the parts which are used here have a different
connection, and are separately complete there, yet as employed here,
they seem to be exactly suited to the new use which is made of the
language; and though the original "reasons" for the use of the language
do not appear here, yet there is a sufficient reason for that language
apparent in the psalm as rearranged. To an Israelite, also, there might
be a new interest in the use of the language in the fact that words with
which he was familiar, as employed for other purposes, "could" be thus
combined, and made applicable to a new occasion in the national history.
