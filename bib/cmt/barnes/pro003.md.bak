### [Proverbs Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 3:2</span></span>

Three words carry on the chain of blessings:

\(1\) "Length of days" (see the [Psa
91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016) note.md);

\(2\) "Years of life," i. e., of a life worth living (compare [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md); [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008).md);

\(3\) "Peace," tranquility inward and outward, the serenity of life
continuing through old age until death. Compare [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md).

[Proverbs 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 3:3</span></span>

The two elements of a morally perfect character:

\(1\) "Mercy," shutting out all forms of selfishness and hate.

\(2\) "Truth," shutting out all deliberate falsehood, all hypocrisy,
conscious or unconscious.

The words that follow possibly refer to the Eastern custom of writing
sacred names on pieces of papyrus or parchment, and wearing them around
the neck, as charms and talismans against evil. Compare, however, [Pe1
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md).

[Proverbs 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 3:4</span></span>

Compare [Luk 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md). These are the two
conditions of true human growth.

[Proverbs 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 3:5</span></span>

In preaching "trust in God" the moralist anticipates the teaching that
man is justified by faith. To confide in God's will, the secret of all
true greatness, is to rise out of all our anxieties and plans and fears
when we think of ourselves as the arbiters of our own fortunes, and so
"lean to our own understanding."

[Proverbs 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 3:6</span></span>

Not in acts of solemn worship or great crises only, but "in all thy
ways;" and then God will make the "path" straight and even.

[Proverbs 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 3:7</span></span>

The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have
already attained it.

[Proverbs 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 3:8</span></span>

Navel - The central region of the body is taken as the representative of
all the vital organs. For "health" we should read healing, or, as in the
marg. There is probably a reference to the local applications used by
the surgery of the period as means of healing.

[Proverbs 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 3:9</span></span>

"Substance" points to capital, "increase" to revenue. The Septuagint as
if to guard against ill-gotten gains being offered as an atonement for
the ill-getting, inserts the quaifying words, "honor the Lord from thy
righteous labors."

[Proverbs 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 3:10</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. This fullness of outward blessings does
not exclude the thought of the "chastening" [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md), without which the discipline of
life would be incomplete. "Presses" are the vats of a Roman vineyard,
into which the wine flowed through pipe from the wine-press.

[Proverbs 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 3:11</span></span>

Despise ... be weary - The temper is not that of contempt. To struggle
impatiently, to fret and chafe, when suffering comes on us, is the
danger to which we are exposed when we do not accept it as from the
hands of God. Compare [Jon 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009.md); [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md).

[Proverbs 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 3:12</span></span>

The first distinct utterance of a truth which has been so full of
comfort to many thousands; it is the summing up of all controversies
(compare [Joh 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002).md) as to the mystery
of suffering. The apostle writing to the Hebrews can find no stronger
comfort [Heb 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md) than this; the
Church, in her visitation service, has no truer message for the
sufferer.

[Proverbs 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 3:13</span></span>

The first beatitude of the Proverbs introduces a new lesson. "Getteth
understanding," literally as in the margin, probably in the sense of
"drawing forth from God's store, from the experience of life" (as in
[Pro 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#035.md); [Pro
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022).md). The preciousness of wisdom is
dwelt on here, not the use to be made of it.

[Proverbs 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 3:14</span></span>

Compare [Pro 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#004.md). "Fine gold" is
apparently a technical word of that commerce, the native gold in the
nugget or the dust.

[Proverbs 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 3:15</span></span>

Rubies - The פנינים pânı̂ynı̂ym were among the costly articles of traffic,
and red or rose-colored [Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md). The
last fact has led some to identify them with coral, or (as in the King
James Version) with "rubies." Most commentators, however, have
identified them with pearls, which may connect this passage with [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md); [Mat
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#045.md). The words of the promise here
are almost the echo of [Kg1 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011.md).

[Proverbs 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 3:17</span></span>

"Ways" and "paths" describe the two kinds of roads, the "highway" and
the "byway." In both these he who was guided by Wisdom would walk
securely.

[Proverbs 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 3:18</span></span>

This and the other references in Proverbs [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md) are the only allusions in any
book of the Old Testament, after Genesis, to the "tree" itself, or to
its spiritual significance. Further, there is the tendency to a
half-allegorizing application of that history. "The tree of life" which
Adam was not to taste lies open to his children. Wisdom is the "tree of
life," giving a true immortality. The symbol entered largely into the
religious imagery. of Assyria, Egypt, and Persia. Philo, going a step
further, found in the two trees the ideal representatives of speculative
knowledge and moral wisdom; and the same image subserves a higher
purpose in the promises and the visions of [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md); [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md).

[Proverbs 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 3:19</span></span>

Hereto Wisdom has been thought of in relation to men. Now the question
comes, What is she in relation to God? and the answer is, that the
creative act implies a Divine Wisdom, through which the Divine will
acts. This thought, developed in Prov. 8, is the first link in the chain
which connects this "Wisdom" with the Divine Word, the Logos of John's
Gospel. Compare [Psa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md); [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md). The words of the writer of the
Proverbs take their place among the proofs of the dogmatic statements of
the Nicene Creed.

[Proverbs 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 3:20</span></span>

Compare [Gen 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md); [Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md); Job 38. Looking upon the face of
Nature, men see two storehouses of the living water, without which it
would be waste and barren. From the "depths" rush forth the surging
waves, from the "clouds" falls the gentle rain or "dew;" but both alike
are ordered by the Divine Wisdom.

[Proverbs 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 3:21</span></span>

Let not them depart - i. e., The wisdom and discretion of the following
clause. Keep thine eye on them, as one who watches over priceless
treasures.

[Proverbs 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 3:25</span></span>

Under the form of this strong prohibition there is an equally strong
promise. So safe will all thy ways be that to fear will be a sin.

[Proverbs 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 3:27</span></span>

A marked change in style. The continuous exhortation is replaced by a
series of maxims.

From them to whom it is due - literally, as in the margin. The precept
expresses the great Scriptural thought that the so-called possession of
wealth is but a stewardship; that the true owners of what we call our
own are those to whom, with it, we may do good. Not to relieve them is a
breach of trust.

[Pro 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#028.md)

Procrastination is especially fatal to the giving impulse. The
Septuagint adds the caution: "for thou knowest not what the morrow will
bring forth."

[Pro 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md)

Securely - i. e., "With full trust," without care or suspicion. Compare
[Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md), [Jdg
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027.md).

[Pro 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md)

A protest against the tendency to worship success, to think the lot of
the "man of violence" enviable, and therefore to be chosen.

[Pro 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md)

The true nature of such success. That which people admire is an
abomination to Yahweh. His "secret," i. e., His close, intimate
communion as of "friend with friend," is with the righteous.

[Pro 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#033.md)

The thought, like that which appears in [Zac
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md), and pervades the tragedies of
Greek drama, is of a curse, an Ate, dwelling in a house from generation
to generation, the source of ever-recurring woes. There is, possibly, a
contrast between the "house" or "palace" of the rich oppressor and the
lowly shepherd's hut, the "sheep-cote" [Sa2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md) ennobled only by its upright
inhabitants.

[Pro 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)

Surely - Better, If he scorneth the scorners, i. e., Divine scorn of
evil is the complement, and, as it were, the condition, of divine bounty
to the lowly (compare the marginal reference and the [Pro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026) note.md).

[Pro 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035.md)

The margin conveys the thought that "fools" glory in that which is
indeed their shame. Others take the clause as meaning "every fool takes
up shame," i. e., gains nothing but that.
