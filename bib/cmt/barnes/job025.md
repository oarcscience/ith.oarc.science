### [Job Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

[Job 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 25:2</span></span>

Dominion and fear are with him - That is, God has a right to rule, and
he ought to be regarded with reverence. The object of Bildad is to show
that He is so great and glorious that it is impossible that man should
be regarded as pure in his sight. He begins, therefore, by saying, that
he is a Sovereign; that he is clothed with majesty, and that he is
worthy of profound veneration.

He maketh peace in his high places - "High places," here refer to the
heavenly worlds. The idea is, that he preserves peace and concord among
the hosts of heaven. Numerous and mighty as are the armies of the skies,
yet he keeps them in order and in awe. The object is to present an image
of the majesty and power of that Being who thus controls a vast number
of minds. The phrase does not necessarily imply that there had been
variance or strife, and that then God had made peace, but that he
preserved or kept them in peace.

[Job 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 25:3</span></span>

Is there any number of his armies? - The armies of heaven; or the hosts
of angelic beings, which are often represented as arranged or marshalled
into armies; see the notes at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md). The word which is used here is
not the common one which is rendered "hosts," (צבא tsâbâ'), but is גדוּד
gedûd which means properly a troop, band, or army. It may here mean
either the constellations often represented as the army which God
marshals and commands, or it may mean the angels.

And upon whom doth not his light arise? - This is designed evidently to
show the majesty and glory of God. It refers probably to the light of
the sun, as the light which he creates and commands. The idea is, that
it pervades all things; that, as controlled by him, it penetrates all
places, and flows over all worlds. The image is a striking and sublime
one, and nothing is better fitted to show the majesty and glory of God.

[Job 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 25:4</span></span>

How then can man be justified with God? - see [Job
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md); [Job
15:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md). Instead of meeting the facts
to which Job had appealed, all that Bildad could now do was to repeat
what had been said before. It shows that he felt himself unable to
dispose of the argument, and yet that he was not willing to confess that
he was vanquished.

Or how can he be clean? - This sentiment had been expressed by Job
himself, [Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md). Perhaps Bildad
meant now to adopt it as undoubted truth, and to throw it back upon Job
as worthy of his special attention. It has no bearing on the arguments
which Job had advanced, and is utterly irrelevant except as Bildad
supposed that the course of argument maintained by Job implied that he
supposed himself to be pure.

[Job 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 25:5</span></span>

Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not - Or, behold even the moon
shineth not. That is, in comparison with God it is dark and obscure. The
idea is, that the most beautiful and glorious objects become dim and
fade away when compared with him. So Jerome renders it, Ecce luna etiam
non splendet. The word here rendered "shineth" (יאהיל ya'âhalı̂yl)
frequently means to pitch or remove a tent, and is a form of the word
אהל 'ôhel uniformly rendered tent or tabernacle. Some have supposed that
the meaning here is, that even the moon and the stars of heaven - the
bright canopy above - were not fit to furnish a tent or dwelling for
God. But the parallelism seems to demand the usual interpretation, as
meaning that the moon and stars faded away before God. The word אהל
'ôhel derives this meaning, according to Gesenius, from its relation to
the word הלל hâlal, to be clear or brilliant, from the mutual relation
of the פא and עע verbs. The Arabic has the same meaning.

Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight - That is, they are not bright
in comparison with him. The design is to show the glory of the Most High
and that nothing could be compared with him; see the notes at [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018.md).

[Job 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 25:6</span></span>

How much less man - See [Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md). Man
is mentioned here as a worm; in [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md) he is said to dwell in a house of
clay and to be crushed before the moth. In both cases the design is to
represent him as insignificant in comparison with God.

A worm - רמה rı̂mmâh; see [Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md). The
word is commonly applied to such worms as are bred in putridity, and
hence, the comparison is the more forcible.

And the son of man - Another mode of speaking of man. Any one of the
children of man is the same. No one of them can be compared with God;
compare the notes at [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

Which is a worm - תולעה tôlê‛âh; compare the notes at [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md). This word frequently denotes the
worm from which the scarlet or crimson color was obtained. It is,
however, used to denote the worm that is bred on putrid substances, and
is so used here; compare [Exo 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#020.md);
[Isa 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md). It is also applied to a worm
that destroys plants. [Jon 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007.md); [Deu
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md). Here it means, that man is
poor, feeble, powerless. In comparison with God he is a crawling worm.
All that is said in this chapter is true and beautiful, but it has
nothing to do with the subject in debate. Job had appealed to the course
of events in proof of the truth of his position. The true way to meet
that was either to deny that the facts existed as he alleged, or to show
that they did not prove what be had adduced them to establish. But
Bildad did neither; nor did he ingenuously confess that the argument was
against him and his friends. At this stage of the controversy, since
they had nothing to reply to what Job had alleged, it would have been
honorable in them to have acknowledged that they were in error, and to
have yielded the palm of victory to him. But it requires extraordinary
candor and humility to do that; and rather than do it, most people would
prefer to say something - though it has nothing to do with the case in
hand.
