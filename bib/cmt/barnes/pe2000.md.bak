Introduction to 2 Peter

Section 1. Genuineness and Authenticity of the Epistle

It is well known that at an early period of the Christian history there
were doubts respecting the canonical authority of the Second Epistle of
Peter. The sole ground of the doubt was, whether Peter was the author of
it. Eusebius, in the chapter of his ecclesiastical history where he
speaks of the New Testament in general, reckons it among the
αντιλεγομενα antilegomena, i. e. those books which were not universally
admitted to be genuine; literally, "those which were spoken against," b.
iii. chapter 25. This does not imply that even he, however, disbelieved
its genuineness, but merely that it was numbered among those about which
there had not always been complete certainty. Jerome says, "Peter wrote
two epistles, called 'catholic'; the second of which is denied by many
to be his, because of the difference of style from the former." Origen,
before him, had also said, "Peter, on whom the church is built, has left
one Epistle (universally) acknowledged. Let it be granted that he also
wrote a second. For it is doubted of." See Lardner, vol. vi., p. 255,
Ed. Lond. 1829. Both the Epistles of Peter, however, were received as
genuine in the fourth and following centuries by all Christians, except
the Syrians. The First Epistle was never doubted to have been the
production of Peter. In regard to the second, as remarked above, it was
doubted by some. The principal ground of the doubt, if not the entire
ground, was the difference of style between the two, especially in the
second chapter, and the fact that the old Syriac translator, though he
admitted the Epistle of James, which was also reckoned among the
"doubtful" epistles, did not-translate the Second Epistle of Peter. That
version was made, probably, at the close of the first century, or in the
second; and it is said that it is to be presumed that if this Epistle
had been then in existence, and had been regarded as genuine, it would
also have been translated by him.

It is of importance, therefore, to state briefly the evidence of the
genuineness and authenticity of this Epistle. In doing this, it is
proper to regard the "First" Epistle as undoubtedly genuine and
canonical, for that was never called in question. That being admitted,
the genuineness of this Epistle may be argued on the following grounds:

\(1\) It does not appear to have been "rejected" by any one. It was
merely "doubted" whether it was genuine. How far even this "doubt"
extended is not mentioned. It is referred to only by Jerome, Origen, and
Eusebius, though there is not the least evidence that even they had any
doubts of its genuineness. They merely state that there were some
persons who had doubts on the subject, from the difference of style
between this and the former Epistle. This fact, indeed, as Wall has
remarked, (Critical Notes on the New Testament, pp. 358, 359,) will
serve at least to show the care which was evinced in admitting books to
be canonical, proving that they were not received without the utmost
caution, and that if the slightest doubt existed in the case of any one,
it was honestly expressed.

\(2\) even all doubt on the subject disappeared as early as the third
and fourth centuries, and the Epistle was received as being
unquestionably the production of Peter. The effect of the examination in
the case was to remove all suspicion, and it has never since been
doubted that the Epistle was written by Peter; at least, no doubt has
arisen, except from the fact stated by Jerome and Origen, that it was
not universally admitted to be genuine.

\(3\) this Epistle purports to have been written by the author of the
former, and has all the internal marks of genuineness which could exist.

\(a\) It bears the inscription of the name of the same apostle: "Simon
Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ," [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md).

\(b\) There is an allusion in [Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md), which Peter only could
appropriately make, and which an impostor, or forger of an epistle,
would hardly have thought of introducing: "Knowing that shortly I must
put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed
me." Here, there is an evident reference to the Saviour's prediction of
the death of Peter, recorded in [Joh
21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md). It is conceivable, indeed,
that an adroit forger of an epistle might have introduced such a
circumstance; but the supposition that it is genuine is much more
natural. It is such an allusion as Peter would naturally make; it would
have required much skill and tact in another to have introduced it so as
not to be easily detected, even if it had occurred to him to personate
Peter at all. Would not a forger of an epistle have been likely to
mention particularly what kind of death was predicted by the Saviour,
and not to have made a mere allusion?

\(c\) In [Pe2 1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md), there is
another allusion of a similar kind. The writer claims to have been one
of the "eye-witnesses of the majesty" of the Lord Jesus when he was
transfigured in the holy mount. It was natural for Peter to refer to
this, for he was with him; and he has mentioned it just as one would be
likely to do who had actually been with him, and who was writing from
personal recollection. A forger of the epistle would have been likely to
be more particular, and would have described the scene more minutely,
and the place where it occurred, and would have dwelt more on the nature
of the evidence furnished there of the Divine mission of the Saviour.

\(d\) In [Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md), it is stated that
this is a Second Epistle written to the same persons, as a former one
had been; and that the writer aimed at substantially the same object in
both. Here the plain reference is to the First Epistle of Peter, which
has always been acknowledged to be genuine. It may be said that one who
forged the Epistle might have made this allusion. This is true, but it
may be doubtful whether he would do it. It would have increased the
liability to detection, for it would not be easy to imitate the manner,
and to carry out the views of the apostle.

\(4\) to these considerations it may be added, that there is clear
internal evidence of another kind to show that it was written by Peter.
This evidence, too long to be introduced here, may be seen in Michaelis'
Introduction, iv. 349-356. The sum of this internal evidence is, that it
would not have been practicable for a writer of the first or second
century to have imitated Peter so as to have escaped detection; and
that, in general, it is not difficult to detect the books that were
forged in imitation of, and in the name of, the apostles.

As to the alleged objection in regard to the difference of the style in
the second chapter, see Michaelis, iv. 352-356. Why it was not inserted
in the Old Syriac Version is not known. It is probable that the author
of that version was exceedingly cautious, and did not admit any books
about which he had any doubt. The fact that this was doubted by some,
and that these doubts were not removed from his mind, as in the case of
the Epistle of James, was a good reason for his not inserting it, though
it by no means proves that it is not genuine. It came, however, to be
acknowledged afterward by the Syrians as genuine and canonical Ephrem
the Syrian, a writer of the 4th century, not only quotes several
passages of it, but expressly ascribes it to Peter. Thus, in the second
volume of his Greek works, p. 387, he says, "The blessed Peter, also,
the Coryphaeus of the apostles, cries, concerning that day, saying, The
day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night, in which the heavens
being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat." This is literally quoted (in the Greek) from [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). See Michaelis, as above, p. 348.
And Asseman, in his catalog of the Vatican Manuscripts, gives an account
of a Syriac book of Lessons, to be read, in which is one taken from this
Epistle. See Michaelis.

These considerations remove all reasonable doubt as to the propriety of
admitting this Epistle into the canon, as the production of Peter.

Section 2. The Time when the Epistle was Written

In regard to the time when this Epistle was written, nothing can be
determined with absolute certainty. All that appears on that subject
from the Epistle itself, is, that at the time of writing it the author
was expecting soon to die. [Pe2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md),
"knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our
Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me." What evidence he had that he was soon
to die he has not informed us; nor is it known even what he meant
precisely by the word "shortly." The Greek word (ταχινή tachinē) is
indeed one that would imply that the event was expected not to be far
off; but a man would not unnaturally use it who felt that he was growing
old, even though he should in fact live several years afterwards. The
Saviour [Joh 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md) did not state to
Peter when his death would occur, except that it would be when he should
be old; and the probability is, that the fact that he was growing old
was the only intimation that he had that he was soon to die.
Ecclesiastical history informs us that he died at Rome, 66 a.d., in the
12th year of the reign of Nero. See Calmet, the article "Peter." Compare
Notes, [Joh 21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md). Lardner
supposes, from [Pe2 1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md), that this
was written not long after the First, as he then says that he "would not
be "negligent" to put them in remembrance of these things." The two
Epistles he supposes were written in the year 63 or 64 a.d., or at the
latest 65 a.d. Michaelis supposes it was in the year 64 a.d.; Calmet
that it was in the year of Christ 68, or according to the Common Era, 65
a.d. Probably the year 64 or 65 a.d. would not be far from the real date
of this Epistle. If so, it was, according to Calmet, one year only
before the martyrdom of Peter (66 a.d.), and six years before the
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, 71 ad.

Section 3. The Persons to whom this Epistle was Written, and the
Location

On this subject there is no room for doubt. In [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md), the writer says, "this Second
Epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your
pure minds by way of remembrance" This Epistle was written, therefore,
to the same persons as the former. On the question to whom that was
addressed, see the introduction to that Epistle, Section 1. The Epistles
were addressed to persons who resided in Asia Minor, and in both they
are regarded as in the midst of trials. No certain intimation of the
place where this Epistle was written is given in the Epistle itself. It
is probable that it was at the same place as the former, as, if it had
not been, we may presume that there would have been some reference to
the fact that he had changed his residence, or some local allusion which
would have enabled us to determine the fact. If he wrote this Epistle
from Babylon, as he did the former one, (see Introduction to that
Epistle, Section 2,) it is not known why he was so soon removed to Rome,
and became a martyr there. Indeed, everything respecting the last days
of this apostle is involved in great uncertainty. See the article
"Peter" in Calmet's Dictionary. See these questions examined also in
Bacon's Lives of the Apostles, pp. 258-279.

Section 4. The Occasion on Which the Epistle Was Written

The First Epistle was written in view of the trials which those to whom
it was addressed were then enduring, and the persecutions which they had
reason to anticipate, [Pe1 1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md); [Pe1
4:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md); [Pe1
5:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md). The main object of that
Epistle was to comfort them in their trials, and to encourage them to
bear them with a Christian spirit, imitating the example of the Lord
Jesus. This Epistle appears to have been written, not so much in view of
persecutions and bodily sufferings, real or prospective, as in view of
the fact that there were teachers of error among them, the tendency of
whose doctrine was to turn them away from the gospel. To those teachers
of error, and to the dangers to which they were exposed on that account,
there is no allusion in the First Epistle, and it would seem not to be
improbable that Peter had been informed that there were such teachers
among them after he had written and despatched that. Or, if he was not
thus informed of it, it seems to have occurred to him that this was a
point of great importance which had not been noticed in the former
Epistle, and that an effort should be made by apostolic influence and
authority to arrest the progress of error, to counteract the influence
of the false teachers, and to confirm the Christians of Asia Minor in
the belief of the truth. A large part of the Epistle, therefore, is
occupied in characterizing the teachers of error, in showing that they
would certainly be destroyed, and in stating the true doctrine in
opposition to what they held. It is evident that Peter supposed that the
danger to which Christians in Asia Minor were exposed from these errors,
was not less than that to which they were exposed from persecution, and
that it was of as much importance to guard them from those errors as it
was to sustain them in their trials.

The characteristics of the teachers referred to in this Epistle, and the
doctrines which they taught, were the following:

\(1\) One of the prominent errors was a denial of the Lord that bought
them, [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md). On the nature of this
error, see Notes on that verse.

\(2\) they gave indulgence to carnal appetites, and were sensual,
corrupt, beastly, lewd, [Pe2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md),
[Pe2 2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012.md), [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md). Compare [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md), [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md),[Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016.md). It is remarkable that so many
professed "reformers" have been men who have been sensual and lewd - men
who have taken advantage of their character as professed religious
teachers, and as "reformers," to corrupt and betray others. Such
reformers often begin with pure intentions, but a constant familiarity
with a certain class of vices tends to corrupt the mind, and to awaken
in the soul passions which would otherwise have slept; and they fall
into the same vices which they attempt to reform. It should be said,
however, that many professed reformers are corrupt at heart, and only
make use of their pretended zeal in the cause of reformation to give
them the opportunity to indulge their base propensities.

\(3\) they were disorderly in their views, and radical in their
movements. The tendency of their doctrines was to unsettle the
foundations of order and government; to take away all restraint from the
indulgence of carnal propensities, and to break up the very foundations
of good order in society, [Pe2
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md). They "walked after the flesh
in the lust of uncleanness;" they "despised government" or authority;
they were "presumptuous and self-willed;" they "were not afraid to speak
evil of dignities;" they were like "natural brute beasts;" they "spoke
evil of the subjects which they did not understand." It is by no means
an uncommon thing for professed reformers to become anti-government men,
or to suppose that all the restraints of law stand in their way, and
that they must be removed in order to success. They fix the mind on one
thing to be accomplished. That thing magnifies itself until it fills all
the field of vision. Everything which seems to oppose their efforts, or
to uphold the evil which they seek to remove, they regard as an evil
itself; and as the laws and the government of a country often seem to
sustain the evil, they become opposed to the government itself, and
denounce it as an evil. Instead of endeavoring to enlighten the public
mind, and to modify the laws by a course of patient effort, they array
themselves against them, and seek to overturn them. For the same reason,
also, they suppose that "the church" upholds the evil, and become the
deadly foe of all church organizations.

\(4\) they were seductive and artful, and adopted a course of teaching
that was fitted to beguile the weak, and especially to produce
licentiousness of living, [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md).
They were characterized by adulterous desires; and they practiced their
arts particularly on the "unstable," those who were easily led away by
any new and plausible doctrine that went to unsettle the foundations of
rigid morality.

\(5\) they adopted a pompous mode of teaching, distinguished for sound
rather than for sense, and proclaimed themselves to be the special
friends of liberal views, and of a liberal Christianity, [Pe2
2:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017.md). They were like "wells without
water;" "clouds that were carried about with a tempest;" they spake
"great swelling words of vanity," and they promised "liberty" to those
who would embrace their views, or freedom from the restraints of bigotry
and of a narrow and gloomy religion. This appeal is usually made by the
advocates of error.

\(6\) they had been professed Christians, and had formerly embraced the
more strict views on morals and religion which were held by Christians
in general, [Pe2 2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md). From this,
however, they had departed, and had fallen into practices quite as
abominable as those of which they had been guilty before their pretended
conversion.

\(7\) they denied the doctrines which the apostles had stated respecting
the end of the world. The "argument" on which they based this denial was
the fact that all things continued unchanged as they had been from the
beginning, and that it might be inferred from that that the world would
be stable, [Pe2 3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md). They saw no
change in the laws of nature; they saw no indications that the world was
drawing to a close, and they "inferred" that laws so stable and settled
as those were which existed in nature would continue to operate, and
that the changes predicted by the apostles were impossible.

A large part of the Epistle is occupied in meeting these errors, and in
so portraying the characters of their advocates as to show what degree
of reliance was to be placed on their preaching. For a particular view
of the manner in which these errors are met, see the analyses to 2 Pet.
2; 3.

This Epistle is characterized by the same earnest and tender manner as
the First, and by a peculiarly "solemn grandeur of imagery and diction."
The apostle in the last two chapters had to meet great and dangerous
errors, and the style of rebuke was appropriate to the occasion. He felt
that he himself was soon to die, and, in the prospect of death, his own
mind was uniquely impressed with the solemnity and importance of coming
events. He believed that the errors which were broached tended to sap
the very foundations of the Christian faith and of good morals, and his
whole soul is roused to meet and counteract them. The occasion required
that he should state in a solemn manner what was the truth in regard to
the second advent of the Lord Jesus; what great changes were to occur;
what the Christian might look for hereafter; and his soul kindles with
the sublime theme, and he describes in glowing imagery, and in
impassioned language, the end of all things, and exhorts them to live as
became those who were looking forward to so important events. The
practical effect of the whole Epistle is to make the mind intensely
solemn, and to put it into a position of waiting for the coming of the
Lord. On the similarity between this Epistlem, 2 Pet. 2, and the Epistle
of Jude, see the introduction to Jude.
