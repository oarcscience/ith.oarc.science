### [Numbers Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001)

[Numbers 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 19:1</span></span>

The principle that death and all pertaining to it, as being the
manifestation and result of sin [Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017), are defiling, and so lead to
interruption of the living relationship between God and His people, is
not now introduced for the first time, nor is it at all peculiar to the
Mosaic law. It was, on the contrary, traditional among the Israelites
from the earliest times, it is assumed in various enactments made
already (compare [Num 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#002); [Num
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006) ff; [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001), [Lev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007); [Lev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008), [Lev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011), [Lev
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024); [Lev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001) ff), and it is traceable in
various forms among many nations, both ancient and modern. Moses
adopted, here as elsewhere, existing and ancient customs, with
significant additions, as helps in the spiritual education of his
people.

The ordinance was probably given at this time because the plague which
happened [Num 16:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046) about the
matter of Korah had spread the defilement of death so widely through the
camp as to seem to require some special measures of purification, more
particularly as the deaths through it were in an extraordinary manner
the penalty of sin.

[Numbers 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 19:2</span></span>

A red heifer - Red, in order to shadow forth man's earthly body, even as
the name Adam bears allusion to the red earth of which man's body was
fashioned.

Without spot, wherein is no blemish - As with sin-offerings generally
[Lev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003).

Upon which never came yoke - So here and elsewhere (see the marginal
references), in the case of female victims.

[Numbers 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 19:3</span></span>

The work would necessarily require a priest; yet as it rendered him
unclean for the day [Num 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022), the
high priest was relieved from performing it.

Without the camp - The defilement was viewed as transferred to the
victim that was to be offered for its removal. Under these circumstances
the victim, like the defiled persons themselves, would be removed
outside the camp. The particular pollution to be remedied by this
ordinance was the indirect one resulting from contact with tokens and
manifestations of sin, not the direct and personal one arising from
actual commission of sin. So too the sinless antitype had to bear the
reproach of associating with sinners [Luk
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#030); [Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002). And as the red heifer was
expelled from the precincts of the camp, so was the Saviour cut off in
no small measure during His Life from the fellowship of the chief
representatives of the theocracy, and put to death outside Jerusalem
between two thieves. Compare [Heb
13:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011).

[Numbers 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 19:6</span></span>

Compare [Lev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004) note.

[Numbers 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 19:9</span></span>

Water of separation - In [Num 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007), the
water of purification from sin is the "water of purifying." So that
which was to remedy a state of legal separation is here called "water of
separation."

[Numbers 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 19:10</span></span>

He that gathered the ashes became equally unclean with the others. For
the defilement of the people, previously transferred to the heifer, was
regarded as concentrated in the ashes.

[Numbers 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 19:11</span></span>

One practical effect of attaching defilement to a dead body, and to all
that touched it, etc., would be to insure early burial, and to correct a
practice not uncommon in the East, of leaving the deal to be devoured by
the wild beasts.
