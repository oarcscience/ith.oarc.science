### [Jeremiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 21:0</span></span>

With the last verse of Jer. 20 ended the scroll of Jehoiakim: with the
first verse of [Jer 21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md) begins a
digest of various prophecies Jer. 21-24 addressed to Zedekiah in his
ninth year, and called Zedekiah's scroll. The occasion of this prophecy
was the embassy sent by Zedekiah to Jeremiah, asking his prayers when
the Chaldaean army was advancing upon Jerusalem. So clearly did the
prophet foresee the result that he could give the king no hope. His
answer, contained in the scroll, divides itself into two parts, in the
first Jer. 20-22, the prophet reviews the conduct of the royal house: in
the second Jer. 23:9-40, that of the priests and prophets; closing with
a vision [Jer 24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md) in which he
shows the pitiable condition of Zedekiah and his people.

[Jeremiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 21:1</span></span>

By sending this embassy Zedekiah acknowledged that Jeremiah held the
same position in the kingdom which Isaiah had held under Hezekiah [Kg2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002.md). Pashur and Zephaniah belonged to
the party who were for resisting Nebuchadnezzar by force of arms.

[Jeremiah 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 21:2</span></span>

Nebuchadrezzar - A more correct way of spelling the name than
Nebuchadnezzar.

According to all his wondrous works - The king and his envoys expected
some such answer as Isaiah had given on a former occasion [Isa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006.md).

[Jeremiah 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 21:4</span></span>

Without the walls - These words are to be joined to wherewith ye fight.

[Jeremiah 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 21:6</span></span>

A great pestilence - As the result of the excessive crowding of men and
animals in a confined space with all sanitary regulations utterly
neglected.

[Jeremiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 21:8</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference; but here the alternative is a life saved
by desertion to the enemy, or a death by famine, pestilence, and the
sword within the walls.

[Jeremiah 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 21:9</span></span>

He that ... falleth to the Chaldeans - This was to counsel desertion,
and would have been treason in an ordinary man: but the prophets Spoke
with an authority above that even of the king, and constantly interfered
in political matters with summary decisiveness. Compare [Mat
24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016.md).

A prey - Something not a man's own, upon which he seizes in the midst of
danger, and hurries away with it. So must the Jews hurry away with their
lives as something more than they had a right to, and place them in the
Chaldaean camp as in a place of safety.

[Jeremiah 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 21:11</span></span>

Rather, And as to the royal house of Judah, Hear ye. Omit say. The words
are no command to the prophet, but form his introduction to the
discourse which extends to the end of [Jer
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008.md). The king and his officers are to
hear the gist of all the messages sent to the royal house since the
accession of Jehoiakim.

[Jeremiah 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 21:12</span></span>

Execute judgment - As the administration of justice was performed in old
time in person, the weal of the people depended to a great degree upon
the personal qualities of the king (see [Sa2
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004).md). And as "the oppressor" was
generally some powerful noble, it was especially the king's duty to see
that the weaker members of the community were not wronged.

[Jeremiah 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 21:13</span></span>

Inhabitant - is feminine, the population of Jerusalem being always
personified as a woman, the daughter of Zion. Omit and. Jerusalem is at
once a valley and a rock [Jer 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md).
The people are described as priding themselves on the impregnability of
their city.

[Jeremiah 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 21:14</span></span>

The forest - This suggested to the Jew the idea of everything grand and
stately.
