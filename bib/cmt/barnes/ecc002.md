### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

Solomon's trial of God's second gift, namely, riches, and the enjoyment
which riches supply; this brought him to the sane result (compare [Ecc
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012).md).

Comparing Solomon's action with [Luk
12:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md), it must be remembered that
Solomon's object was the acquisition of wisdom, not self-indulgence, and
that he did not fail to look forward to the certainty of death
overtaking him.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

I sought ... - Rather, I resolved (literally "I turned in my heart") to
draw my flesh with wine (see the margin), my heart guiding me with
wisdom. In the course of his attempt to answer the question of [Ecc
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003.md), while his heart was directing him
(as a charioteer directs his horses or a shepherd his sheep) with
wisdom, and while he was following that guidance, he determined to draw
with him his flesh by wine, thus making his flesh, which he speaks of as
distinct from himself (compare [Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025).md), a confederate and subsidiary in
his attempt.

[Ecclesiastes 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 2:4</span></span>

Compare [Kg1 7:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md); [Kg1
9:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md); [Kg1
10:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md); and [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 2:5</span></span>

Orchards - literally, "paradises," i. e., parks or pleasure-grounds
(compare [Neh 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008) note.md). Indications
of at least three of these have been pointed out; one at Jerusalem near
the pool of Siloam, called "the king's garden" [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md); [Jer
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md); a second near Bethlehem (compare
[Ecc 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006).md); and a third in the remote
north, on the heights of Hermon [Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md); [Sol
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 2:6</span></span>

Pools - A short distance south of Bethlehem, in a valley in the defile
of Urtas, three "Pools of Solomon" are still shown and an adjoining hill
still bears the name of the "Little Paradise."

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

I got - Rather, I bought, in distinction from those born in the house.
The "children of Solomon's servants" (compare [Ezr
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055.md), [Ezr
2:58](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#058).md) were more probably of Canaanite
origin [Kg1 9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020.md); [Kg1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md) than Hebrews [Kg1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#022.md).

Possessions of great and small cattle - Rather, herds of oxen and sheep.

All ... before me - King David's herds and flocks are mentioned in [Ch1
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#029.md), [Ch1
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#031.md) : but we have no specific
account of the wealth of other Canaanite or Hebrew inhabitants of
Jerusalem before Solomon.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

Kings - Both tributary [Kg1 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md) and
independent [Kg1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md); [Kg1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014.md); [Kg1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md); the "provinces" probably
correspond to the kingdoms mentioned in [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md).

As musical ... sorts - Rather, Many women (compare [Kg1
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

Portion - A word of frequent occurrence. By it Solomon describes the
pleasure found in the act of working and also perhaps the pleasure felt
in the process of acquiring wisdom; this pleasure is admitted to be
good, if received from God ([Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md);
[Ecc 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md); compare [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004).md); but being transitory it is
subject to vanity, and therefore does not afford a sufficient answer to
the repeated question, "What profit etc.?" [Ecc
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

Solomon having found that wisdom and folly agree in being subject to
vanity, now contrasts one with the other [Ecc
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md). Both are brought under vanity by
events [Ecc 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md) which come on the
wise man and the feel alike from without - death and oblivion [Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md), uncertainty [Ecc
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md), disappointment [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md) - all happening by an external
law beyond human control. Amidst this vanity, the good (see [Ecc
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010) note.md) that accrues to man, is the
pleasure felt [Ecc 2:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md) in
receiving God's gifts, and in working with and for them.

[Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

What can the man do ... - i. e., "What is any man - in this study of
wisdom and folly - after one like me, who, from my position, have had
such special advantages (see [Ecc
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#016.md), and compare [Ecc
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025).md) for carrying it on? That which
man did of old he can but do again: he is not likely to add to the
result of my researches, nor even to equal them." Some hold that the
"man" is a reference to Solomon's successor - not in his inquiries, but
in his kingdom, i. e., Jeroboam.

[Ecc 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md)

Event - Or, "hap" [Rut 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#003.md). The verb
from which it is derived seems in this book to refer especially to
death. The word does not mean chance (compare [Ecc
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001).md), independent of the ordering of
Divine Providence: the Gentile notion of "mere chance," or "blind fate,"
is never once contemplated by the writer of this book, and it would be
inconsistent with his tenets of the unlimited power and activity of God.

[Ecc 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

Seeing that ... - Compare [Ecc 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#011.md).
Some render, "as in time past, so in days to come, all will be
forgotten;" others, "because in the days to come all will have been long
before forgotten."

[Ecc 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

I hated life - Compare this expression, extorted from Solomon by the
perception of the vanity of his wisdom and greatness, with [Rom
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022.md). The words of Moses [Num
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#015.md), and of Job [Job
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021.md); [Job
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#009.md), are scarcely less forcible. With
some people, this feeling is a powerful motive to conversion [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md).

[Ecc 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md)

Labour - Compare [Ecc 2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md).

[Ecc 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

I went about - i. e., I turned from one course of action to another.

[Ecc 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md)

Are sorrows ... grief - Rather, sorrows and grief are his toil. See [Ecc
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013.md).

[Ecc 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

Nothing better for a man, than that ... - literally, no good in man that
etc. The one joy of working or receiving, which, though it be
transitory, a man recognizes as a real good, even that is not in the
power of man to secure for himself: that good is the gift of God.

[Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

The doctrine of retribution, or, the revealed fact that God is the moral
Governor of the world, is here stated for the first time (compare [Ecc
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md), [Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017) ff.md) in this book.

This also is vanity - Not only the travail of the sinner. Even the best
gifts of God, wisdom, knowledge, and joy, so far as they are given in
this life, are not permanent, and are not always (see [Ecc
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011).md) efficacious for the purpose for
which they appear to be given.
