### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 5:0</span></span>

1\. "Author of the psalm" - This psalm also purports to be a psalm of
David, and there is nothing in it to lead us to doubt that this opinion
is correct. It is ascribed to him in all the versions, and by all the
ancient Hebrew writers, and the contents are such as we might expect
from him.

2\. "The occasion on which the psalm was composed." This is not
specified in the title to the psalm, and there is nothing in the psalm
itself that can enable us to determine it with certainty. There can be
no improbability in supposing that there were some events in the life of
David, or that there were some particular circumstances, which suggested
the thoughts in the psalm, but all those local and personal allusions
are suppressed, as it does not appear to have been the writer's object
to disclose private feelings, but to give utterance to sentiments,
though perhaps suggested by private and personal considerations, which
might be of permanent use to the church at all times.

There is evidence in the psalm itself that the author at the time of its
composition was beset by enemies, and that he was in the midst of peril
from the designs of violent men, [Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md), [Psa
5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md). Who those enemies were,
however, he does not specify, for the object was to express sentiments
that would be of use, to all who might be in similar circumstances, by
showing what were the true feelings of piety, and what was the real
ground of trust for the people of God at such times; and this object
would not have been furthered by any specifications in regard to the
foes which surrounded him at the time.

Flaminius (see Rosenmuller) supposes that the psalm was composed in the
time of Saul, and in reference to the persecutions which David
experienced then; but most interpreters have referred it to the time of
Absalom's rebellion. Most of the Jewish writers, according to Kimchi
(see DeWette), suppose that it had reference to Doeg and Ahithophel;
but, as DeWette remarks, since they lived at different times, it cannot
be supposed that the psalm had reference to them both. There is no
improbability in supposing that the psalm was composed with reference to
the same circumstances as the two preceding - that important event in
the life of David when his own son rose up in rebellion against him, and
drove him from his throne. In those prolonged and fearful troubles it is
by no means improbable that the royal poet would give utterance to his
feelings in more than one poetic effusion, or that some new phase of the
trouble would suggest some new reflections, and lead him anew to seek
consolation in religion, and to express his confidence in God. The psalm
has a sufficient resemblance to the two preceding to accord with this
supposition, and it can be read with profit with those scenes in view.

3\. "Contents of the psalm." The psalm, so far as the sentiment is
concerned, may be properly regarded as divided into four parts:

I. An earnest prayer of the author to God to hear him; to attend to his
cry, and to deliver him, [Psa 5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md).
His prayer in the morning he would direct to him, and with the returning
light of day he would look up to him. In his troubles his first act
would be each day to call upon God.

II\. An expression of unwavering confidence in God as the protector and
the friend of the righteous, and the enemy of all wickedness, [Psa
5:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md). God, he was assured, had no
pleasure in wickedness; would not suffer evil to dwell in his presence;
would abhor all that was false and deceitful, and he might, therefore,
in all his troubles, put his trust in him. In view of this fact - this
characteristic of the divine nature - he says that he would enter his
holy temple, where prayer was accustomed to be made, with confidence,
and worship with profound reverence, [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md).

III\. Prayer to God, in view of all this, for his guidance and
protection in his perplexities, [Psa
5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md). He felt himself surrounded by
dangers; he was in perplexity as to the true way of safety; his enemies
were powerful, numerous, and treacherous, and he beseeches God,
therefore, to interpose and to deliver him from them - even by cutting
them off. He prays that they might fall by their own counsels, and that,
as they had rebelled against God, they might be checked and punished as
they deserved.

IV\. An exhortation, founded on these views, for all to put their trust
in God, [Psa 5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md). What he had
found to be true, all others would find to be true; and as he in his
troubles had seen reason to put his trust in God, and had not been
disappointed, so he exhorts all others, in similar circumstances, to do
the same.

"To the chief muscian." See the note on the title to [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

:Title

Upon Nehiloth - The title of [Psa
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md) is, "upon Neginoth." As that
refers to a musical instrument, so it is probable that this does, and
that the idea here is that this psalm was intended particularly for the
music-master that had special charge of this instrument, or who presided
over those that played on it. Perhaps the idea is that this psalm was
specially designed to be accompanied with this instrument. The word
here, Nehiloth - נחילות nechı̂ylôth, plural. נחילה nechı̂ylâh, singular -
is supposed by Gesenius, Lexicon, to denote a flute, or pipe, as being
"perforated," from חלל châlal, to bore." The word occurs only in this
place. Very various opinions have been entertained of its meaning. See
Hengstenberg, "Com." The Latin Vulgate and the Septuagint understand it
as meaning "inheritance" - the same as נחלה nachălâh, and as being
somehow designed to refer to the people of God "as" a heritage. Latin
Vulgate: In finem pro ca, quae hereditatem consequitur, psalmus David.
So the Septuagint - ὑπὲρ τῆς κληρονομούσης huper tēs klēronomousēs. So
Luther, Fur das Erbe. What was the precise idea affixed to this it is
not very easy to determine. Luther explains it, "according to the title,
this is the general idea of the psalm, that the author prays for the
inheritance or heritage of God, desiring that the people of God may be
faithful to him, and may always adhere to him." The true interpretation,
however, is evidently to regard this as an instrument of music, and to
consider the psalm as adapted to be sung with the instrument of music
specified. Why it was adapted particularly to "that" instrument of music
cannot now be determined. Horsley renders it "upon the flutes." Compare
Ugolin. Thesau. Ant. Sac.; tom. xxxii. pp. 158-170.

A Psalm of David - See introduction to [Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md).

Give ear to my words, O Lord - We naturally incline the ear toward
anyone when we wish to hear distinctly what he says, and we turn away
the ear when we do not. The meaning here is, David prayed that God would
be attentive to or would regard his prayer. This form of the petition
is, that he would attend to his "words" - to what he was about to
"express" as his desire. He intended to express only what he wished to
be granted.

Consider my meditation - Understand; perceive, for so the word rendered
"consider" properly means. He desired that he would regard the real
import of what is here called his "meditation;" that is, he wished him
not merely to attend to his "words," but to the secret and unexpressed
desires of the soul. The idea seems to be that while his words would be
sincere and truthful, yet they could not express "all" his meaning.
There were desires of the soul which no language could convey - deep,
unuttered "groanings" (compare [Rom
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md), which could not be uttered
in language. There is a difference, however, in rendering the word
translated "meditation." Most interpreters regard it as derived from הגה
hâgâh, to meditate (see the notes at [Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002).md) - and as thus denoting "thought,"
or "meditation." Gesenius and some others regard it as derived from הגג
hāgag, obsolete root - meaning to set on fire, to kindle; and hence,
that it means here "heat," fervour of the mind; and then, fervent cry,
or prayer. See "Rosenmuiller" also in "loc." DeWette concurs with
Gesenius, and supposes that it should be rendered "sigh" or complaint.
Prof. Alexander renders it "thought." Horsley renders it, "my sighing,"
but says he is in doubt whether it refers to an "internal desire of the
mind," in opposition to "words" in the former part of the verse, or to a
"prayer uttered sotto voce, like the private prayer usually said by
every person before he takes his seat in the church" - the "internal
motion of the mind toward God." It is not easy to determine the true
meaning, but the probability is that it refers to an internal emotion -
a fervent, ardent feeling - perhaps finding partial expression in sighs
[Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md), but which does not find
expression in words, and which words could not convey. He prayed that
God would attend to the "whole" desires of the soul - whether expressed
or unexpressed.

[Psalms 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 5:2</span></span>

Hearken unto the voice of my cry - My cry for assistance. The word
"voice" refers to the utterance of his desires, or to his "expressed"
wishes in a time of trouble.

My King, and my God - Though he was himself a king, yet he acknowledged
his subjection to God as his supreme Ruler, and looked up to Him to
protect him in his dangers, and to restore him to his rights. He was, at
the same time, his God - his covenant God - to whom he felt that he was
permitted to come in the hour of trouble, and whose blessing he was
permitted to invoke.

For unto thee will I pray - He had no one else to go to in his troubles,
and he felt that he "might" approach the living God. It was his fixed
purpose - his regular habit - to pray to him, and to seek his favor and
friendship, and he felt that he was permitted to do so now.

[Psalms 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 5:3</span></span>

My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord - The voice of prayer.
Compare the notes at [Psa 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md).
Probably he refers here to a general habit of praying in the morning,
though he makes a particular reference to his circumstances at that
time. Compare [Psa 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md). The psalmist
felt, doubtless, that while it was a general duty and privilege to call
upon God with the return of each morning, there was a special reason for
it in the circumstances in which he then was. See the introduction to
the psalm. He was then surrounded by enemies, and was in danger, and it
was only in God that he could hope for protection even for a single day.
The propriety of looking to God in the morning by prayer commends itself
to any reflecting mind. Who knows what a day may bring forth? Who knows
what temptations may await him? Who can protect himself from the dangers
which may encompass him? Who can enable us to discharge the duties which
are incumbent on us every day? Feeble, helpless, sinful, prone to err,
in a world of temptation, and surrounded by dangers alike when we see
them and when we do not, there is an obvious fitness in looking to God
each morning for his guidance and protection; and the resolution of the
psalmist here should be the firm purpose of every man.

In the morning - Regularly; each morning.

Will I direct my prayer unto thee - Margin, as in Hebrew, "set in
order." The word used here - ערך ‛ârak - means properly to place in a
row, to put in order, to arrange, e. g., to place wood upon the altar
[Gen 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009.md); [Lev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007.md); to arrange the showbread on the
table [Exo 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023.md); [Lev
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006.md), [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008.md). There is, not improbably, an
allusion to these customs in the use of the word here; and the meaning
may be, that his prayer would be a regularly arranged service before
God. It would be a kind of morning sacrifice, and it would be arranged
and performed with a suitable regard to the nature of the service - the
fact that it was rendered to the great God. There would be a devout
regard to propriety - a serious and solemn attention to the duties
involved in the act as the worship of a holy God. Prayer should not be
rash; it should not be performend negligently or with a light spirit; it
should engage the profound thought of the soul, and it should be
performed with the same serious regard to time and to propriety which
was demanded in the solemn and carefully prescribed rites of the ancient
temple-service.

And will look up - The word used here - צפה tsâphâh - means, properly,
to look about, to view from a distance. In [Isa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005.md), it refers to a tower which has a
wide prospect. Compare [Sol 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004.md). The
idea here is properly that he would watch, narrowly and carefully (as
one does who is stationed on a tower), for some token of divine favor -
for some answer to his prayer - for some divine interposition - for some
intimation of the divine will. This is, perhaps, equivalent to the
Saviour's repeated command to "watch and pray." The notion of looking
"up" is not necessarily in the word used here, but it indicates the
state of mind where there is deep and careful solicitude as to the
answer to prayer.

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness - The psalmist
here refers to a well-known and well-understood characteristic of the
Divine Being, that he was holy and pure, and that he could not have any
pleasure in furthering the designs of wicked men. This is said with
reference to his enemies, who were thus wicked; and the idea is that God
would not, and could not, consistently with his nature, further their
designs. This is the ground of encouragement which he had to pray - that
he was conscious that his own aims were right, and that his cause was
just, and that God could not favor the cause of the ungodly. This is
still, and always will be, a ground of encouragement in prayer. If we
know that our cause is right, we may look to God to favor it; if a cause
is wrong, we cannot look to him to interpose to advance it. Good men,
therefore, pray; wicked men do not.

Neither shall evil dwell with thee - The same idea is here expressed in
another form. If God should show favor to the wicked, it would seem as
if he admitted them to his habitation, as we do our friends and those in
whom we delight. But as God would not do this, the psalmist feels that
it was proper for him to call upon Him to deliver him from wicked
people.

[Psalms 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 5:5</span></span>

The foolish - Referring still to his enemies, as having this character,
and urging the fact that they "had" such a character as a reason why God
should hear him, and deliver him. The word "foolish" here, הוללים
hôleliym, is used to denote the wicked, under the common idea in the
Scriptures that sin is folly. Compare [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md). It is rendered by Prof.
Alexander, "the proud" or "insolent." The Aramaic renders it "deriders;"
Latin Vulgate: "unjust;" Septuagint "transgressors;" Gesenius, Lexicon,
"proud." So DeWette. The common idea, however, is the correct one,
referring to the wicked under the idea that they were "fools," as all
sin is supreme folly.

Shall not stand in thy sight - Shall not be allowed to be in thy
presence; that is, thou wilt not approve their cause, or favor them. See
the notes at [Psa 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md).

Thou hatest all workers of iniquity - All that do wrong. He refers here,
also, to a general characteristic of God, but still with an implied and
immediate reference to his enemies as sustaining this character, and as
a reason why he appealed to God to defend his cause. Nothing is more
constantly affirmed in the Scriptures than that God hates all forms of
evil.

[Psalms 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 5:6</span></span>

Thou shalt destroy - Thou wilt bring to ruin; thou wilt cause to perish;
that is, cause to perish as the wicked are caused to perish, by being
punished. The idea is that God could not approve their cause; could not
favor them; could not give them prosperity, and that they must be
overthrown and punished. As in the previous verses, so here, David
refers to this as a general characteristic of God, but with an implied
reference to his enemies.

Them that speak leasing - Lies; the word "leasing" being the old Saxon
word to denote falsehood. See [Psa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md). It is not found elsewhere in our
common version. The allusion here is to his enemies, and the idea is
that they were false and treacherous; a description which will well
apply to them on the supposition that this refers to the rebellion of
Absalom. See the introduction to the psalm.

The Lord will abhor - Will hate; will hold in abomination. That is, he
will show his abhorrence by punishing such as are here referred to.

The bloody and deceitful man - The man of blood and fraud; the man who
sheds blood, and is guilty of treachery and fraud. Margin, "man of
bloods and deceit." The "man of bloods," - "the plural form being
commonly used where there is reference to blood-guiltiness or murder." -
"Prof. Alexander." See [Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md); [Psa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014.md). The idea seems to be that of
shedding "much" blood. The reference here, as before, is to a general
characteristic of the Divine Mind, with a special reference to the
character of David's enemies, as being distinguished for fraud and
blood-guiltiness. On the supposition (see introduction) that this refers
to the rebellion of Absalom, there can be no difficulty in seeing the
propriety of the application. It was on these grounds that the psalmist
directed his prayer to God. He was confident that his was a righteous
cause; he was as sure that his enemies were engaged in a wicked cause;
and he felt, therefore, that "he" might go before God and seek his
interposition, with the assurance that all his attributes, as a
righteous and holy God, would be enlisted in his favor. God has "no"
attribute which can take part with a sinner, or on which a sinner can
rely; the righteous can appeal to "every" attribute in the divine nature
as a ground of confidence and hope.

[Psalms 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 5:7</span></span>

But as for me - While it is their characteristic that they are wicked,
and have no desire to serve God; and while with such characteristics
they can have no hope of access to God, and no reason to suppose that he
will hear their cry, I am inclined to enter his house, and I feel the
assurance that he will listen to my prayer. In character and ill
feelings he was wholly unlike them.

I will come into thy house - Indicating his expectation and his hope
that he would yet be permitted to enter the courts of the Lord, from
which he was now driven away (see the introduction to the psalm), and
his purpose thus to acknowledge God. The word "house" here refers to the
tabernacle, which was regarded as the house or dwelling place of God.
The word was applied to the entire structure, embracing all the courts,
as being sacred to God, as the word was subsequently to the whole of the
temple. It was the holy of holies, however, which was regarded as the
special dwelling-place of God, and that none were permitted to enter but
the high priest, and he but once in the year. (See the notes at [Heb
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001)..md)

In the multitude of thy mercy - In thine abundant mercy. He expected to
be delivered from his present troubles, and he felt assured that God
would permit him again to enter his earthly courts, and to offer his
vows and thanksgivings there.

And in thy fear - In profound reverence for thee. Fear, or reverence, is
often employed to denote devotion or worship.

Will I worship toward thy holy temple - The worshippers were not
permitted to enter the temple, but worshipped "toward" it; that is,
looking toward it, or prostrating themselves toward it as the special
dwelling-place of God. If they were in the courts around the temple,
they worshipped with their faces toward the place where God was supposed
to reside; if they were far away, even in distant lands, they still
directed their faces toward Jerusalem and the temple, as the Muslims now
do toward Mecca. See the notes at [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md). It has been objected, from the
use of the word "temple" here, that this psalm could not have been
written by David, as the temple was not built until the time of Solomon.
But in reply to this it may be observed that the word here used - היכל
hêykâl - is a word of large signification, and might be applied to any
place of worship. It means, properly, a large and magnificent building,
a palace, [Pro 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028.md); [Isa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md); [Dan
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md); and then, the place where Yahweh
was supposed to reside, or the place of his worship; and might be
applied to the tabernacle as well as to the temple. In fact, it is
"often" applied to the tabernacle that was in use before the building of
the temple, [Sa1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md); [Sa1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md); [Sa2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#007.md). Compare Gesenius' Lexicon.

[Psalms 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 5:8</span></span>

Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness - That is, conduct me safely in
the manifestation of the principles of justice or righteousness which
belong to thy nature. David felt assured that his was a righteous cause,
and that he might make his appeal to God on the ground of the justness
of that cause. Such a ground of appeal is always proper when we are in
danger or in trouble from the injustice of others, for we may always ask
of God to interpose, and to cause that which is right to be done.

Because of mine enemies - On account of my enemies, or in respect to
them; that is, that they may not triumph, but that I may be vindicated
and may be delivered from them.

Make thy way straight before my face - The way in which thou wouldst
have me to walk. That is, mark out or make plain before me the path for
me to tread - the path in which thou wilt deliver me. He was in
perplexity, and knew not which way to go, and he looks up to God for
guidance and direction.

[Psalms 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 5:9</span></span>

For there is no faithfulness in their mouth - There is nothing in them
which can be confided in; nothing in their promises and declarations.
They are false and treacherous, and I can, therefore, only appeal to
thee. It is easy to see the propriety of this statement, and of those
which follow, on the supposition that this refers to the rebellion of
Absalom. Absalom had gone to Hebron on a false pretence [Sa2
15:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md), and every act of his in this
whole transaction had been treacherous and false.

Their inward part - Not only their external conduct, but their hearts,
their principles, their motives. This was fairly to be inferred from
their conduct. The object of the psalmist is to show that they were
wholly depraved in all that properly constitutes character or that
entered into moral conduct.

Their throat is an open sepulchre - That is, as the grave is open to
receive its victim, so is their throat open to devour or swallow up the
peace and happiness of others. The main idea is that they are false,
treacherous, not to be confided in, slanderous. This passage, with the
following, is employed by the apostle Paul to demonstrate the universal
depravity of man. See the notes at [Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md).

They flatter with their tongue - He had referred to the "inward part,"
or the "heart," and to the "throat" as being depraved and evil; he now
refers to another member of the body as being equally depraved - the
"tongue." Instead of being employed to utter truth, and to give
expression to the real feelings of the heart, it was employed to flatter
others, with a view to lead them astray, or to make use of them for base
and selfish purposes. The propriety of this representation as applicable
to Absalom and his coadjutors no one can fail to see (compare [Sa2
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001).md). It is also to an eminent
degree the characteristic of the wicked in general. On this, also, see
the notes at [Rom 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 5:10</span></span>

Destroy thou them, O God - The word here rendered "destroy" is
translated by Prof. Alexander "condemn" - "condemn them; literally, make
them guilty; that is, recognize and treat them as such." The Hebrew word
אשׁם 'âsham, means to fail in duty, to transgress, to be guilty; in the
Hiphil, the form used here, according to Gesenius, to "punish; and
hence, to destroy," (Lexicon) The idea in the mind of the psalmist seems
to have been that he desired, since they were undoubtedly guilty, that
God would regard and treat them "as such." It is not that he wished that
God would make them guilty; or that, in itself considered, he desired
that they should be found to be so, or that, in itself considered, he
wished them to be punished or cut off; but it is that, as they were
guilty, and as they were pursuing a course which tended to overthrow the
government of the land, and as they were at war with God and with the
best interests of the people, God would interpose and stay their
progress - that he would show himself to be a righteous and just God.
There is no evidence of any private malignity in this prayer, or of any
spirit of private revenge. It is a prayer which corresponds with all the
efforts, and consequently with all the wishes of every good person, that
the violators of law may be arrested and punished. In this, assuredly,
there is no wrong.

Let them fall by their own counsels - So as to show that they brought
this judgment upon themselves. The wish is, that their plans, which were
evil, might come to nought, and tend to their own overthrow. That is,
the psalmist did not wish to imbrue his hands in their blood, or to be
made the agent in their destruction; but he desired that God would
himself interpose, so that their own plans might be made the means of
quelling the rebellion. If men are so wicked that they must perish it is
desirable that it should be "seen" that they perish by their own guilt
and folly.

Cast them out - Expel them; drive them away; let them not be successful
in taking possession of the throne, and in overturning the government.

In the multitude of their transgressions - In the abundance of their
sins, or as a consequence of the number and the aggravation of their
offences. The design of the psalmist is to fix the attention on the
"great number" of their sins as a reason why they should not be
successful. Such a prayer is not wrong, for it would not be right to
pray that sinners "in" the abundance of their sins, or in consequence of
the multitude of their sins, should be successful and prosperous. The
fact that they are such sinners is, under a righteous administration, a
reason why they should "not" be successful, not why they "should be."

For they have rebelled against thee - This is given as a reason why the
psalmist prayed that they should be cut off. It was not that they had
wronged him; it was because they had rebelled against God; and it was
right, therefore, to hope and to pray that he would interpose and
vindicate his government and law. There is no spirit of private revenge
manifested here, and nothing said that would encourage or foster such a
spirit. All that is said here is but carrying out what every magistrate
must feel who executes the laws, and is what he endeavors himself to do;
for it is desirable that the wicked - the violators of the law - the
enemies of their country - should be arrested and prosecuted. See the
general introduction, 6.

[Psalms 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 5:11</span></span>

But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice - Compare the
notes at [Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md). That is, they have
occasion to rejoice in thee and in thy protection. The wicked have
everything to dread, for they must be cut off; but the righteous have
every reason to be happy, for they shall partake of the favor of God.
This is, at the same time, the earnest expression of a desire that they
might rejoice, and that the dealings of God with them might be such that
they would ever "have occasion" for joy.

Let them even shout for joy - Internal joy or happiness is often
expressed by shouting, or singing, as the word used here frequently
signifies. The meaning is, that they should give every proper expression
to their feeling of joy. This may be done by singing, or by grateful
ascriptions of praise and gratitude.

Because thou defendest them - While the wicked are cut off [Psa
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md). The psalmist, in this
expression, doubtless had a primary reference to himself and to those
who adhered to him in his righteous cause; but, as is common in the
Psalms, he gives to the sentiment a general form, that it might be
useful to all who fear and love God.

Let them also that love thy name - That love thee - the name being often
put for the person. This is but another form of designating the
righteous, for it is one of their characteristics that they love the
name of God.

Be joyful in thee - Rejoice in thee - in thine existence, thy
perfections, thy government, thy law, thy dealings, thy service; in all
that thou hast revealed of thyself, and in all that thou doest. Compare
[Phi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md), note; [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md), note. It is one of the
characteristics of the truly pious that they do find their happiness in
God. They rejoice that there is a God, and that he is just such a being
as he is; and they take delight in contemplating his perfections, in the
evidences of his favor and friendship, in communion with him, in doing
his will.

[Psalms 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 5:12</span></span>

For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous - It is one of the
characteristics of God that, while he will punish the wicked, he will
show favor to the righteous; while he brings deserved punishment upon
the one, he will show his favor to the other.

With favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield - That is, as a shield
is thrown round or before one in the day of battle to protect him, so
wilt thou throw thy protection around the righteous. For a description
of a "shield," see the notes at [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md). Compare the notes at [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md). On these accounts, David felt
that he might trust in God in the day of trouble and danger; and, on the
same account, all who are righteous may put their trust in him now.
