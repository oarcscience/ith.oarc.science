### [Matthew Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 11:1</span></span>

And it came to pass ... - The directions to the apostles were given in
the vicinity of Capernaum. The Saviour went from thence to preach in
their cities; that is, in the cities in the vicinity of Capernaum, or in
Galilee. He did not yet go into Judea.

[Matthew 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 11:2</span></span>

The account contained in this chapter of Matthew, to the [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md), is found, with no material
variation, in Luke 7:18-35. John was in prison. Herod had thrown him
into confinement on account of his faithfulness in reproving him for
marrying his brother Philip's wife. See [Mat
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003.md).

It is not certainly known why John sent to Jesus. It might have been to
satisfy his disciples that he was the Messiah; or he might have been
desirous of ascertaining for himself whether this person, of whom he
heard so much, was the same one whom he had baptized, and whom he knew
to be the Messiah. See [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 11:3</span></span>

Art thou he that should come? - That is, Art thou the Messiah, or the
Christ? The Jews expected a Saviour. His coming had been long foretold,
[Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); [Isa
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md); [Isa
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Isa
35:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004.md); [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md); [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). See also [Joh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md). Compare [Deu
18:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md). In common language,
therefore, he was familiarly described as "he that was to come." Luke
adds here [Luk 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021.md), that at the time
when the messengers came to him, Jesus "cured many of their infirmities,
and plagues, and of evil spirits." An answer was therefore ready to the
inquiries of John.

[Matthew 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 11:4</span></span>

Go and show John again ... - Jesus referred them for an answer to these
miracles. They were proof that he was the Messiah. Prophets had indeed
performed miracles, but no prophet had performed so many, or any so
important. Jesus, moreover, performed them "in his own name" and by his
own power. Prophets had done it by the power of God. Jesus, therefore,
performed the works which none but the Messiah could do, and John might
easily infer that he was the Christ.

The poor have the gospel preached to them - It was predicted of the
Messiah that he would preach good tidings to the meek [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); or, as it is rendered in the New
Testament, "He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor," [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). By this, therefore, also, John
might infer that he was truly the Messiah. It adds to the force of this
testimony that the "poor" have always been overlooked by Pharisees and
philosophers. No sect of philosophers had condescended to notice them
before Christ, and no system of religion had attempted to instruct them
before the Christian religion. In all other schemes the poor have been
passed by as unworthy of notice.

[Matthew 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 11:6</span></span>

And blessed is he ... - The word "offence" means a "stumbling-block."
See the notes at [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). This verse
might be rendered, "Happy is he to whom I shall not prove a
stumbling-block." That is, happy is he who shall not take offence at my
poverty and lowliness of life, so as to reject me and my doctrine. Happy
is the one who can, notwithstanding that poverty and obscurity, see the
evidence that I am the Messiah, and follow me. It is not improbable that
John wished Jesus publicly to proclaim himself as the Christ, instead of
seeking retirement. Jesus replied that he gave sufficient evidence of
that by his works; that a man might discover it if he chose; and that he
was blessed or happy who should appreciate that evidence and embrace him
as the Christ, in spite of his humble manner of life.

[Matthew 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 11:7</span></span>

And as they departed ... - Jesus took occasion, from the inquiries made
by John's disciples, to instruct the people respecting the true
character of John. Multitudes had gone out to hear him when he preached
in the desert Matt. 3, and it is probable that many had been attracted
by the novelty of his appearance or doctrines, or had gone simply to see
and hear a man of singular habits and opinions. Probably many who
followed Christ had been of that number. He took occasion, therefore, by
some striking questions, to examine the motives by which they had been
drawn to his ministry.

A reed shaken with the wind? - The region of country in which John
preached, being overflowed annually by the Jordan, produced great
quantities of "reeds" or "canes," of a light fragile nature, easily
shaken by the wind. They were therefore an image of a light, changing,
inconstant man. John's sending to Christ to inquire his character might
have led some to suppose that he was changing and inconstant, like a
reed. He had once acknowledged him to be the Messiah, and now, being in
prison and sending to him to inquire into the fact, they might have
supposed he had no firmness or fixed principles. Jesus, by asking this
question, declared that, notwithstanding this appearance, this was not
the character of John.

[Matthew 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 11:8</span></span>

Clothed in soft raiment - The kind of raiment here denoted was the
light, thin clothing worn by effeminate persons. It was made commonly of
fine linen, and was worn chiefly for ornament. Christ asks them whether
they were attracted by anything like that. He says that the desert was
not the place to expect it. In the palaces of kings, in the court of
Herod, it might be expected, but not in the place where John was. This
kind of clothing was an emblem of riches, splendor, effeminacy,
feebleness of character. He meant to say that John was a man of a
different stamp - coarse in his exterior, hardy in his character, firm
in his virtue, suited to endure trials and privations, and thus
qualified to be the forerunner of the toiling and suffering Messiah.

[Matthew 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 11:9</span></span>

A prophet? - He next asks whether they went to see a prophet. They had
regarded him as such, and Jesus tells them that in this their
apprehensions of him were correct.

More than a prophet - Sustaining a character more elevated and sacred
than the most distinguished of the ancient prophets. Those had been
regarded as the most eminent of the prophets who had most clearly
predicted the Messiah. Isaiah had been distinguished above all others
for the sublimity of his writings, and the clearness with which he had
foretold the coming of Christ. Yet John surpassed even him. He lived in
the time of the Messiah himself. He predicted his coming with still more
clarity. He was the instrument of introducing him to the nation. He was,
therefore, first among the prophets.

[Matthew 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 11:10</span></span>

For this is he ... - The passage of Scripture here quoted is found in
[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). The substance of it is
contained also in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md).

Prepare thy way - That is, to prepare "the people;" to make them ready,
by proper instructions, to receive the Messiah.

[Matthew 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 11:11</span></span>

Among them that are born of women - This is an emphatic way of saying
that there "had never" been a greater "man" than John. See [Job
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md).

He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he - The
phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used in many senses. See the notes at [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). It here probably means, "in
preaching the kingdom of God," or the gospel. It could hardly be
affirmed of the obscurest and most ignorant Christian that he had
clearer views than Isaiah or John; but of the apostles of the Saviour,
of the first preachers who were with him and who heard his instructions,
it might be said that they had more correct apprehensions than any of
the ancient prophets, or than John.

[Matthew 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 11:12</span></span>

And from the days of John ... - That is, from the days when John began
to preach. It is not known how long this was, but it was not probably
more than a year. Our Saviour here simply states a fact. He says there
was a great rush or a crowd pressing to hear John. Multitudes went out
to hear him, as if they were about to take the kingdom of heaven by
force. See [Mat 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md). So, he says, it
has continued. Since "the kingdom of heaven," or "the gospel," has been
preached, there has been a "rush" to it. People have been "earnest"
about it; they have come "pressing" to obtain the blessing, as if they
would take it by violence. There is allusion here to the manner in which
cities were taken. Besiegers "pressed" upon them with violence and
demolished the walls. With such "earnestness" and "violence," he says,
people had pressed around him and John since they began to preach. There
is no allusion here to the manner in which individual sinners seek
salvation, but it is a simple record of the fact that multitudes had
thronged around him and John to hear the gospel.

[Matthew 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 11:13</span></span>

All the prophets ... - It is meant by this verse that John introduced a
new dispensation; and that the old one, under which the prophets and the
law of Moses were the guide, was closed when he preached that the
kingdom of heaven was at hand. By the "law" is meant here the five books
of Moses; by the prophets, the remainder of the books of the Old
Testament.

[Matthew 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 11:14</span></span>

If ye will receive it - This is a mode of speaking implying that the
doctrine which he was about to state was different from their common
views; that he was about to state something which varied from the common
expectation, and which therefore they might be disposed to reject.

This is Elias ... - That is, "Elijah." Elias is the "Greek" mode of
writing the Hebrew word "Elijah." An account of him is found in the
first and second books of Kings. He was a distinguished prophet, and was
taken up to heaven in a chariot of fire, [Kg2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md). The prophet Malachi [Mal
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) predicted that "Elijah" would be
sent before the coming of the Messiah to prepare the way for him. By
this was evidently meant, not that he should appear "in person," but
that one should appear with a striking resemblance to him; or, as Luke
[Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md) expresses it, "in the spirit
and power of Elijah." But the Jews understood it differently. They
supposed that Elijah would appear in person. They also supposed that
Jeremiah and some other of the prophets would appear also to usher in
the promised Messiah and to grace his advent. See [Mat
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#014.md); [Mat
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010.md); [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md). This prevalent belief was the
reason why he used the words "if ye will receive it," implying that the
affirmation that "John" was the promised Elijah was a doctrine contrary
to their expectation.

[Matthew 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 11:15</span></span>

He that hath ears ... - This expression is frequently used by Christ. It
is a proverbial expression, implying that the highest attention should
be given to what was spoken. The doctrine about John he regarded as of
the greatest importance. He among you, says he, that has the faculty of
understanding this, or that will believe that this is the Elijah spoken
of, let him attend to it and remember it.

[Matthew 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 11:16</span></span>

But whereunto shall I liken ... - Christ proceeds to reprove the
inconsistency and fickleness of that age of people. He says they were
like children - nothing pleased them. He refers here to the "plays" or
"sports" of children. Instrumental music, or piping and dancing, were
used in marriages and festivals as a sign of joy. See the notes at [Isa
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md). Compare [Job
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011.md); [Sa2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md); [Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md); [Luk
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025.md). Children imitate their parents
and others, and act over in play what they see done by others. Among
their childish sports, therefore, was probably an imitation of a wedding
or festal occasion. We have seen also (the notes at [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023).md) that funerals were attended with
mournful music, and lamentation, and howling. It is not improbable that
children also, in play: imitated a mournful funeral procession. One part
are represented as sullen and dissatisfied. They would not enter into
the play: nothing pleased them. The others complained of it. We have,
said they, taken all pains to please you. We have piped to you, have
played lively tunes, and have engaged in cheerful sports, but you would
not join with us; and then we have played different games, and imitated
the mourning at funerals, and you are equally sullen; "you have not
lamented;" you have not joked with us. Nothing pleases you. So, said
Christ, is this generation of people. "John" came one way, "neither
eating nor drinking," abstaining as a Nazarite, and you were not pleased
with him. I, the Son of man, have come in a different manner, "eating
and drinking;" not practicing any austerity, but living like other
people, and you are equally dissatisfied - nay, you are less pleased.
You calumniate him, and abuse me for not doing the very thing which
displeased you in John. Nothing pleases you. You are fickle, changeable,
inconstant, and abusive.

Markets - Places to sell provisions; places of concourse, where also
children flocked together for play.

We have piped - We have played on musical instruments. A "pipe" was a
wind instrument of music often used by shepherds.

Neither eating nor drinking - That is, abstaining from some kinds of
food and wine, as a Nazarite. It does not mean that he did not eat at
all, but that he was remarkable for abstinence.

He hath a devil - He is actuated by a bad spirit. He is irregular,
strange, and cannot be a good man.

The Son of man came eating and drinking - That is, living as others do;
not practicing austerity; and they accuse him of being fond of excess,
and seeking the society of the wicked.

Gluttonous - One given to excessive eating.

Wine-bibber - One who drinks much wine. Jesus undoubtedly lived
according to the general customs of the people of his time. He did not
affect singularity; he did not separate himself as a Nazarite; he did
not practice severe austerities. He ate that which was common and drank
that which was common. As wine was a common article of beverage among
the people, he drank it. It was the pure juice of the grape, and for
anything that can be proved, it was without fermentation. In regard to
the kind of wine which was used, see the notes at [Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md). No one should plead the example,
at any rate, in favor of making use of the wines that are commonly used
in this country - wines, many of which are manufactured here, and
without a particle of the pure juice of the grape, and most of which are
mixed with noxious drugs to give them color and flavor.

Wisdom is justified of her children - The children of wisdom are the
wise - those who understand. The Saviour means that though that
generation of Pharisees and fault-finders did not appreciate the conduct
of John and himself, yet the "wise," the candid - those who understood
the reasons of their conduct - would approve of and do justice to it.

[Matthew 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 11:20</span></span>

Then began he to upbraid ... - That is, to reprove, to rebuke, to
denounce heavy judgment.

[Matthew 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 11:21</span></span>

Chorazin and Bethsaida - These were towns not far from Capernaum, but
the precise situation is unknown. See "The Land and the Book" (Thomson),
vol. ii. pp. 8, 9. Bethsaida means literally a "house of hunting" or "a
house of game," and it was probably situated on the banks of the Sea of
Galilee, and supported itself by hunting or fishing. It was the
residence of Philip, Andrew, and Peter, [Joh
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044.md). It was enlarged by Philip the
Tetrarch, and called "Julia," after the emperor's daughter.

Tyre and Sidon - These were cities of Phoenicia, formerly very opulent,
and distinguished for merchandise. They were situated on the shore of
the Mediterranean Sea, and were in the western part of Judea. They were
therefore well known to the Jews. Tyre is frequently mentioned in the
Old Testament as being the place through which Solomon derived many of
the materials for building the temple, [Ch2
2:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md). It was also a place against
which one of the most important and pointed prophecies of Isaiah was
directed. See the notes at Isa. 23. Compare [Eze
26:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#004.md). Both these cities were very
ancient. Sidon was situated within the bounds of the tribe of Asher [Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md), but this tribe could never get
possession of it, [Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md). It was
famous for its great trade and navigation. Its inhabitants were the
first remarkable merchants in the world, and were much celebrated for
their luxury. In the time of our Saviour it was probably a city of much
splendor and extensive commerce. It is now called Seide, or Saide, and
is far less populous and splendid than it was in the time of Christ. It
was subdued successively by the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Romans, the
latter of whom deprived it of its freedom.

Messrs. Fisk and King, American missionaries, passed through Sidon in
the summer of 1823, and estimated the population, as others have
estimated it, at 8,000 or 10,000; but Mr. Goodell, another American
missionary, took up his residence there in June, 1824, for the purpose
of studying the Armenian language with a bishop of the Armenian Church
who lives there, and of course had far better opportunities to know the
statistics of the place. He tells us there are six Muslim mosques, a
Jewish synagogue, a Maronite, Latin, and Greek church. Dr. Thomson ("The
Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 164) supposes that the population may now
be about 10,000 - about 6,800 Moslems, 850 Greek Catholics, 750
Maronites, 150 Greeks, and 300 Jews. It exports tobacco, oil, fruit, and
silk, but the amount of exports is small.

Tyre was situated about 20 miles south of Sidon. It was built partly on
a small island about 70 paces from the shore, and partly on the
mainland. It was a city of great extent and splendor, and extensive
commerce. It abounded in luxury and wickedness. It was often besieged.
It held out against Shalmaneser five years, and was taken by
Nebuchadnezzar after a siege of "thirteen" years. It was afterward
rebuilt, and was at length taken by Alexander the Great, after a most
obstinate siege of five months. There are no signs now of the ancient
city. It is the residence only of a few miserable fishermen, and
contains, amid the ruins of its former magnificence, only a few huts.
Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of Ezekiel: "Thou shalt be built no
more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again"
[Eze 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#021.md). For a description of Tyre
as it was formerly and as it is now, see the notes at Isa. 23.

In sackcloth and ashes - Sackcloth was a coarse cloth, like canvas, used
for the dress of the poor, and for the more common articles of domestic
economy. It was worn also as a sign of mourning. The Jews also
frequently threw ashes on their heads as expressive of grief, [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md); [Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012.md); [Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md). The meaning is, that they would
have repented with "expressions of deep sorrow." Like Nineveh, they
would have seen their guilt and danger, and would have turned from their
iniquities. "Heathen" cities would have received him better than the
cities of the Jews, his native land,

[Matthew 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 11:23</span></span>

And thou, Capernaum - See the notes at [Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md).

Which art exalted to heaven - This is an expression used to denote great
privileges. He meant that they were especially favored with instruction.
The city was prosperous. It was signally favored by its wealth. Most of
all, it was signally favored by the presence, the preaching, and the
miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here he spent a large portion of his
time in the early part of his ministry, and in Capernaum and its
neighborhood he performed his chief miracles.

Shalt be brought down to hell - This does not mean that all the people
would go to hell, but that the city which had flourished so prosperously
would lose its prosperity, and occupy the "lowest place" among cities.
The word "hell" is used here, not to denote a place of punishment in the
future world, but a state of "desolation and destructions." It stands in
contrast with the word "heaven." As their being exalted to heaven did
not mean that the "people" would all be saved or dwell in heaven, so
their being brought down to "hell" refers to the desolation of the
"city." Their privileges, honors, wealth, etc., would be taken away, and
they would sink as low among cities as they had been before exalted.
This has been strictly fulfilled. In the wars between the Jews and the
Romans, Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, etc., were so completely
desolated that it is difficult to determine their former situation. See
the notes at [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md). It is not to
be denied, also, that he threatened future punishment on those who
rejected him. The truth inculcated is, that those who are especially
favored will be punished accordingly if they abuse their privileges.

If the mighty works ...had been done in Sodom - See the notes at [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015.md). Sodom was destroyed on account
of its great wickedness. Christ says if his miracles had been performed
there, they would have repented, and consequently the city would not
have been destroyed. As it was, it would be better for Sodom in the day
of judgment than for Capernaum, for its inhabitants would not be called
to answer for the abuse of so great privileges.

[Matthew 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 11:25</span></span>

From the wise and prudent - That is, from those who "thought" themselves
wise - "wise" according to the world's estimation of wisdom, [Co1
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md).

Hast revealed them unto babes - To the poor, the ignorant, and the
obscure; the teachable, the simple, the humble. By the wise and prudent
here he had reference probably to the proud and haughty scribes and
Pharisees in Capernaum. They rejected his gospel, but it was the
pleasure of God to reveal it to obscure and more humble people. The
reason given, the only satisfactory reason, is, that it so seemed good
in the sight of God. In this the Saviour acquiesced, saying, "Even so,
Father;" and in the dealings of God it is proper that all should
acquiesce. "Such is the will of God" is often the only explanation which
can be offered in regard to the various events which happen to us on
earth. "Such is the will of God" is the only account which can be given
of the reason of the dispensations of his grace. Our understanding is
often confounded. We are unsuccessful in all our efforts at explanation.
Our philosophy fails, and all that we can say is, "Even so, Father; for
so it seems good to thee." And this is enough. That God does a thing,
is, after all, the best reason which we "can" have that it is right. It
is a "security" that nothing wrong is done; and though now mysterious,
yet light will hereafter shine upon it like the light of noonday. I have
more certainty that a thing is right if I can say that I know such is
the will of God, than I could have by depending on my own reason. In the
one case I confide in the infallible and most perfect God; in the other
I rely on the reason of a frail and erring man. God never errs; but
nothing is more common than for people to err.

[Matthew 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 11:27</span></span>

All things are delivered ... - The same doctrine is clearly taught often
in the New Testament. See [Joh 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md);
[Joh 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md); [Joh
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md); [Col
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). It means that Christ has
control over all things for the good of his church; that the government
of the universe is committed to him "as Mediator," that he may redeem
his people and guide them to glory, [Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md).

No man knoweth the Son - That is, such is the nature of the Son of God,
such the mystery of the union between the divine and human nature, such
his exalted character as "divine," that no mortal can fully comprehend
Jesus. None but God fully knows him. If he had been only a mere man,
this language surely would not have been used of him.

Neither knoweth any man the Father ... - In the original this is,
neither knoweth "anyone" the Father except the Son. That is, no man or
angel clearly and fully comprehends the character of the infinite God;
none but the Son - the Lord Jesus - and he to whom he makes him known,
have any just apprehensions of his being and perfections.

[Matthew 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 11:28</span></span>

All ye that labour and are heavy laden - The Saviour here, perhaps,
refers primarily to the Jews, who groaned under the weight of their
ceremonial laws and the traditions of the elders, [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md). He tells them that by coming to
him, and embracing the new system of religion, they would be freed from
these burdensome rites and ceremonies. There can be no doubt, however,
that he meant here chiefly to address the poor, lost, ruined sinner: the
man "burdened" with a consciousness of his transgressions, trembling at
his danger, and seeking deliverance. For such there is relief. Christ
tells them to come to him, to believe in him, and to trust him, and him
only, for salvation. Doing this, he will give them rest - rest from
their sins, from the alarms of conscience, from the terrors of the law,
and from the fears of eternal death.

[Matthew 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 11:29</span></span>

Take my yoke - This is a figure taken from the use of oxen, and hence
signifying to labor for one, or in the service of anyone. The "yoke" is
used in the Bible as an emblem:

\(1\) of bondage or slavery, [Lev
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md); [Deu
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038.md).

\(2\) of afflictions or crosses, [Lam
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027.md).

\(3\) of the punishment of sin, [Lam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md),

\(4\) of the commandments of God.

\(5\) of legal ceremonies, [Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md);
[Gal 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md).

It refers here to the religion of the Redeemer; and the idea is, that
they should embrace his system of religion and obey him. All virtue and
all religion imply "restraint" - the restraint of our bad passions and
inclinations - and subjection to laws; and the Saviour here means to say
that the restraints and laws of his religion are mild, and gentle, and
easy. Let anyone compare them with the burdensome and expensive
ceremonies of the Jews (see [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md), or with the religious rites of
the pagan everywhere, or with the requirements of the Popish system, and
he will see how true it is that Jesus' yoke is easy. And let his laws
and requirements be compared with the laws which sin imposes on its
votaries - the laws of fashion, and honor, and sensuality - and he will
feel that religion is "freedom," [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036.md). "He is a freeman whom the truth
makes free, and all are slaves besides." It is "easier" to be a
Christian than a sinner; and of all the yokes ever imposed on people,
that of the Redeemer is the lightest.

For I am meek ... - See the notes at [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md). This was eminently Christ's
personal character. But this is not its meaning here. He is giving a
reason why they should embrace his religion. That was, that he was not
harsh, overbearing, and oppressive, like the Pharisees, but meek, mild,
and gentle in his government. His laws were reasonable and tender, and
it would be easy to obey him.

[Matthew 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 11:30</span></span>

My yoke is easy ... - That is, the services that I shall require are
easily rendered. They are not burdensome, like all other systems of
religion. So the Christian always finds them. In coming to him there is
"a peace which passeth all understanding;" in believing in him, "joy;"
in following him "through evil and good report," a comfort "which the
world giveth not;" in bearing trials and in persecution, "the hope of
glory;" and in keeping his commandments, great reward.

Remarks On Matthew 11

1\. A spirit of inquiry about the person and works of Christ is
especially proper, [Mat 11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md). John
was solicitous to ascertain his true character, and nothing is of more
importance for all than to understand his true character. Upon him
depends all the hope that man has of happiness beyond the grave. He
saves, or man must perish. "He" will save, or we must die forever. With
what earnestness, therefore, should the old and the young inquire into
his character. Our eternal all demands it; and while this is delayed, we
are endangering our everlasting felicity.

2\. Clear proof has been furnished that Jesus is the Christ and can save
us, [Mat 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#004.md). If his miracles did
not prove that he came from God, nothing can prove it. If he could open
the eyes of the blind, then he can enlighten the sinner; if he could
unstop the ears of the deaf, then he can cause us to hear and live; if
he could heal the sick, and make the lame walk, then he can heal our
spiritual maladies, and make us walk in the way of life; if he could
raise the dead, then he can raise those dead in sin, and breathe into us
the breath of eternal life. If he was willing to do all this for the
body which is soon to perish, then he will be much more willing to do it
for the soul, that never dies. Then the poor, lost sinner may come and
live.

3\. We see in this chapter Christ's manner of praising or complimenting
men, [Mat 11:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md). He gave, in no
measured terms, his exalted opinion of John - gave him praise which had
been bestowed on no other mortal ranked him far above the purest and
sublimest of the prophets. But this was not done in the presence of
John, "nor was it done in the presence of those who would inform John of
it." It was when the disciples of John had "departed," and his
commendation of John was spoken to "the multitude," [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md). He waited until his disciples
were gone, apprehending, doubtless, that they would be likely to report
what he said in praise of their master, and then expressed his high
opinion of his character. The practice of the world is to praise others
to their faces, or in the presence of those who will be sure to inform
them of it, and to speak evil of them when absent. Jesus delivered his
unfavorable opinions of others to the people themselves; their
excellences he took pains to commend where they would not be likely to
hear of them. He did good to both, and in both prevented the existence
of pride.

4\. The wicked take much pains, and are often fickle and inconsistent,
for the sake of abusing and calumniating religious people, [Mat
11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#018.md). They found much fault with
the Saviour for doing the very same thing which they blamed John for not
doing. So it is commonly with people who slander professors of religion.
They risk their own characters, to prove that others are hypocrites or
sinners. The object is not truth, but calumny and opposition to
religion; and hitherto no means have been too base or too wicked to pour
contempt on the followers of Christ.

5\. The purest characters may expect the shaft of calumny and malice,
and often in proportion to their purity, [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md). Even the Saviour of the world
was accused of being intemperate and a glutton. If the only perfectly
pure being that ever trod the earth was thus accused, let not his
followers think that any strange thing has happened to them if they are
falsely accused.

6\. Judgments will overtake guilty people, and cities, and nations, [Mat
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md). They fell on Sodom, Tyre,
Sidon, and Capernaum. They may long linger; but in due time the hand of
God will fall on the wicked, and they will die - forever die.

7\. The wicked will suffer in proportion to their privileges, [Mat
11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md). So it was with Capernaum.
And if they of ancient days suffered thus; if more tremendous judgments
fell on them than even on guilty Sodom, what shall be the doom of those
who go down to hell from this day of light? The Saviour was indeed there
a few days; he worked a few miracles; but they had not, as we have, all
his instructions; they had not Sunday schools, and Bible classes, and
the stated preaching of the gospel, nor was the world blessed then, as
now, with extensive and powerful revivals of religion. How awful must be
the doom of those who are educated in the ways of religion - who are
instructed from Sabbath to Sabbath - who grow up amid the means of grace
- and then are lost!

8\. The poor and needy; the weary and heavy-ladened; the soul sick of
sin and of the world; the sinner conscious of guilt and afraid to die,
may come to Jesus Christ and live, [Mat
11:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). The invitation is wide as
the world. The child and the old man may seek and find salvation at the
feet of the same Saviour. No child is too young; no man is too old: no
one is too great a sinner. Christ is "full" of mercy, and all who come
shall find peace. O how should we, in this sinful and miserable world,
borne down with sin, and exposed each moment to death - how should we
come and find the peace which he has promised to all, and take the yoke
which all have found to be light!
