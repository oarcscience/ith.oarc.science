### [Numbers Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001)

[Numbers 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 33:1</span></span>

This list was written out by Moses at God's command [Num
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002), doubtless as a memorial of God's
providential care for His people throughout this long and trying period.

[Num 33:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003). For these places, see the
marginal reference.

[Num 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008)

Pi-hahiroth - Hebrew "Hahiroth," but perhaps only by an error of
transcription. However, the omitted "pi" is only a common Egyptian
prefix.

Wilderness of Etham - i. e., that part of the great wilderness of Shur
which adjoined Etham; compare [Exo
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022) note.

The list of stations up to that at Sinai agrees with the narrative of
Exodus except that we have here mentioned [Num
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#010) an encampment by the Red Sea,
and two others, Dophkah and Alush [Num
33:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#012), which are there omitted. On
these places see [Exo 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001) note.

[Num 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016), [Num
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#017)

See the [Num 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035) note.

[Num 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#018)

Rithmah - The name of this station is derived from retem, the
broom-plant, the "juniper" of the King James Version. This must be the
same encampment as that which is said in [Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026) to have been at Kadesh.

[Num 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#019)

Rimmon-parez - Or rather Rimmon-perez, i. e., "Rimmon (i. e., the
Pomegranate) of the Breach." It may have been here that the sedition of
Korah occurred.

Verse 19-36

The stations named are those visited during the years of penal
wandering. The determination of their positions is, in many cases,
difficult, because during this period there was no definite line of
march pursued. But it is probable that the Israelites during this period
did not overstep the boundaries of the wilderness of Paran (as defined
in [Num 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012)), except to pass along
the adjoining valley of the Arabah; while the tabernacle and organized
camp moved about from place to place among them (compare [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001)).

Rissah, Haradah, and Tahath are probably the same as Rasa, Aradeh, and
Elthi of the Roman tables. The position of Hashmonah (Heshmon in [Jos
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#027)) in the Azazimeh mountains
points out the road followed by the children of Israel to be that which
skirts the southwestern extremity of Jebel Magrah.

[Num 33:34](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#034)

Ebronah - i. e, "passage." This station apparently lay on the shore of
the Elanitic gulf, at a point where the ebb of the tide left a ford
across. Hence, the later Targum renders the word as "fords."

[Num 33:35](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#035)

Ezion-gaber - "Giant's backbone." The Wady Ghadhyan, a valley running
eastward into the Arabah some miles north of the present head of the
Elanitic gulf. A salt marsh which here overspreads a portion of the
Arabah may be taken as indicating the limit to which the sea anciently
reached; and we may thus infer the existence here in former times of an
extensive tidal haven, at the head of which the city of Ezion-geber
stood. Here it was that from the time of Solomon onward the Jewish navy
was constructed [Kg1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026); [Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049).

[Num 33:41-49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#041)

Zalmonah and Punon are stations on the Pilgrim's road; and the general
route is fairly ascertained by a comparison of these verses with [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004), etc.

[Numbers 33:50](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 33:50</span></span>

The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments
of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and
[Num 33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054) is substantially a
repetition from Exo. 26:53-55. But the solemn warning of [Num
33:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055) is new. A call for it had
been furnished by their past transgressions in the matter of Baal-peor,
and by their imperfect fulfillment, at the first, of Moses' orders in
the Midianite war.
