### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 6:1</span></span>

Again - It should be, "and David again gathered," etc., i. e. after the
previous gathering, either for his election to the kingdom [Sa2
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md) or for the Philistine war [Sa2
5:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md), he assembled them again for
the peaceful purpose of bringing up the ark to Mount Zion (see marginal
reference). The whole narrative indicates the progressive consolidation
of David's power, and the settlement of his monarchy on strong
foundations.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 6:2</span></span>

From Baale of Judah - See the margin and [Sa1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021.md) note.

Whose name ... - The literal rendering is, "Upon which is called the
Name, the Name of Yahweh of Hosts, who sits upon the cherubim," i. e.
the ark which is called after the Lord of Hosts and bears His Name (see
[Deu 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010.md); [Kg1
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#043.md); [Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 6:3</span></span>

The house of Abinadab in Gibeah - . Rather, on the hill (as in margin
and [Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001).md). It does not at all
follow that Abinadab was still alive, nor can we conclude from Uzzah and
Ahio being called sons of Abinadab, that they were literally his
children. They may well have been sons of Eleazar and grandsons of
Abinadab, or yet more remote descendants; since there is no distinct
evidence that Abinadab was alive even when the ark was brought to
Kirjath-jearim. The house may have retained the name of "the house of
Abinadab" long after his death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 6:5</span></span>

Played - i. e. danced to music vocal and instrumental (see [Jdg
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025) note.md).

Cornets - Rather, from the etymology of the Hebrew word (to shake), and
their being coupled with the cymbals, and being rendered sistra in the
Vulgate, some kind of instrument with bells or rings, which gave a sound
by being shaken.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 6:6</span></span>

Shook it - The use of the Heb. word here is unusual. Some take the word
as in [Kg2 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033.md), and render the
passage: "The oxen were throwing, or had thrown it down," very likely by
turning aside to eat what grain there might be on the threshing-floor.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 6:7</span></span>

For his error - The Hebrew is difficult, and some prefer the reading of
the parallel passage, "because ... ask" [Ch1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 6:8</span></span>

Displeased - Grief allied to anger seems to be intended. Compare [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md) note. On the name of the place,
compare [Sa2 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 6:10</span></span>

Obed-edom was a Levite of the family of Merari, being [Ch1
15:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018.md); [Ch1
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038.md) a son of Jeduthun, who was a
Merarite. He was a porter, a player on the harp, and was one of the
Levites especially designated to take part in the musical services on
the occasion of bringing up the ark to Zion, and to minister before it
when brought up. He is called a Gittite perhaps from Gath-Rimmon, in
Manasseh, which belonged to the Kohathites [Jos
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025.md). Marriage with a Kohathite, or
some other cause, would account for his dwelling in a Kohathite city.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 6:12</span></span>

With gladness - Especially with joyful music and song ([Ch1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016), etc..md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 6:13</span></span>

The meaning is, not that they sacrificed oxen and fatlings every six
steps, which would have been impossible, but that when - after the
arrangement made by David for the Levites to carry the ark [Ch1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002.md), [Ch1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md), [Ch1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#015.md) they had borne it successfully
and with visible tokens of God's favor, out of the house of Obed-edom
and six "steps" on the road to the city of David to the sound of the
musical instruments - then they stopped and offered solemn sacrifices.
Possibly "the step" may have had a technical sense, and denoted a
certain distance, say a stadium. Six such distances would have been
nearly a mile, and if the ground was difficult and steep, the successful
progress of "those that bare the ark," so far, would have been a fit
cause for a thanksgiving sacrifice.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 6:14</span></span>

Danced - The Hebrew word is found only here and in [Sa2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016.md). It means "to dance in a circle,"
hence, simply to dance. The parallel passage in [Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md) gives a widely different sense.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 6:16</span></span>

She despised him in her heart - In the days of Saul the ark had been
neglected [Ch1 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003.md), and Saul had in
everything shown himself to be an irreligious king. Michal seems to have
been of a like spirit.

The whole section, 2Sa. 6:16-36, should be compared with [Ch1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029.md); [Ch1
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043.md).

The peace offerings were with a special view to feasting the people.
(Compare [Kg1 8:63-66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063)..md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 6:18</span></span>

He blessed the people - So did Solomon [Kg1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 6:19</span></span>

A good piece of flesh - The word thus paraphrased is only found here and
in marginal reference A piece of meat from the peace offerings is
probably meant. From the fact that the chronicler explains the preceding
cake by the more common word loaf, but leaves this obscure word
unexplained, one might infer that it was already obsolete and unknown in
his time. The Septuagint translates it: "a cake baked on the hearth;"
the Vulgate "a piece of roast beef."

A flagon of wine - Rather, "a cake" of grapes or raisins [Hos
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md); [Sol
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md), or made with oil or mead.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 6:20</span></span>

Then David returned ... - He had passed his house to accompany the ark
to the tabernacle he had pitched for it, when Michal saw him dancing. He
now returns to bless his household. He had blessed the people [Sa2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018.md), but there were the inmates of
his own house whom the customs of the age did not allow to be present,
and so, with his usual considerate kindness and affection, David came to
bless them also on this solemn occasion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 6:21</span></span>

Play - See [Sa2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md) note. The speech
might be paraphrased, Before the Lord which chose me, etc., yea, before
the Lord have I danced. He humbles Michal's pride by the allusion to her
father's rejection, and shows by Saul's example how little pride
contributes to the stability of greatness. Therefore, for his part, he
will not think anything done for the glory of God too mean for him; and
if he cannot have honor from Saul's daughter, he will be content to be
honored by the maid-servants.
