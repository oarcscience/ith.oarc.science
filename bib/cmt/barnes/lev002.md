### [Leviticus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

[Leviticus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 2:1</span></span>

A meat offering - Better translated in [Lev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004) an oblation of a meat offering
קרבן qorbân, see [Lev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002) מנחה
mı̂nchāh. signifies literally a "gift"; and it appears to have been
applied especially to what was given by an inferior to a superior [Gen
32:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#018); [Gen
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#011); [Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015); [Sa1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027) : but in the technical language
of the Law, it regularly denoted the vegetable offerings as
distinguished from the animal offerings. Our translators have rendered
it "meat-offering", applying the word "meat", according to old usage, as
a general term for food. Vegetable-offering or meal-offering would be a
more convenient rendering.

The meaning of the מנחה mı̂nchāh appears to be much more simple than that
of the animal sacrifices. The מנחה mı̂nchāh, as a sacrifice, was
something surrendered to God, which was of the greatest value to man as
a means of living. It might thus seem to be merely eucharistic. But it
should not be overlooked that the grain had been modified, and made
useful, by man's own labor. Hence, it has been supposed that the מנחה
mı̂nchāh expressed a confession that all our good works are performed in
God and are due to Him.

The order in which the kinds of offering are named agrees with their
development in order of time. The burnt-offering and the מנחה mı̂nchāh
answer to the first two offerings on record [Gen
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003); [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022).

Three kinds of מנחה mı̂nchāh are here mentioned; (1) [Lev
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001); (2) [Lev
2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004); (3) [Lev
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014). Of each of them a small
portion was burned on the altar "for a memorial," and the remainder was
given to the priests. The offerings of flour belonged to the priests at
large, but those of cakes and wafers to the officiating priests, [Lev
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009). Instructions to the priests
are given in [Lev 6:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014).

Fine flour - finely bolted flour of wheat. It was probably always
presented in a bowl, compare [Num
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013).

Oil - For the purpose of anointing and as food; in both senses a symbol
of divine grace.

Frankincense - See the [Exo 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034)
note.

[Leviticus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 2:2</span></span>

Better: "And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests; and the
(officiating) priest shall take from it," etc.

Memorial - The regular name not only for the portion of the מנחה mı̂nchāh
which was burned on the altar [Lev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009), [Lev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016); [Lev
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#012); [Lev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#015); [Num
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#026), but for the frankincense which
was laid upon the showbread [Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007).
It is the word which is applied to the prayers and alms of Cornelius,
[Act 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004).

[Leviticus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 2:3</span></span>

A thing most holy - literally, a holy of holies. All offerings were
holy, including the portions of the peace-offerings which were eaten by
the laity; but that was "most holy" of which every part was devoted
either to the altar, or to the use of the priests. Such were the
minchaahs, the showbread, the incense, and the flesh of the
sin-offerings and trespass-offerings. Compare the similar distinction
between places [Exo 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033). The most
holy food was eaten in "the holy place," that is the precinct of the
tabernacle, probably in the priests' lodgings; but the priests' portion
of the peace-offerings might be eaten by the priests and their families
in any "clean place" [Lev 10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012).

[Leviticus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 2:4</span></span>

The four kinds of bread and the three cooking utensils which are
mentioned in this section were probably such as were in common use in
the daily life of the Israelites; and there appears no reason to doubt
that they were such as are still used in the East. The variety of the
offerings was most likely permitted to suit the different circumstances
of the worshippers.

[Lev 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004)

Oven - This was probably a portable vessel of earthenware; in shape a
cone about 3 ft. 6 in. high, and 1 ft. 6 in. in diameter. Similar jars
are now used for the same purpose by the Arabs. After the vessel has
been thoroughly heated by a fire lighted in the inside, the cakes are
placed within it, and the top is covered up until they are sufficiently
baked. Meantime the outside of the vessel is turned to account. Dough
rolled out very thin is spread over it, and a sort of wafer is produced
considerably thinner than a Scotch oat-cake.

[Lev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005)

A pan - Rather, as in the margin, a flat plate. It was probably of
earthenware, like the oven.

[Lev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006)

Part it in pieces - Break, not cut. The Bedouins are in the habit of
breaking up their cakes when warm and mixing the fragments with butter
when that luxury can be obtained.

[Lev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#007)

Fryingpan - Rather, pan, commonly used for boiling. It is possible that
the cakes here spoken of were boiled in oil. The "pan" and the "frying
pan" [Lev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005), [Lev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#007) may have been the common cooking
implements of the poorest of the people.

[Leviticus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 2:11</span></span>

As for the oblation of the firstfruits - Rather, As an oblation of
firstfruits. The words refer to the leaven and honey mentioned in [Lev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011) which might be offered among the
firstfruits and tithes ([Deu 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002),
[Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012); compare [Ch2
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005)). Honey, being used to produce
fermentation, and leaven (or, a small piece of fermented dough) were
excluded because fermentation was an apt symbol of the working of
corruption in the human heart.

[Leviticus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 2:13</span></span>

With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt - Not only every מנחה
mı̂nchāh, but every animal offering was to be accompanied by salt. It was
the one symbol which was never absent from the altar of burnt-offering,
showing the imperishablness of the love of Yahweh for His people. In its
unalterable nature, it is the contrary of leaven (yeast). The Arabs are
said to retain in common use the expression, "a covenant of salt;" and
the respect they pay to bread and salt in their rites of hospitality is
well known.

[Leviticus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 2:14</span></span>

Green ears of corn - Rather, "fresh ears of corn;" that is, just-ripe
grain, freshly gathered. Parched grain, such as is here spoken of, is a
common article of food in Syria and Egypt, and was very generally eaten
in ancient times.

Beaten out - Not rubbed out by the hands, as described in [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001), but bruised or crushed so as to
form groats.
