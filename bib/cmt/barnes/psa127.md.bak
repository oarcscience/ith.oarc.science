### [Psalms Chapter 127](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 127:0</span></span>

This psalm is entitled "A Song of Degrees for Solomon;" in the margin,
"Of Solomon." In the Syriac Version the title is, "From the Psalms of
the Ascent; spoken by David concerning Solomon; it was spoken also of
Haggai and Zechariah, who urged the rebuilding of the Temple." The
meaning of the title may be either "for Solomon," or of Solomon; that
is, it may have been either composed by him, or with reference to him.
Many have supposed that it was written by David near the close of his
life, and was designed to be a guide to Solomon, his successor, in
regard to the principles which should govern him in his reign. There is
nothing, however, in the title in the Hebrew which would indicate that
it was composed by David; and there is nothing in the psalm which would
seem to be especially appropriate to address to a young monarch just
entering on his reign, unless it was the mere filet of dependence on
God. The allusion to children [Psa
127:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md), beautiful and proper as it
is, would seem to have no particular pertinency to an entrance on the
administration of a government, and would not be the topic which Would
most naturally be suggested in such circumstances. The probability,
therefore, is, that the psalm was composed by Solomon. On what occasion,
however, it was written, it is now impossible to determine. The
sentiments and style are such as agree well with the idea that Solomon
was the author, and the whole psalm might have been introduced into the
Book of Proverbs without any manifest discrepancy with the general
character and style of that book. From the psalm itself it would seem
that it was composed mainly with reference to one who was entering on
domestic life, and that it was intended to set before such a one the
views which ought to guide him, or the thoughts which ought to occur to
him. Nothing could be more appropriate in such circumstances than the
sentiments of the psalm:

I. The entire dependence on God for success, [Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md).

II\. The vanity of all efforts - rising early, and sitting up late -
without the divine blessing, [Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md).

III\. The fact that children belong to God, and are to be regarded as
his, [Psa 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md).

IV\. The aid which children might be expected to render to a father in
supporting or defending him, [Psa
127:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004.md).

V. The comfort which he might expect to derive from them, and the honor
which, being properly trained, they would reflect on him and on the
family, [Psa 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 127:1</span></span>

Except the Lord build the house - Or rather, "a house." The word "house"
may refer either to an ordinary dwelling; to the temple, as a place of
worship; or to a family, with reference to its success and prosperity,
as the word house is often used now. The statement is universal, and is
designed to indicate a universal dependence on God in human
undertakings, though it is not improbable that there may have been an
allusion, when the psalm was composed, to some building which was
contemplated or commenced. If the psalm was a composition of David or
Solomon, the allusion way have been to the temple about to be erected.
The language, however, is so general as to be applicable to any
enterprise of that kind.

They labor in vain that build it - literally, "In vain toil its builders
in it." The idea is, that they are entirely dependent on God. No matter
what their skill, their strength, their industry may be - all will be in
vain unless God shall assist them. They are dependent on Him for life,
for health, for strength, for practical wisdom, for a disposition to
continue their work, and for success in it. Their work might be
destroyed by fire, by a tempest, by an earthquake, or by an irruption of
enemies; and for the result, therefore, they are entirely dependent on
God.

Except the Lord keep the city - The same idea of dependence is here
repeated in another form. The preservation of a city depends wholly on
God, whatever care or precaution may be used.

The watchman waketh but in vain - literally, "In vain waketh the
keeper." The word rendered waketh means to be sleepless; and then, to
watch. The allusion is to the watch or guard appointed to keep a city,
and the idea is, that, whatever may be the diligence, the care, the
fidelity of one thus appointed to guard a city, its safe-keeping must
depend on God alone. Fires may break out in spite of the watchmen; a
tempest may sweep over it; bands of armed people may assail it; or the
pestilence may suddenly come into it, and spread desolation through its
dwellings. There may have been an allusion in this to some immediate
arrangement for guarding Jerusalem when the psalm was composed; but the
remark is so general that it is not necessary to confine it to that. It
is universally true that, after all the care for their own preservation
which people can employ, their safety depends wholly on God.

[Psalms 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 127:2</span></span>

It is vain for you to rise up early - The psalmist does not here say
that it is improper to rise early; or that there could be no advantage
in it; or that people would be more likely to be successful in their
undertakings if they did not rise early; but that, although this was
done, they would be still altogether dependent on God. Mere early
rising, without his blessing, would not secure what they hoped to
accomplish, for everything is still in the hand of God. Health,
strength, clearness of mind, and success, are all under his control; and
though early rising may tend to produce all these - as it does in fact -
yet still people are not the less dependent on God for success.

To sit up late - That you may labor or study. As in the former case the
psalmist does not express any opinion about the propriety or impropriety
of early rising, so it is in respect to this. He merely says that if it
is done, this, of itself, will not accomplish the object; people are
still dependent on God for success though they do it. As a matter of
fact, however, sitting up late has less tendency to promote success in
life than early rising; but in either ease there is the same dependence
on God.

To eat the bread of sorrows - Bread of care, anxiety, or trouble; that
is, bread earned or procured by the severity of toil. There may be an
allusion here to the original sentence pronounced on man, [Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017.md). The meaning is, that it is in
vain that you labor hard, that you exhaust your strength, in order to
get bread to eat, unless God shall bless you. After all your toil the
result is with him.

For so he giveth his beloved sleep - The word "for" is not in the
original, The sentence is very obscure in the connection in which it
stands. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render it, "Ye who eat the
bread of care - rise when you have rested - when he hath given his
beloved sleep." Some have supposed it to mean that God gives his people
rest without toil, or that, while others labor, his "beloved" - his
friends - sleep; but this interpretation is not necessarily demanded by
the Hebrew, and is inconsistent with the general doctrine of the Bible.
Others have supposed the idea to be, that God gives his beloved rest
after labor; but though this is true, it is not true of them especially
or exclusively. Some suppose, with as little probability, that the
meaning is, that what others hope (but hope in vain) to get by labor,
the Lord bestows upon his people in sleep, they know not how.

The meaning evidently is, that God bestows "sleep" upon his people in
some sense in which it is not bestowed on others, or that there is, in
regard to their case, something in which they differ from those who are
so anxious and troubled - who rise so early for the sake of gain - who
toil so late - who eat the bread of care. The idea seems to be that
there would be calmness, repose, freedom from anxiety or solicitude. God
makes the mind of his people - his beloved - calm and tranquil, while
the world around is filled with anxiety and restlessness - busy,
bustling, worried. As a consequence of this calmness of mind, and of
their confidence in him, they enjoy undisturbed repose at night. They
are not kept wakeful and anxious about their worldly affairs as other
men are, for they leave all with God, and thus he "giveth his beloved
sleep." The particle "so" - כן kên - or "thus," I apprehend, refers to
the general sense of what had been said, rather than to what immediately
precedes it; to the fact that all success depends on God [Psa
127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md), and that it is always by his
interposition, and not as the result of human skill, toil, or fatigue,
that people find calmness, success, repose. It is only by the favor of
God, and by their recognizing their dependence on him, that they find
repose, success, and freedom from care.

[Psalms 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 127:3</span></span>

Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord - They are an inheritance
derived from the Lord. They are bestowed by him as really as success is
in building a house, or in guarding a city. The idea is, that everything
which we value, or which we desire, is a gift from God, and is to be
received as from him, and to be acknowledged as his gift. The general
idea here, as in the previous verses, is that of entire dependence on
God.

And the fruit of the womb is his reward - Or rather, "a reward;" that
is, they are of the nature of a reward for a life of devotion to God;
they are among the blessings which God promises, and are evidences of
his favor. Our translation by inserting the words "is his" obscures the
sense, as if the meaning were that they belong to God as his "reward"
for what he does for us. The reverse of this is the true idea - that
they are a blessing with which he rewards or favors his people. Of
course, this is not universally true, but the promise is a general one,
in accordance with the usual promises in the Bible in regard to the
result of piety. Children are to be reckoned among the divine favors
bestowed on us, and for their lives, their health, their virtues, and
the happiness derived from them, we are, as in other things, dependent
on him - as in building a house, in guarding a city, or in the rest and
comfort derived from toil.

[Psalms 127:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 127:4</span></span>

As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man - They are what a parent may
rely on for defense in danger, or for help in securing provision for
himself and family - as the warrior or the hunter relies on his arrows.

So are children of the youth - Sons in their youth; in their prime and
vigor. The comparison of sons with arrows or spears is common in Arabic
poetry. See Rosenmuller, Com. in loc. Also Morgenland, in loc.

[Psalms 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 127:5</span></span>

Happy is the man - Hebrew, The happiness of the man. See the notes at
[Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md).

That hath his quiver full of them - The quiver is a case in which arrows
are carried; and as a man - a hunter or warrior - feels secure when he
has his quiver full of arrows, so a man is blessed in proportion to the
number of his sons. This is in accordance with the idea often presented
in the Bible, and the promise often made there of a numerous posterity
as a proof of the divine favor.

They shall not be ashamed - They shall not turn back discomfited,
hanging their heads with shame and confusion. See the notes at [Job
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#020.md).

But they shall speak with the enemies in the gate - Margin, "shall
subdue, or destroy." The Hebrew word, however, means "to speak;" and the
meaning is, that they would "speak" to their foes in the place of
conflict - for a battle occurred often in the gate of a city, as the
possession of a gate, or an entrance to a city was of so much importance
to those who attacked, and those who defended it. The idea is, that they
would speak with effect; they would distinguish themselves; they would
let their presence be known. The connection does not allow us to
understand this of forensic controversy, or of transactions in business,
though these were usually performed at the gates of cities. The meaning
is, that they would do honor to the family, and gratify the heart of the
parent, by their valor in defending their city and home, or in attacking
the cities of the enemies of their country. The psalm is designed to
inculcate the lesson of dependence on God for success in everything.
