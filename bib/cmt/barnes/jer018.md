### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 18:1</span></span>

In the first prophecy of the series Jer. 18, the fate of Jerusalem was
still undetermined; a long line of kings might yet reign there in
splendor, and the city be inhabited forever. This was possible only so
long as it was still undecided whether Josiah's efforts would end in a
national reformation or not, and before Jehoiakim threw the weight of
the kingly office into the opposite balance. In the present prophecy
mercy is still offered to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but they reject
it [Jer 18:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md). They have made their
final choice: and thereupon follows the third prophecy of "the broken
vessel" [Jer 19:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md) in which the
utter overthrow of city and kingdom is foretold. We should thus place
this prophecy of the potter very early in the reign of Jehoiakim; and
that of the broken vessel at the commencement of his fourth year. This
internal evidence is confirmed by external proof.

[Jeremiah 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 18:2</span></span>

House - i. e., workshop. The clay-field where the potters exercised
their craft lay to the south of Jerusalem just beyond the valley of
Hinnom. Compare [Zac 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013.md); [Mat
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 18:3</span></span>

The wheels - literally, "the two wheels." The lower one was worked by
the feet to give motion to the upper one, which was a flat disc or plate
of wood, on which the potter laid the clay, and moulded it with his
fingers as it revolved rapidly.

[Jeremiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 18:6</span></span>

So are ye in mine hand - When a vessel was ruined, the potter did not
throw it away, but crushed it together, dashed it back upon the wheel,
and began his work afresh, until the clay had taken the predetermined
shape. It was God's purpose that Judaea should become the proper scene
for the manifestation of the Messiah, and her sons be fit to receive the
Saviour's teaching and carry the good tidings to all lands. If therefore
at any stage of the preparation the Jewish nation took such a course as
would have frustrated this purpose of Providence, it was crushed by
affliction into an unresisting mass, in which the formative process
began again immediately.

[Jeremiah 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 18:7</span></span>

At what instant - literally, "in a moment." Here, "at one time - at
another time."

[Jeremiah 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 18:8</span></span>

I will repent of the evil ... I will repent of the good - All God's
dealings with mankind are here declared to be conditional. God changeth
not, all depends upon man's conduct.

[Jeremiah 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 18:11</span></span>

The word rendered "frame" is a present participle, and is the same which
as a noun means "a potter." God declares that He is as free to do what
He will with the Jews as the potter is free to shape as he will the
clay.

Devise a device - "I am purposing a purpose."

[Jeremiah 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 18:12</span></span>

And they said - Better, But they say.

Imagination - Or, stubbornness, see [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md).

[Jeremiah 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 18:13</span></span>

The contrast between the chaste retirement of a virgin and Judah's
eagerness after idolatry, serves to heighten the horror at her conduct.

[Jeremiah 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 18:14</span></span>

Rather, "Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?" The
meaning probably is, "Will the snow of Lebanon fail from its rocks which
tower above the land of Israel?" The appeal of the prophet is to the
unchangeableness of one of nature's most beautiful phenomena, the
perpetual snow upon the upper summits of Lebanon.

Shall the cold ... - literally, "shall the strange, i. e., foreign,
"cool, down-flowing waters be plucked up?" The general sense is: God is
Israel's Rock, from whom the never-failing waters flow [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md) : but men may and do abandon the
cool waters which descend front above to seek their happiness in
channels of their own digging.

[Jeremiah 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 18:15</span></span>

Because - "For." Jeremiah returns to, and continues the words of, [Jer
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md).

Vanity - A word meaning "falsehood," which signifies that the worship of
idols is not merely useless but injurious.

They have caused them to stumble - Judah's prophets and priests were
they who made her to err [Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md).
The idols were of themselves powerless for good or evil.

In their ways ... - Or, "in their ways, the everlasting paths, to walk
in byways, in a road not cast up. The paths of eternity" carry back the
mind not to the immediate but to the distant past, and suggest the good
old ways in which the patriarchs used to walk. The "road cast up" means
one raised sufficiently to keep it out of the reach of floods etc.

[Jeremiah 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 18:16</span></span>

Hissing - Not derision, but the drawing in of the breath quickly as men
do when they shudder.

Way his head - Or, "shake his head," a sign among the Jews not of scorn
but of pity. The desolation of the land of Israel is to fill people with
dismay.

[Jeremiah 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 18:17</span></span>

I will shew them the back - The hiding of God's face is the sure sign of
His displeasure [Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md).

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

The Jews were only hardened by the foregoing prophecy, and determined to
compass Jeremiah's death.

Let us devise devices - i. e., "deliberately frame a plot" for his ruin
(see [Jer 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011) note.md).

The law shall not perish ... - As the Law of Moses was imperishable, the
people probably drew the conclusion that the Levitical priesthood must
also endure forever, and therefore that Jeremiah's predictions of
national ruin were blasphemous (compare [Act
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013).md).

Let us smite him with the tongue - Their purpose was to carry a
malicious report of what he had said to king Jehoiakim, and so stir up
his anger against him.

[Jeremiah 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 18:19</span></span>

The voice - i. e., the outcry and threats.

[Jeremiah 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 18:20</span></span>

Jeremiah had been laboring earnestly to avert the ruin of his country,
but the Jews treated him as farmers do some noxious animal which wastes
their fields, and for which they dig pitfalls.

[Jeremiah 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 18:21</span></span>

Pour out ... sword - literally, "pour them out upon the hands of the
sword, i. e., give them up to the sword."

Put to death - Rather, slain of death. The prophet's phrase leaves it
entirely indefinite in what way the men are to die.

[Jeremiah 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 18:22</span></span>

The sack of the city follows with all the horrible cruelties practiced
at such a time.

[Jeremiah 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 18:23</span></span>

Yet, Lord - Better, But, Lord. They conceal their plots, but God knows,
and therefore must punish.

Neither blot out ... - Or, "blot not out their sin from before Thy face
that they may be made to stumble before Thee."

Thus - Omit this word. Since there is an acceptable time and a day of
salvation, so there is a time of anger, and Jeremiah's prayer is that
God would deal with his enemies at such a time, and when therefore no
mercy would be shown. On imprecations such as these, see Ps. 109
introductory note. Though they did not flow from personal vengeance, but
from a pure zeal for God's honor, yet they belong to the legal spirit of
the Jewish covenant. We must not, because we have been shown a "more
excellent way," condemn too harshly that sterner spirit of justice which
animated so many of the saints of the earlier dispensation.
