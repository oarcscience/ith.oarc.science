### [Joshua Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 16:0</span></span>

This and Josh. 17 are closely connected, and assign the boundaries of
"the children of Joseph," i. e of the kindred tribes of Ephraim and
Manasseh. These two tribes, or more strictly speaking, the tribe of
Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh, drew one lot only, no doubt,
because it was all along intended that their inheritances should be
adjacent. These chapters accordingly describe

\(1\) the southern boundary of the whole territory of the children of
Joseph [Jos 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md);

\(2\) the limits of Ephraim in particular [Jos
16:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005).md)

(3); those of Manasseh [Jos 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md);
and

\(4\) the discontent of the descendants of Joseph with their inheritance
is recorded, together with Joshua's answer to their complaints [Jos
17:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md).

The territory allotted to these two powerful tribes comprises the
central and, in every way, the choicest part of Canaan west of the
Jordan. The hills of this district, making up what is called [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md) "Mount Ephraim," are less high
and far less barren than those of Judah; the water supply is much
larger; and the very rich and fertile plains of Sharon and Esdraelon are
left between the rocky fastnesses of Benjamin on the south and the high
lands of Galilee belonging to Issachar on the north.

[Joshua 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 16:1</span></span>

To the wilderness - Strike out "to," for the word is in apposition to
"lot." The wilderness is [Jos 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#012.md)
"the wilderness of Bethaven."

[Joshua 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 16:2</span></span>

Of Archi - (Read "of the Archite," also a designation of David's friend
Hushai ([Sa2 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md); [Sa2
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#016), etc..md). The word is derived from
Erech [Gen 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md). But whether there
was in the neighborhood of Bethel a place bearing this Babylonian name,
or whether a colony from the East had settled in this spot and brought
the name with them, is unknown.

Ataroth - Called [Jos 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md); [Jos
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#013.md) Ataroth-adar (= "crowns of fame
or greatness") perhaps to distinguish it from two other places bearing
the same name but, situated on the other side of Jordan, in the
territory of Gad [Num 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034.md). It is
identified with Atara, near the road from Jerusalem to Nablous.

[Joshua 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 16:3</span></span>

Of Japhleti - Rather "of the Japhletite." All history of the name is
lost.

[Joshua 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 16:5</span></span>

From the abrupt manner in which the statements are introduced, as well
as from their imperfect character, there is probability in the
conjecture that some words have, in these verses, fallen out of the
text. Few of the places are known for certain.

[Joshua 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 16:9</span></span>

The verb "were," introduced by the King James Version in this verse
should be omitted; and the full stop after [Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md) replaced by a colon. The purport
of [Jos 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md) is simply to add to the
inheritance of Ephraim, defined by the preceding context, "the separate
cities" or more properly "single cities" which were allotted to them in
addition within the borders of Manasseh. The reasons for granting these
additional cities to the Ephraimites can only be conjectured. Perhaps
the territory assigned to this numerous tribe proved on experiment to be
too small; and therefore some towns, which are named in [Ch1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#029.md), were given to them from the
kindred Manassites, the latter being recompensed ([Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011) note.md) at the expense of Issachar
and Asher.
