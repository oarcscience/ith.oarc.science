Introduction to Judges

The Book of Judges, like the other historical books of the Old
Testament, takes its name from the subject to which it chiefly relates,
namely, the exploits of those JUDGES who ruled Israel in the times
between the death of Joshua and the rise of Samuel. The rule of the
Judges [Rut 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md) in this limited sense
was a distinct dispensation, distinct from the leadership of Moses and
Joshua, distinct from the more regular supremacy of Eli, the High
Priest, and from the prophetic dispensation inaugurated by Samuel [Sa1
3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019.md); [Act
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md).

The book consists of three divisions: (1) The PREFACE, which extends to
[Jdg 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006) (inclusive). (2.md) the MAIN
NARRATIVE, Judg. 3:7-16:31. (3) THE APPENDIX, containing two detached
narratives, (a) [Jdg 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001); (b.md)
Judg. 18-21. To these may be added the Book of Ruth, containing another
detached narrative, which anciently was included under the title of
JUDGES, to which book the first verse shows that it properly belongs.

\(1\) the general purpose of the PREFACE is to prepare the ground for
the subsequent narrative; to explain how it was that the pagan nations
of Canaan were still so powerful, and the Israelites so destitute of
Divine aid and protection against their enemies; and to draw out the
striking lessons of God's righteous judgment, which were afforded by the
alternate servitudes and deliverances of the Israelites, according as
they either forsook God to worship idols, or returned to Him in
penitence, faith, and prayer. Throughout there is a reference to the
threatenings and promises of the Books of Moses ([Jdg
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#015.md), [Jdg
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#020), etc..md), in order both to
vindicate the power and faithfulness of Jehovah the God of Israel, and
to hold out a warning to the future generations for whose instruction
the book was written. In the view which the writer was inspired to
present to the Church, never was God's agency more busy in relation to
the affairs of His people, than when, to a superficial observer, that
agency had altogether ceased. On the other hand, the writer calls
attention to the fact that those heroes, who wrought such wonderful
deliverances for Israel, did it not by their own power, but were
divinely commissioned, and divinely endowed with courage, strength, and
victory. The writer of the preface also directs the minds of the readers
of his history to that vital doctrine, which it was one main object of
the Old Testament dispensation to keep alive in the world until the
coming of Christ, namely,, the unity of God. All the calamities which he
was about to narrate, were the fruit and consequence of idolatry. "Keep
yourselves from idols," was the chief lesson which the history of the
Judges was intended to inculcate.

The preface consists of two very different portions; the recapitulation
of events before, and up to, Joshua's death Judg. 1-2:9, and the
reflections on the history about to be related Judg. 2:10-3:6.

\(2\) the MAIN NARRATIVE contains, not consecutive annals of Israel as a
united people, but a series of brilliant, striking, pictures, now of one
portion of the tribes, now of another. Of some epochs minute details are
given; other periods of eight or ten years, nay, even of twenty, forty,
or eighty years, are disposed of in four or five words. Obviously in
those histories in which we find graphic touches and accurate details,
we have preserved to us narratives contemporary with the events narrated
- the narratives, probably, of eye-witnesses and actors in the events
themselves. The histories of Ehud, of Barak and Deborah, of Gideon, of
Jephthah, and of Samson, are the product of times when the invasions of
Moab, of Jabin, of Midian, of Ammon, and of the Philistines, were living
realities in the minds of those who penned those histories. The compiler
of the book seems to have inserted bodily in his history the ancient
narratives which were extant in his day. As the mind of the reader is
led on by successive steps to the various exploits of the twelve Judges,
and from them to Samuel, and from Samuel to David, and from David to
David's son, it cannot fail to recognize the working of one divine plan
for man's redemption, and to understand how judges, and prophets, and
kings were endowed with some portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
preparatory to the coming into the world of Him in whom all the fulLness
of the Godhead should dwell bodily, and who should save to the uttermost
all that come to God by Him.

Some curious analogies have been noted between this, the heroic age of
the Israelites, and the heroic ages of Greece and other Gentile
countries. Here, as there, it is in the early settlement and taking
possession of their new country, and in conflicts with the old races,
that the virtues and prowess of the heroes are developed. Here, as
there, there is oftentimes a strange mixture of virtue and vice, a
blending of great and noble qualities, of most splendid deeds with
cruelty and ignorance, licentiousness and barbarism. And yet, in
comparing the sacred with the pagan heroes, we find in the former a
faith in God and a religious purpose, of which pagandom affords no
trace. The exploits of the sacred heroes advanced the highest interests
of mankind, and were made subservient to the overthrow of abominable and
impure superstitions, and to the preserving a light of true religion in
the world until the coming of Christ.

\(3\) the APPENDIX contains a record of certain events which happened
"in the days when the judges ruled," but are not connected with any
exploits of the judges. Though placed at the end of the book, the two
histories both manifestly belong chronologically to the beginning of it:
the reason for the place selected is perhaps that suggested in the [Jdg
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md) note.

Exact chronology forms no part of the plan of the book. The only guide
to the chronology is to be found in the genealogies which span the
period: and the evidence of these genealogies concurs in assigning an
average of between seven and eight generations to the time from the
entrance into Canaan to the commencement of David's reign, which would
make up from 240 to 260 years. Deducting 30 years for Joshua, 30 for
Samuel, and 40 for the reign of Saul [Act
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md), in all 100 years, we have from
140 to 160 years left for the events related in the Book of Judges. This
is a short time, no doubt, but quite sufficient, when it is remembered
that many of the "rests" and "servitudes" ([Jdg
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008) note.md) therein related are not
successive, but synchronize; and that no great dependence can be placed
on the recurring 80, 40, and 20 years, whenever they are not in harmony
with historical probability.

The narratives which have the strongest appearance of synchronizing are
those of the Moabite, Ammonite, and Amalekite servitude Judg. 3:12-30
which lasted eighteen years, and was closely connected with a Philistine
invasion [Jdg 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md); of the Ammonite
servitude which lasted eighteen years, and was also closely connected
with a Philistine invasion [Jdg
10:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md); and of the Midianite and
Amalekite servitude which lasted seven years [Jdg
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001.md), all three of which terminated in
a complete expulsion and destruction of their enemies by the three
leaders Ehud, Jephthah, and Gideon, heading respectively the Benjamites,
the Manassites and the northern tribes, and the tribes beyond Jordan:
the conduct of the Ephraimites as related in [Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md); [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md), being an additional very strong
feature of resemblance in the two histories of Gideon and Jephthah. The
40 years of Philistine servitude mentioned in [Jdg
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md), seems to have embraced the last
20 years of Eli's judgeship, and the first 20 of Samuel's, and
terminated with Samuel's victory at Eben-ezer: and, if so, Samson's
judgeship of 20 years also coincided in part with Samuel's. The long
rests of 40 and 80 years spoken of as following the victories of
Othniel, Barak, and Ehud, may very probably have synchronized in whole
or in part. It cannot however be denied that the chronology of this book
is still a matter of uncertainty.

The time of the compilation of this book, and the final arrangement of
its component parts in their present form and in their present
connection in the series of the historical books of Scripture, may with
most probability be assigned to the latter times of the Jewish monarchy,
included in the same plan. (The Book of Ezra, it may be observed, by the
way, is a continuation, not of Kings, but of Chronicles.) There is not
the slightest allusion in the Book of Judges, to the Babylonian
captivity. Only [Jdg 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#005.md), as regards
the Canaanite races mentioned, and the context, may be compared with
[Ezr 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md). The language of the Book
of Judges points to the same conclusion. It is pure and good Hebrew,
untainted with Chaldaisms or Persian forms, as are the later books.

The inference to which these and other such resemblances tends, is that
the compilation of the Book of Judges is of about the same age as that
of the books of Samuel and Kings, if not actually the work of the same
hand. But no absolute certainty can be arrived at.

The chief allusions to it in the New Testament are those in [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md) following, and [Act
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#020.md). But there are frequent
references to the histories contained in it in the Psalms and in the
prophets. See [Psa 78:56](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056.md), etc.; [Psa
83:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md); [Psa
106:34-45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034.md), etc.; [Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md); [Isa
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#026.md); [Neh
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md), etc. See also [Sa1
12:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md); [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021.md). Other books to which it refers
are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua. See
the marginal references to Judg. 1; [Jdg
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md), [Jdg
2:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006.md), [Jdg
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#015.md), [Jdg
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#020.md); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md); [Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008.md), [Jdg
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013.md); [Jdg
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md); [Jdg
