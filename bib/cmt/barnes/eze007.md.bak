### [Ezekiel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 7:1</span></span>

A dirge. Supposing the date of the prophecy to be the same as that of
the preceding, there were now but four, or perhaps three, years to the
final overthrow of the kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar.

[Ezekiel 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 7:3</span></span>

A kind of refrain, repeated in [Eze
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#008.md), as the close of another stanza.

[Ezekiel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 7:5</span></span>

An only evil - An evil singular and remarkable above all others.

[Ezekiel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 7:6</span></span>

The end is come: it watcheth for thee - The end (personified) so long
slumbering now awakes and comes upon thee.

[Ezekiel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 7:7</span></span>

The morning - Rather, "The conclusion:" a whole series (literally
circle) of events is being brought to a close. Others render it: Fate.

The day of trouble ... - Or, The day is near; a tumult [Zac
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013.md), and not the echo of (or,
shouting on) the mountains. The contrast is between the wild tumult of
war and the joyous shouts of such as keep holiday.

[Eze 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#010.md)

Rod - Used here for tribe [Exo 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md).
The people of Judah have blossomed into proud luxuriance. In [Eze
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#011.md) it means the rod to punish
wickedness. The meaning of the passage is obscure, owing to the brief
and enigmatic form of the utterance. We may adopt the following
explanation. The Jews had ever exulted in their national privileges -
everything great and noble was to be from them and from theirs; but now
Yahweh raises up the rod of the oppressor to confound and punish the rod
of His people. The furious Chaldaean has become an instrument of God's
wrath, endued with power emanating not from the Jews or from the
multitude of the Jews, or from any of their children or people; nay, the
destruction shall be so complete that none shall be left to make
lamentation over them.

[Ezekiel 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 7:12</span></span>

The day - Either of temporal or final judgment.

It was grievous for an Israelite to part with his land. But now the
seller need not mourn his loss, nor the buyer exult in him gain. All
should live the pitiful lives of strangers in another country.

[Ezekiel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 7:13</span></span>

Although they were yet alive - Though they be yet among the living.

Which shall not return ... - He (i. e. the seller) shall not return;
and, every man living in his iniquity, they shall gather no strength.
Exile being the punishment of iniquity, the exiles were said to "live in
their iniquity."

[Ezekiel 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 7:16</span></span>

As doves whose natural abode is the valleys moan lamentably when driven
by fear into the mountains, so shall the remnant, who have escaped
actual death, moan in the land of their exile.

[Ezekiel 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 7:18</span></span>

Various signs of mourning common in eastern countries. Baldness was
forbidden to the Israelites [Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md).
They seem, however, in later times to have adopted the custom of foreign
nations in this matter, not without permission. Compare [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md).

[Ezekiel 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 7:19</span></span>

Shall be removed - literally, "shall be an unclean thing" [Lev
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#021.md); their gold shall be unclean and
abominable in their eyes.

The stumblingblock of their iniquity - See [Eze
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020.md). Their gold and silver used in
making images was the occasion of their sin.

[Ezekiel 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 7:20</span></span>

Or, And "the beauty of his ornament, he" (the people) turned "it" to
pride.

Have I set it far from them - Rather, as in the margin - therefore have
I made it their defilement and their disgrace.

[Ezekiel 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 7:22</span></span>

My secret place - The inner sanctuary, hidden from the multitude,
protected by the most high.

[Ezekiel 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 7:23</span></span>

Make a chain - Forge the chain, the chain of imprisonment determined for
them.

[Ezekiel 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 7:24</span></span>

The worst of the pagan - The most cruel and terrible of nations - the
Chaldaeans.

The pomp of the strong - Compare [Lev
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md) "The strong" are those who pride
themselves in imaginary strength.

Their holy places - What elsewhere is called "God's Holy place" is here
"their holy places," because God disowns the profaned sanctuary. In the
marginal rendering "they" must mean "the worst of the pagan."
