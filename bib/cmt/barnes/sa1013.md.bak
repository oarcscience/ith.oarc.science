### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 13:1</span></span>

The text of this verse, omitted by the Septuagint, is held to be
corrupt, and the numerals denoting Saul's age at his accession as well
as the duration of his reign, are thought to be omitted or faulty. Saul
may have been about 30 at his accession, and have reigned some 32 years,
since we know that his grandson Mephibosheth was five years old at
Saul's death [Sa2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004.md); and 32 added to
the seven and a half years between the death of Saul and that of
Ishbosheth, makes up the 40 years assigned to Saul's dynasty in [Act
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021.md). Neither is there any clue to
the interval of time between the events recorded in the preceding
chapter, and those which follow in this and succeeding chapters. But the
appearance of Jonathan as a warrior [Sa1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md) compared with the mention of Saul
as "a young man" [Sa1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md), implies an
interval of not less than ten or fifteen years, perhaps more. The object
of the historian is to prepare the way for the history of David's reign.
He therefore passes at once to that incident in Saul's reign, which led
to his rejection by God, as recorded in [Sa1
13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 13:2</span></span>

The state of things which preceded the events described in this chapter
seems to have been a comparative peace between Israel and the
Philistines, since Saul had only 3,000 men under arms. At the same time
Philistine garrisons continued to occupy the country of the Israelites
in certain strong places, whereof one was at Geba (Jeba), in the
immediate neighborhood of Gibeah [Sa1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005.md); [Sa1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md), and exactly opposite Michmash
(Mukhmas), which was on the northern edge of the great Wady Suweinit.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 13:3</span></span>

This was the first act in the war of independence, and probably the
first feat in arms of the young hero Jonathan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 13:4</span></span>

To Gilgal - The Wady Suweinit de-bouches into the plain of the Jordan in
which Gilgal was situated. For the sanctity of Gilgal, see above, [Sa1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md) note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 13:5</span></span>

Thirty thousand chariots - Probably a copyist's mistake for 300.
(Compare, for a similar numerical variation, [Ch1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004.md) with [Sa2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004)..md)

Eastward from Bethaven - Or more simply "to the east of Bethaven," which
[Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002.md) lay "on the east side of
Bethel." Bethaven (thought to be the same as Deir Diwan) lay between
Bethel and Michmash, which had been evacuated by Saul.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 13:6</span></span>

In thickets - literally, "among thorns."

High places - Not the high places for worship, but holds or towers [Jdg
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md), [Jdg
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#049.md); that particular kind of tower
which was the work of the old Canaanite inhabitants, and which remained
as ruins in the time of Saul.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 13:7</span></span>

The words "some of," which are the emphatic words in the King James
Version, as distinguishing those who crossed the Jordan from those who
hid themselves, are not in the Hebrew at all. The "Hebrews" seem to be
distinguished from the "men of Israel" in [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md). (Compare [Sa1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021)..md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

Had appointed - This appointment has of course nothing whatever to do
with that made years before [Sa1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md),
the keeping of which is expressly mentioned at the natural time [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015.md). But Samuel had again, on this
later occasion, made an appointment at the end of seven days. It seems
to have been as a trial of faith and obedience, under which, this time,
Saul unhappily broke down.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 13:9</span></span>

There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether Saul himself
offered the sacrifices prepared for Samuel, thus entrenching upon the
priest's office; or whether he ordered the priests to sacrifice, as
Solomon did. In the latter case his sin consisted in disobeying the word
of God, who had bidden him wait until Samuel came. And this is, on the
whole, the more probable; since Samuel's rebuke says nothing of any
assumption of priesthood, such as we read in the case of Uzziah [Ch2
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 13:11</span></span>

Saul had come from Michmash to Gilgal, expecting to gather the force of
the whole nation around him. Instead of that, the people fled, leaving
him in the exposed plain with only 600 men [Sa1
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md). The Philistines occupied
Michmash, and might at any moment pour down the valley upon Gilgal.
Saul's situation was obviously one of extreme peril. A few hours' delay
might prove fatal to him and his little army. Hence, he "forced"
himself, etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 13:13</span></span>

Thou hast done foolishly ... - Motives of worldly expediency were not to
be weighed against the express commandment of God. All the circumstances
and all the dangers were as well known to God as they were to Saul, and
God had bidden him wait until Samuel came. Here was exactly the same sin
of willful disobedience which broke out again, and was so severely
reproved [Sa1 15:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#017.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 13:15</span></span>

Samuel arose - Saul could not return to his own station at Michmash,
seeing it was occupied by the Philistines; so, perhaps by Samuel's
advice (since, according to the text, he preceded him there), he
effected a junction with Jonathan at Gibeah. Some would read "Saul"
instead of "Samuel."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 13:17</span></span>

The spoilers - "The devastator:" the same word is used of the destroying
Angel [Exo 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md). The verse describes
the system adopted by the Philistines by which for a time they
subjugated the Israelites. From their central camp at Michmash they sent
out three bands to kill and lay waste and destroy. One took a northerly
direction toward Ophrah - five miles east of Bethel, identified with
"Ephrain" [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md) and the modern
"Taiyibeh," - and toward the land of Shual, possibly the same as Shalim
[Sa1 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#004.md); the second westward to
Beth-horon; and the third eastward, by the unknown valley of Zeboim,
toward the wilderness, i. e., the Jordan valley, toward Jericho.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 13:19</span></span>

There was no smith - This was the result of the fierce inroads described
in the preceding verses, and the method adopted to make the Philistine
conquests permanent.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 13:20</span></span>

The best rendering of the passage is perhaps as follows: "But all the
Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen etc. [Sa1
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md), whenever there was bluntness of
edge to their shares and coulters and prong-forks and axes, and to point
their goads." Coulters and mattocks were cutting instruments of the type
of the share.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 13:22</span></span>

This seems to be mentioned here, in anticipation of the narrative in the
next chapter, to enhance the victory gained, through God's help [Sa1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#023.md), by the comparatively unarmed
Israelites over their enemies. What with occasional skirmishes with the
Philistines, the necessity of using their arms for domestic purposes,
accidental losses, and the ordinary wear and tear, coupled with the
impossibility of renewing their arms from the want of smiths and forges,
the people that were with Saul and Jonathan came to be very imperfectly
armed. It has been observed, moreover, that the Benjamites were more
famous for the use of the sling than for any other weapon [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016.md), and this would be an additional
cause of the paucity of swords and spears.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 13:23</span></span>

The passage of Michmash - The steep and precipitous path from Michmash
to Geba, over the valley of Suweinit. The same term is used in [Isa
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028.md), where the march of the
Assyrian army is described.
