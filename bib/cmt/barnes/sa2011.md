### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

After the year was expired - The next spring after the escape of the
Ammonites into their city [Sa2 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014).

The children of Ammon - The marginal reference supplies the word "the
land of," which is obviously the right reading.

David tarried at Jerusalem - The Syrians being subdued, the war with
Ammon was not of sufficient moment to require David's personal presence.
The whole section relating to David's adultery and Uriah's death, from
this verse to [Sa2 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026), is omitted
in the Book of Chronicles.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 11:2</span></span>

An eveningtide - The evening began at three o'clock in the afternoon.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 11:3</span></span>

Eliam - Or Ammiel, [Ch1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005), the
component words being placed in an inverse order. Bath-sheba was the
granddaughter of Ahithophel [Sa2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#034).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 11:7</span></span>

David was forced to stoop to falsehood and dissimulation in the vain
hope of hiding his sin.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 11:8</span></span>

A mess of meat - Compare [Gen 43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034).
The word denotes the honorable portion given by the host to his chief
guest.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 11:11</span></span>

The ark - Perhaps there was a double purpose in taking the ark; one, to
excite to the utmost the enthusiasm of the people for its defense and
against the Ammonites; the other, to have the means at hand of inquiring
of the Lord, which David had found so serviceable.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 11:16</span></span>

Observed the city - In the sense of besieging it closely.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 11:17</span></span>

The men of the city went out - i. e. they made a sally and attacked the
troops which were blockading the city on that side, chiefly to entice
them to pursue them, and so come within shot of the archers who lined
the wall [Sa2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#020), [Sa2
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#024).

There fell some of the people ... - They, too, as well as the brave and
faithful Uriah, were victims of David's cruel artifice.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 11:21</span></span>

Who smote Abimelech ... - This reference indicates the existence in
David's time of the national annals of that period in an accessible
form, and the king's habit of reading, or having read to him, the
history of his country. (Compare [Est
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001).)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 11:26</span></span>

Bath-sheba's mourning, like that of Abigail [Sa1
25:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039), was probably limited to the
customary time of seven days.
