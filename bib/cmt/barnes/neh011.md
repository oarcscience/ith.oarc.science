### [Nehemiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 11:1</span></span>

To bring one of ten - Artificial enlargements of capitals by forcible
transfers of population to them, were not unusual in ancient times.
About 500 B.C., Syracuse became a great city in this way. Tradition
ascribed the greatness of Rome, in part, to this cause.

[Nehemiah 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 11:4</span></span>

See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from
a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his
census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at
Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the
accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and
in Chronicles:

1 Chron Nehemiah Tribes of Judah Of Pharez 468 Of Zerah 690 Tribe of
Benjamin 956 928 Tribe of Levi Priests 1760 1192 Levites 284 Porters 212
172

According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the
entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a
total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from
Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire
population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites
of Ephraim and Manasseh [Ch1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003) are
not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of
the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in [Neh
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001), was not much short of 20,000.

[Neh 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016)

The outward business of the house of God - Such as the collection of the
newly-imposed tax [Neh 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#032), the
providing of the regular sacrifices, the renewal of vestments, and the
like.

[Neh 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017)

The principal to begin the thanksgiving - i. e., "the precentor," or
"leader of the choir."

[Nehemiah 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 11:20</span></span>

The returned community, though consisting mainly of members of the two
tribes, represented the entire people of Israel. The ground, however,
which they occupied, was not the whole land, but that which had
constituted the kingdom of Judah.

[Nehemiah 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 11:21</span></span>

Ophel, the southern spur of the temple hill, having a wall of its own
[Neh 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#027) might be reckoned either in
Jerusalem or outside it. Here it is made a separate place.

[Nehemiah 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 11:22</span></span>

The business intended was probably the internal business, as distinct
from the "outward business" [Neh 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016)
: a part of which was the apportionment of the royal bounty among the
members of the choir [Neh 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023).

[Nehemiah 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 11:23</span></span>

The goodwill of Artaxerxes toward the ministers employed in the temple
service, had been previously shown by his exempting them from taxation
of every kind [Ezr 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#024). Now, it would
seem, he had gone further and assigned to the singers an allowance from
the royal revenue.

[Nehemiah 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">neh 11:24</span></span>

It is difficult to say what office Pethahiah filled. So far as we know,
the only regular officers under the Persian system of government were
the satrap, the subsatrap, the permanent royal secretary, the
commandant, and the occasional commissary.

[Nehemiah 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 11:25</span></span>

Kirjath-arba - i. e., Hebron. In the absence of the Hebrews during the
captivity, the place had recovered its old name [Jos
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013).

[Nehemiah 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">neh 11:26</span></span>

Many of the places mentioned in these verses are mentioned in [Jos
15:27-39](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#027); [Jos
18:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#021).

[Nehemiah 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 11:36</span></span>

Of the Levites were divisions - i. e., "the Levites were scattered among
various towns both in Judah and Benjamin."
