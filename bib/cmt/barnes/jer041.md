### [Jeremiah Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 41:1</span></span>

The seventh month - Gedaliah's government lasted less than two months.

Even - Rather, and. Ishmael was descended probably from Elishama the son
of David [Sa2 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#016.md). Ten grandees each
with his retinue would have aroused suspicion, but the smallness of
Ishmael's following put Gedaliah completely off his guard.

[Jeremiah 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 41:5</span></span>

These three towns all lay in the tribe of Ephraim, and in the district
planted by Salmaneser with Cuthites; but through the fact of these men
having cut themselves (see [Jer 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md)
note), is suspicious, yet they were probably pious Israelites, going up
to Jerusalem, carrying the meat offering usual at the feast of
tabernacles, of which this was the season, and mourning over the
destruction, not of the city, but of the temple, to the repairs of which
we find the members of this tribe contributing in Josiah's time [Ch2
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009.md).

[Jeremiah 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 41:6</span></span>

Ishmael's conduct seems to have been dictated by the malicious desire
utterly to frustrate Gedaliah's work.

Weeping - By this artifice he lured them into Mizpah. The Septuagint:
"as they were ... weeping."

[Jeremiah 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 41:7</span></span>

The pit - the cistern, and in [Jer
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009.md).

[Jeremiah 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 41:8</span></span>

Treasures - Hidden stores; which would be of great value to Ishmael in
his retreat back to Baalis.

[Jeremiah 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 41:9</span></span>

Because of Gedaliah - By the side "of Gedaliah." Ishmael now cast beside
Gedaliah's body those of the pilgrims.

[Jeremiah 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 41:12</span></span>

An open pool still exists at Gibeon, and a large subterranean reservoir
fed by a copious natural spring. Gibeon is about two miles north of
Mizpah.

[Jeremiah 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 41:17</span></span>

The habitation of Chimham - The Hebrew text has Geruth-Chemoham, of
which place nothing is known. The Masoretes read: Geruth-Chimham, the
Khan or Caravanserai of Chimham, son of the rich Barzillai (marginal
reference). The substitution is incapable now of proof or disproof, but
it is possibly right.
