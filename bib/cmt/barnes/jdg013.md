### [Judges Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

[Judges 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 13:1</span></span>

The Philistines have been mentioned as oppressors of Israel in [Jdg
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md); [Jdg
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007.md), [Jdg
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011.md); and the Israelite worship of
the gods of the Philistines is spoken of in [Jdg
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006.md). But this is the first time that
we have any detailed history in connection with the Philistines. They
continned to be the prominent enemies of Israel until the time of David.

Forty years - The Philistine dominion began before the birth of Samson
[Jdg 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md), and was in force during
Samson's twenty years' judgeship [Jdg
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#004.md); [Jdg
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020.md). The 40 years are, therefore,
about coincident with Samson's life.

[Judges 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 13:2</span></span>

Zorah - See the marginal reference.

His wife was barren - To mark more distinctly the high providential
destiny of the child that was eventually born. Compare the similar
circumstances of the birth of Isaac, Jacob, Samuel, and John the
Baptist.

[Judges 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 13:5</span></span>

A Nazarite - See the marginal reference. and note. The common Nazarite
vow was for a limited time, like Paul's [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md); [Act
21:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md). Others, like Samuel [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md), were Nazarites for life.

[Judges 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 13:6</span></span>

A man of God - The designation of a prophet, of frequent use in the
books of Samuel and Kings [Sa1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md);
[Sa1 9:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md), [Sa1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#010.md); [Kg1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md); [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md), [Kg1
13:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#005.md), [Kg1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#011.md), and applied to Timothy by Paul
in the New Testament [Ti1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md); [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md).

His countenance - Rather, "his appearance," as the word is rendered in
[Dan 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md).

[Judges 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 13:12</span></span>

Translate, "What shall be the manner (or ordering) of the child, and
what shall be his work (or exploits)." The original message of the Angel
had given information on these two points:

\(1\) how the child was to be brought up, namely, as a Nazarite;

\(2\) what he should do, namely, begin to deliver Israel.

Manoah desires to have the information repeated (compare [Sa1
17:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md), [Sa1
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#030).md). Accordingly, in [Jdg
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#013.md) the Angel refers to, and
enlarges upon, his former injunctions.

[Judges 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 13:14</span></span>

Compare [Num 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#004.md). In both passages the
vine is described by the somewhat unusual though more accurate term,
"vine of the wine" - the grape-bearing vine - to distinguish it from the
wild cucumber vine [Kg2 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md), or other
plants to which the name vine was applied.

[Judges 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 13:15</span></span>

The language of Manoah, like that of Gideon [Jdg
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018.md), seems to indicate some suspicion
that his visitor was more than human. The word rendered "made ready," is
also the proper word for "offering a sacrifice," and is so used by the
Angel in the next verse. By which it appears that the Angel understood
Manoah to speak of offering a kid as a burnt-offering. Hence, his
caution, "thou must offer it unto the Lord." (Compare [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010.md); [Rev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md); [Act
10:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025)..md)

[Judges 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 13:17</span></span>

Do thee honor - If applied to a man, it would be by gifts, such for
instance as Balak promised to the prophet Balaam [Num
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#017.md), and such as were usually given
to seers [Sa1 9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md); [Kg2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005.md), [Kg2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015.md) : if to God, it would be by
sacrifices [Isa 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023.md).

[Judges 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 13:18</span></span>

Secret - Rather, "wonderful," as in the margin. In [Jdg
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md) the Angel "did wondrously,"
probably as the Angel that Appeared to Gideon had done, bringing fire
from the rock. See the marginal references and notes.

[Judges 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 13:24</span></span>

Samson - The etymology is doubtful. Perhaps it comes from a word
signifying "to minister," in allusion to his Nazaritic consecration to
the service of God.

[Judges 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 13:25</span></span>

In the camp of Dan - Rather, "Mahaneh-Dan" (see the margin). The
impulses of the Spirit of the Lord perhaps took the shape of burning
indignation at the subjection of his brethren, and thoughts and plans
for their deliverance, but especially showed themselves in feats of
strength ([Jdg 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006.md); [Jdg
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#014.md); [Jdg
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#030.md). Compare [Act
7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023).md).
