### [Matthew Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 21:0</span></span>

Mat. 21:1-16. See also [Mar 11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md);
Luke 19:29-44.

[Matthew 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 21:1</span></span>

And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem - They were going up now from
Jericho.

[Mat 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029.md). The distance was about 19
miles. The most of the way was a desert, or filled with caves, and
rocks, and woods - a suitable place for robbers. See [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md). The Mount of Olives, or
"Olivet," is on the east of Jerusalem. Between this and Jerusalem there
runs a small stream called the brook Kidron, or Cedron. It is dry in the
hot seasons of the year, but swells to a considerable size in time of
heavy rains. See the notes at [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md). The Mount of Olives was so
called from its producing in abundance the olive. It was from Jerusalem
about a Sabbath-day's journey. See the notes at [Act
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md). On the west side of the mountain
was the garden of Gethsemane, [Luk
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039.md); [Mar
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032.md). On the eastern declivity of the
mountain were the villages of Bethphage and Bethany. Mark and Luke say
that he came near to both those places.

He appears to have come first to Bethany, where he passed the night [Joh
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001.md), [Joh
12:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#009.md), and in the morning sent over
to the adjacent village Bethphage. Bethany was the place where Lazarus
lived, whom he raised from the dead John 11; where Martha and Mary
lived; and where Mary anointed him with ointment against the day of his
burying, [Joh 12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001.md). The Mount of
Olives is about a mile in length and about 700 feet in height, and
overlooks Jerusalem, so that from its summit almost every part of the
city can be seen. The mountain is composed of three peaks or summits.
The "olive" is a fruit well known among us as an article of commerce.
The tree blooms in June, and bears white flowers. The fruit is small. It
is first green, then whitish, and, when fully ripe, black. It encloses a
hard stone in which are the seeds. The "wild olive" was common, and
differed from the other only in being of a smaller size. There are two
roads from Jerusalem to Bethany; one around the southern end of the
Mount of Olives, and the other across the summit. The latter is
considerably shorter, but more difficult, and it was probably along this
road that the Saviour went.

[Matthew 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 21:2</span></span>

Go into the village over against you - That is, to Bethphage See the
notes at [Mat 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md).

Ye shall find an ass tied ... - In Judea there were few horses, and
those were chiefly used in war. People seldom employed them in common
life and in ordinary journeys. The ass, the mule, and the camel are
still most used in Eastern countries. To ride on a horse was sometimes
an emblem of war; on a mule and an ass, the emblem of peace. Kings and
princes commonly rode on them in times of peace, and it is mentioned as
a mark of rank and dignity to ride in that manner, [Jdg
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004.md); [Jdg
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#014.md); [Sa1
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#020.md). So Solomon, when he was
inaugurated as king, rode on a "mule," [Kg1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033.md). Riding in this manner, then,
denoted neither poverty nor degradation, but was the appropriate way in
which a king should ride, and in which, therefore, the King of Zion
should enter into his capital, the city of Jerusalem.

Mark and Luke say that he told them they should find "a colt tied." This
they were directed to bring. They mention only the colt, because it was
this on which he rode.

[Matthew 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 21:3</span></span>

The Lord hath need of them - This means no more than the "master" has
need of them. The word "Lord" often means no more than "master" as
opposed to servant, [Mat 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md); [Pe1
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md). The word is sometimes used in
the Bible as applied to God, or as a translation of the name Yahweh. Its
common use is a mere title of respect given by an inferior to a
superior, by a servant to a master, by a disciple to a teacher. As a
title of "high respect" it was given to Christ, or the Messiah. The
persons to whom these disciples were sent were probably acquainted with
the miracles of Jesus and favorably disposed toward him He had attracted
great notice in that region, particularly by raising Lazarus from the
dead, and most of the people regarded him as the Messiah.

[Matthew 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 21:4</span></span>

All this was done ... - The prophecy here quoted is found in [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). It was always, by the Jews,
applied to the Messiah.

Daughter of Zion - That is, "Jerusalem." "Zion" was one of the hills on
which the city of Jerusalem was built. On this stood the city of David
and some strong fortresses. The names "daughter and virgin" were given
to it often, in accordance with the Oriental figurative manner of
expression. See the notes at [Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md).
Compare [Amo 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002.md); [Psa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md); [Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md); [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md). It was given to them as an
expression of their beauty or comeliness.

Meek - See the notes at [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md). The
expression here rather denotes "peaceful, not warlike;" not with pomp,
and state, and the ensigns of ambition. He came in the manner in which
kings were accustomed to ride, but with none of their pride and
ambitious feeling.

Sitting upon an ass ... - He rode on the colt (Mark and Luke). This
expression in Matthew is one which is common with all writers. See [Gen
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md); [Jdg
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007.md).

[Matthew 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 21:7</span></span>

And put on them their clothes - This was done as a token of respect,
[Kg2 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 21:8</span></span>

And a very great multitude ... - Others showed the same respect by
throwing their garments before him; others by cutting down branches of
trees and casting them in the way. This was the way in which conquerors
and princes were often honored. To cast flowers, or garlands, or
evergreens before a warrior returning from victory, or a king entering
into his kingdom, was a common way of testifying joyful and triumphant
feeling. Thus Josephus says that Alexander and Agrippa were received at
Jerusalem. So in our own land some of the most acceptable tokens of
rejoicing ever bestowed upon Washington were garlands of roses scattered
in his path by children. So the path of Lafayette was often strewed with
flowers, as a mark of respect and of a nation's gratitude. John says
[Joh 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013.md) that these branches were
branches of the "palm-tree." The palm was an emblem of "joy and
victory." It was used by the Roman soldiers, as well as the Jews, as a
symbol of peace. See 1 Macc. 13:51; 2 Macc. 10:6, 7; [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md).

The "palm-tree" is common in warm climates, and was abundant in
Palestine. The finest grew about Jericho and Engedi. Hence, Jericho was
called the city of "palm-trees." The palm has a long and straight body,
a spreading top, and an appearance of very great beauty. It produces an
agreeable fruit, a pleasant shade, a kind of "honey" little inferior to
the honey of bees, and from it was drawn a pleasant "wine" much used in
the East. On ancient coins the palm-tree is often a symbol of Judea. On
coins made after Jerusalem was taken, Judea is represented by a female
sitting and weeping under a palm-tree. A reference to the palm-tree
occurs often in the Bible, and its general form and uses are familiar to
most readers.

Strictly speaking, the palm has no branches, but at the summit from
forty to eighty twigs or leaf-stalks spring forth. These are referred to
in [Neh 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#015.md). The leaves are set
around the trunk in circles of about six. The lower row is of great
length, and the vast leaves bend themselves in a curve toward the earth:
as the circles ascend, the leaves are shorter. In the month of February,
there sprout from between the junctures of the lower stalks and the
trunk little scales, which develop a kind of bud, the germ of the coming
fruit. These germs are contained in a thick and tough skin, not unlike
leather. According to the account of a modern traveler, a single tree in
Barbary and Egypt bears from fifteen to twenty large clusters of dates,
weighing from 15 to 20 lbs. each. The palm-tree lives more than 200
years, and is most productive from the 30th until the 80th year. The
Arabs speak of 260 uses to which the different parts of the palm-tree
are applied.

The inhabitants of Egypt, Arabia, and Persia depend much on the fruit of
the palm-tree for their subsistence. Camels feed on the seed, and the
leaves, branches, fibres, and sap are all very valuable.

The "branches" referred to by John [Joh
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013.md) are the long "leaves" which
shoot out from the top of the tree, and which were often carried about
as the symbol of victory. Compare the notes at [Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 21:9</span></span>

Hosanna to the son of David ... - The word "hosanna" means "save now,"
or "save, I beseech thee." It is a Syriac word, and was a form of
acclamation used among the Jews. It was probably used in the celebration
of their great festivals. During those festivals they sang Ps. 115; Ps.
116; [Psa 117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md); Ps. 118. In the
chanting or singing of those psalms, the Jewish writers inform us that
the people responded frequently "hallelujah, or hosanna." Their use of
it on this occasion was a joyful acclamation, and an invocation of a
divine blessing by the "Messiah."

Son of David - The Messiah.

Blessed be he ... - That is, blessed be the "Messiah This passage is
taken from [Psa 118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md). To come "in
the name of the Lord" here means to come "by the authority" of the Lord,
or to come "commissioned" by him to reveal his will. The Jews had
commonly applied this to the Messiah.

Hosanna in the highest - This may mean either "Hosanna in the highest,
loftiest strains," or it may be for a prayer to God "Save now, O thou
that dwellest in the highest heaven, or among the highest angels."
Perhaps the whole song of hosanna may be a prayer to the Supreme God, as
well as a note of triumphant acclamation: "Save now, O thou supremely
great and glorious God; save by the Messiah that comes in thy name."

Mark adds that they shouted, "Blessed be the kingdom of our father
David, that cometh in the name of the Lord." That is, the kingdom
"promised" to David, [Kg1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md); [Kg1
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md). "Coming in the name" of the Lord
here evidently means coming according to the "promise" of the Lord. The
sense may be thus expressed: "Prosperity to the reign of our father
David, advancing now according to the promise made to him, and about to
be established by the long predicted Messiah, his descendant."

Luke adds [Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md) that they said,
"Peace in heaven and glory in the highest." The word "peace" is used
here as significant of joy, triumph, exultation at this event. There
will be increased peace and rejoicing in heaven from the accession of
the redeemed: there will be augmented glory - new songs of praise "among
the highest angels."

There is no contradiction here among the evangelists. Among such a
multitude, the shouts of exultation and triumph would by no means be
confined to the same words. Some would say one thing and some another;
and one evangelist recorded what was said by a part of the multitude,
and another what was said by another part.

[Matthew 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 21:10</span></span>

And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved - There was
great excitement. The sight of such a multitude, the shouts of the
people, and the triumphant procession through the city, excited much
attention and inquiry.

[Matthew 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 21:12</span></span>

This paragraph contains the account of the barren fig-tree, and of the
cleansing of the temple. See also [Mar
11:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md); [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md).

[Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

And Jesus went into the temple of God ... - From [Mar
11:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011.md), it is probable that this
cleansing of the temple did not take place on the day that he entered
Jerusalem in triumph, but on the day following.

He came and looked round upon all things, Mark says, and went out to
Bethany with the twelve. On the day following, returning from Bethany,
he saw the fig-tree. Entering into the temple, he purified it "on that
day;" or perhaps he "finished" the work of purifying it on that day,
which he commenced the day before. Matthew has mentioned the purifying
of the temple, which was performed, probably, on two successive days, or
has stated the "fact," without being particular as to the order of
events. Mark has stated the order more particularly, and has "divided"
what Matthew mentions together.

The "temple of God," that is, the temple dedicated and devoted to the
service of God, was built on Mount Moriah. The first temple was built by
Solomon, about 1005 years before Christ, 1 Kings 6, He took seven years
to build it, according to [Kg1 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038.md).
David, his father, had contemplated the design of building it, and had
prepared many materials for it, but was prevented because he had been a
man of war, [Ch1 22:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001.md); [Kg1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md). This temple, erected with great
magnificence, remained until it was destroyed by the Babylonians under
Nebuchadnezzar, 584 years before Christ, [Ch2
36:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md), [Ch2
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#019.md).

After the Babylonian captivity the temple was rebuilt by Zerubbabel, but
with vastly inferior and diminished splendor. The aged people wept when
they compared it with the glory of the former temple, [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008.md), [Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md). This was called the "second"
temple. This temple was often defiled in the wars before the time of
Christ. It had become much decayed and impaired Herod the Great, being
exceedingly unpopular among the Jews on account of his cruelties (see
the notes at Matt. 2), was desirous of doing something to obtain the
favor of the people, and accordingly, about 16 years before Christ, and
in the 18th year of his reign, he commenced the work of repairing it.
This he did, not by taking it down entirely at once, but by removing one
part after another, until it had become, in fact, a new temple, greatly
surpassing the former in magnificence. It was still called by the Jews
the "second" temple; and by Christ's coming to this temple thus
repaired, was fulfilled the prophecy in [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009.md). On this building Herod employed
18,000 men, and completed it so as to be suitable for use in 9 years, or
about 8 years before Christ. But additions continued to be made to it,
and it continued increasing in splendor and magnificence until 64 a.d.
John says [Joh 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020.md), "forty and six
years was this temple in building." Christ was then 30 years of age,
which, added to the 16 years occupied in repairing it before his birth,
makes 46 years.

The word "temple" was given not merely to the sacred edifice or house
itself, but to all the numerous chambers, courts, and rooms connected
with it on the top of Mount Moriah. The temple itself was a small
edifice, and was surrounded by courts and chambers half a mile in
circumference. Into the sacred edifice itself our Saviour never went.
The high priest only went into the holy of holies, and that but once a
year, and none but priests were permitted to enter the holy place. Our
Saviour was neither. He was of the tribe of "Judah," and he consequently
was allowed to enter no further than the other Israelites into the
temple. The works that he is said to have performed in the temple,
therefore, are to be understood as having been performed in the courts
surrounding the sacred edifice. These courts will now be described. The
temple was erected on Mount Moriah. The space on the summit of the mount
was not, however, large enough for the buildings necessary to be
erected. It was therefore enlarged by building high walls from the
valley below and filling up the space within. One of these walls was 600
feet in height. The ascent to the temple was by high flights of steps.
The entrance to the temple, or to the courts on the top of the mount,
was by nine gates, all of them extremely splendid. On every side they
were thickly coated with gold and silver. But there was one gate of
special magnificence: this was called the Beautiful Gate, [Act
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002.md). It was on the east side, and was
made of Corinthian brass, one of the most precious metals in ancient
times. See the Introduction to 1 Corinthians, section 1. This gate was
50 cubits, or 75 feet, in height.

The whole temple, with all its courts, was surrounded by a wall about 25
feet in height. This was built on the wall raised from the base to the
top of the mountain, so that from the top of it to the bottom, in a
perpendicular descent, was in some places not far from 600 feet. This
was particularly the case on the southeast corner; and it was here,
probably, that Satan wished our Saviour to cast himself down. See the
notes at [Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md).

On the inside of this wall, between the gates, were piazzas or covered
porches. On the eastern, northern, and western sides there were two rows
of these porches; on the south, three. These porches were covered walks,
about 20 feet in width, paved with marble of different colors, with a
flat roof of costly cedar, which was supported by pillars of solid
marble, so large that three men could scarcely stretch their arms so as
to meet around them. These walks or porches afforded a grateful shade
and protection to the people in hot or stormy weather. The one on the
east side was distinguished for its beauty, and was called Solomon's
porch, [Joh 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#023.md); [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md). It stood over the vast terrace
or wall which he had raised from the valley beneath, and which was the
only thing of his work that remained in the second temple.

When a person entered any of the gates into this space within the wall
he saw the temple rising before him with great magnificence; but the
space was not clear all the way up to it. Going forward, he came to
another wall, enclosing considerable ground, considered more holy than
the rest of the hill. The space between this first and second wall was
called "the court of the Gentiles." It was so called because Gentiles
might come into it, but they could proceed no further. On the second
wall and on the gates were inscriptions in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
forbidding any Gentile or unclean person from proceeding further on pain
of death. This "court" was not of equal dimensions all the way round the
temple. On the east, north, and west it was quite narrow. On the south
it was wide, occupying nearly half of the whole surface of the hill. In
this court the Gentiles might come. Here was the place where much
secular business was transacted. This was the place occupied by the
buyers and sellers, and by the money-changers, and which Jesus purified
by casting them out.

The enclosure within the second wall was nearly twice as long from east
to west as from north to south. This enclosure was also divided. The
eastern part of it was called "the court of the women;" so called
because women might advance thus far, but no farther. This court was
square. It was entered by three gates; one on the north, one on the east
directly opposite to the Beautiful gate, and one on the south. In
passing from the court of the Gentiles to that of the women, it was
necessary to ascend about 9 feet by steps. This court of the women was
enclosed with a double wall, with a space between the walls about 15
feet in width, paved with marble. The inner of these two walls was much
higher than the one outside. The court of the women was paved with
marble. In the corners of that court were different structures for the
various uses of the temple. It was in this court that the Jews commonly
worshipped. Here, probably, Peter and John, with others, went up to
pray, [Act 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md). Here, too, the
Pharisee and publican prayed - the Pharisee near the gate that led
forward to the temple; the publican standing far off, on the other side
of the court, [Luk 18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md). Paul also
was seized here, and charged with defiling the temple by bringing the
Gentiles into that holy place, [Act
21:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md).

A high wall on the west side of the court of the women divided it from
the court of the Israelites, so called because all the males of the Jews
might advance there. To this court there was an ascent of fifteen steps.
These steps were in the form of a half circle. The great gate to which
these steps led was called the gate "Nicanor." Besides this, there were
three gates on each side, leading from the court of the women to the
court of the Israelites.

Within the court of the "Israelites" was the court of the "priests,"
separated by a wall about 1 1/2 foot in height. Within that court was
the altar of burnt-offering and the laver standing in front of it. Here
the priests performed the daily service of the temple. In this place,
also, were accommodations for the "priests" when not engaged in
conducting the service of the temple, and for the Levites who conducted
the music of the sanctuary.

The temple, properly so called, stood within this court. It surpassed in
splendor all the other buildings of the holy city; perhaps in
magnificence it was unequalled in the world. It fronted the east,
looking down through the gates Nicanor and the Beautiful Gate, and
onward to the Mount of Olives. From the Mount of Olives on the east
there was a beautiful and commanding view of the whole sacred edifice.
It was there that our Saviour sat when the disciples directed his
attention to the goodly stones with which the temple was built, [Mar
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md). The entrance into the temple
itself was from the court "of the priests," by an ascent of twelve
steps. The "porch" in front of the temple was 150 feet high and as many
broad. The open space in this perch through which the temple was entered
was 115 feet high and 37 broad, without doors of any sort, The
appearance of this, built, as it was, with white marble, and decorated
with plates of silver, from the Mount of Olives was exceedingly dazzling
and splendid. Josephus says that in the rising of the sun it reflected
so strong and dazzling an effulgence that the eye of the spectator was
obliged to turn away. To strangers at a distance, it appeared like a
mountain covered with snow, for where it was not decorated with plates
of gold it was extremely white and glistening.

The temple itself was divided into two parts. The first, called the
"sanctuary" or holy place; was 60 feet in length 60 feet in height, and
30 feet in width. In this was the golden candlestick, the table of
showbread, and the altar of incense. The "holy of holies" or the "most
holy place," was 30 feet each way. In the first temple this contained
the ark of the covenant, the tables of the law, and over the ark was the
mercy-seat and the cherubim. Into this place no person entered but the
high priest, and he but once in the year. These two apartments were
separated only by a vail, very costly and curiously performed. It was
this vail which was rent from the top to the bottom when the Saviour
died, [Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md). Around the walls of
the "temple," properly so called, was a structure three stories high,
containing chambers for the use of the officers of the temple. The
temple was wholly leveled to the ground by the Romans under Titus and
Vespasian, and was effectually destroyed, according to the predictions
of the Saviour. See the notes at [Mat
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002.md). The site of it was made like a
plowed field. Julian the apostate attempted to rebuild it, but the
workmen, according to his own historian, Ammianus Marcellinus, were
prevented by balls of fire breaking out from the ground. See Warburton's
"Divine Legation of Moses." Its site is now occupied by the Mosque of
Omar, one of the most splendid specimens of Saracenic architecture in
the world.

And cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple - The place
where this was done was not the temple itself, but the outer court "or
the court of the Gentiles." This was esteemed the least sacred part of
the temple; and the Jews, it seems, did not consider it profanation to
appropriate this to any business in any way connected with the temple
service. The things which they bought and sold were at first those
pertaining. to the sacrifices. It is not improbable, however, that the
traffic afterward extended to all kinds of merchandise. It gave rise to
much confusion, noise, contention, and fraud, and was exceedingly
improper in the temple of the Lord.

The tables of the money-changers - Judea was subject to the Romans. The
money in current use was Roman coin; yet the Jewish law required that
every man should pay a tribute to the service of the sanctuary of "half
a shekel," [Exo 30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md). This was a
Jewish coin, and the tribute was required to be paid in that coin. It
became, therefore, a matter of convenience to have a place where the
Roman coin might be exchanged for the Jewish half shekel. This was the
"professed" business of these men. Of course, they would demand a small
sum for the exchange; and, among so many thousands as came up to the
great feasts, it would be a very profitable employment, and one easily
giving rise to much fraud and oppression.

The seats of them that sold doves - Doves were required to be offered in
sacrifice - [Lev 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#022.md); [Luk
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024.md) - yet it was difficult to bring
them from the distant parts of Judea. It was found much easier to
purchase them in Jerusalem. Hence, it became a business to keep them to
sell to those who were required to offer them.

Mark adds [Mar 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016.md) that he "would
not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple."
That is, probably, any of the vessels or implements connected with the
traffic in oil, incense, wine, etc., that were kept for sale in the
temple.

[Mat 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md)

And said It is written ... - This is written in [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md). The first part of this verse
only is quoted from Isaiah. The rest - "but ye have made it a den of
thieves" - was added by Jesus, denoting their abuse of the temple.
Thieves and robbers live in dens and caves. Judea was then much infested
with them. In their dens thieves devise and practice iniquity. These
buyers and sellers imitated them. They made the temple a place of gain;
they cheated and defrauded; they took advantage of the poor, and, by
their being under a necessity of purchasing these articles for
sacrifice, they "robbed" them by selling what they had at an enormous
price.

The following reasons may be given why this company of buyers and
sellers obeyed Christ:

1\. They were overawed by his authority, and struck with the
consciousness that he had a right to command,

2\. Their own consciences reproved them; they knew they were guilty, and
they dared make no resistance.

3\. The people generally were then on the side of Jesus, believing him
to be the Messiah.

4\. It had always been the belief of the Jews that a "prophet" had a
right to change, regulate, and order the various affairs relating to
external worship. They supposed Jesus to be such, and they did not dare
to resist him.

Mark and Luke add, that in consequence of this, the scribes and chief
priests attempted to put him to death, [Mar
11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#018.md); [Luk
19:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#047.md). This they did from "envy,"
[Mat 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#018.md). He drew off the people
from them, and they envied and hated him. They were "restrained," then,
for the fear of the people; and this was the reason why they plotted
"secretly" to put him to death, and why they afterward so gladly heard
the proposals of the traitor, [Mat
26:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014.md).

[Mat 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md), [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md)

When the chief priests ... - The chief men of the nation were envious of
his popularity.

They could not prevent it; but, being determined to find fault, they
took occasion to do so from the shouts of the children. People often are
offended that "children" have anything to do with religion, and deem it
very improper that "they" should rejoice that the Saviour has come. Our
Lord Jesus viewed this subject differently. He saw that it was proper
that they should rejoice. they are interested in the concerns of
religion, and before evil principles get fast hold of their minds is a
proper time for them to love and obey him. The Lord Jesus silenced those
who made the objection by appealing to a text of their own Scriptures.
This text is found in [Psa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md). The
quotation is not made directly from the Hebrew. but from the Greek
translation. This, however, should create no difficulty. The point of
the quotation was to prove that "children" might offer praise to God.
This is expressed in both the Hebrew and the Greek.

[Mat 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md)

Bethany - See the notes at [Mat 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md).

[Mat 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md)

And when he saw a fig-tree in the way ... - This tree was standing in
the public road.

It was therefore common property and anyone might lawfully use its
fruit. Mark says [Mar 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013.md), "Seeing a
fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came," etc. Not far off "from the
road," but at a considerable distance from the place where he was.
Having loaves, and appearing healthy and luxuriant, they presumed that
there would be fruit on it. Mark says [Mar
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013.md), "he came, if haply he might
find anything thereon." That is, judging from the "appearance" of the
tree, it was "probable" that there would be fruit on it. We are not to
suppose that our Lord was ignorant of the true condition of the tree,
but he acted according to the appearance of things; being a man as well
as divine, he acted, of course, as people do act in such circumstances.

And found nothing thereon but leaves only - Mark [Mar
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013.md) gives as a reason for this that
"the time of figs was not yet." That is, the time "of gathering" the
figs was not yet, or had not passed. It was a time when figs were ripe
or suitable to eat, or he would not have gone to it, expecting to find
them; but the time of gathering them had not passed, and it was to be
presumed that they were still on the tree. This took place on the week
of the Passover, or in the beginning of April. Figs, in Palestine, are
commonly ripe at the Passover. The summer in Palestine begins in March,
and it is no uncommon thing that figs should be eatable in April. It is
said that they sometimes produce fruit the year round.

Mark [Mar 11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md) says that this took
place on the morning of the day on which he purified the temple. Matthew
would lead us to suppose that it was on the day following. Matthew
records briefly what Mark records more "fully." Matthew states the fact
that the fig-tree was barren and withered away, without regarding
minutely the order or the circumstances in which the event took place.
There is no contradiction, because Matthew does not affirm that this
took place on the morning after the temple was cleansed, though he
places it in that order; nor does he say that a day did not elapse after
the fig-tree was cursed before the disciples discovered that it was
withered, though he does not affirm that it was so. Such circumstantial
variations, where there is no positive contradiction, go greatly to
confirm the truth of a narrative. They show that the writers were honest
men, and did not "conspire" to deceive the world.

And said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee ... - Mark calls this
"cursing" the tree [Mar 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021.md). The
word "curse," as used by him, does not imply "anger," or disappointment,
or malice. It means only "devoting it to destruction," or causing it to
wither away. All the "curse" that was pronounced was in the words "that
no fruit should grow on it." The Jews used the word "curse" not as
always implying "wrath or anger," but to devote to "death," or to any
kind of destruction, [Heb 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md). It has
been commonly thought that the Saviour performed this miracle to denote
the sudden "withering away" or destruction of the Jewish people. They,
like the fig-tree, promised fair. That was full of leaves, and they full
of professions. Yet both were equally barren; and as that was destroyed,
so they were soon to be. It was certain that this would be a good
"illustration" of the destruction of the Jewish people, but there is no
evidence that Jesus intended it as such, and without such evidence we
have no right to say that was its meaning. "And presently the fig-tree
withered away." That is, before another day. See Mark. It is probable
that they were passing directly onward, and did not stop then to
consider it. Matthew does not affirm that it withered "away in their
presence," and Mark affirms that they made the discovery on the morning
after it was "cursed."

[Mat 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020.md)

And when the disciples saw it - That is, on the morning following that
on which it was cursed, [Mar 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020.md).

They marveled, saying ... - Peter said this, [Mar
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021.md) Matthew means only to say that
this was said to him; Mark tells us which one of them said it.

[Mat 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md)

Jesus answered and said ... - Jesus took occasion from this to establish
their faith in God, [Mar 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022.md)

He told them that any difficulty could be overcome by faith. To remove a
mountain denotes the power of surmounting or removing any difficulty.
The phrase was so used by the Jews. There is no doubt that this was
"literally" true - that if "they had the faith of miracles," they could
remove the mountain before them - the Mount of Olives - for this was as
easy for God to do by them as to heal the sick or raise the dead. But
the Saviour rather referred, probably, to the difficulties and trials
which they would be called to endure in preaching the gospel.

[Mat 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022.md)

And all things ... - He adds an encouragement for them to pray, assuring
them that they should have all things which they asked.

This promise was evidently a special one, given to them in regard to
working miracles. To them it was true, but it is manifest that we have
no right to apply this promise to ourselves. It was desired especially
for the apostles; nor have we a right to turn it from its original
meaning. There are other promises in, abundance on which we "may" rely
in prayer, with confident assurance that our prayers will be heard.

[Mat 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md)

When he was come into the temple - That is, probably, into the inner
court - the court of the Israelites.

They took this opportunity of questioning him on this subject when he
was not surrounded by the multitude.

By what authority ... - There was a show of propriety in this question.
He was making great changes in the affairs of the temple, and they
claimed the right to know why this was done, contrary to their
permission. He was not "a priest;" he had no civil or ecclesiastical
authority as a Jew. It was sufficient authority, indeed, that he came as
a prophet and worked miracles. But they professed not to be satisfied
with that.

These things - The things which he had just done, in overturning the
seats of those that were engaged in traffic, [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md).

[Mat 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md), [Mat
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md)

And Jesus answered ... - Jesus was under no obligation to give them an
answer.

They well knew by what authority he did this. He had not concealed his
power in working miracles, and had not kept back the knowledge that he
was the Messiah. He therefore referred them to a similar case - that of
John the Baptist. He knew the estimation in which John was held by the
people, and he took the wise in their own craftiness. Whatever answer
they gave, he knew they Would convict themselves, and so they saw when
they looked at the question. They reasoned correctly. If they should say
that John received authority to baptize from God or from heaven, he
would directly ask why they did not believe him. They professed to hear
all the prophets. If they said, "Of men," they would be in danger, for
all the people believed that John was a prophet.

The baptism of John - For an account of this, see Matt. 3. The word
"baptism" here probably includes all his work. This was his principal
employment; and hence he was called the Baptist, or the "Baptizer." But
our Saviour's question refers "to his whole ministry." "The 'ministry of
John' - his baptism, preaching, prophecies was it from God, or not?" If
it was, then the inference was clear that Jesus was the Messiah, and
then they might easily know by what authority he did those things.

From heaven - By divine authority, or by the command of God.

From men - By human authority.

[Mat 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026.md)

We fear the people - They feared that the people would stone them
(Luke). Such an unpopular sentiment as to profess that all that "John"
did was "imposture," would have probably ended in tumult, perhaps in
their death.

[Mat 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md)

We cannot tell - This was a direct falsehood. They could have told; and
the answer should have been, "We will not tell." There was no reason but
that why they did not tell. The reason, probably, why they would not
acknowledge that John was a prophet, was that, if they did, they saw he
could easily show them by "what authority" he did those things; that is,
by his authority as Messiah. John came as his forerunner, pointed him
out to the people, baptized him, and bore his public and solemn
testimony to the fact that he was the Messiah, [Mat
3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md); [Joh
1:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md). If they acknowledged one,
they must the other. In this way our Saviour was about to lead these
crafty men to answer their own question, to their own confusion, about
his authority. They saw this; and, having given them a "sufficient"
answer, there was no need of stating anything further.

[Matthew 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 21:28</span></span>

But what think ye? - A way of speaking designed to direct them
particularly to what he was saying, that they might be self-convicted.

Two sons - By those two sons our Lord intends to represent the conduct
of the Jews, and that of the publicans and sinners.

In my vineyard - See the notes at [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md). To work in the vineyard here
represents the work which God requires man to do.

I will not - This had been the language of the publicans and wicked men.
They refused at first, and did not "profess" to be willing to go.

Repented - Changed his mind. Afterward, at the preaching of John and
Christ, the publicans - the wicked - repented and obeyed.

The second ...said, I go sir; and went not - This represented the
conduct of the scribes and Pharisees - "professing" to obey God,
observing the external rites of religion, but opposed really to the
kingdom of God, and about to put his Son to death.

Whether of them twain ... - Which of the two. "They say unto him, The
first." This answer was correct; but it is strange that they did not
perceive that it condemned themselves.

Go into the kingdom of God - Become Christians, or more readily follow
the Saviour. See the notes at [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

Before you - Rather than you. They are more likely to do it than you.
You are self-righteous, self-willed, and obstinate.

John came in the way of righteousness - Many of them have believed, but
you have not. That is, in the right way, or teaching the way to be
righteous; to wit, by repentance. Publicans and harlots heard him and
became righteous, but they did not. They saw it, but, as in one thousand
other cases, it did not produce the proper effect on them, and they
would not repent.

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

The parable of the vineyard - This is also recorded in [Mar
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md); [Luk
20:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md).

[Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

Hear another parable - See the notes at [Mat
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md).

A certain householder - See the notes at [Mat
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md).

Planted a vineyard - A place for the cultivation of grapes. It is often
used to represent the church of God. as a place cultivated and valuable.
Judea was favorable to vines, and the figure is frequently used,
therefore, in the sacred writers. See [Mat
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md). It is used here to represent the
"Jewish people" - the people chosen of the Lord, cultivated with care,
and signally favored; or perhaps more definitely, "the city of
Jerusalem."

Hedged it round about - This means he enclosed it, either with a fence
of wood or stone, or more probably with "thorns," thick set and growing
- a common way of enclosing fields in Judea, as it is in England,

And digged a wine-press in it - Mark says, "digged a place for the
wine-fat." This should have been so rendered in Matthew. The original
word does not mean the "press" in which the grapes were trodden, but the
"vat or large cistern" into which the wine ran. This was commonly made
by digging into the side of a hill. The "wine-press" was made of two
receptacles. The upper one, in Persia at present, is about 8 feet square
and 4 feet high. In this the grapes are thrown and "trodden" by men, and
the juice runs into the large receptacle or cistern below. See the notes
at [Isa 63:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md).

And built a tower - See also the notes at [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md). In Eastern countries at present,
these towers are often 80 feet high and 30 feet square. They were for
the keepers, who defended the vineyards from thieves and animals,
especially from foxes, [Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006.md); [Sol
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md). Professor Hackett (Illustrations
of Scripture, pp. 171, 172) says of such towers:

They caught my attention first as I was approaching Bethlehem from the
southeast. They appeared in almost every field within sight from that
direction. They were circular in shape, 15 or 20 feet high, and, being
built of stones, looked, at a distance, like a little forest of
obelisks. I was perplexed for some time to decide what they were; my
traveling companions were equally at fault. Suddenly, in a lucky moment,
the words crossed my mind, 'A certain man planted a vineyard, and set a
hedge about it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and
went into a far country,' [Mar 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md).
This recollection cleared up the mystery. There, before my eyes, stood
the towers of which I had so often read and thought; such as stood there
when David led forth his flocks to the neighboring pastures; such as
furnished to the sacred writers and the Saviour himself so many
illustrations for enforcing what they taught.

These towers are said to be sometimes square in form as well as round,
and as high as 40 or 50 feet. Those which I examined had a small door
near the ground, and a level space on the top, where a man could sit and
command a view of the plantation. I afterward saw a great many of these
structures near Hebron, where the vine still flourishes in its ancient
home; for there, probably, was Eshcol, whence the Hebrew spies returned
to Joshua with the clusters of grapes which they had gathered as
evidence of the fertility of the land. Some of the towers here are so
built as to serve as houses: and during the vintage, it is said that the
inhabitants of Hebron take up their abode in them in such numbers as to
leave the town almost deserted.

And let it out ... - This was not an uncommon thing. Vineyards were
often planted to be let out for profit.

Into a far country - This means, in the original, only that he departed
from them. It does not mean that he went out of the "land." Luke adds,
"for a long time." That is, as appears, until the time of the fruit;
perhaps for a year. This vineyard denotes, doubtless, the Jewish people,
or Jerusalem. But these circumstances are not to be particularly
explained. They serve to keep up the story. They denote in general that
God had taken proper care of his vineyard - that is, of his people; but
beyond that we cannot affirm that these circumstances of building the
tower, etc., mean any particular thing, for he has not told us that they
do, and where he has not explained them we have no right to attempt it.

[Mat 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md)

And when the time of the fruit drew near ... - The time of gathering the
fruit.

The vineyard was let out, probably, for a part of the fruit, and the
owner sent to receive the part that was his.

Sent his servants - These, doubtless, represent the prophets sent to the
Jewish people.

[Mat 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md)

And beat one - The word translated here as "beat" properly means to flay
or to take off the skin; hence to beat or to whip so that the skin in
many places is taken off.

And killed another - Isaiah is said to have been put to death by sawing
him asunder.

Many other of the prophets were also put to death. See [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034.md); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md); [Sa1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018.md); [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md).

And stoned another - This was among the Jews a common mode of
punishment, [Deu 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#010.md); [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md); [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md). Especially was this the case in
times of popular tumult, and of sudden indignation among the people,
[Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md); [Joh
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059.md); [Joh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md). This does not I imply, of
necessity, that those who were stoned "died," but they might be only
severely wounded. Mark says, "At him they cast stones and wounded him in
the head, and sent him away," etc.

There is a little variation in the circumstances as mentioned by
Matthew, and by Mark and Luke, but the substance is the same. Mark and
Luke are more particular, and state the order in which the servants were
sent one after another. They all denote the dealing of the people of
Israel toward the prophets. All these things had been done to them. See
[Heb 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md); [Jer
44:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md); [Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016.md); [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026.md); [Ch2
24:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md).

[Mat 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037.md)

Last of all ... - Mark adds that this was an only son, greatly beloved.

This beautifully and most tenderly exhibits the love of God in sending
his only Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to die for people. Long had
he sent the prophets, and they had been persecuted and slain. There was
no use in sending any more prophets to the people. They had done all
that they could do. God had one only-begotten and well-beloved Son, whom
he might send, and whom the world "ought" to reverence even as they
should the Father, [Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md). God is
often represented in the Bible as giving his Son, his only-begotten and
wellbeloved Son, for a lost world, [Joh
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md), [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md); [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md), [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md); [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md).

Saying, They will reverence my son - To "reverence" means to honor, to
esteem, to show deference to. It is that feeling which we have in the
presence of one who is greatly our superior. It means to give to such a
person, in our feelings and our deportment, the honor which is due to
his rank and character.

[Mat 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038.md)

But when the husbandmen ... - They determined to kill him, and as he was
the only son, they supposed they could easily seize on the property It
was rented to them; was in their possession; and they resolved to keep
it.

This circumstance has probably no reference to any particular conduct of
the Jews, but is thrown in to keep up the story and fill up the
narrative. An heir is one who succeeds to an estate, commonly a son; an
"inheritance" is what an heir receives.

[Mat 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#039.md)

And they caught him ... - This refers to the conduct of the Jews in
putting the Saviour to death.

So they understood it, [Mat 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045.md). The
Jews put him to death after they had persecuted and slain the prophets.
This was done by giving him into the hands of the Romans and seeking his
crucifixion, [Mat 27:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#020.md); [Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md); [Act
7:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md).

And cast him out of the vineyard - The vineyard in this parable may
represent Jerusalem. Jesus was crucified "out" of Jerusalem, on Mount
Calvary, [Luk 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#023.md). See the notes at
[Heb 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md).

[Mat 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md)

When the lord, therefore ... - Jesus then asked them a question about
the proper way of dealing with those people.

The design of asking them this question was that they might condemn
themselves, and admit the justice of the punishment that was soon to
come upon them.

[Mat 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md)

They say ... - They answered according as they knew people would act,
and would act justly in doing it.

He would take away their privileges and confer them on others. This was
the answer which Jesus wished. The case was so clear that they could not
answer otherwise. He wished to show them the justice of taking away
their national privileges, and punishing them in the destruction of
their city and nation. Had he stated this at first they would not have
heard him. He, however, by a parable, led them along to "state
themselves" the very truth which he wished to communicate, and they had
then nothing to answer. They did not, however, yet see the bearing of
what they had admitted.

[Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md), [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)

Jesus saith ... - Jesus, having led them to admit the justice of the
great "principle" on which God was about to act toward them proceeds to
apply it by a text of Scripture, declaring that this very thing which
they admitted to be proper in the case of the "husbandmen" had been
predicted respecting themselves.

This passage is found in [Psa
118:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md). It was first applicable to
David, but no less to Jesus.

The stone - The figure is taken from building a house. The principal
stone for size and beauty is that commonly laid as the cornerstone.

Which the builders rejected - On account of its want of beauty or size
it was laid aside, or deemed unfit to be a cornerstone. This represents
the Lord Jesus, proposed to the Jews as the foundation or cornerstone on
which to build the church, but rejected by them - the builders - on
account of his lack of comeliness or beauty; that is, of what they
esteemed to be comely or desirable, [Isa
53:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md).

The same is become ... - Though rejected by them, yet God chose him, and
made him the foundation of the church. Christ is often compared to a
stone, a cornerstone, a tried, that is, a sure, firm foundation - all in
allusion to the custom of building, [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md); [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md).

Lord's doing - The appointment of Jesus of Nazareth to be the foundation
of the church is proved by miracle and prophecy to be the work of God.

Marvellous in our eyes - Wonderful in the sight of his people. That he
should select his only Son - that he should stoop so low, be despised,
rejected, and put to death - that God should raise him up, and build a
church on this foundation, embracing the Gentile as well as the Jew, and
spreading through all the world, is a subject of wonder and praise to
all the redeemed.

[Mat 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)

The kingdom of God ... - Jesus applies the parable to them - the Jews.

They had been the children of the kingdom, or under the reign of God;
having his law and acknowledging him as King. They had been his chosen
and special people, but he says that now this privilege would be taken
away; that they would cease to be the special people of God, and that
the blessing would be given to a nation who would bring forth the fruits
thereof, or "be righteous" that is, to the Gentiles, [Act
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#028.md).

[Mat 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)

Whosoever shall fall ... - There is a reference here, doubtless, to [Isa
8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md). Having made an allusion to
himself "as a stone," or a rock [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md), he proceeds to state the
consequences of coming in contact with it. He that falls upon it shall
be broken; he that "runs against it" - a cornerstone, standing out from
the other parts of the foundation shall be injured, or broken in his
limbs or body. He that is offended with my being the foundation, or that
opposes me, shall by the act injure himself, or make himself miserable
"by so doing," even were there nothing further. But there is something
further.

On whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder - That is, in
the original, will reduce him to dust, so that it may be scattered by
the winds. There is an allusion here, doubtless, to the custom of
stoning as a punishment among the Jews. A scaffold was erected twice the
height of the man to be stoned. Standing on its edge, he was violently
struck off by one of the witnesses: if he died by the blow and the fall,
nothing further was done; if not, a heavy stone was thrown down on him,
which at once killed him. So the Saviour speaks of the "falling" of the
stone on his enemies. They who oppose him, who reject him, and who
continue impenitent, shall be crushed by him in the day of judgment, and
perish forever.

[Mat 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045.md), [Mat
21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md)

At last, they perceived that he spoke of them, and would have gratified
their malice at once but they feared the people.

Remarks On Matthew 21

1\. Jesus is omniscient, and sees and knows all things, [Mat
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md).

2\. It is our duty to obey the Lord Jesus, and to do it at once, [Mat
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md). When He commands there should be
no delay. What he orders is right, and we should not hesitate or
deliberate about it.

3\. Especially is this the case where He is to be honored, as he was on
this occasion, [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md), [Mat
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md). If it was for "our" interest or
honor only that we obeyed him, it would be of less consequence; but our
obedience will honor Him, and we should seek that honor by any sacrifice
or self-denial.

4\. We should be willing to give up our property to honor the Lord
Jesus, [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md). He has a right to
it. If given to spread the gospel, it goes, as this did, to increase
"the triumphs of our King." We should be willing to give our wealth that
he might "gird on his sword," and "ride prosperously among the heathen."
Everyone who is saved among the pagan by sending the gospel to them will
be for the honor of Jesus. They will go to swell his train when he shall
enter triumphantly into his kingdom at the day of judgment.

5\. It is our duty to honor him, [Mat
21:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md). He is King of Zion. He is Lord
of all. He reigns, and shall always reign.

"Sinners! Whose love can ne'er forget

The wormwood and the gall,

Go spread your trophies at his feet,

And crown him Lord of all.

"Ye chosen seed of Israel's race;

Ye ransomed from the fall;

Hail him who saves you by his grace,

And crown him Lord of all.

"Let every kindred, every tribe,

On this terrestrial ball,

To him all majesty ascribe,

And crown him Lord of all."

6\. "Children" should also honor him and shout "hosanna" to him, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md). The chief priests and scribes,
in the time of our Saviour, were displeased that they did it; and many
of the great, and many formal professors since, have been displeased
that "children" should profess to love and honor Jesus. They have
opposed Sunday schools, and opposed the praying of children, and opposed
their singing to his praise, and opposed their giving their money to
spread his gospel; but Jesus loves such praise and such service. The
mouths of babes and sucklings should be taught to speak his name; and
whatever the world may say, whatever the proud, the rich, or the formal
may say, children should seek him early and give their first years to
him. He loves their praises. Perhaps few of all the songs of
thanksgiving are so pleasant to his ears as the "hosannas" of a Sunday
school.

7\. We have here a view of the glory of Jesus, [Mat
21:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md). Though humble yet he was
King. Though most of his life unhonored, yet once he had the honors of
his station rendered to him, and entered the city of his father David as
a triumphant King of Zion. He will be yet "more" honored. He will come
with all his saints, with the glory of his Father, and with the holy
angels. There we shall be; and we should be prepared to join with the
vast host in shouting hosanna to the returning King of Zion.

8\. Yet, amid all these honors, he was meek and lowly, [Mat
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md). Others would have been proud and
lifted up, but he was always meek; his heart was not proud. He is the
only one of kings that could bear triumph and honors without being
lifted up by it and made proud.

9\. Yet amid all his triumphs he wept over Jerusalem (Luke). No king, no
conqueror, ever before showed compassion like this. People weep when
"they" are afflicted, or are poor and needy; but what prince has ever,
in the moment of his triumph, wept over the miseries and dangers of his
subjects? Not an instance can be found in all history where an earthly
conqueror ever showed compassion like this. So Jesus has still
compassion over blind, ruined, wretched man. Amid all the triumphs of
the gospel, he does not forget those I who are yet in their sins, but
stretches out his arms to welcome them to his embrace.

10\. Prophecy will be certainly and exactly fulfilled (Luke). That
respecting Jerusalem was literally accomplished; and in like manner will
all that is predicted of "all" sinners assuredly come to pass. If
Jerusalem had repented it would have been saved; so if sinners repent
they will be saved. If not, like Jerusalem, in due time they will
perish.

11\. Jesus purified the temple, [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md). It was the house of God. So our
hearts should be the dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit; so, also, they
should be pure. All worldly cares, and traffic, and business, that would
interfere with the dwelling of the Spirit there, and all wickedness,
oppression, extortion, cheating, and pollution should be banished. God
dwells not in such polluted temples; and unless we are "pure in heart,"
he will not be with us, and we shall not see his face in peace. Compare
the notes at [Co1 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md).

12\. Jesus only can purify our hearts. He does it by his blood and
Spirit. Over all our sins he holds the same power as he did over the
traffickers in the temple. At his command they will flee, and we shall
be pure. If our hearts are ever purified, therefore, it will be by the
power of Jesus. Nor should we wait in sin for him to do it. We should
come to him, and beseech him to have mercy, and to save us from our
pollutions.

13\. Envy and hatred will take hold of very small matters, to show
itself against the good and even the prudent, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md). When the enemies of Jesus could
find nothing else to blame, they chose to find fault with the shouting
of children. So always in a revival of religion, or any great work of
the Lord, it is some small matter that is seized upon something not
exactly to the view of wicked objectors - that is made the occasion of
reproach and opposition.

14\. We must produce fruit in our lives as well as flowers, [Mat
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md). A profession of religion is
like the flowers of spring. A revival is like fragrant blossoms. They
are beautiful, and promise much fruit; but how many wither, and droop,
and fall useless to the ground! How few of all the blossoms of the
spring produce ripe and mellow fruit in autumn! So, alas! it is often
with those who appear well in revivals of religion.

15\. If we make a profession and do not produce fruit, Jesus will curse
us, and we shall soon wither away, [Mat
21:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md). He will suffer none to enter
into his kingdom on the ground of profession only. If we bear fruit and
live lives of piety, we are Christians; if not, all our professions are
like the blossoms of spring or the leaves of the tree. They will not
save us from the withering frown of Jesus.

16\. People will do almost anything right or wrong, and as often wrong
as right - to court popularity, [Mat
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md). It is generally not asked by
such people what is "right" or what is "true," but what will secure
popularity. If they have that, they are satisfied.

17\. People often tell a direct falsehood rather than acknowledge the
truth, [Mat 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md). Especially is this
the case when the truth makes against them.

18\. Double-dealing and an attempt to evade the truth commonly lead into
difficulty. If these people had been honest, they would have had far
less trouble, [Mat 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md).

19\. A state of gross and open sin is often more hopeful than one of
hypocrisy, pride, and self-conceit, together with external conformity to
religion, [Mat 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md). Multitudes of
profane and licentious people may be saved, while the proud and
self-righteous will be cut off. The reasons are,

\(1\) That the wicked, the gross, have no righteousness on which they
can pretend to rely.

\(2\) nothing so effectually prevents religion as pride and
self-confidence.

\(3\) There is often really more ingenuousness and candor, and less of
malignity against the gospel, among the openly wicked, than among those
who are outwardly righteous, but who are inwardly like whited
sepulchres, full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.

20\. Multitudes of people profess to go, and go not, [Mat
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030.md). They profess to love God, and
love themselves better. They profess to obey him, and yet obey their
lusts. They are hypocrites, and destruction must come upon them.

21\. Sinners, when they see the effect of truth on others, should
repent, [Mat 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md). It is proof of the
truth of religion, and they, as much as others, need it.

22\. We see the goodness of God in sending his messengers to a lost
world, [Mat 21:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md). His prophets he
sent one after another, and they were put to death. His well-beloved Son
he sent, and He also was put to death. Nor is his mercy yet stayed. He
still sends his message to sinners. Thousands have died, as his Son did,
in attempting to spread the gospel, but still he sends it. We have
often, often rejected it, yet still he sends it. What earthly monarch
would be treated in this manner? What earthly parent would be so patient
and so kind?

23\. If we improve not our privileges they will be taken away from us,
[Mat 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md). The gospel will be sent to
many of the pagan, and they will be saved, but woe to those who have had
it all their lives and are not saved.

24\. All who reject the Saviour must perish, [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md).
