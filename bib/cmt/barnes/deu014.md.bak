### [Deuteronomy Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 14:0</span></span>

The whole life and walk of the people were to be regulated by the
principle "ye are the children of the Lord your God" [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md).

[Deuteronomy 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 14:1</span></span>

Make any baldness between your eyes - i. e. by shaving the forepart of
the head and the eyebrows. The practices named in this verse were common
among the pagan, and seem to be forbidden, not only because such wild
excesses of grief (compare [Kg1 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#028).md)
would be inconsistent in those who as children of a heavenly Father had
prospects beyond this world, but also because these usages themselves
arose out of idolatrous notions.

[Deuteronomy 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 14:3</span></span>

Compare Lev. 11. The variations here, whether omissions or additions,
are probably to be explained by the time and circumstances of the
speaker.

[Deu 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md)

The "pygarg" is a species of gazelle, and the "wild ox" and "chamois"
are swift types of antelope.

[Deu 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md)

The prohibition is repeated from [Lev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008.md). The directions as to the
disposal of the carcass are unique to Deuteronomy, and their motive is
clear. To have forbidden the people either themselves to eat that which
had died, or to allow any others to do so, would have involved loss of
property, and consequent temptation to an infraction of the command. The
permissions now for the first time granted would have been useless in
the wilderness. During the 40 years' wandering there could be but little
opportunity of selling such carcasses; while non-Israelites living in
the camp would in such a matter be bound by the same rules as the
Israelites [Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015.md); [Lev
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#022.md). Further, it would seem (compare
[Lev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015).md) that greater stringency is
here given to the requirement of abstinence from that which had died of
itself. Probably on this, as on so many other points, allowance was made
for the circumstances of the people. Flesh meat was no doubt often
scarce in the desert. It would therefore have been a hardship to forbid
entirely the use of that which had not been killed. However, now that
the plenty of the promised land was before them, the modified toleration
of this unholy food was withdrawn.

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

These words recall in general terms the command of the earlier
legislation respecting tithes (compare [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md); [Num
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026).md), but refer more particularly to
the second or festival tithe, which was an exclusively vegetable one.

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. The tithe thus directed in the third
year to be dispensed in charity at home, was not paid in addition to
that in other years bestowed on the sacred meals, but was substituted
for it. The three years would count from the sabbatical year (see the
next chapter), in which year there would of course be neither payment of
tithe nor celebration of the feasts at the sanctuary. In the third year
and sixth year of the septennial cycle the feasts would be superseded by
the private hospitality enjoined in these verses.
