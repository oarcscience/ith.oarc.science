### [Deuteronomy Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 13:0</span></span>

The admonition of the closing verse of the last chapter introduces a new
series of warnings intended to serve as a further safeguard against
violation of these duties. The true modes and forms of worship have been
laid down: the next step is to legislate against the authors and
abettors of false ones.

[Deuteronomy 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 13:1</span></span>

A prophet, or a dreamer of dreams - Compare [Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md). The "prophet" received his
revelations by vision or direct oral communication [Num
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md); [Sa2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md); [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md); "the dreamer of dreams" through
the medium of a dream [Kg1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005.md); [Mat
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013.md).

[Deuteronomy 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 13:2</span></span>

The Lord had said, "Thou shalt have none other gods but Me." A prophet
is here supposed who invites the people "to go after other gods." To
such a one no credit is under any circumstances to be given, even should
he show signs and wonders to authenticate his doctrine. The standing
rule of faith and practice had been laid down once for all - that the
people were to hold fast. The prophet who propounded another rule could
only be an impostor.

A different case is considered in [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md), etc.

[Deuteronomy 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 13:5</span></span>

The context and parallel passages (compare [Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md); [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002).md) indicate that there was to be a
regular judicial procedure, and that the manner of the execution was to
be by stoning. In this the community was to take its part in order to
show its horror at the crime, and to clear itself of complicity therein.

[Deuteronomy 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 13:6</span></span>

If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or
the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice
thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast
not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

[Deuteronomy 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 13:12</span></span>

City was to keep jealous watch over city, as man over man. The clause
"which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell in" significantly
reminds them that the real ownership of their dwellings rested in the
Lord (compare [Lev 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023).md), and that
they, the mere tenants, must not allow His property to become a center
of rebellion against His just authority.

[Deuteronomy 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 13:13</span></span>

In [Deu 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md) and in [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md) the word "Belial" is rendered in
our translation by the adjective "wicked." The word means
"worthlessness."

(from Barnes' Notes)

[Deuteronomy 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 13:16</span></span>

Every whit, for the Lord thy God - Some prefer: "as a whole offering to
the Lord thy God."
