### [Ezekiel Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 25:1</span></span>

It was a distinct part of scriptural prophecy to address pagan nations.
In Isaiah Isa. 13-19, Jeremiah Jer. 46-51, and here Ezek. 25-32, one
section is specially devoted to a collection of such prophecies. Every
such prediction had the general purpose of exhibiting the conflict ever
waging between the servants of God and the powers of the world, the
struggle in which the Church of Christ has still to wrestle against her
foes [Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md), but in which she will
surely prevail.

It was a distinct part of scriptural prophecy to address pagan nations.
In Isaiah Isa. 13-19, Jeremiah Jer. 46-51, and here Ezek. 25-32, one
section is specially devoted to a collection of such prophecies. Every
such prediction had the general purpose of exhibiting the conflict ever
waging between the servants of God and the powers of the world, the
struggle in which the Church of Christ has still to wrestle against her
foes [Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md), but in which she will
surely prevail.

This series of prophecies, with one exception, was delivered at the time
of the fall of Jerusalem; some shortly before, and some shortly after,
the capture of the city. They were collected together to illustrate
their original purpose of warning the nations not to exult in their
neighbor's fall. Seven nations are addressed, which have had most
contact with the children of Israel - on their eastern borders Moab and
Ammon, to the south, Edom, on the south-west Philistia, northward Tyre
(the merchant city) and the more ancient Sidon, and lastly Egypt,
alternately the scourge and the false stay of the chosen people. The
number "seven" is symbolic of completeness. "Seven" prophecies against
Egypt the chief of "seven" nations, denote the completeness of the
overthrow of the pagan power, the antagonist of the kingdom of God.
While other prophets hold out to these pagan nations some prospect of
future mercy (e. g., [Isa 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md); [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md), [Jer
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011).md), Ezekiel speaks of their
complete ruin. He was contemplating "national" ruin. In the case of
Jerusalem there would be national restoration, but in the case of the
pagan no such recovery. The "national" ruin was irretrievable; the
remnant to whom the other prophets hold out hopes of mercy were to find
it as individuals gathered into God's Church, not as nations to be again
set up. Ezekiel does not, like other prophets, prophesy against Babylon;
it was his mission to show that for the moment, Babylon was the
righteous instrument of the divine wrath, doing God's work in punishing
His foes. In prophesying against foreign nations, Ezekiel often adopts
the language of those who preceded him.

In Ezek. 25, the four nations most closely connected with one another by
geographical position and by contact, are addressed in a few brief
sentences concluding with the same refrain - "Ye shall know that I am
the Lord" (e. g. [Eze 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005).md). This
prophecy was delivered immediately after the capture of the city by
Nebuchadnezzar, and so is later, in point of time, than some of the
prophecies that follow it.

The Ammonites were inveterate foes of the descendants of Abraham.

[Eze 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md)

Men of the east - The wild wandering Arabs who should come in afterward
upon the ruined land. The name was a common term for the nomadic tribes
of the desert. Compare [Isa 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md).

Palaces - encampments. The tents and folds of nomadic tribes. After
subjugation by Nebuchadnezzar [Eze
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028.md), the land was subjected to
various masters. The Graeco-Egyptian kings founded a city on the site of
Rabbah [Eze 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md), called Philadelphia,
from Ptolemy Philadelphus. In later times, Arabs from the east have
completed the doom pronounced against Rabbah.

[Eze 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md)

For a spoil - Or, for a portion.

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Prophecies against Moab which lay south of Ammon, and shared Ammon's
implacable hostility to the children of Israel.

Seir was close to Moab. Edom is identified with Mount "Seir" in [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md); and "Seir" is therefore
probably coupled with "Moab" here because, being near neighbors closely
leagued together, they expressed a common exultation at Jerusalem's
fall.

[Ezekiel 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 25:9</span></span>

I will open the side ... - i. e., lay it open to the attack of the enemy
from the cities, from his cities, from his frontier (or, in every
quarter). There is an ironical stress on "his" cities, because these
cities belonged not to Moab but to Israel, having been assigned to the
Reubenites [Num 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038.md); [Jos
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#020.md). They lay to the north of the
river Arnon, which was the proper boundary of Moab [Num
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013.md). The Moabites had in the last
days of the kingdom of Israel recovered this territory [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001.md). They still occupied this land
in the time of Ezekiel (see Jer. 48).

The glory of the country - This tract, belonging to the district called
by the Arabians "Al Belka," has been at all times highly valued on
account of the excellence of its pastures for cattle. The most southern
of these three cities is Kiriathaim, called on the Moabitic stone
Kirjath, and now Kureiyat. The dual termination of the name Kiriathaim,"
is explained by the fact that Kureiyat is situated on two sister
hillocks half a mile apart, both covered by the ancient city. It is
situated about eight miles north of the Arnon, and seven miles east of
the shore of the Dead Sea. Baal-meon is about ten miles north of
Kureiyat - known at present as Main. It is probable that Kiriathaim was
the "Kirjath-Huzoth" (city of streets), and Baal-meon, the "Bamoth-Baal"
(high places of Baal), to which Balak took Balaam [Num
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#039.md), [Num
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md). Baal-meon occurs on the
Moabitic stone as a place which Mesa built or fortified. He probably
erected a stronghold on the old locality, reviving the ancient name.
Beth-jeshimoth is identified with a knoll at the northeasternmost point
of the Dead Sea.

[Ezekiel 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 25:10</span></span>

Ammon and Moab, of common origin, whose lands had so often been
interchanged, shall now share a common ruin. To "the men of the east"
[Eze 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md) shall Moab with Ammon be
given, that Ammon may be remembercd no more, and judgment be executed on
Moab.

[Ezekiel 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 25:12</span></span>

Edom, so named from Esau, consisted of various tribes enumerated in Gen.
36. The Edomites became a powerful nation before the Israelites came out
of Egypt. David conquered them, but in the reign of Joram they rebelled
and were not again subdued [Kg2 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md).
Under the name of Idumea the land was conquered by John Hyrcanus
(compare [Eze 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014).md), when many of the
people adopted the religion of the Jews. In later times the Idumean
Herod became king of Palestine, reckoning himself as a Jew. Mount Seir,
deserted by its original inhabitants, was occupied by a tribe of
Arabians (the Nabatheans), under whelm Petra rose and continued a
flourishing city under Roman dominion, until the tide of Mahometan
conquest brought it to that ruin in which Edom at last found the
complete fulfillment of the prophecies uttered against it [Eze
35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001.md).

Taking vengeance - Referring to the wrong done by Jacob to Esau [Gen
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md).

[Ezekiel 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 25:13</span></span>

From Teman ... - Or "from Teman" even unto "Dedan," "shall they fall."
Teman and Dedan were districts (not cities), the former in the south
([Eze 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#046) note.md), the latter in the
north ("over the whole country").

[Ezekiel 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 25:15</span></span>

The Philistines occupying lands to the south of Judah were a Hamite race
[Gen 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#014.md), but of a different branch
from the Canaanites. They were a powerful people never dispossessed by
the Israelites [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md). They were a
thorn in the side of the chosen people throughout, and joined in
attacking Jerusalem in the day of her trouble. They were much reduced by
the Assyrians [Isa 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#031.md), and
Egyptians [Jer 47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md), before the time
of this prophecy, but further destruction came upon them in the general
ruin of the inhabitants of Canaan, which commenced with the destruction
of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.

[Eze 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016.md)

Cherethims - The inhabitants of the southern portion of Philistia [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md).
