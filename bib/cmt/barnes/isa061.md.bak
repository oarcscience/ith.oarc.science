### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 61:0</span></span>

This chapter, in its design and structure, is intimately connected with
the preceding. That it refers to the Messiah will be shown in the notes
at [Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), and the main scope and
design of the chapter is to show some of the glorious results of his
coming.

The chapter may be regarded as divided into the following parts, namely:

I. The public address or proclamation of the Messiah, stating the design
for which he had been appointed to his office, and the consolatory
nature of his message [Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md).

II\. The happy effects and privileges of his coming [Isa
61:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md).

1\. The effects of his coming in restoring the old wastes, and in
building up the long-fallen ruins [Isa
61:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md).

\(1\) The aid of others would be called in for this.

\(2\) The sons of foreigners would become tributary to them, and feed
their flocks and plow their fields, and dress their vines - that is, the
pagan world would become subject to the church.

2\. The privileges which would result from Ms coming [Isa
61:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md).

\(1\) Absolutely. They would be named friends of God, and enjoy the
wealth of the pagan world.

\(2\) Comparatively. Their state would be far more than a recompence for
all they had suffered.

\(3\) In the honor which would be put upon them. Their name would be
known abroad, and their children be honored as the blessed of the Lord.

III\. The occasion of rejoicing which the church would have in this [Isa
61:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md).

1\. In the beauty and honor with which she would be clothed.

2\. In the abundant increase of righteousness and purity.

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord God - Hebrew, The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh.' The
Chaldee renders this, 'The prophet said, the spirit of prophecy from the
presence of Yahweh God is upon me.' The Syriac, 'The Spirit of the Lord
God.' The Septuagint, Πνεῦμα Κυρίου Pneuma Kuriou - 'The Spirit of the
Lord,' omitting the word אדני 'ădonāy. So Luke quotes it in [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). That this refers to the Messiah
is abundantly proved by the fact that the Lord Jesus expressly applied
it to himself (see [Luk 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021).md).
Rosenmuller, Gesenius, and some others, suppose that it refers to Isaiah
himself, and that the idea is, that the prophet proclaims his commission
as authorized to administer consolation to the suffering exiles in
Babylon. It cannot be denied that the language is such as may be applied
in a subordinate sense to the office of the prophet, and that the work
of the Redeemer is here described in terms derived from the consolation
and deliverance afforded to the long-suffering exiles. But in a much
higher sense it refers to the Messiah, and received an entire completion
only as applied to him and to his work. Even Grotius, who has been said
to 'find Christ nowhere in the Old Testament,' remarks, 'Isaiah here
speaks of himself, as the Chaldee observes; but in him we see not an
obscure image of Christ.' Applied to the Redeemer, it refers to the time
when, having been baptized and set apart to the work of the Mediatorial
office, he began publicly to preach (see [Luk
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021).md). The phrase 'the Spirit of
Yahweh is upon me,' refers to the fact; that he had been publicly
consecrated to his work by the Holy Spirit descending on him at Iris
baptism [Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032.md), and that the Spirit of God had
been imparted to him 'without measure' to endow him for his great office
([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034.md); see the notes at [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md).

Because the Lord hath anointed me - The word rendered 'hath anointed'
(משׁח mâshach), is that from which the word Messiah is derived (see the
notes at [Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). prophets and
kings were set apart to their high office, by the ceremony of pouring
oil on their heads; and the idea here is that God had set apart the
Messiah for the office which he was to bear, and had abundantly endowed
him with the graces of which the anointing oil was an emblem. The same
language is used in reference to the Messiah in [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md) (compare [Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009).md).

To preach good tidings - On the meaning of the word (בשׂר bâs'ar)
rendered here 'to preach good tidings,' see the notes at [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md). The Septuagint renders it,
Εὐαγγελίσασθαι Euangelisasthai - 'To evangelize,' to preach the gospel.

Unto the meek - The word rendered 'meek' (ענוים ‛ănâviym) properly
denotes the afflicted, the distressed, the needy. The word 'meek' means
those who are patient in the reception of injuries, and stands opposed
to revengeful and irascible. This is by no means the sense of the word
here. It refers to those who were borne down by calamity in any form,
and would be particularly applicable to those who had been sighing in a
long captivity in Babylon. It is not improperly rendered by the
Septuagint by the word πτωχοῖς ptōchois, 'poor,' and in like manner by
Luke [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md); and the idea is, that
the Redeemer came to bring a joyful message to those who were oppressed
and borne down by the evils of poverty and calamity (compare [Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005).md).

To bind up the broken-hearted - (See the notes at [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md). The broken-hearted are those who
are deeply afflicted and distressed on any account. It may be either on
account of their sins, or of captivity and oppressionk, or of the loss
of relations and friends. The Redeemer came that he might apply the balm
of consolation to all such hearts, and give them joy and peace. A
similar form of expression occurs in [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md) :

He healeth the broken in heart,

And bindeth up their wounds.

To proclaim liberty to the captives - This evidently is language which
is taken from the condition of the exiles in their long captivity in
Babylon. The Messiah would accomplish a deliverance for those who were
held under the captivity of sin similar to that of releasing captives
from long and painful servitude. The gospel does not at once, and by a
mere exertion of power, open prison doors, and restore captives to
liberty. But it accomplishes an effect analogous to this: it releases
the mind captive under sin; and it will finally open all prison doors,
and by preventing crime will prevent the necessity of prisons, and will
remove all the sufferings which are now endured in confinement as the
consequence of crime. It may be remarked further, that the word here
rendered 'liberty' (דרור derôr) is a word which is properly applicable
to the year of Jubilee, when all were permitred to go free [Lev
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md) : 'And ye shall hallow the
fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty (דרור derôr) throughout all the land
unto all the inhabitants thereof.' So in [Jer
34:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008.md), it is used to denote the
manumission of slaves: 'To proclaim liberty (דרור derôr) unto them; that
every man should let his man-servant and every man his maid-servant,
being an Hebrew, or an Hebrewess, go free.' So also [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), of the same chapter.

So also in [Eze 46:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#017.md), it is applied
to the year in which the slave was by law restored to liberty. Properly,
therefore, the word has reference to the freedom of those who are held
in bondage, or to servitude; and it may be implied that it was to be a
part of the purpose of the Messiah to proclaim, ultimately, universal
freedom, and to restore all people to their just rights. If this is the
sense - and I see no reason to doubt it - while the main thing intended
was that he should deliver people from the inglorious servitude of sin,
it also means, that the gospel would contain principles inconsistent
with the existence of slavery, and would ultimately produce universal
emancipation. Accordingly it is a matter of undoubted fact that its
influence was such that in less than three centuries it was the means of
abolishing slavery throughout the Roman empire; and no candid reader of
the New Testament can doubt that if the principles of Christianity were
universally followed, the last shackle would soon fall from the slave.
Be the following facts remembered:

1\. No man ever made another originally a slave under the influence of
Christian principle. No man ever kidnapped another, or sold another,
BECAUSE it was done in obedience to the laws of Christ.

2\. No Christian ever manumitted a slave who did not feel that in doing
it he was obeying the spirit of Christianity, and who did not have a
more quiet conscience on that account.

3\. No man doubts that if freedom were to prevail everywhere, and all
men were to be regarded as of equal civil rights, it would be in
accordance with the mind of the Redeemer.

4\. Slaves are made in violation of all the precepts of the Saviour. The
work of kidnapping and selling men, women, and children; of tearing them
from their homes, and confining them in the pestilential holds of ships
on the ocean, and of dooming them to hard and perpetual servitude, is
not the work to which the Lord Jesus calls his disciples.

5\. Slavery, in fact, cannot be maintained without an incessant
violation of the principles of the New Testament. To keep people in
ignorance; to witchold from them the Bible; to prevent their learning to
read; to render nugatory the marriage contract, or to make it subject to
the will of a master; to deprive a man of the avails of Iris own labor
without his consent; to make him or his family subject to a removal
against his will; to prevent parents from training up their children
according to their own views of what is right; to fetter and bind the
intellect and shut up the avenues to knowledge as a necessary means of
continuing the system; and to make people dependent wholly on others
whether they shall hear the gospel or be permitted publicly to embrace
it, is everywhere deemed essential to the existence of slavery, and is
demanded by all the laws which rule over the regions of a country cursed
with this institution. In the whole work of slavery, from the first
capture of the unoffending person who is made a slave to the last act
which is adopted to secure his bondage, there is an incessant and
unvarying trampling on the laws of Jesus Christ. Not one thing is done
to make and keep a slave in accordance with any command of Christ; not
one thing which would be done if his example were followed and his law
obeyed. Who then can doubt that he came ultimately to proclaim freedom
to all captives, and that the prevalence of his gospel will yet be the
means of universal emancipation? (compare the notes at [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006).md).

And the opening of the prison - This language also is taken from the
release of those who had been confined in Babylon as in a prison; and
the idea is, that the Redeemer would accomplish a work for sinful and
suffering people like throwing open the doors of a prison and bidding
the man who had been long lying in a dungeon to go free. On the
grammatical structure of the verb rendered here 'opening of the prison'
(פקץ־קיץ peqach-qôach), Gesenius (Lexicon) and Rosenmuller may be
consulted. According to Gesenius, it should be read as one word. So many
manuscripts read it. It occurs nowhere else. It means here deliverance.
The Septuagint renders it, 'And sight to the blind,' which is followed
by Luke. The sentiment which is found in the Septuagint and in Luke, is
a correct one, and one which elsewhere occurs in the prophets (see [Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005).md): and as the sentiment was
correct, the Saviour did not deem it necessary to state that this was
not the literal translation of the Hebrew. Or more properly the Saviour
in the synagogue at Nazareth [Luk 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019.md)
used the Hebrew, and when Luke came to record it, he quoted it as he
found it in the version then in common use. This was the common practice
with the writers of the New Testament. The Evangelist wrote probably for
the Hellenists, or the Greek Jews, who commonly used the Septuagint
version, and he quotes that version as being the one with which they
were familiar. The sense is not materially varied whether the Hebrew be
followed, or the version by the Septuagint. The Arabic version agrees
nearly with the Evangelist. Horne (Introduction, ii. 403) is of opinion
that the Hebrew formerly contained more than we now find in the
manuscripts and the printed editions. Of that, however, I think there is
no good evidence.

[Isaiah 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 61:2</span></span>

To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord - (see the notes at [Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008).md). There is probably an allusion
here to the year of Jubilee, when the trumpet was blown, and liberty was
proclaimed throughout all the land (so [Lev
25:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009).md). In like manner the Messiah
would come to proclaim universal liberty - liberty to all the world from
the degrading servitude of sin. The time of his coming would be a time
when Yahweh would be pleased to proclaim through him universal
emancipation from this ignoble bondage, and to restore to all the
privilege of being the freedmen of the Lord.

And the day of vengeance of our God - (See the notes at [Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008).md). This is language adapted to the
deliverance from Babylon. The rescue of his people would be attended
with vengeance on their enemies. This was not quoted by the Saviour in
his discourse at Nazareth, or if quoted, the fact is not recorded by
Luke (see [Luk 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019).md). The text which
the Saviour took then as the foundation of his discourse [Luk
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021.md), seems to have ended with the
clause before this, It is not to be inferred, however, that he did not
consider the subsequent expressions as referring to himself, but it was
not necessary to his purpose to quote them. Regarded as applicable to
the Redeemer and his preaching, this doubtless refers to the fact that
his coming would be attended with vengeance on his foes. It is a great
truth, manifest everywhere, that God's coming forth at any time to
deliver his people is attended with vengeance on his enemies. So it was
in the destruction of Idumea - regarded as the general representative of
all the foes of God (see the notes at Isa. 34; [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md); so it was in the deliverance
from Egypt - involving the destruction of Pharaoh and his host; so in
the destruction of Babylon and the deliverance of the captives there. So
in like manner it was in the destruction of Jerusalem; and so it will be
at the end of the world Matt. 25:31-46; [Th2
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md).

To comfort all that mourn - The expression, 'all that mourn,' may refer
either to those who mourn over the loss of earthly friends and
possessions, or to those who mourn over sin. In either case the gospel
has afforded abundant sources of consolation (see the notes at [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 61:3</span></span>

To appoint unto them - Hebrew, 'To place;' that is, to place happiness
before them; to give them joy arid consolation.

That mourn in Zion - (See the notes at [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). The mourners in Zion mean those
who dwelt in Jerusalem; then all those who are connected with the church
of God - his poor and afflicted people.

To give unto them beauty for ashes - In the Hebrew there is here a
beautiful paronomasia, which cannot be transferred to our language - אפר
תחת פאר pe'ēr tachath 'êpher. The word rendered 'beauty' (פאר pe'ēr)
means properly a head-dress, turban, tiara, or diadem; and the idea is,
that the Redeemer would impart to his mourning people such an ornament
instead of the ashes which in their grief they were accustomed to easy
on their heads. For the use of the word, see [Isa
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#020.md); [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); [Exo
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#029.md); [Eze
24:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md). It was common among the
Orientals to east dust and ashes upon their heads in time of mourning,
and as expressive of their grief (compare the notes at [Isa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005.md); [Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019).md).

The oil of joy - The oil of joy denotes that which was symbolic or
expressive of joy. Oil or ointment was employed on occasions of
festivity and joy (see the notes at [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009).md); but its use was abstained from
in times of public calamity or grief (see [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002).md).

The garment of praise - That is, the garment or clothing which shall be
expresive of praise or gratitude instead of that which shall indicate
grief.

For the spirit of heaviness. - Instead of a heavy, burdened, and
oppressed spirit. The word used here (כהה kēhâh), usually means faint,
feeble, weak (see the notes at [Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003).md). It is applied to a lamp about
to go out [Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md); to eyes bedimmed,
or dull [Sa1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md); to a faint or pale
color [Lev 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#039.md). Here it denotes
those of a faint and desponding heart. These expressions are figurative,
and are taken from the custom which prevailed more in Oriental countries
than elsewhere - and which is founded in nature - of expressing the
emotions of the mind by the manner of apparel. These customs are stated
in the book of Judith. She 'pulled off the sackcloth which she had on,
and pus off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over
with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the
hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it (Greek, μιτρε mitre), and
put on her garments of gladness wherewith she was clad during the life
of Manasses her husband. And she took sandals upon her feet, and put
about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her
ear-rings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely to allure
the eyes of all men that should see her' [Isa
10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md).

That they might be called - That is, those who had mourned in Zion.

Trees of righteousness - In the Hebrew, 'Oaks,' or terebinth trees. By
their being oaks of righteousness is meant people distinguished for
righteousness or justice. The Septuagint renders it, Γενεαὶ Geneai -
'Generations;' Jerome, Fortes - 'Strong;' the Chaldee, 'Princes;' the
Syriac, 'Rams;' but the word properly denotes the oak, or the terebinth
tree - a lofty, strong, and magnificent tree. It is not uncommon to
represent people by trees (see [Isa
1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Psa
92:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012).md):

The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree;

He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon,

Those that be planted in the house of the Lord,

Shall flourish in the courts of our God.

They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;

They shall be fat and flourishing.

See also the beautiful description in [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md), and in [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md). The idea here is, that they who
had been oppressed and borne down by calamity and by a sense of sin,
would become vigorous and strong; and would be such as aptly to be
compared to majestic trees with far-spreading branches - an image
everywhere of that which is truly beautiful.

The planting of the Lord - Those whom Yahweh had truly planted; that is,
those who were under his care and culture (see the notes at [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021).md). The same figure is used by the
Saviour. 'Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be
rooted up' [Mat 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md).

That he might be glorified - (See the notes at [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 61:4</span></span>

And they shall build the old wastes - (See the notes at [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 61:5</span></span>

And strangers shall stand - (See the notes at [Isa
14:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md); [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010).md).

And feed your flocks - The keeping of flocks constituted a very
considerable part of the husbandry of those who dwelt in Palestine. Of
course, any considerable prosperity of a spiritual nature would be well
represented by an accession of foreigners, who should come to relieve
them in their toil. It is not necessary to suppose that this is to be
taken literally, nor that it should be so spiritualized as to suppose
that the prophet refers to churches and their pastors, and to the fact,
that those churches would be put under the care of pastors from among
the pagan. The idea is, that it would be a time of signal spiritual
prosperity, and when the accession would be as great and important as if
foreigners were to come in among a people, and take the whole labor of
attending their flocks and cultivating their fields.

Your plowmen - Hebrew, אכר 'ikkâr, from which probably is derived the
Greek ἀγρός agros; the Gothic akr; the German acker; and the English
acre. It means properly a digger or cultivator of the soil, or farmer
[Jer 51:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#026.md); [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016.md).

And vine-dressers - The sense here accords with that which has been so
repeatedly said before, that the pagan world would yet become tributary
to the church (see the notes at [Isa
9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md), [Isa
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 61:6</span></span>

But ye shall be named - The idea here literally is, 'There will be no
need of your engaging in the business of agriculture. All that will be
done by others; and you, as ministers of God, may engage wholly in the
duties of religion. The world shall be tributary to you, and you shall
enjoy the productions of all lands; and you may, therefore, devote
yourselves exclusively to the service of Yahweh, as a kingdom of
priests.' A similar promise occurs in [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md) : 'And ye shall be unto me a
kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.' The idea is, that there would
be a degree of spiritual prosperity, as great as if they were permitted
to enjoy all the productions of other climes; as if all menial and
laborious service were performed by others; and as if they were to be
entirely free from the necessity of toil, and were permitted to devote
themselves exclusively to the services of religion.

Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles - (See the notes at [Isa
60:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005).md).

And in their glory - In what constitutes their glory, or what they
regard as valuable; that is, their wealth, their talents, and their
power.

Shall you boast yourselves? - There has been considerable variety of
interpretation in regard to the meaning of the word used here. Jerome
renders it, Et in gloria earum superbietis. The Septuagint, 'In their
wealth ye shall be admired' (θαυμασθήσεσθε thaumasthēsesthe). The
Chaldee and Syriac render it, 'In their splendor ye shall glory.' The
word used is ימר yâmar. It occurs nowhere else, it is believed, except
in [Jer 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md), twice, where it is
tendered 'changed.' 'Hath a nation changed (ההימיר hahēymiyr) their
gods, which are yet no gods? But my people have changed ( המיר hēmiyr)
their glory for that which doth not profit.' In the passage before us,
it is used in Hithpael, and means properly to exchange oneself with
anyone. Here it means, 'In their splendor we shall take their places,'
that is, we shall enjoy it in their stead. We shall avail ourselves of
it as if we were to enter into their possessions, and as if it were our
own. The sense is, it shall come to enrich and adorn the church. It
shall cleavage places, and shall all belong to the penple of God - in
accordance with that which has been so often said by Isaiah, that the
wealth of the world would become tributary to the church.

[Isaiah 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 61:7</span></span>

For your shame - That is, instead of the reproach and humiliation which
you have been called to experience.

You shall have double - A double inheritance or reward (see the notes at
[Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002).md).

And for confusion - The word 'confusion' here means the same as a blush
of shame, and refers to the scenes of humiliation and sorrow which the
nation had passed through on account of its sins.

They shall rejoice - There is here a change from the second to the third
person - a change which is not unfrequent in Isaiah. The same persons,
however, are intended.

In their portion - That is, you shall be permitted to rejoice in the
augmented privileges which you shall enjoy. They will be more than a
compensation for all the calamities which you have been called to
endure.

Therefore in their land - This is to be regarded as addressed to the
exiles in Babylon, and the promise is, that the people of God would be
restored again to their own land, and to more than their former
privileges and blessings there.

The double - Double of what they formerly possessed; that is, their
blessings would be greatly increased and multiplied. Applied to the
times of the Messiah, to which the prophet undoubtedly refers, it means
that the privileges of the friends of God would be far greater than had
been enjoyed even in the most favored times under the former
dispensation.

Everlasting joy - (See the notes at [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 61:8</span></span>

For I the Lord love judgment - That is, 'I shall delight in rendering to
my people what is right. It is right that they should enjoy my
protection, and be favored with the tokens of my kindness. Loving
justice and right, therefore, I will confer on them the privileges and
blessings which they ought to enjoy, and which will be a public
expression of my favor and love.'

I hate robbery for burnt-offering - There has been great variety in the
interpretation of this phrase. Lowth renders it, 'Who hate rapine and
iniquity.' Noyes, 'I hate rapine and iniquity.' Jerome, as in our
translation, Et odio habens rapinam in holocausto. The Septuagint, Μισῶν
ἁρπάγματα ἐξ ἀδικίας Misōn harpagmata ech adikias - 'Hating the spoils
of injustice.' The Chaldee, 'Far from before me be deceit and violence.'
The Syriac, 'I hate rapine and iniquity.' This variety of interpretation
has arisen from the different views taken of the Hebrew בעולה be‛ôlâh.
The Syriac evidently prefixed the conjunction, ו (v), "and," instead of
the preposition, ב (b), "with" or "for"; and, perhaps, also the
Septuagint so read it. But this change, though slight, is not necessary
in order to give a consistent rendering to the passage. The connection
does not necessarily lead us to suppose that any reference would be made
to 'burnt-offering,' and to the improper manner in which such offerings
were made; but the idea is rather, that God hated rapine and sin; he
hateth such acts as those by which his people had been removed from
their land, and subjected to the evils of a long and painful captivity.
And this is undoubtedly the sense of the passage. The Hebrew word עולה
‛ôlâh, usually without the ,ו means properly "a holocaust," or "what is
made to ascend" (from עלה ‛âlâh, to ascend) from an altar. But the word
here is the construct form for עולה ‛avı̂lâh, "evil, wickedness"; whence
our word "evil" (see [Job 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#020.md); [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042).md). And the sense here is, hate
rapine or plunder (גזל gāzēl) with iniquity;' that is, accompanied, as
it always is, with iniquity and sin. And hating that as I do, I will
vindicate my people who have been plundered in this way; and who have
been borne into captivity, accompanied with deeds of violence and sin.

And I will direct their work in truth - literally, 'I will give them
work in truth or faithfulness;' that is, I will give them the reward of
their work faithfully. They shall be amply recompensed for all that they
have done and suffered in my cause.

And I will make - (See the notes at [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 61:9</span></span>

And their seed - The figure here is taken from the feelings of a parent
who desires his children to be esteemed, and who regards it as an honor
that they become so distinguished that their fame extends to distant
lands.

Shall be known - Shall be distinguished or honored. For this use of the
word 'known,' see [Psa 67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002.md); [Psa
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md); [Psa
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md).

And their offspring - (See the notes at [Isa
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019).md). The Chaldee and the Syriac
render this, 'Their children's children.' The sense is, that the true
friends of the church shall be everywhere honored. Distant lands shall
be acquainted with them, and shall be disposed to show them
distinguished respect.

Among the people - The people of distant lands.

All that see them shall acknowledge them - The time shall come when the
true friends of the Redeemer will be universally honored. They shall be
regarded as the favored of the Lord; and instead of being persecuted and
despised, the nations of the earth will regard them as worthy of their
confidence and esteem.

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

I wilt greatly rejoice in the Lord - This is the language of the prophet
in the name of the church; or, as Vitringa supposes, the language of a
chorus introduced here by the prophet. The Chaldee regards it as the
language of Jerusalem, and renders it, 'Jerusalem said, I will surely
rejoice in the Lord.' The sentiment is, that the prosperity and
enlargement of Zion is an occasion of joy, and should lead to
thanksgiving and praise. The phrase, 'I will rejoice in the Lord,' means
that the joy would arise from the view of the faithfulness and
perfections of Yahweh manifested in the redemption of his people. See
similar expressions of joy in the song of Mary [Luk
1:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md).

For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation - That is,
Jerusalem or the church.

He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness - The word rendered
'robe' here means mantle, or a large and loose garment thrown over the
other parts of the dress. Such garments are for protection and for
ornament, and the image is that of the church defended and ornamented by
God (see the notes at [Isa 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018).md).

As a bridegroom decketh himself - Margin, 'As a priest.' The Hebrew is,
'As a bridegroom adorns himself as a priest' (יכהן yekahēn); that is, as
he makes splendid his head-dress in the manner of a priest.

With ornaments - (פאי pe'ēr). With a tiara, head-dress, diadem. See the
word explained in [Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md). The
Septuagint renders it, Μίτραν Mitran - 'Mitre.' The allusion is to the
dress of the Jewish high - priest when he discharged the functions of
his office, and particularly to the mitre and the plate or crown of gold
which he wore in front of it [Exo
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006.md). It is not easy to give full
force to the metaphor of the prophet in another language. The Hebrew, as
near as we can express it, is, 'As a bridegroom attires himself as a
priest with a crown or mitre.' The version by Aquila and Symmachus comes
nearest to it - Ὡς νυμφιον ἱερατευομενον στεφανῳ Hōs numphion
hierateuomenon stephanō. The sense is, that the church should be adorned
with the highest ornament and beauty; not for the mere purpose of
decoration, but as if it were a priest engaged in offering continually
the sacrifice of prayer and praise.

And as a bride - See this explained in the notes at [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018.md). The word rendered 'jewels' here
(כלי kelı̂y) does not of necessity mean merely jewels. It properly means
an apparatus, implement, utensil, vessel; and then dress, ornament of
any kind; and would be better rendered here, in a more general sense,
bridal ornaments.

[Isaiah 61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 61:11</span></span>

For as the earth bringeth forth - This figure is several times used by
the prophet (see the notes at [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md); [Isa
55:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010).md). The idea is an exceedingly
beautiful one, that, on the coming of the Messiah, truth and
righteousness would spring up and abound like grass and fruits in the
vegetable world when the earth is watered with rain.

Her bud - The word 'bud' we now apply usually to the small bunch or
protuberance on the branches of a plant, containing the rudiments of the
future leaf or flower. The Hebrew word, however, (צמח tsemach), rather
means the germ, the shoot, or the young and tender plant as it comes up
from the earth; that which first appears from the seed.

So the Lord God will cause righteousness to spring forth - (See the
notes at [Isa 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019.md); [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md); [Isa
44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004.md); [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008).md).

Before all the nations - The sense is, that righteousness would abound
over all the earth, and that all the world would yet join in celebrating
the praises of God.
