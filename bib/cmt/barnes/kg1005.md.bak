### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 5:1</span></span>

Hiram, king of Tyre - Menander of Ephesus, who wrote a history of Tyre
in Greek, founded upon native Tyrian documents, about 300 B.C.,
mentioned this Hiram as the son of Abibaal king of Tyre, and said that
he ascended the throne when he was nineteen; that he reigned thirty-four
years, and, dying at the age of fifty-three, was succeeded by his son
Baleazar. Menander spoke at some length of the dealings of Hiram with
Solomon.

Sent his servants - This appears to have been an embassy of
congratulation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 5:3</span></span>

Solomon's presumption that Hiram knew David's design has not appeared in
the previous history, but it is in accordance with [Ch1
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#004.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 5:4</span></span>

The contrast is not between different periods of Solomon's reign, but
between his reign and that of his father.

Evil occurrent - Rather, evil occurrence.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 5:5</span></span>

As the Lord spake - See the marginal references [Kg1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md), and compare [Ch1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#010.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 5:6</span></span>

Solomon's message to Hiram and Hiram's answer [Kg1
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008.md) are given much more fully in
[Ch2 2:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md).

Cedar-trees - The Hebrew word here and elsewhere translated "cedar,"
appears to be used, not only of the cedar proper, but of other
timber-trees also, as the fir, and, perhaps, the juniper. Still there is
no doubt that the real Lebanon cedar is most commonly intended by it.
This tree, which still grows on parts of the mountain, but which
threatens to die out, was probably much more widely spread anciently.
The Tyrians made the masts of their ships from the wood [Eze
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#005.md), and would naturally be as
careful to cultivate it as we have ourselves been to grow oak. The
Assyrian kings, when they made their expeditions into Palestine, appear
frequently to have cut it in Lebanon and Hermon, and to have transported
it to their own capitals.

Skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians - The mechanical genius and
nautical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Sidonians in
particular, is noticed by Homer and Herodotus. In the reign of Hiram,
Sidon, though perhaps she might have a king of her own, acknowledged the
supremacy of Tyre.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 5:9</span></span>

See the marginal reference. The timber was first carried westward from
the flanks of Lebanon to the nearest part of the coast, where it was
collected into floats, or rafts, which were then conveyed southward
along the coast to Joppa, now Jaffa, from where the land journey to
Jerusalem was not more than about forty miles. A similar course was
taken on the building of the second temple [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md).

Food for my household - The Phoenician cities had very little arable
territory of their own, the mountain range of Lebanon rising rapidly
behind them; and they must always have imported the chief part of their
sustenance from abroad. They seem commonly to have derived it from
Judaea (marginal references). Hiram agreed now to accept for his timber
and for the services of his workmen [Kg1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006.md) a certain annual payment of grain
and oil, both of them the best of their kind, for the sustentation of
his court. This payment was entirely distinct from the supplies
furnished to the workmen (marginal reference "l").

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 5:11</span></span>

The number of measures of wheat was considerably less than Solomon's own
annual consumption, which exceeded 32,000 cors [Kg1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md); but the small amount of twenty
cors of oil, which seems at first sight scarcely to match with the
20,000 cors of wheat, will not appear improbable, if we consider that
the oil was to be" pure" - literally "beaten" - i. e., oil extracted
from the olives by pounding, and not by means of the press.

Year by year - i. e., during all the years that Solomon was engaged in
building and was helped by Hiram.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 5:12</span></span>

The Lord gave Solomon wisdom - It seems to be implied that Solomon's
divine gift of wisdom enabled him to make such favorable arrangements
with Hiram.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 5:13</span></span>

A levy out of all Israel - This was, apparently, the first time that the
Israelites had been called upon to perform forced labor, though it had
been prophesied [Sa1 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#016.md). David had
bound to forced service "the strangers" [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md); but hitherto the Israelites had
escaped. Solomon now, in connection with his proposed work of building
the temple, with the honor of God as an excuse, laid this burden upon
them. Out of the 1,300, 000 able-bodied Israelites [Sa2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#009.md), a band of 30,000 - one in
forty-four - was raised, of whom one-third was constantly at work in
Lebanon, while two-thirds remained at home, and pursued their usual
occupations. This, though a very light form of task work, was felt as a
great oppression, and was the chief cause of the revolt of the ten
tribes at Solomon's death [Kg1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 5:15</span></span>

That bare burdens ... - Compare the marginal references. These laborers,
whose services were continuous, consisted of "strangers" - "the people
that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and
Jebusites" - whom Solomon, following the example of his father [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md), condemned to slavery, and
employed in this way.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 5:16</span></span>

Comparing this verse and [Kg1 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023.md)
with [Ch2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018.md); [Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010.md), the entire number of the
overseers will be seen to be stated by both writers at 3,850; but in the
one case nationality, in the other degree of authority, is made the
principle of the division.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 5:17</span></span>

Some of these "great, hewed (no and) stones," are probably still to be
seen in the place where they were set by Solomon's builders, at the
southwestern angle of the wall of the Haram area in the modern
Jerusalem. The largest found so far is 38 ft. 9 in. long, and weighs
about 100 tons.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 5:18</span></span>

The stone-squarers - The Gebalites (see the margin), the inhabitants of
Gebal, a Phoenician city between Beyrout and Tripolis, which the Greeks
called Byblus, and which is now known as Jebeil.
