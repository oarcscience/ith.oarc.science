### [Psalms Chapter 148](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 148:0</span></span>

The author of this psalm is unknown. The occasion on which it was
composed was probably the same as that on which the two previous psalms
and the two following were written - each commencing and closing with a
Hallelujah. That occasion was, most probably, as before remarked, the
rebuilding of Jerusalem after the captivity, and the dedication of the
temple.

The psalm is, in general, a call on all parts of the universe to praise
the Lord. It is properly divided into two portions. In the first [Psa
148:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001), the call is addressed to the
heavens - to all that is above the earth - to praise Yahweh; in the
second [Psa 148:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007), the call is
addressed to all the dwellers on the earth to unite in that praise. The
psalm is most animated and triumphant. The language accords with the
sentiment. It is adapted to the most animating and spirit-stirring
music; and these psalms - this and the two preceding and the two
following - in style, in sentiment, in poetic beauty, in sublimity, in
their adaptedness to fill the soul with lofty emotions - are eminently
suited to close the whole collection - the entire Book of Psalms. Little
can be needed, or can be added, in illustration of the sentiments of the
psalm.

[Psalms 148:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 148:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - See the notes at [Psa
146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001).

Praise ye the Lord from the heavens - On the part of the heavens. Let
those who dwell in heaven begin the song.

Praise him in the heights - All that are in the heights; to wit, in the
highest parts of the universe, or the heavens.

[Psalms 148:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 148:2</span></span>

Praise ye him, all his angels - Dwelling in the heavens. Compare the
notes at [Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).

Praise ye him, all his hosts - See the notes at [Psa
103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021) and the notes at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009). All his armies - referring to the
angels considered as marshalled into hosts, of which God is the Head and
Leader.

[Psalms 148:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 148:3</span></span>

Praise ye him, sun and moon - The most conspicuous and glorious objects
in the heavens, as apparent to the eyes of people.

Praise him, all ye stars of light - A poetical expression to denote
bright or shining stars. The phrase embraces all the stars as they
strike the eyes of people. Each one has something special to it for
which to praise God: and the entire groups - the immense multitudes, as
such - should join in one chorus of praise.

[Psalms 148:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 148:4</span></span>

Praise him, ye heavens of heavens - Referring to the idea that there is
one heaven rising above another. See the notes at [Psa
68:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#033). See [Kg1
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027) : "Behold, the heaven and heaven
of heavens cannot contain thee." Compare [Ch2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006).

And ye waters that be above the heavens - [Gen
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007) : "And God made the firmament, and
divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which
were above the firmament." The allusion here is to the waters which seem
to be above the lower heaven, that is, the air, and which seem to come
from some higher region - some higher heaven. See the notes at [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003) : "Who layeth the beams of his
chambers in the waters."

[Psalms 148:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 148:5</span></span>

Let them praise the name of the Lord - That is, Let them praise Yahweh
himself - the name being often put for the person or thing referred to.

For he commanded, and they were created - He showed his great power by
merely speaking, and they came at once into being. Compare [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006), note; [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009), note.

[Psalms 148:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 148:6</span></span>

He hath also stablished them forever and ever - He has made them firm,
stable, enduring. That they may be eternal is possible; that they will
not be, no one can prove. Matter, when created, has no necessary
tendency to decay or annihilation; and the universe - the stars, and
suns, and systems - which have endured so many million of ages may
continue to exist any number of million of ages to come. Of course,
however, all this is dependent on the will of God. On the meaning of
this passage, compare [Psa 119:90](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#090),
note; [Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005), note; [Psa
89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002), note; [Psa
89:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036), note. See also [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007), note; [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010), note; [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013), note.

He hath made a decree which shall not pass - He has given a law or
statute which they cannot pass. The word rendered decree here seems to
be used in the sense of limit or bound; and the idea is, that he has
bound them by a fixed law; he has established laws which they are
compelled to observe. The fact is, in regard to them, that he has
established great laws - as the law of gravitation - by which they are
held from flying off; he has marked out orbits in which they move; he
has so bound them that they perform their revolutions with unerring
accuracy in the very path which he has prescribed. So accurate are their
movements that they can be predicted with exact precision; and so
uniform, that any succession of ages does not vary or affect them.

[Psalms 148:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 148:7</span></span>

Praise the Lord from the earth - From among those who dwell on the
earth. In respect to terrestrial objects, let these also unite in the
praise of God.

Ye dragons - On the meaning of this word, see [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013), note; [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022), note. The word may mean a great
fish, a whale, a sea monster, or a serpent. It would seem to refer here
to whales and sea monsters. See the notes at [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003).

And all deeps - All that are in the depths of the sea. Not merely the
"dragons" or sea monsters, but all that inhabit the oceans.

[Psalms 148:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 148:8</span></span>

Fire, and hail - Fire, when accompanied by hail; that is, the lightning.
See [Psa 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012).

Snow, and vapors - Snow and clouds. It was not unnatural that these
should be combined, or suggested together to the mind.

Stormy wind - The storm; the tempest.

Fulfilling his word - Obeying his command; accomplishing his purpose.
Let the storm-wind, which seems to be so little under any control, speak
his praise by showing how obedient it is to his will, and how exactly it
carries out his designs. Its perfect submission to his laws - the
exactness with which, though apparently so fierce, raging, and lawless,
it carries out his plans, and pauses when he commands it - is in fact an
act of praise or homage, as it proclaims his majesty, his supremacy, and
his power. On the sentiment here expressed, compare [Psa
107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029), note; [Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009), note.

[Psalms 148:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 148:9</span></span>

Mountains, and all hills - As being among the loftiest objects of earth,
raising their heads highest toward the heavens.

Fruitful trees, and all cedars - Fruitful trees, not as distinguished
from those which are barren, but as distinguished from forest-trees,
those whose nature is that they do not bear fruit. Of the latter, the
cedar was the most prominent, and, therefore, is made the representative
of the whole.

[Psalms 148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 148:10</span></span>

Beasts, and all cattle - Wild beasts and tame; those which roam the
forest, and those which have been domesticated for the service of man.
As fruitful trees and cedars might include all the trees, so the "beasts
and cattle" here might include the whole of those that were wild and
tamed.

Creeping things, and flying fowl - Margin, as in Hebrew, Birds of wing.
These are grouped together for a reason similar to that for which
fruitful trees and cedars, and beasts and cattle, are grouped together,
to embrace the whole. The expression embraces the loftiest and lowest;
those which ascend farthest above the earth, and those which creep upon
its surface. The word rendered creeping things would properly embrace
the smaller animals which creep along upon the ground; both those which
have four feet or more, as mice, lizards, crabs, etc., and those without
feet, which glide or drag themselves upon the ground, as worms and
serpents. (Gesenius, Lexicon) These, in their lowly condition, and in
their humble way, are called on to unite in the general chorus of
praise. Accomplishing the purpose for which they are made, they will,
with the most lofty of created beings, contribute to proclaim the
wisdom, the power, and the goodness of God.

[Psalms 148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 148:11</span></span>

Kings of the earth, and all people - This would embrace all, as all are
included in the idea of the rulers and the ruled.

Princes, and all judges of the earth - Those of exalted rank; those high
in authority. This is proper in itself considered, as they are people
like other people; and proper as an example to the rest. None of any
rank are exempt from the obligation to praise God; none are cut off from
the privilege.

[Psalms 148:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 148:12</span></span>

Both young men, and maidens - Those in the morning of life, just
entering on their career; just forming their character: with ardor,
elasticity, cheerfulness, hope; let them consecrate all this to God: let
all that there is in the buoyancy of their feelings, in the melody of
their voices, in their ardor and vigor, be employed in the praise and
the service of God.

Old men, and children - Old men, with what remains of life, and
children, with all that there is of joyousness - let all unite in
praising God. Life, as it closes - life, as it begins - let it all be
devoted to God.

[Psalms 148:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 148:13</span></span>

Let them praise the name of the Lord - Let them praise Yahweh - the name
being often put for the person.

For his name alone is excellent - Margin, as in Hebrew, exalted. He only
is exalted as God. See the notes at [Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001) : "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
is thy name in all the earth!"

His glory is above the earth and heaven - Compare the notes at [Psa
113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004) : "The Lord is high above all
nations, and his glory above the heavens." See also the notes at [Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001) : "Who hast set thy glory above
the heavens."

[Psalms 148:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 148:14</span></span>

He also exalteth the horn of his people - He gives them power and
prosperity. See the notes at [Psa
89:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017) : "And in thy favor our horn
shall be exalted." Compare [Psa 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010);
[Psa 112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009).

The praise of all his saints - That is, "he has raised up praise for all
his saints;" or, has given them occasion for praise. He has so blessed
them with special mercies as to make praise especially appropriate for
them.

Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him - whom he admits
to his presence as his friends; whom he regards as his own. See the
notes at [Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013); compare the notes
at [Act 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039).

Praise ye the Lord - Hallelu-jah. Let all unite in his praise.
