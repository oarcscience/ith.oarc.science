### [Psalms Chapter 130](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 130:0</span></span>

This psalm also is entitled "A Song of Degrees." See the notes at
Introduction to [Psa 120:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md). The
author and the occasion on which it was composed are unknown, as is also
the reason why it was included in this group of psalms.

The language of the psalm seems to be that of an individual; but most
interpreters suppose that it is an individual speaking in the name of
the nation, and representing its calamities and its penitence. Some have
imagined that the person represented as speaking in [Psa
130:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md), is a different individual
from the one speaking in the other part of the psalm, but there seems to
be no ground for this opinion. It is commonly supposed that the psalm
had reference to the state of the Jews in the Babylonian captivity, but
there is no necessity for limiting it to that period, if indeed it has
any reference to the people of Israel. There were many occasions in
their history when the language of the psalm would not be less
appropriate than at that time. But there is no necessity at all for
supposing that it refers to the nation as such. It may be the language
of an individual, mourning over his sins, and pleading for mercy,
expressing deep conviction of sin, and humble trust in God as the only
hope for a convinced, condemned, and penitent sinner. As such, it would
represent what has occurred in thousands of cases when sinners have been
brought to conviction of sin, and have cried for mercy. Understood in
this manner, it is one of the most instructive and touching of the
psalms. I know of no reason why it may not be so regarded.

[Psalms 130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 130:1</span></span>

Out of the depths - The word rendered "depths" is from a verb - עמק
‛âmaq - which means to be deep; then, to be unsearchable; then, to make
deep; and it would apply to anything low, deep, or profound, as the
ocean, a pit, or a valley. The word used here occurs elsewhere only in
the following places: [Psa 69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002.md), [Psa
69:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014.md), where it is rendered "deep,"
applied to waters; and [Isa 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010.md);
[Eze 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#034.md), where it is rendered
"depths." The word, as used here, would be applicable to deep
affliction, dejection, or distress. It would be applicable

\(a\) to affliction - the depths of sorrow from loss of friends,
property, or bodily suffering;

\(b\) sin - the depths into which the soul is plunged under the
consciousness of guilt;

\(c\) mental trouble - low spirits - melancholy - darkness of mind -
loss of comfort in religion - powerful temptation - disappointment - the
anguish caused by ingratitude - or sadness of heart in view of the
crimes and the sorrows of people - or grief at the coldness, the
hardness, the insensibility of our friends to their spiritual condition.

From all these depths of sorrow it is our privilege to call upon the
Lord; in those depths of sorrow it is proper thus to implore his help.
Often he brings us into these "depths" that we may be led to call upon
him; always when we are brought there, we should call upon him.

Have I cried unto thee, O Lord - Or rather, "do I now invoke thee," or
call earnestly upon thee. The language does not refer so much to the
past as the present. I now cry for mercy; I now implore thy blessing.
The condition is that of one who in deep sorrow, or under deep
conviction for sin, pleads earnestly that God would have compassion on
him.

[Psalms 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 130:2</span></span>

Lord, hear my voice - This is the prayer; this is what he cried. It is
the language of earnest pleading.

Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications - Do not
turn away from me; do not disregard my cry. See the notes at [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 130:3</span></span>

If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities - If thou shouldst observe,
note, attend to, regard all the evil that I have done. The Hebrew word
means properly to keep, to watch, to guard. The word, as used here,
refers to that kind of vigilance or watchfulness which one is expected
to manifest who is on guard; who keeps watch in a city or camp by night.
The idea is, If God should thus look with a scrutinizing eye; if he
should try to see all that he could see; if he should suffer nothing to
escape his observation; if he should deal with us exactly as we are; if
he should overlook nothing, forgive nothing, we could have no hope.

Who shall stand? - Who shall stand upright? Who could stand before thee?
Who could hope to be acquitted? This implies

\(1\) that the petitioner was conscious of guilt, or knew that he was a
sinner;

\(2\) that he felt there was a depth of depravity in his heart which God
could see, but which he did not - as every man must be certain that
there is in his own soul;

\(3\) that God had the power of bringing that to light if he chose to do
it, so that the guilty man would be entirely overwhelmed;

\(4\) that he who urged the prayer rested his only hope on the fact that
God would not mark iniquity; would not develop what was in him; would
not judge him by what he saw in his heart; but would deal with him
otherwise, and show him mercy and compassion.

Every man must feel that if God should "mark iniquity" as it is - if he
should judge us as we are - we could have no hope. It is only on the
ground that we may be forgiven, that we eau hope to come before him.

[Psalms 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 130:4</span></span>

But there is forgiveness with thee - The Septuagint renders this ἱλασμός
hilasmos, propitiation, reconciliation; the Latin Vulgate "propitiatio,"
propitiation. The Hebrew word means "pardon." The idea is, that sin may
be forgiven; or, that God is a Being who does pardon sin, and that this
is the only ground of hope. When we come before God, the ground of our
hope is not that we can justify ourselves; not that we can prove we have
not sinned; not that we can explain our sins away; not that we can offer
an apology for them; it is only in a frank and full confession, and in a
hope that God will forgive them. He who does not come in this manner can
have no hope of acceptance with God.

That thou mayest be feared - That thou mayest be reverenced; or, that
men may be brought to serve and worship thee - may be brought to a
proper reverence for thy name. The idea is, not that pardon produces
fear or terror - for the very reverse is true - but that God, by
forgiving the sinner, brings him to reverence him, to worship him, to
serve him: that is, the sinner is truly reconciled to God, and becomes a
sincere worshipper. The offendcr is so pardoned that he is disposed to
worship and honor God, for God has revealed himself as one who forgives
sin, in order that the sinner may be encouraged to come to him, and be
his true worshipper.

[Psalms 130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 130:5</span></span>

I wait for the Lord - That is, in this state of distress and trouble -
from these "depths" of woe, and sorrow, and conviction of sin. This
implies two things:

\(1\) that he had no other dependence;

\(2\) that his soul was actually in a waiting posture, or that he
actually looked to the Lord for his interposition.

My soul doth wait - I wait, with all my soul and heart.

And in his word do I hope - In his promise. I believe that he will
fulfill that promise, and that I shall find a gracious answer to my
prayers. Under conviction for sin, under deep sorrow and distress of any
kind, this is the only hope of man. If God does not interpose, there is
no deliverer; that he will interpose we may feel assured, if we come to
him with a humble, a believing, and a penitent heart.

[Psalms 130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 130:6</span></span>

My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning -
More intently; more anxiously. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render
this, "My soul hopeth in the Lord from the morning watch until night."
The idea is that of watchers - night guards - who look anxiously for the
break of day that they may be relieved. It is not that of persons who
simply look for the return of day, but of those who are on guard - or it
may be who watch beside the sick or the dying - and who look out on the
east to mark the first indications of returning light. To them the night
seems long; they are weary, and want repose; all around is cheerless,
gloomy, and still; and they long for the first signs that light will
again visit the world. Thus in affliction - the long, dark, dreary,
gloomy night of sorrow - the sufferer looks for the first indication,
the first faint ray of comfort to the soul. Thus under deep conviction
for sin, and deep apprehension of the wrath of God - that night, dark,
dreary, gloomy, often long - the soul looks for some ray of comfort,
some intimation that God will be merciful, and will speak peace and
pardon.

I say, more than they that watch for the morning - Margin, which watch
unto the morning. The translation in the text best expresses the sense.
There is something exceedingly beautiful and touching in this language
of repetition, though it is much enfeebled by the words which our
translators have inserted, "I say, more than." The Hebrew is, "more than
they that watch for the morning - watch for the morning," as if the mind
dwelt upon the words as better expressing its own anxious state than any
other words could do. Everyone who has been afflicted will feel the
force of this; every one who has been under conviction of sin, and who
has felt himself in danger of suffering the wrath of God, will remember
how anxiously he longed for mercy, for light, for peace, for some
indication, even the most faint, like the first ray which breaks in the
east, that his soul would find mercy and peace.

[Psalms 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 130:7</span></span>

Let Israel hope in the Lord - In such circumstances of affliction and
distress, let not the people of God despair. In the darkest night, in
calamities deep and prolonged, let not those who love God despair. The
morning will dawn; the light will break in the east; deliverance and joy
will come. The Hebrew here is, "Trust, O Israel, in the Lord." The
design of the Psalmist seems to be, from his own experience, to persuade
others - the afflicted people of God - to put their trust in Him in whom
he had himself hoped. From the very depths of affliction, guilt, and
almost despair, he had looked to the Lord: encouraged and persuaded by
his example, he would now entreat the people of God everywhere and
always, in like manner, to trust him.

For with the Lord there is mercy - He is merciful, and in his mercy we
may trust.

And with him is plenteous redemption - It is ample; it is full; it
abounds. It is not limited; it is not exhausted; it cannot be exhausted.
So we may always feel when we come before God, that his mercy is ample
for all the needs of all the sinful and the suffering; that the
provisions of his grace are unexhausted and inexhaustible. Applying
this, as we may, to the work of the Saviour, we may feel that the
redemption which is in him is adequate to the needs of a world, and that
although numberless million have been saved by it, yet that it is still
as rich, as full, and as free as it was in the beginning; as the ocean,
though from the beginning of the world it has supplied the materials for
rain and dew to water the hills, the vales, the continents, and the
islands, is still full; as the light of the sun, though for thousands of
ages it has poured its light on the planets, and on all the vast space
between itself and those orbs, and has sent out its light into the vast
regions beyond, still shines with undiminished splendor, and pours its
floods of day and of glory on all those worlds.

[Psalms 130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 130:8</span></span>

And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities - His people. He will
completely deliver them from the power and the pollution of sin. This
will ultimately be accomplished in reference to his whole church, and to
every true member of that church. This was the highest object before the
mind of the psalmist - that with which the psalm appropriately closes.
And this is the highest object before the mind of every true child of
God - that he may be completely and forever delivered from the power and
the dominion of sin. This will be perfectly accomplished in heaven only;
but there and then the bliss will be complete. The psalm begins with an
earnest cry from the "depths;" it closes with the triumphant hope of
complete and eternal deliverance. There is one world where there is no
occasion to cry to God from the "depths" of sorrow and of sin.
