\- The Confusion of Tongues

1\. נסע nāsa‛ "pluck out, break up, journey." מקדם mı̂qedem "eastward, or
on the east side" as in [Gen 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#014.md);
[Gen 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md); [Isa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011) (12.md).

6\. החלם hachı̂lām "their beginning", for החלם hăchı̂lām, the regular form
of this infinitive with a suffix. יזמוּ yāzmû as if from יזם yāzam = זמם
zāmam.

7\. נבלה nābelâh usually said to be for נבלה nābolâh from בלל bālal; but
evidently designed by the punctuator to be the third singular feminine
perfect of נבל nābal "to be confounded," having for its subject שׂפה
śāpâh, "and there let their lip be confounded." The two verbs have the
same root.

9\. בבל bābel Babel, "confusion," derived from בל bl the common root of
בלל bālal and נבל nābel, by doubling the first radical.

Having completed the table of nations, the sacred writer, according to
his wont, goes back to record an event of great moment, both for the
explanation of this table and for the future history of the human race.
The point to which he reverts is the birth of Peleg. The present
singular passage explains the nature of that unprecedented change by
which mankind passed from one family with a mutually intelligible
speech, into many nations of diverse tongues and lands.

[Gen 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

The previous state of human language is here briefly described. "The
whole land" evidently means the whole then known world with all its
human inhabitants. The universality of application is clearly and
constantly maintained throughout the whole passage. "Behold, the people
is one." And the close is on this point in keeping with the
commencement. "Therefore was the name of it called Babel, because the
Lord had there confounded the lip of all the land."

Of one lip, and one stock: of words. - In the table of nations the term
"tongue" was used to signify what is here expressed by two terms. This
is not undesigned. The two terms are not synonymous or parallel, as they
form the parts of one compound predicate. "One stock of words," then, we
conceive, naturally indicates the matter, the substance, or material of
language. This was one and the same to the whole race. The term "lip,"
which is properly one of the organs of articulation, is, on the other
hand, used to denote the form, that is, the manner, of speaking; the
mode of using and connecting the matter of speech; the system of laws by
which the inflections and derivations of a language are conducted. This
also was one throughout the human family. Thus, the sacred writer has
expressed the unity of language among mankind, not by a single term as
before, but, with a view to his present purpose, by a combination of
terms expressing the two elements which go to constitute every organic
reality.

[Gen 11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md)

The occasion of the linguage change about to be described is here
narrated. "As they journeyed eastward." The word "they" refers to the
whole land of the previous verse, which is put by a common figure for
the whole race of man. "Eastward" is proved to be the meaning of the
phrase מקדם mı̂qedem by [Gen 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md),
where Lot is said to journey (מקדם mı̂qedem) from Bethel to the plain of
the Jordan, which is to the east. The human race, consisting it might be
of five hundred families, journeys eastward, with a few points of
deflection to the south, along the Euphrates valley, and comes to a
plain of surpassing fertility in the land of Shinar (Herod. 1:178, 193).
A determination to make a permanent abode in this productive spot is
immediately formed.

[Gen 11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003.md)

A building is to be erected of brick and asphalt. The Babylonian soil is
still celebrated for these architectural materials. There is here a fine
clay, mingled with sand, forming the very best material for brick, while
stones are not to be found at a convenient distance. Asphalt is found
boiling up from the soil in the neighborhood of Babylon and of the Dead
Sea, which is hence called the "lacus Asphaltites." The asphalt springs
of Is or Hit on the Euphrates are celebrated by many writers. "Burn them
thoroughly." Sun-dried bricks are very much used in the East for
building purposes. These, however, were to be burned, and thereby
rendered more durable. "Brick for stone." This indicates a writer
belonging to a country and an age in which stone buildings were
familiar, and therefore not to Babylonia. Brickmaking was well known to
Moses in Egypt; but this country also abounds in quarries and splendid
erections of stone, and the Sinaitic peninsula is a mass of granitic
hills. The Shemites mostly inhabited countries abounding in stone.
"Asphalt for mortar." Asphalt is a mineral pitch. The word rendered
mortar means at first clay, and then any kind of cement.

[Gen 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004.md)

The purpose of their hearts is now more fully expressed. "Let us build
us a city, and a tower whose top may be in the skies." A city is a
fortified enclosure or keep for defense against the violence of the
brute creation. A tower whose top may be in the skies for escape from
the possibility of a periodical deluge. This is the language of pride in
man, who wishes to know nothing above himself, and to rise beyond the
reach of an over-ruling Providence. "And let us make us a name." A name
indicates distinction and pre-eminence. To make us a name, then, is not
so much the cry of the multitude as of the few, with Nimrod at their
head, who alone could expect what is not common, but distinctive. It is
here artfully inserted, however, in the popular exclamation, as the
people are prone to imagine the glory even of the despot to be reflected
on themselves. This gives the character of a lurking desire for empire
and self-aggrandizement to the design of the leaders - a new form of the
same selfish spirit which animated the antediluvian men of name [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004.md). But despotism for the few or the
one, implies slavery and all its unnumbered ills for the many. "Lest we
be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole land." The varied
instincts of their common nature here speak forth. The social bond, the
tie of kinsmanship, the wish for personal safety, the desire to be
independent, perhaps even of God, the thirst for absolute power, all
plead for union; but it is union for selfish ends.

[Gen 11:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md)

These verses describe the nature of that change by which this form of
human selfishness is to be checked. "The Lord came down." The
interposing providence of God is here set forth in a sublime simplicity,
suited to the early mind of man. Still there is something here
characteristic of the times after the deluge. The presence of the Lord
seems not to have been withdrawn from the earth before that event. He
walked in the garden when Adam and Eve were there. He placed the
ministers and symbols of his presence before it when they were expelled.
He expostulated with Cain before and after his awful crime. He said, "My
Spirit shall not always strive with man." He saw the wickedness of man;
and the land was corrupt before him. He communicated with Noah in
various ways, and finally established his covenant with him. In all this
he seems to have been present with man on earth. He lingered in the
garden as long as his forbearance could be expected to influence man for
good. He at length appointed the limit of a hundred and twenty years.
And after watching over Noah during the deluge, he seems to have
withdrawn his visible and gracious presence from the earth. Hence, the
propriety of the phrase, "the Lord came down." He still deals in mercy
with a remnant of the human race, and has visited the earth and
manifested His presence in a wondrous way. But He has not yet taken up
His abode among people as He did in the garden, and as He intimates that
He will sometime do on the renovated earth.

[Gen 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md)

In like simplicity is depicted the self-willed, God-defying spirit of
combination and ambition which had now budded in the imagination of man.
"The People is one" - one race, with one purpose. "And they have all one
lip." They understand one another's mind. No misunderstanding has arisen
from diversity of language. "This is their beginning." The beginning of
sin, like that of strife, is as when one letteth out water. The Lord
sees in this commencement the seed of growing evil. All sin is dim and
small in its first rise; but it swells by insensible degrees to the most
glaring and gigantic proportions. "And now nothing will be restrained
from them, which they have imagined to do." Now that they have made this
notable beginning of concentration, ambition, and renown, there is
nothing in this way which they will not imagine or attempt.

[Gen 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007.md)

Here is announced the means by which the defiant spirit of concentration
is to be defeated. From this and the previous verse we learn that the
lip, and not the stock of words, is the part of language which is to be
affected, and hence, perceive the propriety of distinguishing these two
in the introductory statement. To confound, is to introduce several
kinds, where before there was only one; and so in the present case to
introduce several varieties of form, whereas language was before of one
form. Hence, it appears that the one primitive tongue was made manifold
by diversifying the law of structure, without interfering with the
material of which it was composed. The bases or roots of words are
furnished by instinctive and evanescent analogies between sounds and
things, on which the etymological law then plays its part, and so
vocables come into existence. Thus, from the root "fer," we get "fer,
ferre, ferens, fert, ferebat, feret, ferat, ferret;" φέρε phere, φέρειν
pherein, φέρων pherōn, φέει pherei, ἔφερε ephere, φέρῃ pherē, φέροι
pheroi, etc.; ברה perēh, ברה pāroh, פרהo poreh, שפרה pārâh, יפרה yı̂preh,
etc., according to the formative law of each language.

It is evident that some roots may become obsolete and so die out, while
others, according to the exigencies of communication and the abilities
of the speaker, may be called into existence in great abundance. But
whatever new words come into the stock, are made to comply with the
formative law which regulates the language of the speaker. This law has
been fixed as the habitude of his mind, from which he only deviates on
learning and imitating some of the formative processes of another
tongue. In the absence of any other language, it is not conceivable that
he should on any account alter this law. To do so would be to rebel
against habit without reason, and to put himself out of relation with
the other speakers of the only known tongue.

The sacred writer does not care to distinguish the ordinary from the
extraordinary in the procedure of Divine Providence, inasmuch as he
ascribes all events to the one creating, superintending, and
administering power of God. Yet there is something beyond nature here.
We can understand and observe the introduction of new words into the
vocabulary of man as often as the necessity of designating a new object
or process calls the naming faculty into exercise. But the new word,
whether a root or not, if engrafted into the language, invariably obeys
the formative law of the speech into which it is admitted. A nation adds
new words to its vocabulary, but does not of itself, without external
influence, alter the principle on which they are formed. Here, then, the
divine interference was necessary, if the uniform was ever to become
multiform. And accordingly this is the very point in which the historian
marks the interposition of the Almighty.

Philologists have distinguished three or four great types or families of
languages. The first of these was the Shemitic or Hebrew family. It is
probable that most of the Shemites spoke dialects of this well-defined
type of human speech. Aram (the Syrians), Arpakshad, (the Hebrews and
Arabs), and Asshur (the Assyrians), certainly did so. Elam (Elymais),
succumbed first to the Kushite race (Κίσσιοι Kissioi, Κοσσαῖοι Kossaioi)
and afterward to the Persian, and so lost its language and its
individuality among the nations. Lud (the Lydians) was also overrun by
other nationalities. But this type of language was extended beyond the
Shemites to the Kenaanites and perhaps some other Hamites. It includes
the language of the Old Testament.

The second family of languages has been variously designated Japhetic,
Indo-Germanic, Indo-European and Arian. It is spoken by the great bulk
of the descendants of Japheth, and embraces a series of cognate modes of
communication, extending from India to the various European colonies of
America. It includes Greek, the tongue of the New Testament.

A third class, including the Kushite (Babylonian), Egyptian, and other
African languages, has been termed Hamitic. Some of its stocks have
affinities both with the Shemitic and Japhetic families.

It is probable that the congeries of unclassed languages (Allophylian,
Sporadic, Turanian), including even the Chinese tongues, have relations
more or less intimate with one or other of these three tolerably
definite families. But the science of comparative philology is only
approaching the solution of its final problem, the historical or natural
relationship of all the languages of the world. It is evident, however,
that the principle of classification is not so much the amount of roots
in common, as the absence or presence of a given form. The diversity in
the matter may be brought about by assignable natural causes; but the
diversity in the form can only arise from a preternatural impulse. Forms
may wear off; but they do not pass from one constituent law to another
without foreign influence. The speech of a strong and numerous race may
gradually overbear and annihilate that of a weak one; and in doing so
may adopt many of its words, but by no means its form. So long as a
national speech retains any of its forms, they continue to be part of
that special type by which it is characterized.

Hence, we perceive that the interposition of Providence in confounding
the lip of mankind, is the historical solution of the enigma of
philology; the existence of diversity of language at the same time with
the natural persistency of form and the historical unity of the human
race. The data of philology, indicating that the form is the side of
language needing to be touched in order to produce diversity, coincide
also with the facts here narrated. The preternatural diversification of
the form, moreover, marks the order amid variety which prevailed in this
great revolution of mental habitude. It is not necessary to suppose that
seventy languages were produced from one at the very crisis of this
remarkable change, but only the few generic forms that sufficed to
effect the divine purpose, and by their interaction to give origin to
all subsequent varieties of language or dialect. Nor are we to imagine
that the variant principles of formation went into practical development
all at once, but only that they started a process which, in combination
with other operative causes, issued in all the diversities of speech
which are now exhibited in the human race.

That they may not understand one another's lip. - This is the immediate
result of diversifying the formative law of human speech, even though
the material elements were to remain much the same as before. Further
results will soon appear.

[Gen 11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md)

The effect of the divine interposition is noted in [Gen
11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008.md). "And the Lord scattered them
abroad." Not understanding one another's mode of speech, they feel
themselves practically separated from one another. Unity of counsel and
of action becomes impossible. Misunderstanding naturally follows, and
begets mistrust. Diversity of interest grows up, and separation ensues.
Those who have a common speech retreat from the center of union to a
sequestered spot, where they may form a separate community among
themselves. The lack of pasture for their flocks and provision for
themselves leads to a progressive migration. Thus, the divine purpose,
that they should be fruitful and multiply and replenish the land [Gen
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md) is fulfilled. The dispersion of
mankind at the same time put an end to the ambitious projects of the
few. "They left off to build the city." It is probable that the people
began to see through the plausible veil which the leaders had cast over
their selfish ends. The city would henceforth be abandoned to the
immediate party of Nimrod. This would interrupt for a time the building
of the city. Its dwellings would probably be even too numerous for its
remaining inhabitants. The city received the name of Babel (confusion),
from the remarkable event which had interrupted its progress for a time.

This passage, then, explains the table of nations, in which they are
said to be distinguished, not merely by birth and land, but "every one
after his tongue." It is therefore attached to the table as a needful
appendix, and thus completes the history of the nations so far as it is
carried on by the Bible. At this point the line of history leaves the
universal, and by a rapid contraction narrows itself into the
individual, in the person of him who is to be ultimately the parent of a
chosen seed, in which the knowledge of God and of his truth is to be
preserved, amidst the degeneracy of the nations into the ignorance and
error which are the natural offspring of sin.

Here, accordingly, ends the appendix to the second Bible, or the second
volume of the revelation of God to man. As the first may have been due
to Adam, the second may be ascribed in point of matter to Noah, with
Shem as his continuator. The two joined together belong not to a special
people, but to the universal race. If they had ever appeared in a
written form before Moses, they might have descended to the Gentiles as
well as to the Israelites. But the lack of interest in holy things would
account for their disappearance among the former. The speakers of the
primitive language, however, would alone retain the knowledge of such a
book if extant. Some of its contents might be preserved in the memory,
and handed down to the posterity of the founders of the primeval
nations. Accordingly we find more or less distinct traces of the true
God, the creation, the fall and the deluge, in the traditions of all
nations that have an ancient history.

But even if this two-volumed Bible were not possessed by the nations in
a written form, its presence here, at the head of the writings of divine
truth, marks the catholic design of the Old Testament, and intimates the
comprehension of the whole family of man within the merciful purposes of
the Almighty. In the issues of Providence the nations appear now to be
abandoned to their own devices. Such a judicial forsaking of a race, who
had a second time heard the proclamation of his mercy, and a second time
forsaken the God of their fathers, was naturally to be expected. But it
is never to be forgotten that God twice revealed his mercy "to the whole
human race" before they were left to their own ways. And even when they
were given over to their own willful unrighteousness and ungodlincss, it
was only to institute and develop the mystery by which they might be
again fully and effectually brought back to reconciliation with God.

The new developments of sin during this period are chiefly three -
drunkenness, dishonoring of a parent, and the ambitious attempt to be
independent of God's power, and to thwart his purpose of peopling the
land. These forms of human selfishness still linger about the primary
commands of the two tables. Insubordination to the supreme authority of
God is accompanied with disrespect to parental authority. Drunkenness
itself is an abuse of the free grant of the fruit of the trees orignally
made to man. These manifestations of sin do not advance to the grosser
or more subtle depths of iniquity afterward explicitly forbidden in the
ten commandments. They indicate a people still comparatively
unsophisticated in their habits.

The additional motives brought to bear on the race of man during the
interval from Noah to Abraham, are the preaching of Noah, the perdition
of the unbelieving antediluvians, the preservation of Noah and his
family, the distinction of clean and unclean animals, the permission to
partake of animal food, the special prohibition of the shedding of man's
blood, the institution thereupon of civil government, and the covenant
with Noah and his seed that there should not be another deluge.

The preaching of Noah consisted in pressing the invitations and warnings
of divine mercy on a wicked race. But it bore with new power on the
succeeding generations, when it was verified by the drowning of the
impenitent race and the saving of the godly household. This was an awful
demonstration at the same time of the divine vengeance on those who
persisted in sin, and of the divine mercy to the humble and the
penitent. The distinction of the clean and the unclean was a special
warning against that conformity with the world by which the sons of God
had died out of the human race. The permission to partake of animal food
was in harmony with the physical constitution of man, and seems to have
been delayed until this epoch for moral as well as physical reasons. In
the garden, and afterward in Eden, the vegetable products of the soil
were adequate to the healthy sustenance of man. But in the universal
diffusion of the human race, animal food becomes necessary.

In some regions where man has settled, this alone is available for a
great portion of the year, if not for the whole. And a salutary dread of
death, as the express penalty of disobedience, was a needful lesson in
the infancy of the human race. But the overwhelming destruction of the
doomed race was sufficient to impress this lesson indelibly on the minds
of the survivors. Hence, the permission of animal food might now be
safely given, especially when accompanied with the express prohibition
of manslaying, under the penalty of death by the hands of the
executioner. This prohibition was directly intended to counteract the
bad example of Cain and Lamek, and to deter those who slew animals from
slaying men; and provision was made for the enforcement of its penalty
by the institution of civil government. The covenant with Noah was a
recognition of the race being reconciled to God in its new head, and
therefore suited to be treated as a party at peace with God, and to
enter on terms of communion with him. Its promise of security from
destruction by a flood was a pledge of all greater and after blessings
which naturally flow from amity with God.

Thus, we perceive that the revelation of God to the antediluvian world
was confirmed in many respects, and enlarged in others, by that made to
the postdiluvians. The stupendous events of the deluge were a marvelous
confirmation of the justice and mercy of God revealed to Adam. The
preaching of Noah was a new mode of urging the truths of God on the
minds of men, now somewhat exercised in reflective thought. The
distinction of clean and unclean enforced the distinction that really
exists between the godly and the ungodly. The prohibition of shedding
human blood is the growth of a specific law out of the great principle
of moral rectitude in the conscience, apace with the development of evil
in the conduct of mankind. The covenant with Noah is the evolution into
articulate utterance of that federal relation which was virtually formed
with believing and repentant Adam. Adam himself was long silent in the
depth of his self-abasement for the disobedience he had exhibited. In
Noah the spirit of adoption had attained to liberty of speech, and
accordingly, God, on the momentous occasion of his coming out of the ark
and presenting his propitiatory and eucharistic offering, enters into a
covenant of peace with him, assuring him of certain blessings.

There is something especially interesting in this covenant with Noah, as
it embraces the whole human race, and is in force to this day. It is as
truly a covenant of grace as that with Abraham. It is virtually the same
covenant, only in an earlier and less developed form. Being made with
Noah, who had found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and added to the
former expression of the divine favor to man, it explicitly mentions a
benefit which is merely the first and most palpable of the series of
benefits, temporal and eternal, flowing from the grace of God, all of
which are in due time made over to the heirs of salvation. We cannot
tell how many of the Gentiles explicitly or implicitly consented to this
general covenant and partook of its blessings. But it is only just to
the God of Noah to be thankful that there was and is an offer of mercy
to the whole family of man, all who accept of which are partakers of his
grace, and that all subsequent covenants only help to the ultimate and
universal acceptance of that fundamental covenant which, though violated
by Adam and all his ordinary descendants, was yet in the fullness of
time to be implemented by him who became the seed of the woman and the
second Adam.

\- Section IX - The Line to Abram

\- XXXV. The Line of Abram

18\. רעוּ re‛û, Re'u, "friend;" verb: "feed, delight in, enjoy."

20\. שׂרוּג śerûg, Serug, "vine-shoot."

22\. נחור nāchôr, Nachor, "snorting."

24\. תרה terach, Terach, "delay?" Aramaic.

26\. אברם 'abrām, Abram, "high father." הרן hārān Haran, "mountaineer."

The usual phrase, "These are the generations," marks the beginning of
the fifth document. Accordingly, we now enter upon a new phase of human
development. The nations have gradually departed from the living God.
They have not, however, stopped at this negative stage of ungodliness.
They have fallen into polytheism and idolatry. And the knowledge of the
one true God, the Maker, Possessor, and Upholder of heaven and earth, is
on the verge of being entirely lost. Nevertheless the promises, first to
the race of Adam, that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's
head, and next to the family of Noah, that the Lord should be the God of
Shem, were still in force. It is obvious, from the latter promise, that
the seed of the woman is to be expected in the line of Shem.

The present passage contains the pedigree of Abram from Shem. From this
it appears that the sacred writer here reverts to the second year after
the flood - a point of time long before the close of the preceding
narrative. "Shem was the son of a hundred years," or in his hundredth
year, two years after the flood, and therefore in the six hundred and
third year of Noah, and consequently three years after Japheth. Abram
was the twentieth, inclusive, from Adam, the tenth from Shem, and the
seventh from Heber. A second Kenan is inserted after Arpakshad in the
Septuagint, and in the Gospel according to Luke. But this name does not
occur even in the Septuagint in [Ch1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#024.md), where the genealogy of Abram is
given. It is not found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Targums, or the
ancient versions. It does not appear in Josephus or Philo. Neither is it
found in the Codex Bezae in the Gospel of Luke. It must therefore be
regarded as an interpolation.

The following table is a continuation of that given at the fifth
chapter, and will serve for the comparison of the different forms in
which the numbers are presented:

From this table it appears that in the total years of life the Hebrew,
Samaritan, and Septuagint agree on Shem; the Hebrew and Septuagint on
Terah; the Samaritan and Septuagint on Heber; and the Hebrew and
Samaritan on all the rest. In regard, however, to the years of
paternity, the Hebrew stands alone, against the Samaritan and Septuagint
agreeing, except in Terah, where they all agree. The difference is not
in units or tens, but in the addition to the Hebrew numbers of a hundred
years, except in the case of Nahor, where the addition is fifty years,
or a hundred and fifty according to the Codex Vaticanus (B) of the
Septuagint. Here, again, it is remarkable that Josephus while agreeing
with the Samaritan and Septuagint in most of the separate numbers before
paternity, agrees with the Hebrew in the sum of years from the flood to
the 70th year of Terah (292 years, Josephus I. 6, 5). In Reu and Serug
the numbers are transposed, seemingly by a mistake arising from the
inverted order in which he gives the numbers.

In Nahor he, or his transcriber, seems to have added one hundred years
according to the uniform law, and neglected the nine. To make up for
this omission, the inexact round number 10 has been apparently added to
the number of years after the flood, when Arpakshad was born. We have
already noticed that some MSS. of Josephus gave 1656 as the sum-total of
years from the creation to the flood, in which case the sums of Josephus
and the Hebrew exactly agree. We find him also stating (viii. 3, 1) that
the world was created 3102 years before Solomon began to build the
temple, and that the deluge took place 1440 before the same point of
time. Hence, we obtain 1662 years between the creation and the deluge;
and this, if we only deduct from it the six years added to Lamek, agrees
with the Hebrew. In the same passage he states that the entrance of
Abram into Kenaan was 1020 years before the building of the temple.

Hence, we infer that 420 years elapsed from the flood to the call of
Abram, which, if we count from the birth of Arpakshad, allow sixty years
to elapse between the births of Haran and Abram, and date the call of
Abram at 70, will exactly tally with the Hebrew. These sums cannot in
any probable way be reconciled with the details in his own text, or in
the Septuagint, or Samaritan. Again, Josephus calculates (x. 8, 5) that
the temple was burnt 3513 years from the creation, and 1957 from the
flood. Hence, the interval from the creation to the deluge would be 1556
years, differing from the Hebrew by 100 years, and reconcilable with it,
if we suppose the 500th year of Noah to be the terminating date. He also
concludes that the burning of the temple took place 1062 years after the
exodus, thus making the interval from the flood to the exodus 895 years,
while the Hebrew makes it 852. If we reckon the 100 years from the 500th
year of Noah to the flood, the 292 which Josephus gives from the flood
to the birth of Abraham, the 75 years to the call of Abraham, and the
430 from that to the exodus, we have 897 years, which will be reduced to
Josephus's number by omitting the 2 years from the flood to the birth of
Arpakshad; and to the Hebrew number by omitting the 100 years before the
flood, adding the 60 between Haran and Abram, which Josephus here
neglects, and dating the call of Abram at 70 years. But by no process
that we are aware of can these calculated numbers of Josephus be
reconciled with the details of his own text, or the Samaritan, or
Septuagint. It seems perfectly clear that the Hebrew numbers lie at the
basis of these calculations of our author.

The age of paternity in the Samaritan from Peleg down is beyond the
middle age of life, which is contrary to all experience. The editor of
the Septuagint seems to have observed this anomaly, and added 100 years
to three of these lives, and 156 to that of Nahor, against the joint
testimony of the Hebrew and Samaritan. If the year of paternity in the
Vatican be the correct reading, a much greater number should have been
here added. The Samaritan deducts 60 years from the age of Terah,
against the joint testimony of the Hebrew, Samaritan, and Josephus,
seemingly because the editor conceived that Abram was born in his
seventieth year.

From the Targum of Onkelos and the Peshito it is evident that the Hebrew
text was the same as now up to the Christian era. Before that time there
was no conceivable reason for shortening the chronology, while national
vanity and emulation might easily prompt men to lengthen it. It is
acknowledged that the text of the Septuagint is inferior to that of the
Hebrew.

The age of puberty in the Hebrew affords more scope for the increase of
population than that in the other texts. For if a man begin to have a
family at thirty, it is likely to be larger than if he began a hundred
years later and only lived the same number of years altogether. Now the
Hebrew and Samaritan agree generally, against the Septuagint, in the
total years of life; and in two instances, Heber and Terah, the
Samaritan has even a less number than the Hebrew. It is to be
remembered, also, that the number of generations is the same in every
case. Hence, in all human probability the Hebrew age of paternity will
give the greater number of inhabitants to the world in the age of Abram.
If we take the moderate average of five pairs for each family, we shall
have for the estimated population 4 X 5(to the 9th power) pairs, or
15,625,000 souls. This number is amply sufficient for all the kingdoms
that were in existence in the time of Abram. If we defer the time of
becoming a father for a whole century, we shall certainly diminish,
rather than increase, the chance of his having so large a family, and
thereby the probability of such a population on the earth in the tenth
generation from Noah.

In these circumstances we are disposed to abide by the Hebrew text, that
has descended to us in an original form, at least until we see some more
cogent reasons for abandoning any of its numbers than chronologers have
yet been able to produce. And we content ourselves, meanwhile, with the
fact that the same system of numbers manifestly lay at the basis of all
our present texts, though it may be difficult in some cases to determine
to the satisfaction of all what was the original figure. The
determination of the chronology of ancient history is neither a question
of vital importance, nor, to us now, a part of the primary or direct
design of the Hebrew records.

\- Section X - Abraham

\- XXXVI. The Father of Abram

27\. לוט lôṭ, Lot, "veil;" verb: "cover."

28\. אוּר 'ûr, Ur, "light, flame." כשׂדים kaśdı̂ym, Kasdim, Cardi, Kurds,
Χαλδαῖοι Kaldaioi. כסד kesed, "gain?" Arabic. Ur Kasdim has been
identified with Hur, now called Mugheir (the bitumened), a heap of ruins
lying south of the Euphrates, nearly opposite its jucnction with the
Shat el-Hie. Others place it at Edessa, now Orfa, a short way north of
Carrhae.

29\. שׂרי sāray, Sarai, "strife;" שׂרה śārâh "strive, rule." מלכה mı̂lkâh
Milkah, "counsel, queen;" verb: "counsel, reign." יסכה yı̂sekâh, Jiskah,
"one who spies, looks out."

31\. הרן hārān, Haran, "burnt place." Χαῤῥαι Charran, Κάῤῥαι Karrai, a
town on the Bilichus (Bililk), a tributary of the Frat, still called
Harran. This has been identified by some with Harae, on the other side
of the Frat, not far from Tadmor or Palmyra.

This passage forms the commencement of the sixth document, as is
indicated by the customary phrase, "These are the generations." The
sense also clearly accords with this distinction; and it accounts for
the repetition of the statement, "Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
Yet the scribe who finally arranged the text makes no account of this
division; as he inserts neither the Hebrew letter פ (p) nor even the
Hebrew letter ס (s) at its commencement, while he places the threefold פ
(p), marking the end of a Sabbath lesson, at its close. We learn from
this that the Jewish rabbis did not regard the opening phrase as a
decided mark of a new beginning, or any indication of a new author.
Nevertheless, this passage and the preceding one form the meet prelude
to the history of Abram - the one tracing his genealogy from Shem and
Heber, and the other detailing his relations with the family out of
which he was called.

God has not forsaken the fallen race. On the contrary, he has once and
again held out to them a general invitation to return, with a promise of
pardon and acceptance. Many of the descendants of Noah have already
forsaken him, and he foresees that all, if left to themselves, will sink
into ungodliness. Notwithstanding all this, he calmly and resolutely
proceeds with his purpose of mercy. In the accomplishment of this
eternal purpose he moves with all the solemn grandeur of longsuffering
patience. One day is with him as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day. Out of Adam's three sons he selects one to be the progenitor
of the seed of the woman; out of Noah's three sons he again selects one;
and now out of Terah's three is one to be selected. Among the children
of this one he will choose a second one, and among his a third one
before he reaches the holy family. Doubtless this gradual mode of
proceeding is in keeping with the hereditary training of the holy
nation, and the due adjustment of all the divine measures for at length
bringing the fullness of the Gentiles into the covenant of everlasting
peace.

The history here given of the postdiluvians has a striking resemblance
in structure to that of the antediluvians. The preservation of Noah from
the waters of the flood, is the counterpart of the creation of Adam
after the land had risen out of the roaring deep. The intoxication of
Noah by the fruit of a tree corresponds with the fall of Adam by eating
the fruit of a forbidden tree. The worldly policy of Nimrod and his
builders is parallel with the city-building and many inventions of the
Cainites. The pedigree of Abram the tenth from Shem, stands over against
the pedigree of Noah the tenth from Adam; and the paragraph now before
us bears some resemblance to what precedes the personal history of Noah.
All this tends to strengthen the impression made by some other
phenomena, already noticed, that the book of Genesis is the work of one
author, and not a mere file of documents by different writers.

The present paragraph is of special interest for the coming history. Its
opening word and intimates its close connection with the preceding
document; and accordingly we observe that the one is merely introductory
to the other. The various characters brought forward are all of moment.
Terah is the patriarch and leader of the migration for part of the way.
Abram is the subject of the following narrative. Nahor is the
grandfathcr of Rebekah. Haran is the father of Lot the companion of
Abram, of Milcah the wife of Nahor and grandmother of Rebekah, and of
Iskah. Iskah alone seems to have no connection with the subsequent
narrative. Josephus says Sarai and Milkah were the daughters of Haran,
taking no notice of Iskah. He seems, therefore, to identify Sarai and
Iskah. Jerome, after his Jewish teachers, does the same. Abram says of
Sarai, "She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my
mother" [Gen 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md).

In Hebrew phrase the granddaughter is termed a daughter; and therefore
this statement might be satisfied by her being the daughter of Haran.
Lot is called the brother's son and the brother of Abram [Gen
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#012.md), [Gen
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#016.md). If Sarai be Haran's daughter,
Lot is Abram's brother-in-law. This identification would also explain
the introduction of Iskah into the present passage. Still it must be
admitted, on the other hand, that persons are sometimes incidentally
introduced in a history of facts, without any express connection with
the course of the narrative, as Naamah in the history of the Cainites.
The studied silence of the sacred writer in regard to the parentage of
Sarai, in the present connection, tells rather in favor of her being the
actual daughter of Terah by another wife, and so strictly the
half-sister of Abram. For the Mosaic law afterward expressly prohibited
marriage with "the daughter of a father" [Lev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md). And, lastly, the text does not
state of Iskah, "This is Sarai," which would accord with the manner of
the sacred writer, and is actually done in the Targum of
Pseudo-Jonathan.

[Gen 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#028.md)

And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah. - There is reason to
believe that Haran was the oldest son of Terah. Though mentioned in the
third place, like Japheth the oldest son of Noah, yet, like Japheth,
also, his descendants are recounted first. He is the father of Lot,
Milkah, and Iskah. His brother Nahor marries his daughter Milkah. If
Iskah be the same as Sarai, Haran her father must have been some years
older than Abram, as Abram was only ten years older than Sarai; and
hence her father, if younger than Abram, must have been only eight or
nine when she was born, which is impossible. Hence, those who take Iskah
to be Sarai, must regard Abram as younger than Haran.

In the land of his birth. - The migration of Terah, therefore, did not
take place until after the death of Haran. At all events, his three
grandchildren, Lot, Milkah, and Iskah, were born before he commenced his
journey. Still further, Milkah was married to Nahor for some time before
that event. Hence, allowing thirty years for a generation, we have a
period of sixty years and upwards from the birth of Haran to the
marriage of his daughter. But if we take seventy years for a generation,
which is far below the average of the Samaritan or the Septuagint, we
have one hundred and forty years, which will carry us beyond the death
of Terah, whether we reckon his age at one hundred and forty-five with
the Samaritan, or at two hundred and five with the other texts. This
gives another presumption in favor of the Hebrew average for a
generation.

In Ur of the Kasdim. - The Kasdim, Cardi, Kurds, or Chaldees are not to
be found in the table of nations. They have been generally supposed to
be Shemites. This is favored by the residence of Abram among them, by
the name Kesed, being a family name among his kindred [Gen
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#022.md), and by the language commonly
called Chaldee, which is a species of Aramaic. But among the settlers of
the country, the descendants of Ham probably prevailed in early times.
Nimrod, the founder of the Babylonian Empire, was a Kushite. The ancient
Babylonish language, Rawlinson (Chaldaea) finds to be a special dialect,
having affinities with the Shemitic, Arian, Turanian, and Hamitic
tongues. The Chaldees were spread over a great extent of surface; but
their most celebrated seat was Chaldaea proper, or the land of Shinar.
The inhabitants of this country seem to have been of mixed descent,
being bound together by political rather than family ties.

Nimrod, their center of union, was a despot rather than a patriarch. The
tongue of the Kaldees, whether pure or mixed, and whether Shemitic or
not, is possibly distinct from the Aramaic, in which they addressed
Nebuchadnezzar in the time of Daniel [Dan
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md); [Dan
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004.md). The Kaldin at length lost their
nationality, and merged into the caste or class of learned men or
astrologers, into which a man might be admitted, not merely by being a
Kaldai by birth, but by acquiring the language and learning of the
Kasdim [Dan 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md); [Dan
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#011.md). The seats of Chaldee learning
were Borsippa (Birs Nimrud), Ur, Babylon, and Sepharvaim (Sippara,
Mosaib). Ur or Hur has been found by antiquarian research (see
Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies) in the heap of ruins called Mugheir,
"the bitumened." This site lies now on the right side of the Frat; but
the territory to which it belongs is mainly on the left. And Abram
coming from it would naturally cross into Mesopotamia on his way to
Haran. Orfa, the other supposed site of Ur, seems to be too near Haran.
It is not above twenty or twenty-five miles distant, which would not be
more than one day's journey.

[Gen 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md), [Gen
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#030.md)

But Sarai was barren. - From this statement it is evident that Abram had
been married for some time before the migration took place. It is also
probable that Milkah had begun to have a family; a circumstance which
would render the barrenness of Sarai the more remarkable.

[Gen 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md), [Gen
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#032.md)

And Terah took Abram. - Terah takes the lead in this emigration, as the
patriarch of the family. In the Samaritan Pentateuch Milkah is mentioned
among the emigrants; and it is not improbable that Nahor and his family
accompanied Terah, as we find them afterward at Haran, or the city of
Nahor [Gen 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md). "And they went forth
with them." Terah and Abram went forth with Lot and the other companions
of their journey. "To go into the land of Kenaan. It was the design of
Terah himself to settle in the land of Kenaan. The boundaries of this
land are given in the table of nations [Gen
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#019.md). The Kenaanites were therefore
in possession of it when the table of nations was drawn up. It is
certain, however, that there were other inhabitants, some of them
Shemites probably, anterior to Kenaan, and subjected by his invading
race. The prime motive to this change of abode was the call to Abram
recorded in the next chapter. Moved by the call of God, Abram "obeyed;
and he went out not knowing whither he went" [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md).

But Terah was influenced by other motives to put himself at the head of
this movement. The death of Haran, his oldest son, loosened his
attachment to the land of his birth. Besides, Abram and Sarai were no
doubt especially dear to him, and he did not wish to lose their society.
The inhabitants also of Ur had fallen into polytheism, or, if we may so
speak, allotheism, the worship of other gods. Terah had himself been
betrayed into compliance with this form of impiety. It is probable that
the revelation Abram had received from heaven was the means of removing
this cloud from his mind, and restoring in him the knowledge and worship
of the true God. Hence, his desire to keep up his connection with Abram,
who was called of God. Prayerful conversation with the true and living
God, also, while it was fast waning in the land of the Kasdim, seems to
have been still maintained in its ancient purity in some parts of the
land of Kenaan and the adjacent countries. In the land of Uz, a Shemite,
perhaps even at a later period, lived Job; and in the neighboring
districts of Arabia were his several friends, all of whom acknowledged
the true God. And in the land of Kenaan was Melkizedec, the king of
Salem, and the priest of the Most High God. A priest implies a
considerable body of true worshippers scattered over the country.
Accordingly, the name of the true God was known and revered, at least in
outward form, wherever Abram went, throughout the land. The report of
this comparatively favorable state of things in the land of Kenaan would
be an additional incentive to the newly enlightened family of Terah to
accompany Abram in obedience to the divine call.

Terah set out on his journey, no doubt, as soon after the call of Abram
as the preparatory arrangements could be made. Now the promise to Abram
was four hundred and thirty years before the exodus of the children of
Israel out of Egypt [Exo 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040.md). Of
this long period his seed was to be a stranger in a land that was not
theirs for four hundred years [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md). Hence, it follows that Isaac,
his seed, was born thirty years after the call of Abram. Now Abram was
one hundred years old when Isaac was born, and consequently the call was
given when he was seventy years of age - about five years before he
entered the land of Kenaan [Gen 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md).
This whole calculation exactly agrees with the incidental statement of
Paul to the Galatians [Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md) that
the law was four hundred and thirty years after the covenant of promise.
Terah was accordingly two hundred years old when he undertook the long
journey to the land of Kenaan; for he died at two hundred and five, when
Abram was seventy-five. Though proceeding by easy stages, the aged
patriarch seems to have been exhausted by the length and the difficulty
of the way. "They came to Haran and dwelt there." Broken down with
fatigue, he halts for a season at Haran to recruit his wasted powers.
Filial piety, no doubt, kept Abram watching over the last days of his
venerable parents, who probably still cling to the fond hope of reaching
the land of his adoption. Hence, they all abode in Haran for the
remainder of the five years from the date of Abram's call to leave his
native land. "And Terah died in Haran." This intimates that he would
have proceeded with the others to the land of Kenaan if his life had
been prolonged, and likewise that they did not leave Haran until his
death.

We have already seen that Abram was seventy-five years of age at the
death of Terah. It follows that he was born when Terah was one hundred
and thirty years old, and consequently sixty years after Haran. This is
the reason why we have placed one hundred and thirty (seventy and
sixty), in the genealogical table opposite Terah, because the line of
descent is not traced through Haran, who was born when he was seventy,
but through Abram, who by plain inference was born when he was one
hundred and thirty years old. It will be observed, also, that we have
set down seventy opposite Abram as the date of his call, from which is
counted the definite period of four hundred and thirty years to the
exodus. And as all our texts agree in the numbers here involved, it is
obvious that the same adjustment of years has in this case to be made,
whatever system of chronology is adopted. Hence, Abram is placed first
in the list of Terah's sons, simply on account of his personal
pre-eminence as the father of the faithful and the ancestor of the
promised seed; he and his brother Nahor are both much younger than
Haran, are married only after his death, and one of them to his grown-up
daughter Milkah; and he and his nephew Lot are meet companions in age as
well as in spirit.

Hence, also, Abram lingers in Haran, waiting to take his father with him
to the land of promise, if he should revive so far as to be fit for the
journey. But it was not the lot of Terah to enter the land, where he
would only have been a stranger. He is removed to the better country,
and by his departure contributes no doubt to deepen the faith of his son
Abram, of his grandson Lot, and of his daughter-in-law Sarai. This
explanation of the order of events is confirmed by the statement of
Stephen: "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was
in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran. Then came he out of the land
of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charran; and from thence, when his father
was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell" [Act
7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md).
