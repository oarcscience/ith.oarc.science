### [Job Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#001.md)

[Job 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 20:2</span></span>

Therefore - לכן lākên, "certainly, truly." In view of what has been just
said. Or perhaps the word means merely certainly, truly.

Do my thoughts cause me to answer - This is variously rendered. The
Vulgate renders it, Idcirco cogitationes meae variae succedunt sibi, et
mens in diversa rapitur - "Therefore my various thoughts follow in
succession, and the mind is distracted." The Septuagint, "I did not
suppose that thou wouldst speak against these things, and you do not
understand more than I." How this was ever made from the Hebrew it is
impossible to say. On the word "thoughts," see the notes at [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013.md). The word denotes thoughts which
divide and distract the mind; not calm and collected reflections, but
those which disturb, disconcert, and trouble. He acknowledges that it
was not calm reflection which induced him to reply, but the agitating
emotions produced by the speech of Job. The word rendered "cause me to
answer" (ישׁיבוּני yeshı̂ybûnı̂y), "cause me to return" - and Jerome
understood it as meaning that his thoughts returned upon him in quick
and troublesome succession, and says in his Commentary on Job, that the
meaning is, "I am troubled and agitated because you say that you sustain
these evils from God without cause, when nothing evil ought to be
suspected of God."

And for this I make haste - Margin, "my haste is in me." The meaning is,
"the impetuosity of my feelings urges me on. I reply on account of the
agitation of my soul, which will admit of no delay." His heart was full,
and he hastened to give vent to his feelings in impassioned and earnest
language.

[Job 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 20:3</span></span>

I have heard the check of my reproach - I have heard your violent and
severe language reproaching us. Probably he refers to what Job had said
in the close of his speech [Job 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029.md),
that they had occasion to dread the wrath of God, and that they might
anticipate heavy judgments as the result of their opinions. Or it may
be, as Schultens supposes, that he refers to what Job said in [Job
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#002.md), and the rebuke that he had
administered there. Or possibly, and still more probably, I think, he
may refer to what Job had said in reply to the former speech of Zophar
[Job 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002.md), where he tauntingly says
that "they were the people, and that wisdom would die with them." The
Hebrew literally is, "the correction of my shame" (כלמה מוּסר mûsâr
kelı̂mmâh), "the correction of my shame." that is, the castigation or
rebuke which tends to cover me with ignominy. The sense is, "you have
accused me of that which is ignominious and shameful, and under the
impetuous feelings caused by such a charge I cannot refrain from
replying."

And the spirit of my understanding - Meaning, perhaps, "the emotion of
his mind." The word "mind" or "soul" would better express the idea than
the word "understanding;" and the word "spirit" here seems to be used in
the sense of violent or agitating emotions - perhaps in allusion to the
primary signification of the word (רוּח rûach), "mind."

[Job 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 20:4</span></span>

Knowest thou not this of old - That is, dost thou not know that this has
always happened from the beginning of the world, or that this is the
invariable course of events. His purpose is to show that it was the
settled arrangement of Providence that the wicked would be overtaken
with signal calamity. It was "so" settled that Job ought not to be
surprised that it had occurred in "his" case. Zophar goes on to show
that though a wicked man might rise high in honor, and obtain great
wealth, yet that the fall would certainly come, and he would sink to a
depth of degradation corresponding to the former prosperity.

Since man was placed upon earth - Since the creation; that is, it has
always been so.

[Job 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 20:5</span></span>

That the triumphing - The word "triumphing" here (רננה renânâh),"
shouting, rejoicing" - such a shouting as people make after a victory,
or such as occurred at the close of harvesting. Here it means that the
occasion which the wicked had for rejoicing would be brief. It would be
but for a moment, and he then would be overwhelmed with calamity or cut
off by death.

Short - Margin, as in Hebrew "from near." That is, it would be soon
over.

And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? - This probably means, as
used by Zophar, that the happiness of a hypocrite would be brief -
referring to the happiness arising from the possession of health, life,
property, friends, reputation. Soon God would take away all these, and
leave him to sorrow. This, he said, was the regular course of events as
they had been observed from the earliest times. But the "language"
conveys most important truths in reference to the spiritual joys of the
hypocrite at all times, though it is not certain that Zophar used it in
this sense. The truths are these.

\(1\) There is a kind of joy which a hypocrite may have - the
counterfeit of that which a true Christian possesses. The word
"hypocrite" may be used in a large sense to denote the man who is a
professor of religion, but who has none, as well as him who
intentionally imposes on others, and who makes pretensions to piety
which he knows he has not. Such a man may have joy. He supposes that his
sins are forgiven, and that he has a well-founded hope of eternal life.
He may have been greatly distressed in view of his sin and danger, and
when he supposes that his heart is changed, and that the danger is
passed, from the nature of the case he will have a species of enjoyment.
A man is confined in a dungeon under sentence of death. A forged
instrument of pardon is brought to him. He does not know that it is
forged, and supposes the danger is past, and his joy will be as real as
though the pardon were genuine. So with the man who "supposes" that his
sins are forgiven.

\(2\) The joy of the self-deceiver or the hypocrite will be short. There
is no genuine religion to sustain it, and it soon dies away. It may be
at first very elevated, just as the joy of the man who supposed that he
was pardoned would fill him with exultation. But in the case of the
hypocrite it soon dies away. He has no true love to God; he has never
been truly reconciled to him; he has no real faith in Christ; he has no
sincere love of prayer, of the Bible, or of Christians and soon the
temporary excitement dies away, and he lives without comfort or peace.
He may be a professor of religion, but with him it is a matter of form,
and he has neither love nor zeal in the cause of his professed Master.
Motives of pride, or the desire of a reputation for piety, or some other
selfish aim may keep him in the church, and he lives to shed blighting
on all around him. Or if, under the illusion, he should be enabled to
keep up some emotions of happiness in his bosom, they must soon cease,
for to the hypocrite death will soon end it all. How much does it become
us, therefore, to inquire whether the peace which we seek and which we
may possess in religion, is the genuine happiness which results from
true reconciliation to God and a well founded hope of salvation. Sad
will be the disappointment of him who has cherished a hope of heaven
through life, should he at last sink down to hell! Deep the condemnation
of him who has professed to be a friend of God, and who has been at
heart his bitter foe; who has endeavored to keep up the forms of
religion, but who has been a stranger through life to the true peace
which religion produces!

[Job 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 20:6</span></span>

Though his excellency mount up to the heavens - Though he attain to the
highest pitch of honor and prosperity. The Septuagint renders this,
"Though his gifts should go up to heaven, and his sacrifice should touch
the clouds;" a sentence conveying a true and a beautiful idea, but which
is not a translation of the Hebrew. The phrases, to go up to heaven, and
to touch the clouds, often occur to denote anything that is greatly
exalted, or that is very high. Thus, in Virgil,

It clamor coelo.

So Horace,

Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.

And again,

Attingit solium Joyis.

Compare [Gen 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004.md), "Let us build us a
tower whose top may reach unto heaven." In Homer the expression not
unfrequently occurs, τοῦ γὰρ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει tou gar kleos ouranon
hikei. In Seneca (Thyest. Act. v. ver. 1, 2,4,) similar expressions
occur:

Aequalis astris gradior, et cunctos super

Altum superbo vertice attingens polum,

Dimitto superos: summa votorum attigi.

The "language" of Zophar would also well express the condition of many a
hypocrite whose piety seems to be of the most exalted character, and who
appears to have made most eminent attainments in religion. Such a man
may "seem" to be a man of uncommon excellence. He may attract attention
as having extraordinary sanctity. He may seem to have a remarkable
spirit of prayer, and yet all may be false and hollow. Men who design to
be hypocrites, aim usually to be "eminent" hypocrites; they who have
true piety often, alas, aim at a much lower standard. A hypocrite cannot
keep himself in countenance, or accomplish his purpose of imposing on
the world, without the appearance of extraordinary devotedness to God;
many a sincere believer is satisfied with much less of the appearance of
religion. He is sincere and honest. He is conscious of true piety, and
he attempts to impose on none. At the same time he makes no attempt
scarcely "to be" what the hypocrite wishes "to appear" to be; and hence,
the man that shall appear to be the most eminently devoted to God "may"
be a hypocrite - yet usually not long. His zeal dies away, or he is
suffered to fall into open sin, and to show that he had no true religion
at heart.

[Job 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 20:8</span></span>

He shall fly away as a dream - As a dream wholly disappears or vanishes.
This comparison of man with a dream is not uncommon, and is most
impressive. See [Psa 73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020.md); see the
notes at [Isa 29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md).

As a vision of the night - As when one in a dream seems to see objects
which vanish when he awakes. The parallelism requires us to understand
this of what appears in a dream, and not of a spectre. In our dreams we
"seem" to see objects, and when we awake they vanish.

[Job 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 20:9</span></span>

The eye also which saw him - This is almost exactly the language which
Job uses respecting himself. See [Job
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008.md), note; [Job
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010.md), note.

[Job 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 20:10</span></span>

His children shall seek to please the poor - Margin, or, "the poor shall
oppress his children." The idea in the Hebrew seems to be, that his sons
shall be reduced to the humiliating condition of asking the aid of the
most needy and abject. Instead of being in a situation to assist others,
and to indulge in a liberal hospitality, they themselves shall be
reduced to the necessity of applying to the poor for the means of
subsistence. There is great strength in this expression. It is usually
regarded as humiliating to be compelled to ask aid at all; but the idea
here is, that they would be reduced to the necessity of asking it of
those who themselves needed it, "or would be beggars of beggars."

And his hands shall restore their goods - Noyes renders this, "And their
hands shall give back his wealth." Rosenmuller supposes it means, "And
their hands shall restore his iniquity;" that is, what their father took
unjustly away. There can be but little doubt that this refers to his
"sons," and not to himself - though the singular suffix in the word
(ידיו yâdāŷ), "his hands" is used. But the singular is sometimes used
instead of the plural. The word rendered "goods" (און 'ôn), means
"strength, power, and then wealth;" and the idea here is, that the hands
of his sons would be compelled to give back the property which the
father had unjustly acquired. Instead of retaining and enjoying it, they
would be compelled to make restitution, and thus be reduced to penury
and want.

[Job 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 20:11</span></span>

His bones are full of the sin of his youth - The words "of the sin" in
our common translation are supplied by the translators. Gesenius and
Noyes suppose that the Hebrew means, "His bones are full of youth;" that
is, full of vigor and strength, and the idea according to this would be,
that he would be cut off in the fulness of his strength. Dr. Good
renders it forcibly,

"His secret lusts shall follow his bones,

Yea, they shall press upon him in the dust."

The Vulgate renders it, "His bones are full of the sins of his youth."
The Septuagint, "His bones are full of his youth." The Chaldee
Paraphrase, "His bones are full of his strength." The Hebrew literally
is, "His bones are full of his secret things" (עלוּמו ‛âlûmāŷ) -
referring, as I suppose, to the "secret, long-cherished" faults of his
life; the corrupt propensities and desires of his soul which had been
seated in his very nature, and which would adhere to him, leaving a
withering influence on his whole system in advancing years. The effect
is that which is so often seen, when vices corrupt the very physical
frame, and where the results are seen long in future life. The effect
would be seen in the diseases which they engendered in his system, and
in the certainty with which they would bring him down to the grave. The
Syriac renders it, "marrow," as if the idea were that he would die full
of vigor and strength. But the sense is rather that his secret lusts
would work his certain ruin.

Which shall lie down with him - That is, the results of his secret sins
shall lie down with him in the grave. He will never get rid of them. He
has so long indulged in his sins; they have so thoroughly pervaded his
nature, and he so delights to cherish them, that they will attend him to
the tomb. There is truth in this representation. Wicked people often
indulge in secret sin so long that it seems to pervade the whole system.
Nothing will remove it; and it lives and acts until the body is
committed to the dust, and the soul sinks ruined into hell.

[Job 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 20:12</span></span>

Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth - Though he has pleasure in
committing it, as he has in pleasant food. The sense of this and the
following verses is, that though a man may have pleasure in indulgence
in sin, and may find happiness of a certain kind in it, yet that the
consequences will be bitter - as if the food which he ate should become
like gall, and he should cast it up with loathing. There are many sins
which, from the laws of our nature, are attended with a kind of
pleasure. Such, for illustration, are the sins of gluttony and of
intemperance in drinking; the sins of ambition and vanity; the sins of
amusement and of fashionable life. To such we give the name of
"pleasures." We do not speak of them as "happiness." That is a word
which would not express their nature. It denotes rather substantial,
solid, permanent joy - such joy as the "pleasures of sin for a season"
do not furnish. It is this temporary "pleasure" which the lovers of
vanity, fashion and dress, seek, and which, it cannot be denied, they
often find. As long ago as the time of Zophar, it was admitted that such
pleasure might be found in some forms of sinful indulgence and yet even
in his time that was seen, which all subsequent observation has proved
true, that such indulgence must lead to bitter results.

Though he hide it under his tongue - It is from this passage, probably,
that we have derived the phrase, "to roll sin as a sweet morsel under
the tongue," which is often quoted as if it were a part of Scripture.
The "meaning" here is, that a man would find pleasure in sin, and would
seek to prolong it, as one does the pleasure of eating that which is
grateful to the palate by holding it long in the mouth, or by placing it
under the tongue.

[Job 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 20:13</span></span>

Though he spare it - That is, though he retains it long in his mouth,
that he may enjoy it the more.

And forsake it not - Retains it as long as he can.

But keep it still within his mouth - Margin, as in Hebrew "in the midst
of his palate." He seeks to enjoy it as long as possible.

[Job 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 20:14</span></span>

Yet his meat - His food.

In his bowels is turned - That is, it is as if he had taken food which
was exceedingly pleasant, and had retained it in his mouth as long as
possible, that he might enjoy it, but when he swallowed it, it became
bitter and offensive; compare [Rev
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009.md). Sin may be pleasant when it
is committed, but its consequences will be bitter.

It is the gall of asps - On the meaning of the word here rendered "asps"
(פתן pethen), see the notes at [Isa
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008.md). There can be little doubt that
the "asp," or aspic, of antiquity, which was so celebrated, is here
intended. The bite was deadly, and was regarded as incurable. The sight
became immediately dim after the bite - a swelling took place, and pain
was felt in the stomach, followed by stupor, convulsions, and death. It
is probably the same as the "boetan" of the Arabians. It is about a foot
in length, and two inches in circumference - its color being black and
white. "Pict. Bib." The word "gall" (מרורה merôrâh), means "bitterness,
acridness" (compare [Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026).md); and
hence, bile or gall. It is not improbable that it was formerly supposed
that the poison of the serpent was contained in the gall, though it is
now ascertained that it is found in a small sack in the mouth. It is
used here as synonymous with the "poison" of asps - supposed to be
"bitter" and "deadly." The meaning is, that sin, however pleasant and
grateful it may be when committed, will be as destructive to the soul as
food would be to the body, which, as soon as it was swallowed, became
the most deadly poison. This is a fair account still of the effects of
sin.

[Job 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 20:15</span></span>

He hath swallowed down riches - He has "glutted" down riches - or
gormandized them - or devoured them greedily. The Hebrew word בלע bela‛,
means "to absorb, to devour with the idea of greediness." It is
descriptive of the voracity of a wild beast, and means here that he had
devoured them eagerly, or voraciously.

And he shall vomit - As an epicure does that which he has drunk or
swallowed with delight. "Noyes." The idea is, that he shall lose that
which he has acquired, and that it will be attended with loathing. All
this is to a great extent true still, and may be applied to those who
aim to accumulate wealth, and to lay up ill gotten gold. It will be
ruinous to their peace; and the time will come when it will be looked on
with inexpressible loathing. Zophar meant, undoubtedly, to apply this to
Job, and to infer, that since it was a settled maxim that such would be
the result of the ill-gotten gain of a wicked man, where a result like
this "had" happened, that there must have been wickedness. How cutting
and severe this must have been to Job can be easily conceived. The
Septuagint renders this, "Out of his house let an angel drag him."

[Job 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 20:16</span></span>

He shall suck the poison of asps - That which he swallowed as pleasant
nutriment, shall become the most deadly poison; or the consequence shall
be as if he had sucked the poison of asps. It would seem that the
ancients regarded the poison of the serpent as deadly, however, it was
taken into the system. They seem not to have been aware that the poison
of a wound may be sucked out without injury to him who does it; and that
it is necessary that the poison should mingle with the blood to be
fatal.

The viper's tongue shall slay him - The early impression probably was,
that the injury done by a serpent was by the fiery, forked, and
brandished tongue, which was supposed to be sharp and penetrating. It is
now known, that the injury is done by the poison ejected through a
groove, or orifice in one of the teeth, which is so made as to lie flat
on the roof of the mouth, except when the serpent bites, when that tooth
is elevated, and penetrates the flesh. The word "viper" here (אפעה
'eph‛eh), "viper," is probably the same species of serpent that is known
among the Arabs by the same name still - El Effah. See the notes at [Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md). It is the most common and
venomous of the serpent tribe in Northern Africa and in South-western
Asia. It is remarkable for its quick and penetrating poison. It is about
two feet long, as thick as a man's arm, beautifully spotted with yellow
and brown, and sprinkled over with blackish specks. They have a large
mouth, by which they inhale a large quantity of air, and when inflated
therewith, they eject it with such force as to be heard a considerable
distance. "Jackson." Capt. Riley, in his "Authentic Narrative," (New
York, 1817,) confirms this account. He describes the viper as the "most
beautiful object in nature," and says that the poison is so virulent as
to cause death in fifteen minutes.

[Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 20:17</span></span>

He shall not see the rivers - That is, he shall not be permitted to
enjoy plenty and prosperity. Rivers or rills of honey and butter are
emblems of prosperity; compare [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017.md); [Job
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006.md). A land flowing with milk, honey,
and butter, is, in the Scripture, the highest image of prosperity and
happiness. The word rendered "rivers" (פלגה pelaggâh), means rather
"rivulets small streams - or brooks," such as were made by "dividing" a
large stream (from פלג pâlag, to "cleave, divide"), and would properly
be applied to canals made by separating a large stream, or dividing it
into numerous watercourses for the purpose of irrigating lands. The word
rendered "floods," and in the margin, "streaming brooks" (נחלי נהרי
nâhârēy nachalēy), means "the rivers of the valley," or such as flow
through a valley when it is swelled by the melting of snow, or by
torrents of rain.

A flood, a rapid, swollen, full stream, would express the idea. These
were ideas of beauty and fertility among the Orientals; and where butter
and honey were represented as flowing in this manner in a land, it was
the highest conception of plenty. The word rendered "honey" (דבשׁ
debash) may, and commonly does, mean "honey;" but it also means the
juice of the grape, boiled down to about the consistency of molasses,
and used as an article of food. The Arabs make much use of this kind of
food now, and in Syria, nearly two-thirds of the grapes are employed in
preparing this article of food. It is called by the Arabs "Dibs," which
is the same as the Hebrew word used here. May not the word mean this in
some of the places where it is rendered "honey" in the Scriptures? The
word rendered "butter" (חמאה chem'âh) probably means, usually, "curdled
milk." See the notes at [Isa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md). It
is not certain that the word is ever used in the Old Testament to denote
"butter." The article which is used still by the Arabs is chiefly
curdled milk, and probably this is referred to here. It will illustrate
this passage to remark, that the inhabitants of Arabia, and of those who
live in similar countries, have no idea of "butter," as it exists among
us, in a solid state. What they call "butter," is in a fluid state, and
is hence compared with flowing streams. An abundance of these articles
was regarded as a high proof of prosperity, as they constitute a
considerable part of the diet of Orientals. The same image, to denote
plenty, is often used by the sacred writers, and by Classical poets; see
[Isa 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md) :

And it shall come to pass in that day

That a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep,

And it shall be that from the plenty of milk which they shall give,

He shall eat butter

For butter and honey shall every one eat,

Who is left alone in the midst of the land.

See also in [Joe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md) :

And it shall come to pass in that day,

The mountains shall drop down new wine,

And the hills shall flow with milk,

And all the rivers of Judah shall flow with water.

Thus, also Ovid, Metam. iii.

Flumina jam lactis, jam flumina nectaris ibant.

Compare Horace Epod. xvi. 41.

Mella cava manant ex ilice; montibus altis

Levis crepante lympha desilit pede.

From oaks pure honey flows, from lofty hills

Bound in light dance the murmuring rills.

Boscawen.

See also Euripides, Bacch. 142; and Theoc. Idyll. 5,124. Compare
Rosenmuller's Alte u. neue Morgenland on [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md), No. 194.

[Job 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 20:18</span></span>

That which he laboured for shall he restore - This means that he shall
give back the profit of his labor. He shall not be permitted to enjoy it
or to consume it.

And shall not swallow it down - Shall not enjoy it; shall not eat it. He
shall be obliged to give it to others.

According to his substance shall the restitution be - literally,
according to Gesenius, "As a possession to be restored in which one
rejoices not." The sense is, that all that he has is like property which
a man has, which he feels not to be his own, but which belongs to
another and which is soon to be given "up." In such property a man does
not find that pleasure which he does in that which he feels to be his
own. He cannot dispose of it, and he cannot look on it and feel that it
is his. So Zophar says it is with the wicked man. He can look on his
property only as that which he will soon be compelled to part with, and
not having any security for retaining it, he cannot rejoice in it as if
it were his own. Dr. Lee, however, renders this, "As his wealth is, so
shall his restitution be; and he shall not rejoice." But the
interpretation proposed above, seems to me to accord best with the sense
of the Hebrew.

[Job 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 20:19</span></span>

Because he hath oppressed - Margin, "crushed." Such is the Hebrew.

And forsaken the poor - He has plundered them, and then forsaken them -
as robbers do. The meaning is, that he had done this by his oppressive
manner of dealing, and then left them to suffer and pine in want.

He hath violently taken away an house which he builded not - That is, by
overreaching and harsh dealings he has come in possession of dwellings
which he did not build, or purchase in any proper manner. It does not
mean that he had done this by violence - for Zophar is not describing a
robber, but he means that he took advantage of the needs of the poor and
obtained their property. This is often done still. A rich man takes
advantage of the needs of the poor, and obtains their little farm or
house for much less than it is worth. He takes a mortgage, and then
forecloses it, and buys the property himself for much less than its real
value, and thus practices a species of the worst kind of robbery. Such a
man, Zophar says, must expect punishment - and if there is any man who
has occasion to dread the wrath of heaven it is he.

Surely he shall not feel quietness - Margin, as in the Hebrew "know."
The sense is, he shall not know peace or tranquility. He shall be
agitated and troubled. Wemyss, however, renders this, "Because his
appetite could not be satisfied." Noyes, "Because his avarice was
insatiable." So Rosenmuller explains it. So the Vulgate renders it, "Nec
est satiatus renter ejus." The Septuagint, "Neither is there safety to
his property, nor shall he be saved by his desire." But it seems to me
that the former is the sense, and that the idea is, that he should not
know peace or tranquility after he had obtained the things which he had
so anxiously sought.

In his belly - Within him; in his mind or heart. The viscera in general
in the Scriptures are regarded as the seat of the affections. We confine
the idea now to the "heart."

He shall not save of that which he desired - literally, he shall not
"escape" with that which was an object of desire. He shall not be
"delivered" from the evils which threaten him by obtaining that which he
desired. All this shall be taken from him.

"There shall none of his meat be left Margin, "or, be none left for his
meat." Noyes renders it, "Because nothing escaped his greatness." Prof.
Lee, "no surviver shall remain for his provision." But the meaning,
probably, is, nothing shall remain of his food, or it shall all be
wasted, or dissipated.

Therefore, shall no man look for his goods - Or rather, his goods or his
property shall not endure. But a great variety of interpretations has
been given to the passage. The Hebrew word rendered "shall look," יחיל
yāchı̂yl, is from חוּל chûl, which means, "to turn round, to twist, to
whirl;" and thence, arises the notion of being firm, stable, or strong -
as a rope that is twisted is strong. That is the idea here; and the
sense is, that his property should not be secure or firm; or that he
should not prosper. Jerome renders it, "Nothing shall remain of his
goods." The Septuagint, "Therefore his good things - αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀγκθά
autou ta agatha - shall not flourish" - ἀνθήσει anthēsei.

In the fulness of his sufficiency - When he seems to have an abundance.

He shall be in straits - Either by the dread of calamity, or because
calamity shall come suddenly upon him, and his property shall be swept
away. When everything seemed to be abundant he should be reduced to
want.

Every hand of the wicked shall come upon him - Margin, "or, troublesome"
The meaning is, that all that the wretched or miserable endure should
come suddenly upon him. Rosenmuller suggests, however, that it means
that all the poor, and all who had been oppressed and robbed by him,
would suddenly come upon him to recover their own property, and would
scatter all that he had. The general meaning is clear, that he would be
involved in misery from every quarter, or on every hand.

[Job 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 20:23</span></span>

When he is about to fill his belly - Or rather, "there shall be enough
to fill his belly." But what "kind" of food it should be, is indicated
in the following part of the verse. "God" would fill him with the food
of his displeasure. It is spoken sarcastically, as of a gormandizer, or
a man who lived to enjoy eating, and the meaning is, that he should for
once have enough. So Rosenmuller interprets it.

God shall cast the fury - This is the kind of food that he shall have.
God shall fill him with the tokens of his wrath - and he shall have
enough.

And shall rain it upon him while he is eating - Noyes renders this, "And
rain it down upon him for his food." The meaning is, that God would pour
down his wrath like a plentiful shower while he was in the act of
eating. In the very midst of his enjoyments God would fill him with the
tokens of his displeasure. There can be no doubt that Zophar designed
that this should be understood to be applicable to Job. Indeed no one
can fail to see that his remarks are made with consummate skill, and
that they are such as would be fitted "to cut deep," as they were
doubtless intended to do. The speaker does not, indeed, make a direct
application of them, but he so makes his selection of proverbs that
there could be no difficulty in perceiving that they were designed to
apply to him, who, from such a height of prosperity, had been so
suddenly plunged into so deep calamity.

[Job 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 20:24</span></span>

He shall flee from the iron weapon - The sword, or the spear. That is,
he shall be exposed to attacks, and shall flee in cowardice and alarm.
Bands of robbers shall come suddenly upon him, and he shall have no
safety except in flight. Pref. Lee explains this as meaning, "While he
flees from the iron weapon, the brass bow shall pierre him through."
Probably the expression is proverbial, like that in Latin, Incidit in
Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdin.

The bow of steel shall strike him through - That is, the "arrow" from
the bow of steel shall strike him down. Bows and arrows were commonly
used in hunting and in war. To a considerable extent they are still
employed in Persia, though the use has been somewhat superseded by the
gun. "Bows" were made of various materials. The first were, undoubtedly,
of wood. They were inlaid with horn, or ivory, or were made in part of
metal. Sometimes, it would seem that the whole bow was made of metal,
though it is supposed that the metal bow was not in general use. The
"weight," if nothing else, would be an objection to it. The word which
is here rendered "steel" (נחוּשׁה nechûshâh), means properly "brass or
copper" - but it is certain that brass or copper could never have been
used to form the main part of the bow, as they are destitute of the
elasticity which is necessary. Jerome renders it, et irruet in arcum
aereum - "he rushes on the brazen bow." So the Septuagint, τόξον
χάλκειον toxon chalkeion. So the Chaldee, דכוכומא קשתא - "the bow of
brass." There is no certain proof that "steel" was then known - though
"iron" is often mentioned. It is possible, however, that though the
whole bow was not made of brass or copper, yet that such quantities of
these metals were employed in constructing bows, that they might,
without impropriety, be called bows of brass. The Oriental bow consists
of three parts. The handle, or middle part - that on which the arrow
rested - was straight, and might be made of wood, brass, copper, or any
other strong substance. To this was affixed, at each end, pieces of
horn, or of any other elastic substance, and, the string was applied to
the ends of these horns. The straight piece might have been of brass,
and so without impropriety it might be called a brass bow. It is not
properly rendered "steel" at any rate, as the word used here is never
employed to denote iron or steel.

It is drawn - Or rather, "he draws" - that is, he draws out the arrow
that has been shot at him; or it may mean, as Prof. Lee supposes, that
he draws, that is, "someone" draws the arrow from its quiver, or the
sword from its sheath, in order to smite him. The object is to describe
his death, and to show that he should be certainly overtaken with
calamity. Zophar, therefore, goes through the process by which he would
be shot down, or shows that he could not escape.

And cometh out of the body - That is, the arrow, or the glittering
blade. It has penetrated the body, and passed through it. He shall be
pierced through and through.

The glittering sword - Hebrew ברק bârâq - "the glittering;" scil. thing,
or weapon, and is given to the sword, because it is kept bright.

Cometh out of his gall - Supposed to be the seat of life. See the notes,
[Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013.md).

Terrors are upon him - The terrors of death.

[Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 20:26</span></span>

All darkness shall be hid in his secret places - The word "darkness"
here, as is common, means evidently calamity. The phrase "is hid," means
is treasured up for him. The phrase "in his secret places," may mean
"for his treasures," or instead of the great treasures which he had laid
up for himself. The Apostle Paul has a similar expression, in which,
perhaps, he makes an allusion to this place. [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md), "but, after thy hardness and
impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath." Treasures formerly were laid up in secret places, or places of
darkness, that were regarded as inaccessible; see the notes at [Isa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003.md).

A fire not blown - A fire unkindled. Probably the meaning is, a fire
that man has not kindled, or that is of heavenly origin. The language is
such as would convey the idea of being consumed by lightning, and
probably Zophar intended to refer to such calamities as had come upon
the family of Job, [Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016.md). There is
much "tact" in this speech of Zophar, and in the discourses of his
friends on this point. They never, I believe, refer expressly to the
calamities that had come upon Job and his family. They never in so many
words say, that those calamities were proof of the wrath of heaven. But
they go on to mention a great many similar "cases" in the abstract; to
prove that the wicked would be destroyed in that manner; that when such
calamities came upon people, it was proof that they were wicked, and
they leave Job himself to make the application. The allusion, as in this
case, was too broad to be misunderstood, and Job was not slow in
regarding it as intended for himself. Prof Lee ("in loc.") supposes that
there may be an allusion here to the "fire that shall not be quenched,"
or to the future punishment of the wicked. But this seems to me to be
foreign to the design of the argument, and not to be suggested or
demanded by the use of the word. The argument is not conducted on the
supposition that people will be punished in the future world. That would
at once have given a new phase to the whole controversy, and would have
settled it at once. The question was about the dealings of God "in this
life," and whether men are punished according to their deeds here. Had
there been a knowledge of the future world of rewards and punishments,
the whole difficulty would have vanished at once, and the controversy
would have been ended.

It shall go ill with him in his tabernacle - Hebrew שׂריד ירע yâra‛
śârı̂yd - "It shall be ill with whatever survives or remains in his
tent." That is, all that remains in his dwelling shall be destroyed.
Prof Lee renders it, "In his tent shall his survivor be broken" -
supposing that the word ירע yâra‛ is from רעע râ‛a‛ - "to break." But it
is more probably from רוּע rûa‛ - "to be evil; to suffer evil; to come
off ill:" and the sense is, that evil, or calamity, would come upon all
that should remain in his dwelling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 20:27</span></span>

The heaven shall reveal his iniquity - The meaning here is, that the
whole creation would conspire against such a man. Heaven and earth would
be arrayed against him. The course of events would be so ordered as to
seem designed to bring his character out, and to show what he was. He
would attempt to conceal his sin, but it would be in vain. He would hide
it in his bosom, but it would be developed. He would put on the air of
piety and innocence, but his secret sin would be known. This seems to be
the general sense of the verse; and it is not necessary to attempt to
show "how" it would be done - whether by lightning from heaven, as Noyes
supposes, or whether by some direct manifestation from the skies.
Probably the meaning is, that the divine dispensations toward such a man
- the overwhelming calamities which he would experience, would show what
he was. The word "heaven" is not unfrequently put for God himself. [Dan
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#023.md), "the heavens do rule." [Luk
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#021.md), "I have sinned against heaven."

The earth shall rise up against him - Calamities from the earth. The
course of events here. Want of success - sterility of soil - blight and
mildew, would rise up against such a man and show what he was. His real
character would in some way be brought out, and it would be seen that he
was a wicked man; compare [Jdg 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#020.md).

They fought from heaven;

The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.

The increase of his house shall depart - Septuagint, "Destruction shall
bring his house to an end." The word rendered "depart" (יגל yı̂gel from
גלה gâlâh), means, properly, "shall go into captivity." The sense is,
that whatever he had laid up in his house would entirely disappear.

His goods shall flow away - What he had gained would seem to flow away
like water.

In the day of his wrath - The wrath of God - for so the connection
demands.

[Job 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 20:29</span></span>

This is the portion of a wicked man - This conclusion is similar to that
which Bildad drew at the close of his speech, [Job
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021.md). Zophar intended, undoubtedly,
that Job should apply it to himself, and that he should draw the
inference, that one who had been treated in this manner, must be a
wicked man.

And the heritage appointed - Margin, "of his decree from." The Hebrew
is," Of his word" (אמרוּ 'êmerô ) - that is, of his "purpose." The idea
is, that this is the divine rule, or arrangement. It is not a matter of
chance. It is the result of appointment, and when people are afflicted
in this manner, we are to conclude that "God" regards them as guilty.
The whole object of the discussion was to arrive at the principles of
the divine administration. Nothing is attributed to chance; and nothing
is ascribed to second causes, except as indicating the will of God. It
is assumed, that the course of events in the world was a sufficient
exponent of the divine intention, and that when they understood how God
"treated" a man, they could clearly understand how he regarded his
character. The principle is a good one, when "the whole of existence" is
taken into the account; the fault here was in taking in only a small
part of existence - this short life - and hastening to the conclusion,
that the character could be certainly determined by the manner in which
God deals with people here.
