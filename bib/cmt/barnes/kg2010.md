### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 10:1</span></span>

Seventy sons - i. e., descendants; there were included among them
children of Jehoram ([Kg2 10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#002.md),
etc.).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 10:2</span></span>

A fenced city - Or, "fenced cities." If Samaria had refused to
acknowledge Jehu, many other Israelite towns would have been sure to
follow the example.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 10:3</span></span>

Jehu, placing his adversaries' advantages before them in the most
favorable light, called upon them to decide what they would do. The
unscrupulous soldier shows shrewdness as well as courage, a sharp wit as
well as a bold heart.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 10:4</span></span>

Two kings - literally, "the two kings," i. e., Jehoram and Ahaziah [Kg2
9:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 10:5</span></span>

The officer who had the charge of the place ([Kg1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006) note.md) and the governor of the town
([Kg1 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026) note.md) seem to correspond
to the "rulers" of [Kg2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 10:6</span></span>

The heads of rivals, pretenders, and other obnoxious persons are
commonly struck off in the East, and conveyed to the chief ruler, in
order that he may be positively certified that his enemies have ceased
to live. In the Assyrian sculptures we constantly see soldiers conveying
heads from place to place, not, however, in baskets, but in their hands,
holding the head by the hair.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 10:8</span></span>

Two heaps - Probably placed one on either side of the gateway, to strike
terror into the partisans of the late dynasty as they passed in and out
of the town.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 10:9</span></span>

Ye be righteous - i. e., "Ye are just, and can judge aright." Jehu
unfairly keeps back the fact that he had commanded the execution.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 10:10</span></span>

Shall fall to the earth - i. e., "Shall remain unfulfilled" (compare the
marginal reference). Jehu and others were but executing the word of the
Lord.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 10:11</span></span>

So Jehu slew - Rather, "And Jehu slew." The reference is to fresh
executions (compare [Kg2 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#017).md). He
proceeded on his bloody course, not merely destroying the remainder of
the kindred of Ahab, but further putting to death all the most powerful
of Ahab's partisans.

His priests - Not the Baal priests generally, whose persecution came
afterward [Kg2 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#019.md), but only such of
them as were attached to the court.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 10:12</span></span>

The shearing-house - literally, as in margin. Perhaps already a proper
name, Beth-eked, identical with the Beth-akad of Jerome, which is
described as between Jezreel and Samaria; but not yet identified.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 10:13</span></span>

The brethren of Ahaziah - Not the actual brothers of Ahaziah, who had
all been slain by the Arabs before his accession to the throne [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md); [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md); but his nephews, the sons of his
brothers (marginal reference). It is remarkable that they should have
penetrated so far into the kingdom of Israel without having heard of the
revolution.

The children of the king ... - i. e." the sons of Jehoram, and the
children (sons and grandsons) of the queen-mother, Jezebel." Some of
both may well have been at Jezreel, though the younger branches of the
royal family were at Samaria [Kg2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 10:15</span></span>

Jehonadab (compare the margin) belonged to the tribe of the Kenites, one
of the most ancient in Palestine [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md). Their origin is unknown, but
their habits were certainly those of Arahs. Owing to their connection
with Moses ([Num 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021) note.md), they
formed a friendship with the Israelites, accompanied them in their
wanderings, and finally receivcd a location in the wilderness of Judah
[Jdg 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md). The character of this
chief, Jonadab, is best seen in the rule which he established for his
descendants [Jer 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006.md) - a rule said
to be still observed at the present day. It would seem that he
sympathised strongly with Jehu's proceedings, and desired to give the
countenance of his authority, such as it was, to the new reign.
According to the Hebrew text, Jehu "saluted" (or blessed) Jehonadab.
According to the Septuagint and Josephus, Jehonadab "saluted" (or
blessed) the king. Further, the Hebrew text runs - "And Jehonadab
answered, It is, it is. Give (me) thy hand. And he gave (him) his hand,
and took him up to him into the chariot." Our translators appear to have
preferred the Septuagint; but the Hebrew is more graphic. Jehu was no
doubt glad to have the countenance of Jehonadab on his public entrance
into Samaria. The ascetic had a reputation for sanctity, which could not
fail to make his companionship an advantage to the but half-established
monarch.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 10:17</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md). Thus was finally
completed the political revolution which transferred the throne from the
house of Omri to that of Nimshi, the fifth of the royal families of
Israel.

According to the saying of the Lord - This emphatic reiteration (compare
[Kg2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#010).md) marks, first, how in the
mind of the writer all this history is viewed as deriving its special
interest from its being so full and complete an accomplishment of
Elijah's prophecies; and, secondly, how at the time Jehu carefully put
forward the plea that what he did had this object. It does not indicate
that a single-minded wish to execute God's will was Jehu's predominate
motive. Probably, even where he most strictly fulfilled the letter of
prophecies, he was working for himself, not for God; and hence,
vengeance was denounced upon his house even for the very "blood of
Jezreel" [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 10:18</span></span>

Though we cannot ascribe to Jehu a spirit of true piety (see [Kg2
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#029).md), we can well enough understand
how the soldier, trained in the Syrian wars, revolted against the
unmanly and voluptuous worship of the Dea Syra, and wished to go back to
the simple solemn service of Yahweh. These views and feelings it would
have been dangerous to declare during the lifetime of Jezebel. Even
after her death it was prudent to temporise, to wait until the party of
Ahab was crushed politically, before broaching tbe religious question.
Having now slain all the issue of Ahab in the kingdom of Israel, and all
the influential men of the party [Kg2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007.md), [Kg2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md), [Kg2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#017.md), Jehu felt that he might begin
his reformation of religion. But even now he uses "subtilty" rather than
open violence. "Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him
much."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 10:19</span></span>

It appears from this verse that the "prophets" and "priests" of Baal
were not identical. The former would correspond to the dervishes, the
latter to the mullahs, of Muslim countries. By the "servants" of Baal
are meant the ordinary worshippers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 10:20</span></span>

A solemn assembly - Jehu applies to his proposed gathering the sacred
name assigned in the Law to the chiefest festivals of Yahweh (see [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036.md); [Num
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md); [Deu
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#008).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 10:21</span></span>

In order to understand how such numbers could find room, we must
remember that the ancient temples had vast courts around them, which
could contain many thousands.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 10:22</span></span>

The vestry - The sacred robes of the Baal priests seem to have been of
linen, and were probably white. The vestry here mentioned may, probably,
be the robe-chamber of the royal palace, from which the king gave a
festal garment to each worshipper.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 10:23</span></span>

The presence of persons belonging to another religion was usually
regarded by the ancients as a profanation of the rites. In the case of
the Greek mysteries such intrusion is said to have been punished by
death. Consequently Jehu could give these injunctions without arousing
any suspicion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 10:25</span></span>

As soon as he had made an end of offering - The actual sacrificers were
no doubt the priests of Baal; but Jehu is considered to have made the
offering, since he furnished the victims. Compare [Kg1
8:62-63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md).

The guard - literally, "the runners." This name seems to have been given
to the royal body-guard as early as the time of Saul ([Sa1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#017), margin.md). It was their duty to
run by the side of the king's chariot as he moved from plaze to place.

Cast them out, and went - Rather, "the captains hasted and went," or
"went hastily;" which gives a satisfactory sense. That the soldiers
should have troubled themselves to cast the bodies of the slain out of
the temple enclosure is very unlikely.

The city of the house of Baal - i. e., the temple itself, as
distinguished from the court in which it stood, is intended. The guard
having slain all who were in the court, rushed on and entered the
sanctuary, there no doubt completing the massacre, and further tearing
down and bringing out the sacred objects mentioned in the next verse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 10:26</span></span>

The images - Or "pillars" of wood. The Phoenician pillar idols were mere
columns, obelisks, or posts, destitute of any shaping into the semblance
of humanity (compare [Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 10:27</span></span>

And they brake down the image of Baal - The other images, it appears,
were not images of Baal, but of inferior deities. The image of Baal,
which was "broken down," and not burned, would seem to have been of
stone, perhaps erected in front of the temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 10:29</span></span>

To abolish the calf-worship was a thought which had probably never
occurred to Jehu. He had religious feeling enough, and patriotism
enough, to detest the utterly debasing Astarte worship; but the pure
worship of Yahweh was altogether beyond and above him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 10:30</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Jehu - Probably by the mouth of Elisha. To a
certain extent Jehu's measures were acts of obedience, for which God
might see fit to assign him a temporal reward.

Thy children ... - This was accomplished in the persons of Jehoahaz,
Joash, Jeroboam, and Zachariah, the son, grandson, great-grandson, and
great-great-grandson of Jehu (compare the marginal references). No other
family sat upon the throne of Israel so long. The house of Omri, which
furnished four kings, held the crown for three generations only and for
less than 50 years - that of Jehu reigned for five generations and for
more than 100 years.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 10:32</span></span>

To cut Israel short - literally, "to cut off in Israel," i. e., to take
away from Israel portions of its territory (see the marginal reference).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 10:33</span></span>

The loss of the entire trans-Jordanic territory seems to be intended, or
at any rate its complete ruin and devastation (compare marginal
reference "y"). This was the home of the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and
of the half tribe of Manasseh [Jos
22:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md). It was more accessible from
Damascus than the region west of the river.

Aroer - There were several places of this name. The one here mentioned
is the most famous (compare [Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md)
note).

Even Gilead and Bashan - The writer had previously called the whole
territory "Gilead;" now he distinguishes it, more accurately, into
Gilead, the southern, and Bashan, the northern region [Kg1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md), [Kg1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 10:34</span></span>

All his might - It is remarkable that this expression, which is not used
by the author of Kings in connection with any other king of Israel,
should be applied to Jehu, whose ill success in his struggle with Hazael
has just been noted, and who submitted to the Assyrians and consented to
become a tributary. Perhaps the word is used here in the sense of
"personal courage" rather than of "power."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 10:36</span></span>

In Samaria - The family of Ahab had made Jezreel a sort of second
capital, and had reigned there, at least in part 2 Kings 9:15-30. Jehu
and his descendants seem to have fixed their residence wholly in Samaria
[Kg2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md), [Kg2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md); [Kg2
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md); [Kg2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md).
