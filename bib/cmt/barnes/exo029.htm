<p>The consecration of the priests. See the notes to Lev. 8-9.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#004">Exo 29:4</A>
<p>Door of the tabernacle - Entrance of the tent. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#003">Lev 8:3</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027">Exo 29:27</A>
<p>The "waving" was the more solemn process of the two: it was a movement several times repeated, while "heaving" was simply a "lifting up" once.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033">Exo 29:33</A>
<p>A stranger - One of another family, i. e. in this case, one not of the family of Aaron. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038">Exodus 29:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">exo 29:38</A></FONT></span></p>
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038">Exo 29:38</A>
<p>The continual burnt-offering - The primary purpose of the national altar is here set forth. The victim slain every morning and every evening was an acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Yahweh; the offering of meal was an acknowledgment that all their works rightly done were His due (see Lev. 2); while the incense symbolized their daily prayers.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#039">Exo 29:39</A>
<p>At even - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006">Exo 12:6</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040">Exo 29:40</A>
<p>A tenth deal - i. e. the tenth part of an Ephah; it is sometimes called an Omer (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036">Exo 16:36</A>; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013">Lev 23:13</A>). The Ephah seems to have been rather less than four gallons and a half (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036">Lev 19:36</A> note); and the tenth deal of flour may have weighed about 3 lbs. 2 oz.
<p>An hin - The word appears to be Egyptian. The measure was one-sixth of an ephah. The quarter of a bin was therefore about a pint and a half. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036">Lev 19:36</A> note.
<p>Beaten oil - See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020">Exo 27:20</A>.
<p>Wine for a drink offering - The earliest mention of the drink-offering is found in connection with Jacob's setting up the stone at Bethel <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014">Gen 35:14</A>. But it is here first associated with the rites of the altar. The law of the drink-offering is stated <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005">Num 15:5</A> following. Nothing whatever is expressly said in the Old Testament regarding the mode in which the wine was treated: but it would seem probable, from the prohibition that it should not be poured upon the altar of incense <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009">Exo 30:9</A>, that it used to be poured on the altar of burnt-offering.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#042">Exo 29:42</A>
<p>At the door of the tabernacle - At the entrance of the tent.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#043">Exo 29:43</A>
<p>The (tabernacle) shall be sanctified - The word "tabernacle" is certainly not the right one to be here supplied. What is probably meant is the spot in which Yahweh promises to meet with the assembly of His people. The verse may be rendered, And in that place will I meet with the children of Israel, and it shall be sanctified with my glory. See also the margin.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044">Exo 29:44-45</A>
<p>The purpose of the formal consecration of the sanctuary and of the priests who served in it was, that the whole nation which Yahweh had set free from its bondage in Egypt might be consecrated in its daily life, and dwell continually in His presence as "a kingdom of priests and an holy nation." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006">Exo 19:6</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046">Exo 29:46</A>
<p>Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Gen 17:7</A>.
