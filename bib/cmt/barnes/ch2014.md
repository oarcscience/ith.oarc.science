### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 14:1</span></span>

Asa his son reigned - If Rehoboam was ([Kg1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008) note.md) not more than 21 years old
at his accession, Asa, when he mounted the throne, must have been a mere
boy, not more than 10 or 11 years of age.

The land was quiet ten years - The great blow struck by Abijah [Ch2
13:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#015.md), his alliance with Syria [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019.md), and the rapid succession of
sovereigns in Israel during the earlier part of Asa's reign [Kg1
15:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025.md), would naturally prevent
disturbance on the part of the northern kingdom. The tender age of Asa
himself would be a bar to warlike enterprises on the part of Judah.

[2 Chronicles 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 14:5</span></span>

Images - See the margin, sun-images; and [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md) note.

[2 Chronicles 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 14:7</span></span>

The land is yet before us - i. e., "unoccupied by an enemy" - "the land
is open to us to go where we please." Compare [Gen
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#009.md). The fortification of the
strongholds would be an act of rebellion against Egypt, and it might be
expected that the Egyptians would endeavor to put a stop to it.

[2 Chronicles 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 14:8</span></span>

The men of Judah served as heavy-armed troops, while the Benjamites were
light-armed. Their numbers accord well with those of [Ch2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003.md). As the boundaries of Judah had
been enlarged [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md), and as for
ten years at least there had been no war [Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001.md), the effective force had
naturally increased. It was 400, 000; it is now 580, 000.

[2 Chronicles 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 14:9</span></span>

Zerah the Ethiopian is probably Usarken (Osorkon) II, the third king of
Egypt after Shishak, according to the Egyptian monuments. Osorkon II may
have been by birth an Ethiopian, for he was the son-in-law, not the son,
of the preceding monarch, and reigned in right of his wife. The object
of the expedition would be to bring Judaea once more under the Egyptian
yoke.

An host of a thousand thousand - This is the largest collected army of
which we hear in Scripture; but it does not exceed the known numbers of
other Oriental armies in ancient times. Darius Codomannus brought into
the field at Arbela a force of 1,040, 000; Xerxes crossed into Greece
with certainly above a million of combatants.

[2 Chronicles 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 14:10</span></span>

The "valley of Zephathah" - not elsewhere mentioned - is probably the
broad Wady which opens out from Mareshah (marginal reference) in a
northwesterly direction, leading into the great Philistine plain. Zerah,
on the advance of Asa, drew off into the wider space of the Wady, where
he could use his horsemen and chariots.

[2 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 14:11</span></span>

It is nothing ... - i. e., "Thou canst as easily help the weak as the
strong."

[2 Chronicles 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 14:12</span></span>

The defeat of Zerah is one of the most remarkable events in the history
of the Jews. On no other occasion did they meet in the field and
overcome the forces of either of the two great monarchies between which
they were placed. It was seldom that they ventured to resist, unless
behind walls. Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, were
either unopposed or only opposed in this way. On the one other occasion
on which they took the field - under Josiah against Necho - their
boldness issued in a most disastrous defeat [Ch2
35:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md). Now, however, under Asa,
they appear to have gained a complete victory over Egypt. The results
which followed were nicest striking. The Southern power could not rally
from the blow, and, for above three centuries made no further effort in
this direction. Assyria, growing in strength, finally, under Sargon and
Sennacherib, penetrated to Egypt itself. All fear of Egypt as an
aggressive power ceased; and the Israelites learned instead to lean upon
the Pharaohs for support ([Kg2 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md);
[Kg2 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md); [Isa
30:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002), etc..md). Friendly ties alone
connected the two countries: and it was not until 609 B.C. that an
Egyptian force again entered Palestine with a hostile intention.

[2 Chronicles 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 14:14</span></span>

They smote all the cities round about Gerar - The Philistines of these
parts had, it is probable, accompanied Zerah in his expedition.
