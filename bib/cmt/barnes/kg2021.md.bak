### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 21:1</span></span>

Manasseh was twelve years old - Manasseh, therefore, was not born at the
time of Hezekiah's dangerous illness; and it is probable that Hezekiah
had at that time no son to succeed him. According to Josephus, this was
the principal cause of his grief.

Hephzibah - Jewish tradition makes Hephzibah, Hezekiah's wife, the
daughter of Isaiah; but this is scarcely probable. She was, however, no
doubt, known to the prophet, and it may well have been in special
compliment to her that Isaiah introduced her name [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md) as one that Jerusalem would bear
after her restoration to God's favor. The name means, "My delight (is)
in her."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 21:2</span></span>

Manasseh during his minority naturally fell under the influence of the
chief Jewish nobles, with whom the pure religion of Yahweh was always
unpopular (compare [Ch2 24:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017.md); [Jer
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001).md). They seem to have persuaded
him, not only to undo Hezekiah's work, but to proceed to lengths in
polytheism, magic, and idolatry, unknown before. The sins of Manasseh's
reign appear to have been those which filled up the measure of Judah's
iniquity, and brought down the final sentence of doom on the last
remnant of the chosen people ([Kg2
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md); compare [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 21:3</span></span>

The first step in the re-establishment of idolatry seems to have been
the restoration of the high places where Yahweh was professedly
worshipped [Kg2 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022.md), but with
idolatrous rites [Kg1 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023.md). The next
was to re-introduce the favorite idolatry of Israel, Baal-worship, which
had formerly flourished in Judaea under Athaliah [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md), and Ahaz [Ch2
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md). After this, Manasseh seems to
have especially affected Sabaism, which had been previously unknown in
Judaea (compare [Kg2 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016) and note.md).

Worshipped all the host of heaven - Sabaism, or pure star-worship,
without images, and without astrological superstitions, included a
reverence for the sun, the moon, the chief stars, and the twelve signs
of the Zodiac ([Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005) note.md). The
main worship was by altars, on which incense was burned [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md). These altars were placed either
upon the ground [Kg2 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md), or upon the
house-tops [Kg2 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md). The sun was worshipped with the
face toward the east [Eze 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md);
chariots and horses were dedicated to him [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md). The star-worship of the Jews
has far more the character of an Arabian than an Assyrian or Chaldaean
cult. It obtained its hold at a time when Assyria and Babylonia had but
little communication with Judaea - i. e., during the reign of Manasseh.
It crept in probably from the same quarter as the Molech worship, with
which it is here (and in [Ch2 33:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#003).md)
conjoined.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 21:4</span></span>

The "altars" of this verse seem to be the same with those of [Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md), and consequently were not in the
temple building, but in the outer and inner courts.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 21:6</span></span>

On the meaning of the phrase "passing through the fire," see [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md), and [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md).

To "observe times" was forbidden in the Law (marginal references), and
was no doubt among the modes of divination practiced by the Canaanite
nations. It has been explained as,

\(1\) Predicting from the state of the clouds and atmosphere;

\(2\) Fascination with the eye;

\(3\) Watching and catching at chance words as ominous.

Dealt with familiar spirits - This practice was forbidden by Moses [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md) under the penalty of death [Lev
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md). Its nature is best learned from
Saul's visit to the witch of Endor ([Sa1
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007), etc..md).

Wizards - "Wizards" - literally, "wise men" - are always joined with
those who have familiar spirits. Probably they were a sort of
necromancers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 21:7</span></span>

A graven image of the grove - Rather, "the carved work of the Asherah."
This Asherah which Manasseh placed in the very temple itself, from where
it was afterward taken by Josiah to be destroyed [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006.md). Such a profanation was beyond
anything that had been done either by Athaliah [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md), or by Ahaz [Kg2
16:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014.md); [Ch2
29:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#005.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 21:9</span></span>

During the long reign of Manasseh idolatry in all manner of varied forms
took a hold upon the Jewish people such as had never been known before.
Compare [Jer 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018.md), [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md); [Eze
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#037.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md). The corruption of morals kept
pace with the degradation of religion. Compare [Kg2
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007.md); [Zep
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md); [Jer
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008.md); [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 21:10</span></span>

The prophets - None of the prophets of this reign are certainly known.
One may possibly have been Hosai or Hozai ([Ch2
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#019), margin.md), who perhaps wrote a
life of Manasseh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 21:13</span></span>

The general meaning is plain, but the exact force of the metaphor used
is not so clear. If the "line" and the "plummet" be "symbols of rule" or
law, the meaning will be - "I will apply exactly the same measure and
rule to Jerusalem as to Samaria - I will treat both alike with strict
and even justice."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 21:16</span></span>

Compare [Jer 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md); [Isa
57:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md). According to tradition, Isaiah
was among the first to perish. More than a century afterward, the final
judgment upon Jerusalem was felt to be in an special way the punishment
of Manasseh's bloody persecution of God's people (marginal reference).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 21:17</span></span>

The writer of Kings relates in eighteen verses the history of 55 years,
and consequently omits numerous facts of great importance in the life of
Manasseh. Among the most remarkable of the facts omitted are the capture
of Manasseh by the king of Assyria, his removal to Babylon, his
repentance there, his restoration to his kingdom, and his religious
reforms upon his return to it. These are recorded only in Chronicles
(marginal reference, see the note). The writer of Kings probably
considered the repentance of Manasseh but a half-repentance, followed by
a half-reformation, which left untouched the root of the evil.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 21:18</span></span>

Was buried - The catacomb of David was probably full, and the later
kings, from Ahaz downward, had to find sepulture elsewhere. Ahaz was
buried in Jerusalem, but not in the sepulchres of the kings [Ch2
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#027.md). Hezekiah found a resting place
on the way that led up to David's catacomb [Ch2
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033.md). Manasseh and Amon were interred
in "the garden of Uzza," a portion (apparently) of the royal
palace-garden; perhaps so called after the name of the previous owner.
Josiah was buried in "his own sepulchre" [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md).

Amon his son - This name, which occurs only at this time and in the
reign of the idolatrous Ahab [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md), is identical in form with the
Hebrew representative of the great Egyptian god, Amen or Amun ([Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008) margin.md); and it is therefore
probable that Manasseh selected it and gave it to his son in compliment
to the Egyptians.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 21:21</span></span>

At Manasseh's death, the idolatrous party, held in some check during his
later years [Ch2 33:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#015.md), recovered
the entire direction of affairs, and obtained authority from Amon to
make once more all the changes which Manasseh had made in the early part
of his reign. Hence, we find the state of things at Josiah's accession
[Kg2 23:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004.md); [Zep
1:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md); [Zep
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md), the exact counterpart of that
which had existed under Manasseh.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 21:23</span></span>

This conspiracy may have been due to the popular reaction against the
extreme idolatry which the young king had established.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 21:24</span></span>

The intention of the conspirators had perhaps been to declare a
forfeiture of the crown by the existing line, and to place a new dynasty
on the throne. This the people would not suffer. They arrested them and
put them to death; and insisted on investing with the royal authority
the true heir of David, the eldest son of Amon, though he was a boy only
8 years old.
