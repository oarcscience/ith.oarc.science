### [Leviticus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001)

[Leviticus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 27:1</span></span>

Dues. The position which this chapter holds after the formal conclusion,
[Lev 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046), suggests that it is of a
supplementary character. There seems, however, no reason to doubt its
Mosaic origin.

[Leviticus 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 27:2</span></span>

Rather, When a man makes a special vow which concerns thy valuation of
persons to Yahweh, if thy estimation shall be of the male, etc. The
expression "thy estimation" is addressed either to Moses or to the
priest [Lev 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012) : it denoted a legal
valuation. The vow of a person was perhaps most frequently made in cases
of illness or danger, under the impulse of religions feeling, either in
the way of thankfulness for blessings received, or of supplication for
something desired. A man might dedicate himself, his wife, his child, or
his bondservant. This might have been an old custom; but the Law
ordained that he who had taken such a vow should pay a sum of money to
the sanctuary, determined according to the age and sex of the person.

[Leviticus 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 27:4</span></span>

The relative values of the persons appear to be regulated according to
an estimate of the probable value of their future work:

Ages Male Female From a month to five years of age 5 shekels 3 shekels
From five years to twenty of age 20 shekels 10 shekels From forty years
to sixty of age 50 shekels 30 shekels Sixty years of age and older: 15
shekels 10 shekels

As regards the shekel of the sanctuary, see [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note.

[Leviticus 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 27:8</span></span>

If he be poorer than thy estimation - Too poor (to pay) thy valuation.
Compare [Lev 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#007), [Lev
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011).

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

Sanctify - i. e. vow to devote. This law relates to houses in the
country [Lev 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#031), which were under
the same general law as the land itself, with a right of redemption for
the inheritor until the next Jubilee. See [Lev
27:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#017). For houses in walled towns
the right of redemption lasted for only one year [Lev
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#029).

[Leviticus 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 27:16</span></span>

Some part of a field of his possession - Rather, a part of the land of
his inheritance.

The seed thereof - i. e. the quantity of seed required to sow it
properly. Thus the value of about 5 1/2 bushels (an homer) was about 6
pounds, 9 shillings, 2d. (50 shekels. See [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024).)

[Leviticus 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 27:21</span></span>

Devoted - See [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028) note.

[Leviticus 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 27:25</span></span>

On the shekel and the gerah, see [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013), note; [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024), note.

[Leviticus 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 27:28</span></span>

Devoted thing - The primary meaning of the Heb. word חרם chērem is
something cut off, or shut up. Its specific meaning in the Law is, that
which is cut off from common use and given up in some sense to Yahweh,
without the right of recal or commutation. It is applied to a field
wholly appropriated to the sanctuary [Lev
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021), and to whatever was doomed to
destruction [Sa1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021); [Kg1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042). Our translators have often
rendered the word by "cursed," or "a curse," which in some places may
convey the right sense, but it should be remembered that the terms are
not identical in their compass of meaning ([Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026); [Jos
6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017); [Jos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001); [Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005); [Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028), etc. Compare [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)).

Of man and beast - This passage does not permit human sacrifices. Man is
elsewhere clearly recognized as one of the creatures which were not to
be offered in sacrifice [Exo 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013);
[Exo 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#020); [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015).

Therefore the application of the word חרם chērem to man is made
exclusively in reference to one rightly doomed to death and, in that
sense alone, given up to Yahweh. The man who, in a right spirit, either
carries out a sentence of just doom on an offender, or who, with a
single eye to duty, slays an enemy in battle, must regard himself as
God's servant rendering up a life to the claim of the divine justice
(compare [Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004)). It was in this
way that Israel was required to destroy the Canaanites at Hormah ([Num
21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002); compare [Deu
13:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012)), and that Samuel hewed Agag
in pieces before the Lord [Sa1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033).
In all such instances, a moral obligation rests upon him whose office it
is to take the life: he has to look upon the object of his stroke as
under a ban to the Lord (compare [Deu
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#004); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)). Therefore, there can be neither
redemption nor commutation.

It is evident that the righteousness of this law is not involved in the
sin of rash or foolish vows, such as Saul's [Sa1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024) or Jephthah's [Jdg
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#030).

And it seems hardly needful to add that sacrifice, as it is represented
both in the Law and in the usage of the patriarchs, is something very
different from consecration under a ban, though a tiring to be
sacrificed might come under the designation of חרם chērem in its wider
sense. The sacrifice was always the offering up of the innocent life of
a creature chosen, approved, and without spot or blemish.

[Leviticus 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 27:32</span></span>

Whatsoever passeth under the rod - According to rabbinical tradition,
the animals to be tithed were enclosed in a pen, and as they went out
one by one at the opening, every tenth animal was touched with a rod
dipped in vermilion. Compare the margin reference.

For a more full explanation of what relates to tithes, see the margin
reference and [Gen 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020); [Deu
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022), [Deu
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028).
