### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 17:1</span></span>

In the twelfth year - Compare [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md) note. The history of the kingdom
of Israel is in this chapter brought to a close.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 17:2</span></span>

Not as the kings of Israel that were before him - The repentance of a
nation like that of an individual, may be "too late." God is
long-suffering; but after national sins have reached a certain height,
after admonitions and warnings have been repeatedly rejected, after
lesser punishments have failed - judgment begins to fall. Forces have
been set in motion, which nothing but a miracle could stop; and God does
not see fit to work a miracle in such a case. Compare Butler, 'Analogy,
' Pt. I ch. 2 end.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 17:3</span></span>

Of Shalmaneser, the successor of Tiglath-pileser in the Assyrian Canon,
we know little from Assyrian sources, since his records have been
mutilated by his successors, the Sargonids, who were of a wholly
different family. The archives of Tyre mention him as contemporary with,
and warring against, a Tyrian king named Elulaeus. The expedition,
referred to here, was probably in the first year of Shalmaneser (727
B.C.). Its main object was the reduction of Phoenicia, which had
re-asserted its independence, but (except Tyre) was once more completely
reduced. Shalmaneser probably passed on from Phoenicia into Galilee,
where he attacked and took Beth-arbel (Arbela of Josephus, now Irbid),
treating it with great severity [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md), in order to alarm Hoshea, who
immediately submitted, and became tributary (see the marginal rendering
and [Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021) note.md). Shalmaneser then
returned into Assyria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 17:4</span></span>

So, king of Egypt, is generally identified with Shebek (730 B.C.), the
Sabaco of Herodotus. Hoshea's application to him was a return to a
policy which had been successful in the reign of Jeroboam I ([Kg1
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020) note.md), but had not been resorted
to by any other Israelite monarch. Egypt had for many years been weak,
but Sabaco was a conqueror, who at the head of the swarthy hordes of
Ethiopia had invaded Egypt and made himself master of the country. In
the inscriptions of Shebek he boasts to have received tribute from "the
king of Shara" (Syria), which is probably his mode of noticing Hoshea's
application. References to the Egyptian proclivities of Hoshea are
frequent in the prophet Hosea [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md), [Hos
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md). King Hoshea, simultaneously with
his reception as a vassal by Sabaco, ceased to pay tribute to
Shalmaneser, thus openly rebelling, and provoking the chastisement which
followed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 17:5</span></span>

All the land - The second invasion of Shalmaneser (723 B.C., his fifth
year), is here contrasted with the first, as extending to the whole
country, whereas the first had afflicted only a part.

Three years - From the fourth to the sixth of Hezekiah, and from the
seventh to the ninth of Heshea; two years, therefore, according to our
reckoning, but three, according to that of the Hebrews. This was a long
time for so small a place to resist the Assyrians but Samaria was
favorably situated on a steep hill; probably Sabaco made some attempts
to relieve his vassal; the war with Tyre must have distracted
Shalmaneser; and there is reason to believe that before the capture was
effected a revolt had broken out at Nineveh which must have claimed
Shalmaneser's chief attention, though it did not induce him to abandon
his enterprise.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 17:6</span></span>

The king of Assyria took Samaria - i. e., from the Assyrian
inscriptions, not Shalmaneser but Sargon, who claims to have captured
the city in the first year of his reign (721 B.C.). At first Sargon
carried off from Samaria no more than 27,280 prisoners and was so far
from depopulating the country that he assessed the tribute on the
remaining inhabitants at the same rate as before the conquest. But later
in his reign he effected the wholesale deportation here mentioned.

Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan - Rather, "on the Habor, the
river of Gozan." Halah is the tract which Ptolemy calls Chalcitis, on
the borders of Gauzanitis (Gozan) in the vicinity of the Chaboras, or
Khabour (Habor, the great affluent of the Euphrates). In this region is
a remarkable mound called Gla, which probably marks the site, and
represents the name, of the city of Chalach, from where the district
Chalcitis was so called.

In the cities of the Medes - Sargon relates that he overran Media,
seized and "annexed to Assyria" a number of the towns, and also
established in the country a set of fortified posts or colonies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 17:7</span></span>

The reasons for which God suffered the Israelites to be deprived of
their land and carried into captivity were:

1\. their idolatries;

2\. their rejection of the Law;

3\. their disregard of the warning voices of prophets and seers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 17:8</span></span>

Idolatry was worse in the Israelites than in other nations, since it
argued not merely folly and a gross carnal spirit, but also black
ingratitude [Exo 20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md). The writer
subdivides the idolatries of the Israelites into two classes, pagan and
native - those which they adopted from the nations whom they drove out,
and those which their own kings imposed on them. Under the former head
would come the great mass of the idolatrous usages described in [Kg2
17:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md), [Kg2
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017.md); "the high places" [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md), [Kg2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011.md); the "images" and "groves" [Kg2
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010.md); the causing of their children
to "pass through the fire" [Kg2 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017.md);
and the "worship of the host of heaven" [Kg2
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016.md) : under the latter would fall
the principal points in [Kg2 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#012.md),
[Kg2 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016.md), [Kg2
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#021.md).

Which they had made - "Which" refers to "statutes." The lsraelites had
"walked in the statutes of the pagan, and in those of the kings of
Israel, which (statutes) they (the kings) had made."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 17:9</span></span>

Literally, the words run thus - "And the children of Israel concealed
(or 'dissembled') words which were not so concerning the Lord their
God;" the true meaning of which probably is, the Israelites cloaked or
covered their idolatry with the pretence that it was a worship of
Yahweh: they glossed it over and dissembled toward God, instead of
openly acknowledging their apostasy.

From the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city - This phrase was
probably a proverbial expression for universality, meaning strictly;
"alike in the most populous and in the most desolate regions." "Towers
of watchmen" were built for the protection of the flocks and herds which
were pastured in waste and desert places [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md); [Ch2
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 17:11</span></span>

The burning of incense was a common religious practice among the
Egyptians and the Babylonians; and from the present passage we gather
that the Canaanite nations practiced it as one of their ordinary sacred
rites. The Israelites are frequently reproached with it [Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013.md); [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md); [Isa
65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 17:13</span></span>

God raised up a succession of prophets and seers, who repeated and
enforced the warnings of the Law, and breathed into the old words a new
life. Among this succession were, in Israel, Ahijah the Shilonite [Kg1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md), Jehu the son of Hanani [Kg1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md), Elijah, Micaiah the son of Imlah
[Kg1 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md), Elisha, Jonah the son of
Amittai [Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), Oded [Ch2
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009.md), Amos, and Hosea; in Judah, up to
this time, Shemaiah [Ch2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#002.md); [Ch2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005.md), Iddo [Ch2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015.md); [Ch2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022.md), Azariah the son of Oded [Ch2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md), Hanani [Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007.md), Jehu his son [Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md), Jahaziel the son of Zechariah
[Ch2 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md), Eliezer the son of Dodavah
([Ch2 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037).md), Zechariah the son of
Jehoiada [Ch2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md), another Zechariah
[Ch2 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005.md), Joel, Micah, and Isaiah,
besides several whose names are not known. Some of these persons are
called "prophets," others "seers." Occasionally, the same person has
both titles (as Iddo and Jehu the son of Hanani), which seems to show
that there was no very important distinction between them.

Probably the conjecture is right that "prophet" נביא nâbı̂y' in
strictness designates the official members of the prophetical order
only, while "seer" חזה chôzeh is applicable to all, whether members of
the order or not, who receive a prophetical revelation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 17:14</span></span>

To "harden" or "stiffen the neck" is a common Hebrew expression
significative of unbending obstinacy and determined self-will. See the
marginal references.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 17:15</span></span>

As idols are "vanity" and "nothingness," mere weakness and impotence, so
idolators are "vain" and impotent. Their energies have been wasted,
their time misspent; they have missed the real object of their
existence; their whole life has been a mistake; and the result is utter
powerlessness. Literally, the word rendered "vanity" seems to mean
"breath" or "vapor" - a familiar image for nonentity. It occurs
frequently in the prophets, and especially in Jeremiah (e. g. [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005.md); [Jer
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019.md); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022), etc..md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 17:16</span></span>

In [Kg2 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010.md) there is a reference to
the old high-place worship, which was professedly a worship of Yahweh,
but with unauthorized rites and emblems; here the reference is to Ahab's
setting up a grove to Baal in the city of Samaria (marginal reference).

And worshipped all the host of heaven - Astral worship has not hitherto
been mentioned as practiced by the Israelites. Moses had warned against
it [Deu 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md); [Deu
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md), so that it no doubt existed in
his day, either among the Canaanite nations or among the Arabians [Job
31:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md). Perhaps it was involved to
some extent in the Baal worship of the Phoenicians, for Baal and Astarte
were probably associated in the minds of their worshippers with the Sun
and moon. Later in the history we shall find a very decided and
well-developed astral worship prevalent among the Jews, which is
probably Assyro-Babylonian ([Kg2 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md)
note).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 17:17</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md) note, and see [Lev
20:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 17:19</span></span>

This verse and the next are parenthetical. Here again, as in [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md), the writer is led on from his
account of the sins and punishment of the Israelites to glance at the
similar sins and similar punishment of the Jews.

It was the worst reproach which could be urged against any Jewish king,
that he "walked in the way of the kings of Israel" [Kg2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md); [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md); [Ch2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006.md); [Ch2
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002.md). The Baal worship is generally
the special sin at which the phrase is leveled; but the meaning here
seems to be wider. Compare [Mic 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 17:20</span></span>

All the seed of lsrael - The Jews, i. e. as well as the Israelites.
God's dealings with both kingdoms were alike. "Spoilers" were sent
against each, time after time, before the final ruin came on them -
against Israel, Pul and Tiglath-pileser [Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md), [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md); against Judah, Sennacherib [Kg2
18:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md), Esar-haddon [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md), and Nebuchadnezzar thrice.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 17:21</span></span>

The strong expression "drave Israel" is an allusion to the violent
measures whereto Jeroboam had recourse in order to stop the efflux into
Judea of the more religious portion of his subjects [Ch2
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md), the calling in of Shishak,
and the permanent assumption of a hostile attitude toward the southern
kingdom.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 17:23</span></span>

As he had said by all his servants the prophets - The writer refers not
only to the extant prophecies of Moses ([Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md); [Deu
4:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md); [Deu
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036), etc..md), Ahijah the Shilohite
(marginal reference), Hosea [Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md),
[Hos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017.md), and Amos [Amo
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md), but also to the entire series of
warnings and predictions which prophet after prophet in a long unbroken
succession had addressed to the disobedient Israelites [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md) on their apostasy, and so
leaving them wholly "without excuse" (see the [Kg2
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013) note.md).

Unto this day - The words, taken in combination with the rest of the
chapter, distinctly show that the Israelites had not returned to their
land by the time of the composition of the Books of Kings. They show
nothing as to their ultimate fate. But, on the whole, it would seem
probable:

\(1\) that the ten tribes never formed a community in their exile, but
were scattered from the first; and

\(2\) that their descendants either blended with the pagan and were
absorbed, or returned to Palestine with Zerubbabel and Ezra, or became
inseparable united with the dispersed Jews in Mesopotamia and the
adjacent countries.

No discovery, therefore, of the ten tribes is to be expected, nor can
works written to prove their identity with any existing race or body of
persons be regarded as anything more than ingenious exercitations.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 17:24</span></span>

Sargon is probably the king of Assyria intended, not (as generally
supposed) either Shalmaneser or Esar-haddon.

The ruins of Cutha have been discovered about 15 miles northeast of
Babylon, at a place which is called Ibrahim, because it is the
traditional site of a contest between Abraham and Nimrod. The name of
Cuilia is found on the bricks of this place, which are mostly of the era
of Nebuchadnezzar. The Assyrian inscriptions show that the special god
of Cutha was Nergal (see the [Kg2
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030) note.md).

Ava or Ivah or Ahava [Ezr 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md) was on
the Euphrates; perhaps the city in ancient times called Ihi or Aia,
between Sippara (Sepharvaim) and Hena (Anah).

On Hamath, see [Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md) note.

Sepharvaim or Sippara is frequently mentioned in the Assyrian
inscriptions under the name of Tsipar ([Kg2
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031) note.md). The dual form of the
Hebrew name is explained by the fact that the town lay on both sides of
the river. Its position is marked by the modern village of Mosaib, about
20 miles from the ruins of Babylon up the course of the stream.

The towns mentioned in this verse were, excepting Hamath, conquered by
Sargon in his twelfth year, 709 B.C.; and it cannot have been until this
time, or a little later, that the transplantation here recorded took
place. Hamath had revolted, and been conquered by Sargon in his first
year, shortly after the conquest of Samaria.

Instead of the children of Israel - This does not mean that the whole
population of Samaria was carried off (compare [Ch2
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009).md). The writer here, by expressly
confining the new-comers to the "cities of Samaria," seems to imply that
the country districts were in other hands.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 17:25</span></span>

The depopulation of the country, insufficiently remedied by the influx
of foreigners, had the natural consequence of multiplying the wild
beasts and making them bolder. Probably a certain number had always
lurked in the jungle along the course of the Jordan [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md); [Jer
50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044.md); and these now ventured into the
hill country, and perhaps even into the cities. The colonists regarded
their sufferings from the lions as a judgment upon them from "the god of
the land" ([Kg2 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#026.md); compare [Kg1
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#023) note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 17:27</span></span>

Carry one of the priests ...; let them go and dwell there, and let him
teach - The double change of number is curious; but rise text needs no
emendation. The priest would require to be accompanied by assistants,
who would "go and dwell," but would not be qualified to "teach." The
arcana of the worship would be known to none excepting the priests who
had ministered at the two national sanctuaries of Dan and Bethel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 17:28</span></span>

The priest sent to the colonists was not a true Yahweh-priest, but one
of those who had been attached to the calf-worship, probably at Bethel.
Hence, he would be willing to tolerate the mixed religion, which a true
Yahweh-priest would have unsparingly condemned.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 17:29</span></span>

The "Samaritans" here are the Israelites. The temples built by them at
the high places [Kg1 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md); [Kg1
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#032.md) had remained standing at the
time of their departure. They were now occupied by the new-comers, who
set up their own worship in the old sanctuaries.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 17:30</span></span>

Succoth-benoth probably represents a Babylonian goddess called
Zir-banit, the wife of Merodach. She and her husband were, next to Bel
and Beltis, the favorite divinities of the Babylonians.

Nergal, etymologically "the great man," or "the great hero," was the
Babylonian god of war and hunting. His name forms an element in the
Babylonian royal appellation, Nergal-shar-ezar or Neriglissar. The
Assyrian inscriptions connect Nergal in a very special way with Cutha,
of which he was evidently the tutelary deity.

Ashima is ingeniously conjectured to be the same as Esmun, the
AEsculapius of the Cabiri or "great gods" of the Phoenicians.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031.md)

Nibhaz and Tartak are either gods of whom no other notice has come down
to us, or intentional corruptions of the Babylonian names Nebo and Tir,
the great god of Borsippa, who was the tutelar deity of so many
Babylonian kings. The Jews, in their scorn and contempt of polytheism,
occasionally and purposely altered, by way of derision, the names of the
pagan deities. Anammelech is possibly an instance of the same
contemptuous play upon words.

Adrammelech, "the glorious king," signifies the sun. The Assyrian
inscriptions commonly designate Tsipar, or Sepharvaim [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md), "Sippara of the Sun." The title
"Adrammelech" has not yet been found in the inscriptions hitherto; but
it would plainly be a fitting epithet of the great luminary.

The sun-god of the Babylonians, Shamas, was united at Sippara and
elsewhere with a sun-goddess, Anunit, whose name may be represented in
the Anammelech of the text. The Hebrews, taking enough of this name to
show what they meant, assimilated the termination to that of the male
deity, thus producing a ridiculous effect, regarded as insulting to the
gods in question.

Of the lowest of them - Rather, "from all ranks." See marginal reference
note.

Understand the passage thus: "They (the colonists) served their own gods
after the manner of the nations from which they (the government) removed
them," i. e., after the manner of their own countrymen at home.

They fear not the Lord - The new-comers in one sense feared Yahweh [Kg2
17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033.md), [Kg2
17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md). They acknowledged His name,
admitted Him among their gods, and kept up His worship at the high place
at Bethel according to the rites instituted by Jeroboam [Kg2
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#028.md). But in another sense they did
not fear Him. To acknowledge Yahweh together with other gods is not
really to acknowledge Him at all.

Which he wrote for you - It is worth observing here, first, that the
author regards the whole Law as given to the Israelites in a written
form; and secondly, that he looks on the real writer as God.

Their graven images - The Babylonians appear to have made a very sparing
use of animal forms among their religious emblems. They represented the
male Sun, Shamas, by a circle, plain or crossed; the female Sun, Anunit,
by a six-rayed or eight-rayed star; Nebo by a single wedge or
arrow-head, the fundamental element of their writing; the god of the
atmosphere by a double or triple thunderbolt. The gods generally were
represented under human forms. A few of them had, in addition, animal
emblems - the lion, the bull, the eagle, or the serpent; but these seem
never to have been set up for worship in temples. There was nothing
intentionally grotesque in the Babylonian religion, as there was in the
Egyptian and Phoenician.

So do they unto this day - The mixed worship, the union of professed
reverence for Yahweh with the grossest idolatry, continued to the time
of the composition of this book, which must have been as late as 561
B.C., or, at any rate, as late as 580 B.C. [Kg2
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md). It did not, however, continue
much longer. When the Samaritans wished to join the Jews in rebuilding
the temple (about 537 B.C.), they showed that inclination to draw nearer
to the Jewish cult which henceforth marked their religious progress.
Long before the erection of a temple to Yahweh on Mount Gerizim (409
B.C.) they had laid aside all their idolatrous rites, and, admitting the
binding authority of the Pentateuch, had taken upon them the observance
of the entire Law.
