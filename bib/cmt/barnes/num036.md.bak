### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 36:1</span></span>

The daughters of Zelophehad had obtained an ordinance [Num
28:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#006.md) which permitted the daughters
of an Israelite dying without male issue to inherit their father's
property. The chiefs of the Machirites, of whom Zelophehad had been one,
now obtain a supplemental enactment, directing that heiresses should
marry within their own tribe.

[Num 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#004.md)

Be taken away - i. e. be permanently taken away. The jubilee year, by
not restoring the estate to the tribe to which it originally belonged,
would in effect confirm the alienation.

[Num 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#011.md)

Unto their father's brothers' sons - Or more generally, "unto the sons
of their kinsmen."
