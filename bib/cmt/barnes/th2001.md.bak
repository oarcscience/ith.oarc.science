### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

Analysis Of The Chapter

[Th2 1:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md) comprises the following
points:

\(1\) The salutation; [Th2 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md).

\(2\) an expression of thanks for the progress which the Thessalonians
had made in piety, and especially for the manner in which they had been
enabled to bear their trials; [Th2
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md).

\(3\) an assurance that the manner in which they had been enabled to
bear their trials was an evidence that they were true Christians; [Th2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md).

\(4\) a declaration that those who had persecuted them, and all others
who were wicked, would be punished when the Lord Jesus should come, and
that when this should occur the righteous would appear in glory and
honor; [Th2 1:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md).

\(5\) the expression of an earnest desire that they might be prepared
for the solemn scenes of that day; [Th2
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 1:1</span></span>

Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus; - See the notes on [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 1:3</span></span>

We are bound to thank God always for you; - See the notes on [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md). "As it is meet." Since it is fit
or proper. "Because that your faith groweth exceedingly." It would seem
probable from this that Paul had heard from them since his First Epistle
was written. He had doubtless received intelligence of the error which
prevailed among them respecting his views of the coming of the Lord
Jesus, and of the progress which the truth was making, at the same time.
"And the charity of every one of you all toward each other." Your mutual
love.

[2 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 1:4</span></span>

So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God - That is, we
mention your example to other churches, and glory in it, as an evidence
of what the gospel is suited to do; see the notes on [Th1
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md); compare the notes on [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md).

For your patience - Your patient endurance of trials.

And faith - Fidelity, or constancy. You have shown unwavering confidence
in God in your afflictions.

In all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure - See the notes
on [Th1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md); [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md). It would seem from this that the
persecutions and trials to which the apostle referred in his First
Epistle were still continued.

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 1:5</span></span>

Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God - The word
"which" is supplied by our translators, and there may be some doubt to
what the apostle has reference as being "a manifest token of the
righteous judgment of God." The general sense seems to be, that the fact
that they were thus persecuted was an evidence that there would be a
future judgment, when the righteous who were persecuted would be
rewarded, and the wicked who persecuted them would be punished. The
manner in which they bore their trials was an indication also of what
the result would be in regard to them. Their patience and faith under
persecutions were constantly showing that they would "be counted worthy
of the kingdom of God, for which they were called to suffer." It is
evident that a relative must be supplied here, as our translators have
done, but there has been a difference of view as to what it refers. Some
suppose that it is to "patience," others to "persecutions and
tribulations," and others to the "whole sentence" preceding. The latter
is probably the true construction, and the sense is, that the endurance
of affliction in a proper manner by the righteous is a proof that there
will be a righteous judgment of God in the last day:

\(1\) It is evidence that there will be a future judgment - since the
righteous here suffer so much, and the wicked triumph.

\(2\) these things are now permitted in order that the character may be
developed, and that the reason of the sentence in the last day may be
seen.

\(3\) the manner in which these afflictions are borne is an evidence -
an indication (ἔνδειγμα endeigma) of what the results of the judgment
will be. The word rendered "manifest token" (ἔνδειγμα endeigma), occurs
nowhere else in the New Testament. It means an indication, token, proof
- anything that shows or points out how a thing is, or is to be (from
ἐνδείκνυμι endeiknumi, to show, to point out). The meaning here is,
therefore, that the course of events referred to - the persecutions
which they endured, and the manner in which they were borne - furnished
a proof that there would be a righteous judgment, and also afforded an
indication of what the result of that judgment would be. We may, in
general, learn what will be the issues of the judgment in the case of an
individual from the manner in which he bears trials.

Of the righteous judgment of God - That there will be a just judgment
hereafter. The crimes of the wicked who go unpunished on the earth, and
the sufferings of the good who are unavenged, are a demonstration that
there will be a judgment, when all these inequalities will be adjusted.

That ye may be counted worthy - As the result of your affliction, that
you may be fitted for the kingdom of God. This does not mean that
Christians will merit heaven by their sufferings, but that they may show
that they have such a character that there is a fitness or propriety
that they should be admitted there. They may evince by their patience
and resignation, by their deadness to the world and their holy lives,
that they are not disqualified to enter into that kingdom where the
redeemed are to dwell. No true Christian will ever feel that he is
worthy on his own account, or that he has any claim to eternal life, yet
he may have evidence that he has the characteristics to which God has
promised salvation, and is fitted to dwell in heaven.

Of the kingdom of God. - In heaven, see the notes on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

For which ye also suffer. - The sufferings which you now endure are
because you are professed heirs of the kingdom; that is, you are
persecuted because you are Christians; see [Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 1:6</span></span>

Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you - The sense is: "There will be a future judgment,
because it is proper that God should punish those who now persecute you.
It is not right that they should go unpunished, and triumph forever. It
is not an arbitrary thing, a thing which is indifferent, a thing which
may or may not be done; it is a just and proper thing that the wicked
should be punished." The doctrine is, that the future punishment of the
wicked is just and proper; and that, being just and proper, it will be
inflicted. Many suppose that there would be no justice in the eternal
punishment of the wicked; that the threatening of that punishment is
wholly arbitrary; that it might easily be dispensed with, and that
because it is unjust it will not be inflicted, and need not be dreaded.
But that it is just and proper, a very slight degree of reflection must
show. Because:

\(1\) it is inconceivable that God should threaten such punishment
unless it were just. How can it be reconciled with his perfections that
he can hold up before mankind the assurance that any of them will be
punished forever, unless it be right that it should be so? Can we
believe that he deliberately threatens what is wrong, or that, in the
face of the universe, he publicly declares his intention to do what is
wrong?

\(2\) people themselves believe that it is just that the wicked should
be punished. They are constantly making laws, and affixing penalties to
them, and executing them, under the belief that it is right. Can they
regard it as wrong in God to do the same thing? Can that be wrong in him
which is right in themselves?

\(3\) if it is right to punish wickedness here, it is not wrong to
punish it in the future world. There is nothing in the two places which
can change the nature of what is done. If it is right for God to visit
the sinner here with the tokens of his displeasure, there is nothing
which can make it wrong to visit him in like manner in the future world.
Why should that be wrong in another world which is right and proper in
this?

\(4\) it will be a righteous thing for God to punish the wicked in a
future state, for they are not always punished here as they deserve. No
one can seriously maintain that there is an equal distribution of
rewards and punishments on the earth. Many a man goes to the grave
having received no adequate punishment for his crimes. Many a murderer,
pirate, robber, traitor, and plunderer of nations under the name of a
conqueror, thus dies. No one can doubt that it would be a just thing to
punish them here if they could be arrested. Why should it be any the
less "just" to punish them when they enter another world? In like
manner, many a man lives a life of profligacy; or is an open scoffer; or
aims to cast off the government of God; or is a seducer of innocence;
and yet lives in the midst of wealth, and goes down in calmness and
peace to the grave; [Psa 73:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md); [Job
21:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md). Why is it not just that such
an one should be punished in the future world? compare [Psa
73:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md). But, if it is right that God
should punish the wicked in the future world, it will be done. Because:

\(1\) There is nothing to hinder him from doing it. He has all power,
and has all necessary means of inflicting punishment, entirely at his
disposal.

\(2\) it would not be right not to do it. It is not right for a
magistrate to treat the righteous and the wicked alike, or to show that
he has as much regard to the one as to the other.

\(3\) it cannot be believed that God has uttered a threatening which he
never meant to execute, or to appear before the universe as having held
up before men the terror of the most awful punishment which could be
inflicted, but which he never intended to carry into effect. Who could
have confidence in such a Being? Who could know what to believe when he
makes the most solemn declaration?

\(4\) the Judge of all the earth "will do right;" and if it is right to
declare that "the wicked shall be turned into hell," it will not be
wrong to inflict the sentence. And if, on the whole, it is right that
the sinner should be punished, it will be done.

Them that trouble you. - Those who persecute you; see [Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 1:7</span></span>

And to you who are troubled - That is, "it will be a righteous thing for
God to give to you who are persecuted rest in the last day." As it will
be right and proper to punish the wicked, so it will he right to reward
the good. It will not, however, be in precisely the same sense. The
wicked will deserve all that they will suffer, but it cannot be said
that the righteous will deserve the reward which they will receive. It
will be right and proper, because:

\(1\) there is a fitness that they who are the friends of God should be
treated as such, or it is proper that he should show himself to be their
friend; and,

\(2\) because in this life this is not always clearly done. They are
often less prospered, and less happy in their outward circumstances,
than the wicked. There is, therefore, a propriety that in the future
state God should manifest himself as their friend, and show to assembled
worlds that he is not indifferent to character, or that wickedness does
not deserve his smiles, and piety incur his frown. At the same time,
however, it will be owing wholly to his grace that any are ever admitted
to heaven.

Rest - The future happiness of believers is often represented under the
image of rest. It is rest like that of the weary laborer after his day
of toil; rest, like that of the soldier after the hardships of a long
and perilous march; rest, like the calm repose of one who has been
racked with pain; see the notes on [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md). The word "rest" here (ἄνεσις
anesis) means a letting loose, a remission, a relaxation; and hence
composure, quiet; [Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md); [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md).

With us - That is, with Paul, Silas, and Timothy; [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md). It would increase the comfort of
the Thessalonians derived from the anticipation of the future world, to
reflect that they would meet their religious teachers and friends there.
It always augments the anticipated joy of heaven to reflect that we are
to share its blessedness with them. There is no envy among those who
anticipate heaven; there will be none there. They who desire heaven at
all, desire that it may be shared in the highest degree by all who are
dear to them.

When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven - Shall appear; shall
come from heaven; see the notes, [Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md).

With his mighty angels - Margin, "angels of his power." So the Greek.
The sense is, that angels of exalted rank and glory will accompany him;
see the [Th1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md) note; [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md) notes.

[2 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 1:8</span></span>

In flaming fire - This is a circumstance which is not noticed in the
account of his appearing in the parallel place in [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md). The object of the apostle here
seems to be to represent him as coming amidst vivid flashes of
lightning. He is commonly described as coming in clouds, and to that
common description there is here added the image of incessant
lightnings, as if the whole heavens were illuminated with a continued
blaze.

Taking vengeance - Margin, "yielding." Greek, "giving. The word
"vengeance" is used in the sense of punishment, for there cannot be in
God what literally corresponds with the passion of revenge; compare the
notes on [Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).

On them that know not God. - On all who are strangers to him; that is,
who are living in pagan darkness, or who, having heard of him, have no
practical acquaintance with him.

And that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. - Who do not
embrace it, and practice its precepts in their lives; compare the notes
on [Rom 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 1:9</span></span>

Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction; - see the notes on
[Mat 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md), [Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md). The word which is here rendered
"destruction" (ὄλεθρον olethron), is different from that which occurs in
[Mat 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md), and which is there
rendered "punishment" - κόλασις kolasis. The word ὄλεθρον olethron -
"olethron" - occurs only here and in [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md); [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md); [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md); in each of which places it is
rendered destruction. It does not denote annihilation, but is used in
the same sense in which we use the word when we say that a thing is
destroyed. Thus, health is destroyed when it fails; property is
destroyed when it is burned or sunk in the ocean; a limb is destroyed
that is lost in battle; life is destroyed when one dies. In the case
before us, the destruction, whatever it be, is:

\(1\) to be continued forever; and,

\(2\) is to be of the nature of punishment.

The meaning then must be, that the soul is destroyed as to the great
purposes of its being - its enjoyment, dignity, honor, holiness,
happiness. It will not be annihilated, but will live and linger on in
destruction. It seems difficult to conceive how anyone can profess to
hold that this passage is a part of the Word of God, and yet deny the
doctrine of future eternal punishment. It would not be possible to state
that doctrine in clearer language than this. It is never is in clearer
language in any creed or confession of faith, and if it is not true that
the wicked will be punished forever, then it must be admitted that it
would not have been possible to reveal the doctrine in human language!

From the presence of the Lord - That is, a part of their punishment will
consist in being banished from the immediate presence of the Lord. There
is a sense in which God is everywhere present, and in that sense he will
be in the world where the wicked will dwell, to punish them. But the
phrase is also used to denote his more immediate presence; the place
where are the symbols of his majesty and glory; the home of the holy and
the blessed. It is in that sense that the word is used here, and the
idea is, that it will be one of the circumstances contributing to the
deeper woe of the place of punishment, that those who dwell there will
be banished from that holy abode, and will never be permitted to enter
there.

And from the glory of his power - The meaning seems to be, that they
will not be able to endure the manifestation of his power and majesty
when he shall appear, but will be driven away by it into outer darkness;
see [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). The Saviour, in
describing his second coming, uses this language: "They shall see the
Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;"
[Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md). There will be a great
exhibition of both. The power will be seen in the convulsions of nature
which will precede or attend him; in the resurrection of the dead; and
in the bringing of all to judgment: and the glory will be seen in his
own person; the dignity and number of his attendants; and the honor that
shall then be conferred on him as the final Judge of all mankind. By the
manifestation of that power and glory the wicked will be driven away
into eternal ruin. They will not be able to stand before it, and though,
in common with the righteous, they may see the majesty of the Redeemer
in the last day, yet they will be driven away to witness it no more.

[2 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 1:10</span></span>

When he shall come to be glorified in his saints - That is, the redeemed
in that day will be the means of promoting his glory, or the universe
will see his glory manifested in their redemption. His chief glory as
seen in that day will be connected with the fact that he has redeemed
his people; and he will come in order that all the appropriate honor of
such a work may then be manifested. He will be "glorified" then by the
numbers that shall have been redeemed; by their patience in the trials
through which they have passed; by the triumphs which religion shall
have made on the earth; by their praises and songs, and by their ascent
with him to the realms of blessedness.

And to be admired in all them that believe - This may either mean that
he will be admired among or by them that believe; or that the ground of
the admiration which he will receive in that day will be what will be
seen in them; that is, their graces, their numbers, their joys, their
triumphs will be the occasion of producing admiration of him - for he
will be regarded as the source of it all. Tyndale renders it: "and to be
made marvelous in all them that believe." The latter interpretation
seems to me to be the correct one. The general idea is, that Christ in
that day will be manifested in a glorious manner, and that the source of
his highest triumphs will be what is seen in the saints. His main honor
when he returns to the world will not be the outward splendors which
will attend his coming, nor the angels that will accompany him, nor the
manifestation of his power over the elements, but the church which he
has redeemed. It will then be seen that he is worthy of universal
admiration, for having redeemed that church. He shall then be admired or
glorified in his people:

\(1\) for having conceived the plan of redeeming them;

\(2\) for being willing to become incarnate and to die to save them;

\(3\) for the defense of his church in all its persecutions and trials;

\(4\) for raising his people from the dead;

\(5\) for the virtues and graces which they will exhibit in that day.

This appropriate honor of Christ in the church has never yet been fully
seen. His people on earth have, in general, most imperfectly reflected
his image. They have in general been comparatively few in number, and
scattered upon the earth. They have been poor and despised. Often they
have been persecuted and regarded as the "filth of the world and the
offscouring of all things." The honors of this world have been withheld
from them. The great have regarded it as no honor to be identified with
the church, and the proud have been ashamed to be enrolled among the
followers of the Lamb. In the last day all this will be changed, and the
assembled church will show to admiring worlds how great and glorious is
it, Redeemer, and how glorious was the work of redemption.

Because our testimony among you was believed. - The meaning of this
seems to be, that they would be among the number of those who would in
that day honor the Saviour, because they had embraced what the apostle
had preached to them respecting these future scenes. Thus interpreted,
this clause should be regarded as connected with [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md). "And to you it is a righteous
thing that he should give rest with us, because our testimony among you
was believed," That is, you have shown that you are true Christians, and
it is proper that you should partake of the triumphs and hopes of that
day.

[2 Thessalonians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 1:11</span></span>

Wherefore also we pray always for you - See the notes, [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md).

That our God would count you worthy of this calling. - Margin, "or,
vouchsafe." The meaning is, "that he would regard you as worthy of this
calling;" see the notes on ver. 5. Of this calling; see the notes, [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md). The "calling" here, is that which
had brought them into the kingdom, and led them to become Christians.

And fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness. - That is, make the
work of salvation complete and effectual. Oldshausen has well expressed
the sense: "May God fill you with all that good which is pleasing to
him." The thoughts in the passage are:

\(1\) that the purpose toward them on the part of God was one of
"goodness" or benevolence;

\(2\) that there was a state of mind which would be regarded by him as
pleasing, or as his "good pleasure;" and,

\(3\) that Paul wished that this might be accomplished in them. He
desired that there might be in them everything which would be pleasing
to God, and which his benevolence was fitted to secure.

And the work of faith - The work which faith is adapted to produce on
the soul; see [Jo1 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md).

With power - Effectually, completely. The apostle prays that so much
power may be exerted as will be sufficient to secure the object. The
work of religion on the soul is always represented in the Bible as one
of power.

[2 Thessalonians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 1:12</span></span>

That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ - That is, that the Lord Jesus
himself may be honored among you; the name often denoting the person.
The idea is that the apostle wished that the Lord Jesus might be honored
among them by the fair application and development of the principles of
his religion.

And ye in him - That you may be regarded and treated as his friends when
he shall come to judge the world.

According to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ - That is,
that you may experience all the honor which his grace is fitted to
impart.

In view of the exposition given of this chapter, we may remark:

\(1\) That the wicked will certainly be punished when the Lord Jesus
shall come to judgment. Words cannot reveal this truth more plainly than
is done in this chapter, and if it is not to be so, then language has no
meaning.

\(2\) the punishment of the wicked will be eternal. It is impossible for
language to teach that doctrine more clearly than is done in this
chapter. If it were admitted to have been the intention of God to teach
the doctrine of eternal punishment, it is impossible to conceive that he
could have chosen more plain and positive language to express the
doctrine than has been done here. Can it be, then, that he means to
trifle with people on so solemn a subject, by using words which have no
meaning?

\(3\) it will greatly aggravate the punishment of the wicked that it
will be "a righteous thing" for God thus to punish them. If they were to
suffer as martyrs; if in their sufferings they could feel that they were
oppressed and crushed beneath mere power; if they could feel that they
were right and that God was wrong; if they could get up a party in the
universe against God, sympathizing with them as if they were wronged,
the case would be changed. A man can endure suffering much more easily
when he has a good conscience, and feels that he is right, than he can
when he feels that what he endures is deserved. But the sinner in hell
can never have this consolation. He will forever feel that God is right
and that he is wrong, and that every pang which he endures is deserved.

\(4\) if it be a "righteous thing" that the wicked shall be punished,
then they never can be saved by mere justice. No one will go to heaven
because he deserves or merits it. All dependence on human merit,
therefore, is taken away in the matter of salvation, and if the sinner
is ever saved, it will be by grace, and not by justice.

\(5\) if it is a "righteous thing" that the sinner should perish, he
will perish. God will do right to all.

\(6\) it is amazing that the mass of men have so little concern about
their future condition. God has plainly revealed that he will destroy
the wicked forever, and that it will be a righteous thing for him to do
it; and yet the mass of mankind are wholly unconcerned, and disregard
all the solemn declarations of the Bible on this subject as if they were
idle tales. One would suppose that the very possibility of eternal
suffering would rouse all the sensibilities of the soul, and lead to the
earnest inquiry whether it is not possible to avoid it. Yet the mass of
people feel no concern in this inquiry. It is impossible to ever get
them to think of it. We cannot get them even to ask the question,
seriously, whether they themselves are to be happy or miserable for all
eternity. This stupidity and indifference is the most unaccountable fact
on earth, and probably distinguishes this world from all others.

\(7\) it is rational to think of religion; to reflect on eternity; to be
serious; to be anxious about the future state. If there is even a
possibility that we may be miserable forever, it is proper to be serious
about it. And if there is a solemn declaration of God that it will be a
"righteous thing" for him to punish the wicked, and that he will "punish

the human soul than such solemn declarations of the infinite God?
