### [Numbers Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 11:0</span></span>

This and the following three chapters recount the successive rebellions
of the Israelites after their departure from Sinai; culminating in that
by which they brought upon themselves the sentence of personal exclusion
from the land of promise.

[Numbers 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 11:1</span></span>

See the marginal rendering. They murmured against the privations of the
march.

The fire of the Lord - Probably lightning; compare [Psa
78:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#021.md).

In the uttermost parts - Rather, in the end. The fire did not reach far
into the camp. It was quickly quenched at the intercession of Moses.

[Numbers 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 11:3</span></span>

Taberah - i. e. "burning:" not the name of a station, and accordingly
not found in the list given in Num. 33, but the name of the spot where
the fire broke out. This incident might seem (compare [Num
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034).md) to have occurred at the station
called, from another still more terrible event which shortly followed,
Kibroth-hattaavah.

[Numbers 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 11:4</span></span>

Occurrences at Kibroth-hattavah.

[Num 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004.md)

The mixt multitude - The word in the original resembles our "riff-raff,"
and denotes a mob of people scraped together. It refers here to the
multitude of strangers (see [Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038).md) who had followed the Israelites
from Egypt.

[Num 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005.md)

The natural dainties of Egypt are set forth in this passage with the
fullness and relish which bespeak personal experience.

[Num 11:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006.md)

There is nothing at all ... - literally, "Nought at all have we except
that our eyes are unto this manna;" i. e. "Nought else have we to expect
beside this manna." On the manna see [Exo
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#015.md) note; on bdellium see [Gen
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#012.md) note.

[Num 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#010.md)

The weeping was general; every family wept (compare [Zac
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012).md), and in a manner public and
unconcealed.

[Num 11:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#011.md)

The complaint and remonstrance of Moses may be compared with that in
[Kg1 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md) ff; [Jon
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md), and contrasted with the
language of Abraham ([Gen 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023) ff.md)
The meekness of Moses (compare [Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003).md) sank under vexation into
despair. His language shows us how imperfect and prone to degeneracy are
the best saints on earth.

[Num 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016.md)

Seventy men of the elders of Israel - Seventy elders had also gone up
with Moses to the Lord in the mount [Exo
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md), [Exo
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md). Seventy is accordingly the
number of colleagues assigned to Moses to share his burden with him. To
it, the Jews trace the origin of the Sanhedrim. Subsequent notices [Num
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#025.md); [Jos
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006.md); [Jos
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md), [Jos
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033.md); [Jos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011.md); [Jos
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#002.md); [Jos
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001.md), [Jos
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md) so connect the elders with the
government of Israel as to point to the fact that the appointment now
made was not a merely temporary one, though it would seem to have soon
fallen into desuetude. We find no traces of it in the days of the Judges
and the Kings.

Elders of the people, and officers over them - In English idiom, "elders
and officers of the people." Both elders and officers appear in Egypt
([Exo 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#016.md); [Exo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006) ff.md): the former had headed the
nation in its efforts after freedom; the latter were the subordinate,
though unwilling, agents of Egyptian tyranny. The two classes no doubt
were working together; and from those who belonged to either, perhaps
from those who were both eiders and officers, the council of Seventy was
to be selected.

[Num 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017.md)

I will take of the spirit which is upon thee - Render rather separate
from the spirit, etc.; i. e. they shall have their portion in the same
divine gift which thou hast.

[Num 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025.md)

They prophesied - i. e. under the extraordinary impulse of the Holy
Spirit they uttered forth the praises of God, or declared His will.
Compare the marginal references.

And did not cease - Rather, and added not, i. e. they prophesied at this
time only and not afterward. The sign was granted on the occasion of
their appointment to accredit them in their office; it was not
continued, because their proper function was to be that of governing not
prophesying.

[Num 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#026.md)

Of them that were written - i. e. enrolled among the Seventy. The
expression points to a regular appointment duly recorded and permanent.

[Num 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#029.md)

Enviest thou for my sake? - (Compare [Mar
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038) ff.md) The other members of the
Seventy had been with Moses (compare [Num
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#016.md), [Num
6:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024).md) when the gift of prophecy was
bestowed on them. They received "of the spirit that was upon him," and
exercised their office visibly through and for him. Eldad and Medad
prophesying in the camp seemed to Joshua to be acting independently, and
so establishing a separate center of authority.

[Num 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md)

The southeast wind, which blew from the neighboring Elanitic gulf of the
Red Sea, brought the quails [Exo
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#013.md).

Two cubits high - Better, "two cubits above the face of the ground:" i.
e. the quails, wearied with their long flight, flew about breast high,
and were easily secured by the people, who spread them all abroad for
themselves [Num 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032.md), in order to
salt and dry them. The quail habitually flies with the wind, and low.

[Num 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032.md)

Ten homers - About 55 bushels. Compare [Lev
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016.md).

[Num 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033.md)

Ere it was chewed - Better, ere it was consumed. See [Num
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#019.md). The surfeit in which the
people indulged, as described in [Num
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032.md), disposed them to sickness.
God's wrath, visiting the gluttonous through their gluttony, aggravated
natural consequences into a supernatural visitation.

[Num 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034.md), [Num
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035.md)

(Kibroth-hattaavah has been identified by Palmer with the extensive
remains, graves, etc., at Erweis El Ebeirig, and Hazeroth "enclosures"
with Ain Hadherah.)
