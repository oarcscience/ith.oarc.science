### [Genesis Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

\- Joseph and Ten of His Brethren

1\. שׁבר sheber, "fragment, crumb, hence, grain." בר bar "pure,"
"winnowed," hence, "corn" (grain).

6\. שׁליט shallı̂yṭ, "ruler, governor, hence," Sultan. Not elsewhere
found in the Pentateuch.

25\. כלי kelı̂y, "vessel," here any portable article in which grain may
be conveyed. שׂק śaq, "sack," the very word which remains in our
language to this day. אמתחת 'amtachath "bag."

Twenty years, the period of Joseph's long and anxious waiting, have come
to an end. The dreams of his boyhood are now at length to be fulfilled.
The famine has reached the chosen family, and they look at one another
perplexed and irresolute, not knowing what to do.

[Gen 42:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

The aged Jacob is the only man of counsel. "Behold, I have heard there
is grain in Mizraim:" go down and buy. The ten brothers are sent, and
Benjamin, the youngest, is retained, not merely because of his youth,
for he was now twenty-four years of age, but because he was the son of
his father's old age, the only son of Rachel now with him, and the only
full brother of the lost Joseph. "Lest mischief befall him," and so no
child of Rachel would be left. "Among those that went." The dearth was
widespread in the land of Kenaan.

[Gen 42:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#006.md)

The ten brothers meet with a rough reception from the lord of the land.
"The governor" - the sultan. This, we see, is a title of great antiquity
in Egypt or Arabia. Joseph presided over the cornmarket of the kingdom.
"Bowed down to him with their faces to the earth." Well might Joseph
think of those never-to-be-forgotten dreams in which the sheaves and
stars bowed down to him. "And knew them." How could he fail to remember
the ten full-grown men of his early days, when they came before him with
all their peculiarities of feature, attitude, and mother tongue. "And he
made himself strange unto them." All that we know of Joseph's character
heretofore, and throughout this whole affair, goes to prove that his
object in all his seemingly harsh treatment was to get at their hearts,
to test their affection toward Benjamin, and to bring them to repent of
their unkindness to himself.

"They knew not him." Twenty years make a great change in a youth of
seventeen. And besides, with his beard and head shaven, his Egyptian
attire, his foreign tongue, and his exalted position, who could have
recognized the stripling whom, twenty years ago, they had sold as a
slave? "Spies are ye." This was to put a color of justice on their
detention. To see the nakedness of the land, not its unfortified
frontier, which is a more recent idea, but its present impoverishment
from the famine. "Sons of one man are we." It was not likely that ten
sons of one man would be sent on the hazardous duty of spies. "And
behold the youngest is with our father this day." It is intensely
interesting to Joseph to hear that his father and full brother are still
living. "And one is not." Time has assuaged all their bitter feelings,
both of exasperation against Joseph and of remorse for their unbrotherly
conduct. This little sentence, however, cannot be uttered by them, or
heard by Joseph, without emotion. "By the life of Pharaoh." Joseph
speaks in character, and uses an Egyptian asseveration. "Send one of
you." This proposal is enough to strike terror into their hearts. The
return of one would be a heavy, perhaps a fatal blow to their father.
And how can one brave the perils of the way? They cannot bring
themselves to concur in this plan. Sooner will they all go to prison, as
accordingly they do. Joseph is not without a strong conviction of
incumbent duty in all this. He knows he has been put in the position of
lord over his brethren in the foreordination of God, and he feels bound
to make this authority a reality for their moral good.

[Gen 42:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018.md)

After three days, Joseph reverses the numbers, allowing nine to return
home, and retaining one. "This do and live." Joseph, notwithstanding the
arbitrary power which his office enabled him to exercise, proves himself
to be free from caprice and unnecessary severity. He affords them a fair
opportunity of proving their words true, before putting them to death on
suspicion of espionage. "The God do I fear." A singular sentence from
the lord paramount of Egypt! It implies that the true God was not yet
unknown in Egypt. We have heard the confession of this great truth
already from the lips of Pharaoh [Gen
41:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038.md). But it intimates to the
brothers the astonishing and hopeful fact that the grand vizier serves
the same great Being whom they and their fathers have known and
worshipped; and gives them a plain hint that they will be dealt with
according to the just law of heaven.

"Carry grain for your houses." The governor then is touched with some
feeling for their famishing households. The brothers, though honoring
their aged father as the patriarch of their race, had now their separate
establishments. Twelve households had to be supplied with bread. The
journey to Egypt was not to be undertaken more than once a year if
possible, as the distance from Hebron was upwards of two hundred miles.
Hence, the ten brothers had with them all their available beasts of
burden, with the needful retinue of servants. We need not be surprised
that these are not especially enumerated, as it is the manner of
Scripture to leave the secondary matters to the intelligence and
experience of the reader, unless, as in the case of Abraham's three
hundred and eighteen trained servants, they happen to be of essential
moment in the process of events. "Your youngest brother." Joseph longs
to see his full brother alive, whom he left at home a child of four
summers. "Verily guilty are we concerning our brother."

Their affliction is beginning to bear the fruit of repentance. "Because
we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us, and we would not
hear." How vividly is the scene of Joseph's sale here brought before us.
It now appears that he besought them to spare him, and they would not
hear! "This distress." Retribution has come at last. "His blood is
required." Reuben justly upbraids them with their hardness of heart.
Their brother's blood is required; for murder was intended, and when he
was sold his death was pretended. "The interpreter was betwixt them."
The dragoman was employed in holding conversation with them. But Joseph
heard the spontaneous expressions of remorse, coming unprompted from
their lips. The fountain of affection is deeply stirred. He cannot
repress the rising tear. He has to retire for a time to recover his
composure. He now takes, not Reuben, who was not to blame, but Simon,
the next oldest, and binds him before them: a speaking act. He then
gives orders to supply them with corn (grain), deposit their money in
their sacks without their knowledge, and furnish them with provision for
the way. Joseph feels, perhaps, that he cannot take money from his
father. He will pay for the corn out of his own funds. But he cannot
openly return the money to his brothers without more explanation than he
wishes at present to give.

[Gen 42:26-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#026.md)

The nine brothers return home and record their wonderful adventure. "In
the inn;" the lodge or place where they stopped for the night. This
place was not yet perhaps provided with even the shelter of a roof. It
was merely the usual place of halting. They would probably occupy six or
seven days on the journey. Apparently at the first stage one opened his
sack to give provender to his ass. The discovery of the silver in its
mouth strikes them with terror. In a strange land and with an uneasy
conscience they are easily alarmed. It was not convenient or necessary
to open all the bags on the way, and so they make no further discovery.

[Gen 42:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#035.md)

Upon emptying the other sacks all the silver turns up, to their great
amazement and consternation. Jacob laments the loss of his son. Reuben
offers two of his sons to Jacob as pledges for Benjamin, to be slain if
he did not bring him back in safety. The sorrowing parent cannot yet
bring himself to consent to Benjamin's departure on this hazardous
journey. "And ye shall bring down." Jacob either speaks here in the
querulous tone of afflicted old age, or he had come to know or suspect
that his brothers had some hand in the disappearance of Joseph.
