### [Psalms Chapter 146](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 146:0</span></span>

This psalm is without a title, and it is impossible to ascertain by
whom, or on what occasion, it was composed. In the Septuagint and the
Latin Vulgate, the title is, "Hallelujah. Of Haggai and Zechariah." But
this is without authority, and it is not known how it came to be
prefixed. The same title occurs in the Arabic Version. The Syriac
Version has the title still more in full: "Spoken by Haggai and
Zechariah the prophets, who ascended from the captivity at Babylon,
concerning the morning ministration of the priests;" that is, to be used
in their morning services. The tradition, therefore, would seem to be
that this is a composition of those prophets. That it may have belonged
to the times of Haggai and Zechariah is certainly possible, nor is there
anything in the psalm inconsistent with that supposition, though there
is no positive evidence that it is so. In this portion of the Psalms Ps.
146-150 all begin and end in the same manner, with a Hallelujah; they
all belong to one group, and seem to pertain to the same occasion; and
it is not inprobable that they constitute a series of psalms intended to
commemorate the completion of the walls of Jerusalem, and the finishing
of the temple. They would be eminently appropriate to such an event.

This psalm is a general psalm of praise which might be used at any time,
containing thoughts such as are appropriately suggested by a
contemplation of the character of God, and his dealings with people. The
idea is that of the blessedness of trusting in God; the security of
those who do it; the superiority of this confidence and peace over any
which is reposed in princes; and the evidence that it will be safe to
trust in him, furnished by his merciful interpositions in behalf of the
oppressed, the hungry, the prisoner, the blind, the bowed down, the
righteous, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. The psalm, then,
has these parts:

I. An expression of a purpose to praise God; or, God as an object of
praise, [Psa 146:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md).

II\. Reliance is not to be put in man, even in princes, since all are
mortal, [Psa 146:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md).

III\. God is the only Being on whom we can rely, [Psa
146:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md).

\(1\) the happiness of that reliance, [Psa
146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md).

\(2\) reasons for such reliance, [Psa
146:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md). He is the Creator of all
things; he keeps truth; he executes judgment for the oppressed; he shows
his kindness toward the hungry, the prisoner, the blind, the bowed down,
the righteous, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.

IV\. God will reign for ever, and he is the God of Zion. His people,
therefore, should praise him, [Psa
146:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 146:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 146:1</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - "Ye" - all people. Margin, Hallelujah. See [Psa
104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035.md); [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md).

Praise the Lord, O my soul - See [Psa
103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001.md), note; [Psa
104:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md), note.

[Psalms 146:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 146:2</span></span>

While I live will I praise the Lord ... - See the notes at [Psa
104:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#033.md), where the same language occurs
substantially as in this verse: "I will sing unto the Lord as long as I
live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being." The idea is,
not merely that he would praise him during this life - short and
fleeting as it is - but that as long as he had an existence - in the
future world - forever he would praise him.

Through every period of my life

Thy goodness I'll pursue;

And after death, in distant worlds,

The glorious theme renew.

Through all eternity to Thee

A joyful song I'll raise;

But, oh! eternity's too short

To utter all thy praise."

\- Addison

[Psalms 146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 146:3</span></span>

Put not your trust in princes - Rely on God rather than on man, however
exalted he may be. There is a work of protection and salvation which no
man, however exalted he may be, can perform for you; a work which God
alone, who is the Maker of all things, and who never dies, can
accomplish. See the notes at [Psa
118:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md). Compare also the notes at
[Isa 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md) : "Cease ye from man, whose
breath is in his nostrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?"

Nor in the son of man - Any son of man; any human being, no matter what
his rank or power. The phrase is often used to denote man. See the notes
at [Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md). The appellation "Son of
man" was often applied by the Saviour to himself to express emphatically
the idea that he was a man - that he had a human nature; that he was
identified with the race; that he was a brother, a fellow-sufferer, a
friend of man: that he was not a cold and abstract being so exalted that
he could not feel or weep over the sins and woes of a fallen and
suffering world. The language here, however, it is scarcely necessary to
say, does not refer to him. It is right to put our trust in him; we have
no other trust.

In whom there is no help - Margin, salvation. So the Hebrew. The idea
is, that man cannot save us. He cannot save himself; he cannot save
others.

[Psalms 146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 146:4</span></span>

His breath goeth forth - He dies like other people, no matter how
exalted he is. See the notes at [Isa
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md).

He returneth to his earth - See the notes at [Psa
90:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#003.md). The earth - the dust - is "his"
-

\(a\) It is his, as that from which he was made: he turns back to what
he was. [Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019.md) : "dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return."

\(b\) The earth - the dust - the grave is his, as it is his home - the
place where he will abide.

\(c\) It is his, as it is the only property which he has in reversion.
All that a man - a prince, a nobleman, a monarch, a millionaire - will
soon have will be his grave - his few feet of earth. That will be his by
right of possession; by the fact that, for the time being, he will
occupy it, and not another man. But that, too, may soon become another
man's grave, so that even there he is a tenant only for a time; he has
no permanent possession even of a grave. How poor is the richest man!

In that very day - The very day - the moment - that he dies.

His thoughts perish - His purposes; his schemes; his plans; his purposes
of conquest and ambition; his schemes for becoming rich or great; his
plans of building a house, and laying out his grounds, and enjoying
life; his design of making a book, or taking a journey, or giving
himself to ease and pleasure. [Luk
12:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md) : "and I will say to my soul,
Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,
drink, and be merry; but God said unto him, Thou fool! this night thy
soul shall be required of time." Such are all the purposes of men!

[Psalms 146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 146:5</span></span>

Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help - Who may rely for
protection on the God who defended Jacob in his travels and dangers. Or,
perhaps the word Jacob is used here collectively to denote Israel - the
Jewish people: the God whom they adore and worship, rather than the gods
of the pagan. Compare [Psa 144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md),
note; [Psa 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004.md), note.

Whose hope is in the Lord his God - In Yahweh, worshipped as his God.
That is, who truly worships Yahweh, or makes Yahweh his God.

[Psalms 146:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 146:6</span></span>

Which made heaven and earth ... - Who is the true God, the Creator of
all things. Happy is he who can address the God who called all this
wondrous universe into being, and who sustains all by his power, as his
God.

Which keepeth truth for ever - Who is always true to his promises. In
this verse there are two reasons given why the lot of the people of God
would be a happy one:

\(1\) That Yahweh is the true God, the Creator of all things, and,
therefore, able to protect and provide for them.

\(2\) That he is faithful, and may always be relied on.

Idol-gods have no power, and every reliance placed on them is a vain
reliance; people are often false and cannot be trusted, but Yahweh has
infinite power, and every promise that he makes will be fulfilled; all
that he says is eternally and unchangeably true. The reasons for
trusting in him, or the reasons why they who trust in him are "happy,"
are further stated in the following verses.

[Psalms 146:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 146:7</span></span>

Which executeth judgment for the oppressed - This is the third reason
why the lot of those is a happy one who trust in God. It is because he
has power to pronounce and execute a right judgment or sentence in
regard to the oppressed and the wronged, and because it is
characteristic of his nature that he does thus execute judgment. See the
notes at [Psa 103:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#006.md) : "The Lord
executeth right. eousness and judgment for all that are oppressed."

Which giveth food to the hungry - See the notes at [Psa
107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md) : "For he satisfieth the longing
soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness." This is the fourth
reason why they who confide in God are happy. Compare [Luk
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053.md) : "He hath filled the hungry with
good things."

The Lord looseth the prisoners - This is the fifth reason why they who
trust in the Lord are "happy." Compare the notes at [Psa
68:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#006.md) : "He bringeth out those which
are bound with chains." See also the notes at [Psa
107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md) : "Being bound in affliction
and iron." Compare [Job 36:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 146:8</span></span>

The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind - This is the sixth reason for
what is stated as to the blessedness of those who put their trust in the
Lord. The language here would be applicable to bodily or to mental
blindness. Compare the notes at [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md) : "Open thou mine eyes, that I
may behold wondrous things out of thy law." See also the notes at [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md) : "Then the eyes of the blind
shall be opened."

The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down - This is the seventh reason
why they are happy who trust in the Lord. It is that those who are
crushed and bowed down under the weight of care, trouble, and calamity,
are raised up by him, or are sustained and comforted. See the notes at
[Psa 145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md) : "The Lord upholdeth all
that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down."

The Lord loveth the righteous - This is the eighth reason why those who
trust in the Lord are happy. It is a characteristic of God, and a
foundation for praise, that he loves those who obey law; who do that
which is right.

[Psalms 146:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 146:9</span></span>

The Lord preserveth the strangers - He regards them with interest; he
defends and guides them. This is the ninth reason why those who trust in
the Lord are happy. The stranger - away from home and friends; with no
one to feel an interest in him or sympathy for him; with the feeling
that he is forsaken; with no one on whom he can call for sympathy in
distress - may find in God one who will regard his condition; who will
sympathize with him; who is able to protect and befriend him. Compare
[Exo 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#049.md); [Exo
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md); [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009.md); [Lev
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md); [Deu
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016.md); [Deu
10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018.md); [Isa
56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003.md), [Isa
56:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006.md).

He relieveth the fatherless and widow - He is their friend. This is the
tenth reason why those who put their trust in the Lord are happy. It is
that God is the Friend of those who have no earthly protector. See the
notes at [Psa 68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md) : "A father of the
fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation."

But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down - He overturns their
plans; defeats their schemes; makes their purposes accomplish what they
did not intend they should accomplish. The Hebrew word here means to
bend, to curve, to make crooked, to distort; then, to overturn, to turn
upside down. The same word is applied to the conduct of the wicked, in
[Psa 119:78](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#078.md) : "They dealt perversely
with me." The idea here is, that their path is not a straight path; that
God makes it a crooked way; that they are diverted from their design;
that through them he accomplishes purposes which they did not intend;
that he prevents their accomplishing their own designs; and that he will
make their plans subservient to a higher and better purpose than their
own. This is the eleventh reason why those who put their trust in God
are happy. It is that God is worthy of confidence and love, because he
has all the plans of wicked men entirely under his control.

[Psalms 146:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 146:10</span></span>

The Lord shall reign for ever - See the notes at [Psa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016.md) : "The Lord is King forever and
ever" Compare [Exo 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018.md).

Even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations - As long as the world shall
endure. There shall be no change of dynasty as there is in human
governments; but the same King shall reign from age to age.

Praise ye the Lord - Hallelu-jah. The psalm closes as it commences. It
is a call on all persons to unite in the praise of Yahweh.
