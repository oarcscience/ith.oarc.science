### [Joshua Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 17:1</span></span>

Manasseh, as the "first-born," was to receive not only the territory on
the east of Jordan won by the valor of the Machirites, but also a
portion with the other tribes on the west of Jordan, the holy land of
promise strictly so called. Thus, though Ephraim took precedence of
Manasseh, according to the prediction of Joseph [Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md), yet Manasseh received "the
double portion" which was the special privilege of the first-born [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 17:2</span></span>

For the rest ... - i. e. for those who were not settled on the east of
Jordan.

[Joshua 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 17:5</span></span>

Ten portions - i. e. five for the five families descended from the male
children of Gilead, and five others for the five daughters of
Zelophehad, who represented the sixth family, the Hepherites.

[Joshua 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 17:7</span></span>

Asher - Not the tribe so called, but a place somewhere toward the
eastern end of the boundary line here drawn: perhaps "Teyasir," on the
road from Sichem to Beth-shean.

[Joshua 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 17:9</span></span>

These cities ... - The text is possibly corrupt. The intention seems to
be to state that the cities lying south of the river, though within the
limits of Manasseh, were in fact made over to Ephraim, and were among
the "separate cities" [Jos 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#009.md). On
the contrary, the north bank of the river, both land and towns, belonged
to Manasseh exclusively.

[Joshua 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 17:10</span></span>

Southward - i. e. of the river Kanah.

Render, "they (i. e. the two kindred tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the
northern border being treated here as common to the two) reached unto
Asher." (See the map.) The northern border is only indicated in general
terms, perhaps because the Israelites were not yet completely masters of
this part of the country, and so had not precisely determined it.

[Joshua 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 17:11</span></span>

Perhaps Beth-shean (in Issachar) and the other five towns (in Asher)
were given to the Manassites in compensation for towns in the Manassite
territory allotted to the Ephraimites. (See [Jos
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md). Compare [Jos
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#009)..md) To the wall of Beth-shean, or
Bethshah ("Beisan," about 5 miles west of the Jordan), the bodies of
Saul and his sons were fastened by the Philistines after the battle on
Mount Gilboa. After the exile it received the Greek name of Scythopolis,
perhaps because it was principally tenanted by a rude and pagan
population, styled in contempt Scythians. It was a border city of
Galilee, and the chief town of the Decapolis. In Christian times it was
the see of a bishop, who is enumerated as present at Nicaea and other
Councils of the Church.

Ibleam (Bileam, [Ch1 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070).md), perhaps
"Jelameh," was a Levitical town ([Jos
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025) note.md). Near this place Ahaziah
was mortally wounded by Jehu ([Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md), and fled to Megiddo, which was
no doubt not far distant.

Three countries - Rather "the three hills." The district belonging to
the last-mentioned three towns had a common name, derived no doubt from
its natural features, and was called "the three hills." Compare
Decapolis, Tripolis, etc.

[Joshua 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 17:14</span></span>

Seeing I am a great people - The assertion can hardly have been
warranted by facts, for at the census Num. 26 the two tribes of Manasseh
and Ephraim together were not greatly more numerous than the single
tribe of Judah; and now that half the Manassites were provided for on
the eastern side of Jordan, the remaining children of Joseph could
hardly be stronger than the Danites or the Issacharites. The children of
Joseph seem therefore to exhibit here that arrogant and jealous spirit
which elsewhere characterises their conduct ([Jdg
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md); [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md); [Sa2
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041.md); [Ch2
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#007) etc..md). A glance at the map shows
that their complaint was in itself unreasonable. Their territory, which
measured about 55 miles by 70 miles, was at least as large in proportion
to their numbers as that of any other tribe, and moreover comprehended
some of the most fertile of the whole promised land.

[Joshua 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 17:15</span></span>

Joshua was himself of the tribe of Ephraim, but far from supporting the
demands of his kinsmen he reproves them, and calls upon them to make
good their great words by corresponding deeds of valor. He bids them
clear the country of its woods and thus make room for settling their
people. The "wood country" means probably the range which runs along the
northern border of Manasseh, and which connects the mountains of Gilboa
with Carmel. Mount Ephraim, (a name perhaps used by anticipation) called
"the hill" [Jos 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md), and "the
mountain of Israel" [Jos 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016.md), is the
eastern portion of the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh extending
toward the Jordan. This was a hilly, though by no means barren,
district.

[Joshua 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 17:16</span></span>

The possession by the Canaanites of chariots strengthened and tipped
with iron, such as were used by the Egyptians [Exo
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md), is named here by the children of
Joseph as a reason why they could not possess themselves of the plains.
"The valley of Jezreel" is the broad low valley which sweeps from
"Zerin" between the mountains of Gilboa and the range of little Hermon
eastward down to the Jordan. It was most likely in this valley that the
host of the Midianites was encamped, when attacked by Gideon [Jdg
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md), [Jdg
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008.md). The great plain of Jezreel,
called the plain of Esdraelon (Esdrelom, Judith 1:8), extends from
Carmel on the west to the hills of Gilboa, little Hermon, and Tabor on
the east, a distance of full sixteen miles; and its breadth between the
rocky mass of southern Palestine and the bolder mountains of Galilee on
the north, is about twelve miles. Its position as well as its open area
make it the natural battlefield of Palestine.

[Joshua 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 17:17</span></span>

Thou shalt not have one lot only - i. e. by dispossessing the
Canaanites, thou shalt double the portion of land at thy disposal. The
"but" with which the King James Version begins [Jos
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md) should be "for."
