### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 15:2</span></span>

The vine ... - The image is grounded on a well-known figure [Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md); Isa. 5. The comparison is not
between the vine and other trees, but between the wood of the vine and
the wood of other trees.

[Ezekiel 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 15:4</span></span>

Behold, it is cast into the fire - The wood is in itself useless for any
purpose; but what if it have been cast into the fire, and half burned,
what of it then?

[Ezekiel 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 15:7</span></span>

They shall go out ... - Rather, they have gone forth from the fire, and
the fire shall devour them. The condition of the people is here
depicted. The people of Israel - as a whole and as separate kingdoms -
had become worthless. The branch torn from the living stem had truly
been cast into the fire, which had devoured both ends of it; what
remained was a brand plucked from the burning. Those who had escaped the
general calamity were reserved for a like fate. Compare [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md).
