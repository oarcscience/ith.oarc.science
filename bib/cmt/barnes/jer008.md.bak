### [Jeremiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 8:1</span></span>

Not the living only but the dead shall be exposed to the ruthless
violence of the enemy, who will ransack the graves of the wealthier
classes.

[Jeremiah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 8:2</span></span>

Loved ... served ... walked ... sought ... worshipped - There is great
force in the piled-up verbs by which their worship of the heavenly
bodies is described. The prophet beginning with the heart's "love"
describes that worship) in the various stages of its development, and
then contrasts its fulness with the miserable reward which ensues.

[Jeremiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 8:3</span></span>

This evil family - The whole Jewish race.

Which remain - The words are omitted by the Septuagint and Syriac
versions.

[Jeremiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 8:4</span></span>

The prophet here resumes from [Jer
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md) the main subject of his prophecy.
He again invites the Jews to repentance.

Shall they fall? - The argument is that when men fall, they do not lie
upon the ground, but endeavor to get up again: and when a man loses his
way, he does not persist in going on, but turns round, and retraces his
steps. Israel then will be only following the dictates of comnon sense
in desisting from that which she now knows to be her ruin.

[Jeremiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 8:5</span></span>

When men act as in [Jer 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004.md), why is
God's own people alone an exception?

Slidden back ... backsliding - The same words as "turn" and "return" in
[Jer 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004.md). They should be rendered,
"Why doth this people of Jerusalem turn away with a perpetual turning?"

Deceit - i. e., idolatry; because men worship in it that which is false,
and it is false to the worshippers.

Refuse - From a feeling of dislike.

[Jeremiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 8:6</span></span>

I hearkened and heard - God, before passing sentence, carefully listens
to the words of the people. Compare [Gen
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#005.md), where the divine judgment is
preceded by the Almighty going down to see the tower.

Not aright - Or, "not-right;" which in the Hebrew idiom means that which
is utterly wrong.

No man repented - The original phrase is very striking: No "man had pity
upon his own wickedness." If men understood the true nature of sin, the
sinner would repent out of very pity upon himself.

As the horse rusheth - literally, "overfloweth." It is a double
metaphor; first, the persistence of the people in sin is compared to the
fury which at the sound of the trumpet seizes upon the war-horse; and
then its rush into the battle is likened to the overflowing of a
torrent, which nothing can stop in its destructive course.

[Jeremiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 8:7</span></span>

Jeremiah appeals to the obedience which migratory birds render to the
law of their natures. The "stork" arrives in Palestine about March 21,
and after a six weeks' halt departs for the north of Europe. It takes
its flight by day, at a vast height in the air ("in the heaven"). The
appearance of the "turtle-dove" is one of the pleasant signs of the
approach of spring.

The crane and the swallow - Rather, "the swift and the crane."

[Jeremiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 8:8</span></span>

The law of the Lord - The "Torah," or written law, the possession of
which made the priests and prophets so boastfully exclaim, "We are
wise."

Lo, certainly ... - Rather, Verily, lo! the lying pen "of the scribes"
hath made it - the Law - into a lie. The mention of "scribes" in this
place is a crucial point in the argument whether or not the Pentateuch
or Torah is the old law-book of the Jews, or a fabrication which
gradually grew up, but was not received as authoritative until after the
return from the captivity. It is not until the time of Josiah [Ch2
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#013.md) that "scribes" are mentioned
except as political officers; here, however, they are students of the
Torah. The Torah must have existed in writing before there could have
been an order of men whose special business it was to study it; and
therefore to explain this verse by saying that perhaps the scribes were
writers of false prophecies written in imitation of the true, is to lose
the whole gist of the passage. What the scribes turned into a lie was
that Law of which they had just boasted that they were the possessors.
Moreover, the scribes undeniably became possessed of preponderating
influence during the exile: and on the return from Babylon were powerful
enough to prevent the restoration of the kingly office. That there
should be along with the priests and Levites men who devoted themselves
to the study of the written Law, and who in the time of Josiah had
acquired such influence as to be recognized as a distinct class - is
just what we should expect from the rapid progress of learning, which
began with Elisha's active management of the schools of the prophets,
and culminated in the days of Hezekiah. Jeremiah's whole argument
depends upon the fact that there were in his days men who claimed to be
"wise" or "learned" men because of their study of the Pentateuch, and is
entirely inconsistent with the assumptions that Jeremiah wrote the book
of Deuteronomy, and that Ezra wrote parts of Exodus and the whole of
Leviticus.

[Jeremiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 8:9</span></span>

They have rejected the word of the Lord - It became in the hands of the
Soferim or scribes a mere code of ceremonial observance. Compare [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013.md).

[Jeremiah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 8:10</span></span>

These verses are almost identical with [Jer
6:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012.md).

[Jer 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010.md)

To them that shall inherit them - Rather, "to those that shall take
possession of them, i. e., "to conquerors who shall take them by force.

[Jeremiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 8:13</span></span>

Or, "I will gather and sweep them away, saith Jehovah: there are no
grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry:
therefore will I appoint those that shall pass over them." Judah is a
vine which bears no fruit: a tree which makes even no profession of
life, for her leaf is dry. Many explain the last words of an army
sweeping over the land like a flood.

[Jeremiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 8:14</span></span>

The people rouse one another to exertion. "Why," they ask, "do we remain
here to be overwhelmed?" They are ready now to follow the command given
(see the marginal reference), but with the conviction that all hope is
over.

Let us be silent there - Rather, let us perish there, literally "be put
to silence."

Water of gall - i. e., poison. The word rendered "gall" was probably the
belladonna, or night-shade, to the "berries" of which the grapes of
Israel were compared.

[Jeremiah 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 8:15</span></span>

Health ... trouble - Or, "rest ... terror."

[Jeremiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 8:16</span></span>

Dan - i. e. the northern boundary of the land.

His strong ones - i. e., "his war-horses."

[Jeremiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 8:17</span></span>

I will send - Or, am sending. No prophet changes his metaphors so
suddenly as Jeremiah. The invading army is now compared to snakes, whom
no charming can soothe, and whose bite is fatal. Compare [Num
21:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#005.md).

Cockatrices - "Vipers." See [Isa 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008.md)
note.

[Jeremiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 8:18</span></span>

Rather, "O my comfort in sorrow: my heart faints for me." The word
translated "comfort" is by some supposed to be corrupt. With these
mournful ejaculations a new strophe begins, ending with [Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md), in which the prophet mourns over
the miserable fate of his countrymen, among whom he had been earnestly
laboring, but all in vain.

[Jeremiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 8:19</span></span>

Or, "Behold the voice of the cry for help of the daughter of my people
from a distant land: Is not Yahweh in Zion? Is not her king there? Why
have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images, with foreign
vanities?" Their complaint, "Is there no Jehovah in Zion?" is met by God
demanding of them the reason why instead of worshipping Him they have
set up idols.

[Jeremiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 8:20</span></span>

The summer - Rather, the fruit-gathering, which follows the
grain-harvest. The grain has failed; the fruit-gathering has also proved
unproductive; so despair seized the people when they saw opportunities
for their deliverance again and again pass by, until God seemed utterly
to have forgotten them.

[Jeremiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 8:21</span></span>

For the hurt ... hurt - literally, "Because of the breaking ... broken."
These are the words of the prophet, whose heart is crushed by the cry of
his countrymen.

I am black - Or, I go mourning.

[Jeremiah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 8:22</span></span>

No physician there - i. e., in Gilead. Balm used to grow in Israel for
the healing of the nations. Her priests and prophets were the
physicians. Has Israel then no balm for herself? Is there no physician
in her who can bind up her wound? Gilead was to Israel what Israel
spiritually was to the whole world.

Why then is not the health ... recovered? - Or, "why then has no
bandage," or plaster of balsam, "been laid upon my people?"
