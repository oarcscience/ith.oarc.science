### [Isaiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 25:0</span></span>

For the general design and scope of this chapter, see the Analysis to
Isa. 24. It is a song of praise to God for the anticipated deliverance
of his people from the bondage in Babylon. The desolation of Jerusalem
and Judah had been described in Isa. 24; that chapter had closed with an
intimation that Yahweh would again reign in glory on Mount Zion [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md); and in view of this future
deliverance the prophet breaks out into this beautiful song of praise.
It was not unusual for the prophets to express, by anticipation, such
songs of praise as would be celebrated by the people in times of signal
deliverance (see the notes at [Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md) This song of praise is one of
the most beautiful that is to be found in the writings of Isaiah. The
essential idea is that which was hinted at in [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md), that Yahweh would reign with a
glory that would obscure the brightness of the sun and the moon on Mount
Zion. Filled with the idea, the prophet fixes the eye on those future
glories, and declares what shall occur under that reign. He sees Yahweh
reigning there for a long series of years; and during that reign he sees
[Isa 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md) that he would provide a way
by which the darkness might be removed from all nations [Isa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007.md); that he would originate that
plan by which death would be swallowed up in victory [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md); and that there he would execute
a plan by which all his enemies would be laid low [Isa
25:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md). The hymn is designed,
therefore, to celebrate the faithfulness of God in fulfilling his
ancient promises, and delivering his people from their long captivity by
the destruction of Babylon [Isa
25:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md); and the future glories that
would shine forth under the reign of Yahweh on Mount Zion, including the
arrangements of redeeming mercy for the world.

[Isaiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 25:1</span></span>

O Lord, thou art my God - The prophet speaks, not in his own name, but
in the name of the people that would be delivered from bondage. The
sense is, that Yahweh had manifested himself as their covenant-keeping
God; and that in view of his faithfulness in keeping his promises, they
now had demonstration that he was their God.

I will exalt thee - A form of expression often used to denote praise
[Psa 118:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#028.md); [Psa
145:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md), meaning that the worshipper
would exalt God in the view of his own mind, or would regard him as
above all other beings and objects.

For thou hast done wonderful things - On the meaning of the Hebrew, פלא
pel' - 'wonderful,' see the note at [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md).

Thy counsels of old - Which were formed and revealed long since. The
counsels referred to are those respecting the delivery of his people
from bondage, which had been expressed even long before their captivity
commenced, and which would be now completely and triumphantly fulfilled.

Are faithfulness - Have been brought to pass; do not fail.

And truth - Hebrew, אמן 'omen - whence our word Amen. Septuagint,
Γένοιτο Genoito - 'Let it be.' The word denotes that the purposes of God
were firm, and would certainly be fulfilled.

[Isaiah 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 25:2</span></span>

For thou hast made - This is supposed to be uttered by the Jews who
should return from Babylon, and therefore refers to what would have been
seen by them. In their time it would have occurred that God had made of
the city an heap.

Of a city - I suppose the whole scope of the passage requires us to
understand this of Babylon. There has been, however, a great variety of
interpretation of this passage. Grotius supposed that Samaria was
intended. Calvin that the word is used collectively, and that various
cities are intended. Piscator that Rome, the seat of antichrist, was
intended. Jerome says that the Jews generally understand it of Rome.
Aben Ezra and Kimchi, however, understand it to refer to many cities
which they say will be destroyed in the times of Gog and Magog. Nearly
all these opinions may be seen subjected to an examination, and shown to
be unfounded, in Vitringa.

An heap - It is reduced to ruins (see the notes at Isa. 13; 14) The ruin
of Babylon commenced when it was taken by Cyrus, and the Jews were set
at liberty; it was not completed until many centuries after. The form of
the Hebrew here is, 'Thou hast placed from a city to a ruin:' that is,
thou hast changed it from being a city to a pile of ruins.

Of a defensed city - A city fortified, and made strong against the
approach of an enemy. How true this was of Babylon may be seen in the
description prefixed to Isa. 13.

A palace - This word properly signifies the residence of a prince or
monarch [Jer 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md); [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md), [Amo
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#007.md), [Amo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md), [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md). Here it is applied to Babylon on
account of its splendor, as if it were a vast palace, the residence of
princes.

Of strangers - Foreigners; a term often given to the inhabitants of
foreign lands, and especially to the Babylonians (see the note at [Isa
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md); compare [Eze
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007.md); [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017).md). It means that this was, by way
of eminence, The city of the foreigners; the capital of the whole Pagan
world; the city where foreigners congregated and dwelt.

It shall never be built - (See the notes at [Isa
13:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019).md)

[Isaiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 25:3</span></span>

The strong people - The reference here is not probably to the
Babylonians, but to the surrounding nations. The deliverance of the
Jews, and the destruction of Babylon, would be such striking events that
they would lead the surrounding nations to acknowledge that it was the
hand of God.

The city of the terrible nations - The word 'city' here is taken
probably in a collective sense, to denote the cities or the strong
places of the surrounding nations which would be brought thus to tremble
before God. The destruction of a city so proud and wicked as Babylon
would alarm them, and would lead them to fear that they might share the
same fate, especially as many of them had been associated in oppressing
the now delivered people of the land of Judea.

[Isaiah 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 25:4</span></span>

For thou hast been a strength to the poor - Thou hast sustained and
upheld them in their trials, and hast delivered them. God is often
spoken of as the strength of his people. [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md) : 'In the Lord Yahweh is
everlasting strength.' [Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md) :
'The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?' [Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md); [Psa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011.md); [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002.md); [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md); [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md). By the 'poor' and the 'needy'
here undoubtedly are mean; the captive Jews who had been stripped of
their wealth, and carried from their homes, and confined in Babylon.

A refuge - A place of safety; a retreat; a protection. God is often
spoken of as such a refuge; [Deu 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027.md)
: 'The eternal God is thy refuge.' [Sa2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#003.md); [Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006.md); [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md), [Psa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md), [Psa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011.md); [Psa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md); [Psa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#016).md)

From the storm - This word (זרם zerem) usually denotes a tempest of wind
and rain. Here it is put for calamity and affliction. The figure is
common in all languages.

A shadow from the heat - (See [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md), note; [Isa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003.md), note; compare [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)..md)

When the blast of the terrible ones - Of the fierce, mighty, invading
enemies. When they sweep down all before them as a furious tempest does.

Is as a storm against the wall - For 'wall' here (קיר qiyr), Lowth
proposes to read קוּר qûr, from קרר qârar, to be cold or cool, and
supposes that this means a winters storm. In this interpretation also
Vitringa and Cappellus coincide. But there is no need of supposing an
error in the text. The idea is, probably, that of a fierce driving storm
that would prostrate walls and houses; meaning a violent tempest, and
intending to describe in a striking manner the severity of the
calamities that had come upon the nation.

[Isaiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 25:5</span></span>

Thou shalt bring down the noise - The tumult; the sound which they make
in entering into battle; or the note of triumph, and the sound of
revelry. The phrase may refer either to their shout of exultation over
their vanquished foes; or to the usual sound of revelry; or to the hum
of business in a vast city.

Of strangers - Of foreigners (see the note at [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002).md).

As the heat in a dry place - The parallelism here requires that we
should suppose the phrase 'with the shadow of a cloud' to be supplied in
this hemistich, as it is obscurely expressed in our translation by the
word 'even,' and it would then read thus:

As the beat in a dry place (by the shadow of a cloud),

The noise of the strangers shalt thou humble;

As the heat by the shadow of a cloud,

The exultation of the formidable ones shalt thou bring low.

The idea thus is plain. Heat pours down intensely on the earth, and if
unabated would wither up every green thing, and dry up every stream and
fountain. But a cloud intervenes, and checks the burning rays of the
sun. So the wrath of the 'terrible ones,' the anger of the Babylonians,
raged against the Jews. But the mercy of God interposed. It was like the
intervening of a cloud to shut out the burning rays of the sun. It
stayed the fury of their wrath, "and rendered them impotent to do
injury, just as the intense burning rays of the sun are completely
checked by an interposing cloud.

The branch of the terrible ones - This is a very unhappy translation.
The word זמיר zâmiyr is indeed used to denote a branch, or bough, as
derived from זמר zâmar, "to prune a vine;" but it also has the I sense
of "a song;" a song of praise, or a song of exultation, from a second
signification of זמר zâmar, "to sing; perhaps" from the song with which
the work of the vineyard was usually accompanied. See the verb used in
this sense in [Jdg 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#003.md); [Psa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md); [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md); [Psa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md); and the word which occurs here
(zamir) used in the sense of a song in [Psa
119:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054.md); [Sa2
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md). Here it is undoubtedly used in
the sense of a song, meaning either a shout of victory or of revelry;
and the idea of the prophet is, that this would be brought low by the
destruction of Babylon, and by the return of the captive Jews to their
own land.

[Isaiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 25:6</span></span>

And in this mountain - In mount Zion, that is, in Jerusalem. The
following verses undoubtedly refer to the times of the Messiah. Several
of the expressions used here are quoted in the New Testament, showing
that the reference is to the Messiah, and to the fact that his kingdom
would commence in Jerusalem. and then extend to all people.

Shall the Lord of hosts - (See the note at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)..md)

Make unto all people - Provide for all people. He shall adapt the
provisions of salvation not only to the Jews, but to people everywhere.
This is one of the truths on which Isaiah loved to dwell, and which in
fact constitutes one of the peculiarities of his prophecy. It is one of
the chief glories of the gospel, that it is unto all people. See [Isa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007.md); [Dan
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md); compare [Luk
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010.md) : 'I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be unto all people'

A feast - A feast, or entertainment, was usually observed, as it is now,
on occasion of a great victory, or any other signal success. It is,
therefore, emblematic of an occasion of joy. Here it is used in the
twofold sense of an occasion of joy, and of an abundance of provisions
for the necessities of those who should be entertained. This feast was
to be prepared on mount Zion - in the provision which would be made in
Jerusalem by the Messiah for the spiritual needs of the whole world. The
arrangements for salvation arc often represented under the image of an
ample and rich entertainment (see [Luk
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016.md); [Rev
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019.md); [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md).

Of fat things - Of rich delicacies. Fat things and marrow are often used
as synonymous with a sumptuous entertainment, and are made emblematic Of
the abundant provisions of divine mercy (see [Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md); [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md); [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md) : 'I shall be satisfied with the
fatness of thy house. ')

A feast of wines on the lees - The word which is used here (שׁמרים
shemâriym) is derived from שׁמר shâmar, to keep, preserve, retain, and
is applied usually to the lees or dregs of wine, because they retain the
strength and color of the wine which is left to stand on them. It is
also in this place applied to wine which has been kept on the lees, and
is therefore synonymous with old wine; or wine of a rich color and
flavor. This fact, that the color and strength of wine are retained by
its being suffered to remain without being poured from one vessel into
another, is more fully expressed in [Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md) :

Moab hath been at ease from his youth,

And he hath settled on his lees,

And hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,

Neither hath he gone into captivity;

Therefore his taste remaineth in him,

And his scent is not changed.

Compare [Zep 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md). It is well known
that wines, unless retained for a considerable time on the lees, lose
their flavor and strength, and are much less valuable (compare the notes
at [Joh 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md); notes at [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011).md).

Of fat things full of marrow - Marrow is also an emblem of richness, or
the delicacy of the entertainment [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md).

Of wines on the lees well refined - The word rendered 'well refined'
(מזקקים mezuqqāqiym) is usually applied to the purifying of metals in a
furnace [Ch1 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018.md); [Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004.md); [Job
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001.md). When applied to wine, it denotes
that which has been suffered to remain on the lees until it was entirely
refined and purified by fermentation, and had become perfectly clear.

[Isaiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 25:7</span></span>

And he will destroy - Hebrew, 'He will swallow up,' that is, he will
abolish, remove, or take away.

In this mountain the face of the covering - In mount Zion, or in
Jerusalem. This would be done in Jerusalem, or on the mountains of which
Jerusalem was a part, where the great transactions of the plan of
redemption would be accomplished. The word 'face' here is used as it is
frequently among the Hebrews, where the face of a thing denotes its
aspect. or appearance, and then the thing itself. Thus 'the face of God'
is put for God himself; the 'face of the earth' for the earth itself;
and the 'face of the vail' means the veil itself, or the appearance of
the veil. To cover the head or the face was a common mode of expressing
grief (see [Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md); [Sa2
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md); [Est
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012).md). It is probable that the
expression here is taken from this custom, and the veil over the nations
here is to be understood as expressive of the ignorance, superstition,
crime, and wretchedness that covered the earth.

[Isaiah 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 25:8</span></span>

He will swallow up - This image is probably taken from a whirlpool or
maelstrom in the ocean that absorbs all that comes near it. It is,
therefore, equivalent to saying he will destroy or remove [Isa
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007.md). In this place it means that be
will abolish death; that is, he will cause it to cease from its ravages
and triumphs. This passage is quoted by Paul in his argument respecting
the resurrection of the dead [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md). He does not, however, quote
directly from the Hebrew, or from the Septuagint, but gives the
substance of the passage. His quoting it is sufficient proof that it
refers to the resurrection, and float its primary design is to set forth
the achievements of the gospel - achievements that will be fully
realized only when death shall cease its dominion, and when its reign
shall be forever at an end.

Death - Vitringa supposes that by 'death' here is meant the wars and
calamities with which the nation had been visited, and which would cease
under the Messiah. In this interpretation Rosenmuller concurs. It is
possible that the word may have this meaning in some instances; and it
is possible that the calamities of the Jews may have suggested this to
the prophet, but the primary sense of the word here, I think, is death
in its proper signification, and the reference is to the triumphs of God
through the Messiah in completely abolishing its reign, and introducing
eternal life. This was designed, doubtless, to comfort the hearts of the
Jews, by presenting in a single graphic description the gospel as
adapted to overcome all evils, and even to remove the greatest calamity
under which the race groans - death.

In victory - Hebrew, לנצח lānetsach. Paul, in [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md), has translated this, Εἰς νῖκος
Eis nikos - 'Unto victory.' The word νῖκος nikos (victory) is often the
translation of the word (see [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md); [Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md); Lam: [Lam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#018.md); [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md); [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007).md); though here the Septuagint has
rendered it 'strong (or prevailing) death shall be swallowed up.' The
word may be derived from the Chaldee verb נצח netsach, to conquer,
surpass; and then may denote victory. It often, however, has the sense
of permanency, duration, completness, eternity; and may mean for ever,
and then entirely or completely. This sense is not materially different
from that of Paul, 'unto victory.' Death shall be completely,
permanently, destroyed; that is, a complete victory shall be gained over
it. The Syriac unites the two ideas of victory and perpetuity. 'Death
shall be swallowed up in victory forever.' This will take place under
the reign of the Messiah, and shall be completed only in the morning of
the resurrection, when the power of death over the people of God shall
be completely and forever subdued.

Will wipe away tears from off all faces - This is quoted in [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md), as applicable to the gospel. The
sense is, that Yahweh would devise a plan that would be suited to
furnish perfect consolation to the afflicted; to comfort the
broken-hearted; and that would in its final triumphs remove calamity and
sorrow from people forever. The fullness of this plan will be seen only
in heaven. In anticipation of heaven, however, the gospel now does much
to alleviate human woes, and to wipe away tears from the mourner's eyes.
This passage is exquisitely beautiful. The poet Burns once said that he
could never read it without being affected to tears. It may be added
that nothing but the gospel will do this. No other religion can furnish
such consolation; and no other religion is, therefore, adapted to man.

And the rebuke of his people - The reproach; the contempt; the
opposition to them. This refers to some future period when the church
shall be at peace, and when pure religion shall everywhere prevail.
Hitherto the people of God have been scorned and persecuted, but the
time will come when persecution shall cease, the true religion shall
everywhere prevail, the church shall have rest, and its triumphs shall
spread everywhere on the earth.

[Isaiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 25:9</span></span>

And it shall be said in that day - By the people of God. This shall be
the language of exultation and joy which they shall use.

Lo, this is our God - This is the language of those who now see and hail
their Deliverer. It implies that such deliverance, and such mercy could
be bestowed only by God, and that the fact that such mercies had been
bestowed was proof that he was their God.

We have waited for him - Amidst many trials, persecutions, and
calamities, we have looked for the coming of our God to deliver us, and
we will rejoice in the salvation that he brings.

This is the Lord - This is Yahweh. It is Yahweh that has brought this
deliverance. None but he could do it. The plan of redeeming mercy comes
from him, and to him is to be traced all the benefits which it confers
on man.

[Isaiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 25:10</span></span>

For in this mountain - In mount Zion.

Shall the land of the Lord rest - "The hand" in the Scriptures is often
used as the symbol of protection and defense. By the expression that the
hand of Yahweh should REST on mount Zion, is meant probably that be
would be its defender; his protection would not be withdrawn, but would
be permanent there. For an illustration of the phrase, see a similar use
of the word hand as denoting protection, in [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md), [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028.md); [Ezr
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018.md), [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022.md), [Ezr
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md); [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008.md).

And Moab - (For an account of Moab, see the notes at [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md); [Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001)..md) Moab here seems to be used
in a general sense to denote the enemies of God, a and the declaration
that it would be trodden down seems designed to indicate that the foes
of God and his people would all be destroyed (compare the notes at Isa.
34)

Under him - The Chaldee renders this, 'In his own place.' The phrase has
the sense of 'in his place,' in [Exo
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#029.md); [Sa2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023.md). Here it may mean that Moab, or
the enemies of God, would be trodden down and destroyed in their own
land.

As straw is trodden down for the dunghill - As straw is suffered to lie
in the yard where cattle lie, to be trodden down by them for the purpose
of making manure. Lowth renders this,

'As the straw is threshed under the wheels of the car.'

The Septuagint renders it in the same way. Lowth supposes that there has
been an error in transcribing the Hebrew text, and that the former
reading was מדכבה instead of מדמנה. But there is not the slightest
evidence from the MSS that any such mistake has occurred. Nor is it
necessary to suppose it. The image is one that is not of unfrequent
occurrence in the Scriptures, to denote the complete and disgraceful
prostration of an enemy (see [Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010.md); [Kg2
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#037.md); [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Jer
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022.md); [Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004.md); [Jer
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033).md).

[Isaiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 25:11</span></span>

And he shall spread forth his hands - The sense is, that Yahweh would
stretch out his hands everywhere, prostrating his enemies, and the
enemies of his people. Lowth, however, applies this to Moab, and
supposes that it is designed to represent the action of one who is in
danger of sinking, and who, in swimming, stretches out his hands to
sustain himself. In order to this, he supposes that there should be a
slight alteration of a single letter in the Hebrew. His main reason for
suggesting this change is, that he cannot conceive how the act of the
stretch out of the hands of a swimmer can be any illustration of the
action of God in extending his hands ever Moab to destroy it. It must be
admitted that the figure is one that is very unusual. Indeed it does not
anywhere else occur. But it is the obvious meaning of the Hebrew text;
it is so understood in the Vulgate, the Chaldee, the Syriac, and the
figure is one that is net unintelligible. It is that of a swimmer who
extends his hands and arms as far as possible, and who by force removes
all that is in his way in passing through the water. So Yahweh would
extend his hands over all Moab. He would not confine the desolation to
any one place, but it would be complete and entire. He would subject all
to himself, as easily as a swimmer makes his way through the waters.

With the spoils of their hands - The word rendered here 'spoils' ( ארבות
'ârebôth), Lowth renders, 'The sudden gripe.' The Chaldee renders it
substantially in the same manner, 'With the laying on of his hands,'
that is, with all his might. Kimchi also understands it of the gripe of
the hands or the arms. The Septuagint renders it, 'Upon whatsoever he
lays his hands,' that is, God shall humble the pride of Moab in respect
to everything on which he shall lay his hands. The word properly and
usually signifies snares, ambushes, craft; and then, by a natural
metonymy, the plunder or spoils which he had obtained by snares and
ambushes - which seems to be the sense here. It would all perish with
Moab, and the land would thus be completely subdued.

[Isaiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 25:12</span></span>

And the fortress ... - Thy strong defenses shall be destroyed. This is
spoken of Moab (compare the notes at [Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md);[Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md), and is designed to be
emblematic of the enemies of the people of God (compare the notes at
Isa. 34) The repetition of the expressions 'bring down,' 'lay low,' and
'bring to the ground,' is designed to make the sentence emphatic, and to
indicate that it would certainly be accomplished.
