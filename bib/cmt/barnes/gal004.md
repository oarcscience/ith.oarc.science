### [Galatians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md)

[Galatians](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gal 4:0</span></span>

The design of this chapter is, to show the effect of being under the
Law, and the inconsistency of that kind of bondage or servitude with the
freedom which is vouchsafed to the true children of God by the gospel.
It is, in accordance with the whole drift of the Epistle, to recall the
Galatians to just views of the gospel; and to convince them of their
error in returning to the practice of the Mosaic rites and customs. In
the previous chapter he had shown them that believers in the gospel were
the true children of Abraham; that they had been delivered from the
curse of the Law; that the Law was a schoolmaster to lead them to
Christ, and that they were all the children of God. To illustrate this
further, and to show them the true nature of the freedom which they had
as the children of God, is the design of the argument in this chapter.
He therefore states:

\(1\) That it was under the gospel only that they received the full
advantages of freedom; [Gal 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md).
Before Christ came, indeed, there were true children of God, and heirs
of life. But they were in the condition of minors; they had not the
privileges of sons. An heir to a great estate, says the apostle [Gal
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md), is treated substantially as if
he were a servant. He is under tutors and governors: he is not permitted
to enter on his inheritance; he is kept under the restraint of law. So
it was with the people of God under the Law of Moses. They were under
restraints, and were admitted to comparatively few of the privileges of
the children of God. But Christ came to redeem those who were under the
Law, and to place them in the elevated condition of adopted sons; [Gal
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md). They were no longer servants;
and it was as unreasonable that they should conform again to the Mosaic
rites and customs, as it would be for the heir of full age, and who has
entered on his inheritance, to return to the condition of minorship, and
to be placed again under tutors and governors, and to be treated as a
servant.

\(2\) as sons of God, God had sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
their hearts, and they were enabled to cry Abba, Father. They were no
longer servants, but heirs of God, and should avail themselves of the
privileges of heirs; [Gal 4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md).

\(3\) sustaining this relation, and being admitted to these privileges,
the apostle remonstrates with them for returning again to the "weak and
beggarly elements" of the former dispensation - the condition of
servitude to rites and customs in which they were before they embraced
the gospel; [Gal 4:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md). When they
were ignorant of God, they served those who were no gods, and there was
some excuse for that; [Gal 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md). But
now they had known God, they were acquainted with his laws; they were
admitted to the privileges of his children; they were made free, and
there could be no excuse for returning again to the bondage of those who
had no true knowledge of the liberty which the gospel gave. Yet they
observed days and times as though these were binding, and they had never
been freed from them [Gal 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md); and
the apostle says, that he is afraid that his labors bestowed on them, to
make them acquainted with the plan of redemption, had been in vain.

\(4\) to bring them to a just sense of their error, he reminds theta of
their former attachment to him, [Gal
4:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012.md). He had indeed preached to
them amidst much infirmity, and much that was suited to prejudice them
against him [Gal 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md); but they had
disregarded that, and had evinced toward him the highest proofs of
attachment - so, much so, that they had received him as an angel of God
[Gal 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014.md), and had been ready to pluck
out their own eyes to give them to him, [Gal
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015.md). With great force, therefore, he
asks them why they had changed their views toward him so far as to
forsake his doctrines? Had he become their enemy by telling the truth?
[Gal 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016.md). He tenderly addresses them,
therefore, as little children, and says, that he has the deepest
solicitude for their welfare, and the deepest anxiety on account of
their danger - a solicitude which he compares [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md), with the pains of childbirth.

\(5\) in order to enforce the whole subject, and to show the true nature
of the conformity to the Law compared with the liberty of the gospel, he
allegorizes an interesting part of the Mosaic history - the history of
the two children of Abraham; [Gal
4:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md). The condition of Hagar - a
slave - under the command of a master - harshly treated - cast out and
disowned, was an apt illustration of the condition of those who were
under the servitude of the Law. It would strikingly represent Mount
Sinai, and the Law that was promulgated there, and the condition of
those who were under the Law. That, too, was a condition of servitude.
The Law was stern, and showed no mercy. It was like a master of a slave,
and would treat those who were under it with a rigidness that might be
compared with the condition of Hagar and her son; [Gal
4:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md). That same Mount Sinai also
was a fair representation of Jerusalem as it was then - a city full of
rites and ceremonies, where the Law reigned with rigor, where, there was
a burdensome system of religion, and where there was none of the freedom
which the gospel would furnish; [Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md).

On the other hand, the children of the free woman were an apt
illustration of those who were made free from the oppressive ceremonies
of the Law by the gospel; [Gal 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md).
That Jerusalem was free. The new system from heaven was one of liberty
and rejoicing; [Gal 4:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md).
Christians were, like Isaac, the children of promise, and were not
slaves to the Law; [Gal 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md), [Gal
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031.md). And as there was a command [Gal
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030.md) to east out the bondwoman and her
son, so the command now was to reject all that would bring the mind into
ignoble servitude, and prevent its enjoying the full freedom of the
gospel. The whole argument is, that it would be as unreasonable for
those who were Christians to submit again to the Jewish rites and
ceremonies, as it would be for a freeman to sell himself into slavery.
And the design of the whole is, to recall them from the conformity to
Jewish rites and customs, and from their regarding them as now binding
on Christians.

[Galatians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 4:1</span></span>

Now I say - He had before said [Gal
3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md) that while they were under the
Law they were in a state of minority. This sentiment he proceeds further
to illustrate by showing the true condition of one who was a minor.

That the heir - Any heir to an estate, or one who has a prospect of an
inheritance. No matter how great is the estate; no matter how wealthy
his father; no matter to how elevated a rank he may be raised on the
moment that he enters on his inheritance, yet until that time he is in
the condition of a servant.

As long as he is a child - Until he arrives at the age. The word
rendered "child" (νήπιοι nēpioi) properly means an infant; literally,
"one not speaking" (νη nē insep. un, ἔπος epos), and hence, a child or
babe, but without any definite limitation - Robinson. It is used as the
word "infant" is with us in law, to denote "a minor."

Differeth nothing from a servant - That is, he has no more control of
his property; he has it not at his command. This does not mean that he
does not differ in any respect, but only that in the matter under
consideration he does not differ. He differs in his prospects of
inheriting the property, and in the affections of the father, and
usually in the advantages of education, and in the respect and attention
shown him. but in regard to property, he does not differ, and he is like
a servant, under the control and direction of others.

Though he be lord of all - That is, in prospect. He has a prospective
right to all the property, which no one else has. The word "lord" here
(κύριος kurios), is used in the same sense in which it is often in the
Scriptures, to denote master or owner. The idea which this is designed
to illustrate is, that the condition of the Jews before the coming of
the Messiah was inferior in many respects to what the condition of the
friends of God would be under him - as inferior as the condition of an
heir was before he was of age, to what it would be when he should enter
on his inheritance. The Jews claimed, indeed, that they were the
children or the sons of God, a title which the apostle would not
withhold from the pious part of the nation; but it was a condition in
which they had not entered on the full inheritance, and which was far
inferior to that of those who had embraced the Messiah, and who were
admitted to the full privileges of sonship. They were indeed heirs. They
were interested in the promises. But still they were in a condition of
comparative servitude, and could be made free only by the gospel.

[Galatians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 4:2</span></span>

But is under - Is subject to their control and direction.

Tutors - The word tutor with us properly means instructor. But this is
not quite the sense of the original. The word (επίτροπος epitropos);
properly means a steward, manager, agent; [Mat
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008.md); [Luk
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md). As used here, it refers to one -
usually a slave or a freedman - to whose care the boys of a family were
committed, who trained them up, accompanied them to school, or sometimes
instructed them at home; compare the note at [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md). Such a one would have the
control of them.

And governors - This word (οἰκόνομος oikonomos) means a house-manager,
an overseer, a steward. It properly refers to one who had authority over
the slaves or servants of a family, to assign them their tasks and
portions. They generally, also, had the management of the affairs of the
household, and of the accounts. They were commonly slaves, who were
entrusted with this office as a reward for fidelity; though sometimes
free persons were employed; [Luk 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md),
[Luk 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003.md),[Luk
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md). These persons had also charge of
the sons of a family, probably in respect to their pecuniary matters,
and thus differed from those called tutors. It is not necessary,
however, to mark the difference in the words with great accuracy. The
general meaning of the apostle is, that the heir was under government
and restraint.Until the time appointed of the father - The time fixed
for his entering on the inheritance. The time when he chose to give him
his portion of the property. The law with us fixes the age at twenty-one
when a son shall be at liberty to manage for himself. Other countries
have affixed other times. But still, the time when the son shall inherit
the father's property must be fixed by the father himself if he is
living, or may be fixed by his will if he is deceased. The son cannot
claim the property when he comes of age.

[Galatians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 4:3</span></span>

Even so we - We who were Jews - for so I think the word here is to be
limited, and not extended to the pagan, as Bloomfield supposes. The
reasons for limiting it are:

\(1\) That the pagans in no sense sustained such a relation to the Law
and promises of Gad as is here supposed;

\(2\) Such an interpretation would not be pertinent to the design of
Paul. He is stating reasons why there should not be subjection to the
laws of Moses, and his argument is, that that condition was like that of
bondage or minorship.

When we were children - (νήπιοι nēpioi). Minors; see the note at [Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md). The word is not υἱοι huioi,
"sons;" but the idea is, that they were in a state of non-age; and
though heirs, yet were under severe discipline and regimen. They were
under a kind of government that was suited to that state, and not to the
condition of those who had entered on their inheritance.

Were in bondage - In a state of servitude. Treated as servants or
slaves.

Under the elements of the world - Margin, Rudiments. The word rendered
"elements" (sing. στοιχεῖον stoicheion), properly means a row or series;
a little step; a pin or peg, as the gnomen of a dial; and then anything
"elementary," as a sound, a letter. It then denotes the elements or
rudiments of any kind of instruction, and in the New Testament is
applied to the first lessons or principles of religion; [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md). It is applied to the elements or
component parts of the physical world; [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). Here the figure is kept up of
the reference to the infant [Gal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md),
[Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md); and the idea is, that
lessons were taught under the Jewish system adapted to their nonage - to
a state of childhood. They were treated as children under tutors and
governors. The phrase "the elements of the world," occurs also in [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md). In [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md), Paul speaks of these lessons as
"beggarly elements," referring to the same thing as here.

Different opinions have been held as to the reason why the Jewish
institutions are here called "the elements of the world." Rosenmuller
supposes it was because many of those rites were common to the Jews and
to the pagan - as they also had altars, sacrifices, temples, libations,
etc. Doddridge supposes it was because those rites were adapted to the
low conceptions of children, who were most affected with sensible
objects, and have no taste for spiritual and heavenly things. Locke
supposes it was because those institutions led them not beyond this
world, or into the possession and taste of their heavenly inheritance.
It is probable that there is allusion to the Jewish manner of speaking,
so common in the Scriptures, where this world is opposed to the kingdom
of God, and where it is spoken of as transient and worthless compared
with the future glory. The world is fading, unsatisfactory, temporary.
In allusion to this common use of the word, the Jewish institutions are
called the wordly rudiments. It is not that they were in themselves evil
- for that is not true; it is not that they were adapted to foster a
worldly spirit - for that is not true; it is not that they had their
origin from this world - for that is not true; nor is it from the fact
that they resembled the institutions of the pagan world - for that is as
little true; but it is, that, like the things of the world, they were
transient, temporary, and of little value. They were unsatisfactory in
their nature, and were soon to pass away, and to give place to a better
system - as the things of this world are soon to give place to heaven.

[Galatians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 4:4</span></span>

But when the fulness of the time was come - The full time appointed by
the Father; the completion (filling up, πλήρωμα plērōma,) of the
designated period for the coming of the Messiah; see the [Isa
49:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md) notes; [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md) note. The sense is, that the time
which had been predicted, and when it was proper that he should come,
was complete. The exact period had arrived when all things were ready
for his coming. It is often asked why he did not come sooner, and why
mankind did not have the benefit of his incarnation and atonement
immediately after the fall? Why were four thousand dark and gloomy years
allowed to roll on, and the world suffered to sink deeper and deeper in
ignorance and sin? To these questions perhaps no answer entirely
satisfactory can be given. God undoubtedly saw reasons which we cannot;
see, and reasons which we shall approve if they are disclosed to us.

It may be observed, however, that this delay of redemption was in entire
accordance with the whole system of divine arrangements, and with all
the divine interpositions in favor of men. People are suffered long to
pine in want, to suffer from disease, to encounter the evils of
ignorance, before interposition is granted. On all the subjects
connected with human comfort and improvement, the same questions may be
asked as on the subject of redemption. Why was the invention of the art
of printing so long delayed, and people suffered to remain in ignorance?
Why was the discovery of vaccination delayed so long, and millions
suffered to die who might have been saved? Why was not the bark of Peru
sooner known, and why did so many millions die who might have been saved
by its use? So of most of the medicines, and of the arts and inventions
that go to ward off disease, and to promote the intelligence, the
comfort, and the salvation of man. In respect to all of these, it may be
true that they are made known at the very best time, the time that will
on the whole most advance the welfare of the race. And so of the
incarnation and work of the Saviour. It was seen by God to be the best
time, the time when on the whole the race would be most benefited by his
coming. Even with our limited and imperfect vision, we can see the
following things in regard to its being the most fit and proper time.

\(1\) it was just the time when all the prophecies centerd in him, and
when there could be no doubt about their fulfillment. It was important
that such an event should be predicted in order that there might be full
evidence that he came from heaven; and yet in order that prophecy may be
seen to have been uttered by God, it must be so far before the event as
to make it impossible to have been the result of mere human conjecture.

\(2\) it was proper that the world should be brought to see its need of
a Saviour, and that a fair and satisfactory opportunity should be given
to men to try all other schemes of salvation that they might be prepared
to welcome this. This had been done. Four thousand years were sufficient
to show to man his own powers, and to give him an opportunity to devise
some scheme of salvation. The opportunity had been furnished under every
circumstance that could be deemed favorable. The most profound and
splendid talent of the world had been brought to bear on it, especially
in Greece and Rome; and ample Opportunity had been given to make a fair
trial of the various systems of religion devised on national happiness
and individual welfare; their power to meet and arrest crime; to purify
the heart; to promote public morals, and to support man in his trials;
their power to conduct him to the true God, and to give him a
wellfounded hope of immortality. All had failed; and then it was a
proper time for the Son of God to come and to reveal a better system.

\(3\) it was a time when the world was at peace. The temple of Janus,
closed only in times of peace, was then shut, though it had been but
once closed before during the Roman history. What an appropriate time
for the "Prince of Peace" to come! The world was, to a great extent,
under the Roman sceptre. Communications between different parts of the
world were then more rapid and secure than they had been at any former
period, and the gospel could be more easily propagated. Further, the
Jews were scattered in almost all lands, acquainted with the promises,
looking for the Messiah, furnishing facilities to their own countrymen
the apostles to preach the gospel in numerous synagogues, and qualified,
if they embraced the Messiah, to become most zealous and devoted
missionaries. The same language, the Greek, was, moreover, after the
time of Alexander the Great, the common language of no small part of the
world, or at least was spoken and understood among a considerable
portion of the nations of the earth. At no period before had there been
so extensive a use of the same language.

\(4\) it was a proper period to make the new system known. It accorded
with the benevolence of God, that it should be delayed no longer than
that the world should be in a suitable state for receiving the Redeemer.
When that period, therefore, had arrived, God did not delay, but sent
his Son on the great work of the world's redemption.

God sent forth his Son - This implies that the Son of God had an
existence before his incarnation; see [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md). The Saviour is often
represented as sent into the world, and as coming forth from God.

Made of a woman - In human nature; born of a woman, This also implies
that he had another nature than that which was derived from the woman.
On the supposition that he was a mere man, how unmeaning would this
assertion be! How natural to ask, in what other way could he appear than
to be born of a woman? Why was he particularly designated as coming into
the world in this manner? How strange would it sound if it were said,
"In the sixteenth century came Faustus Socinus preaching Unitarianism,
made of a woman!" or, "In the eighteenth century came Dr. Joseph
Priestley, born of a woman, preaching the doctrines of Socinus!" How
else could they appear? would be the natural inquiry. What was there
special in their birth and origin that rendered such language necessary?
The language implies that there were other ways in which the Saviour
might have come; that there was something special in the fact that he
was born of a woman; and that there was some special reason why that
fact should be made prominently a matter of record. The promise was [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md) that the Messiah should be the
"seed" or the descendant of woman; and Paul probably here alludes to the
fulfillment of that promise.

Made under the law - As one of the human race, partaking of human
nature, he was subject to the Law of God. As a man he was hound by its
requirements, and subject to its control. He took his place under the
Law that he might accomplish an important purpose for those who were
under it. He made himself subject to it that he might become one of
them, and secure their redemption.

[Galatians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 4:5</span></span>

To redeem them - By his death as an atoning sacrifice; see the note at
[Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md).

Them that were under the law - Sinners, who had violated the Law, and
who were exposed to its dread penalty.

That we might receive the adoption of sons - Be adopted as the sons or
the children of God; see [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md),
note; [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md), note.

[Galatians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 4:6</span></span>

And because ye are sons - As a consequence of your being adopted into
the family of God, and being regarded as his sons. It follows as a part
of his purpose of adoption that his children shall have the spirit of
the Lord Jesus.

The Spirit of his Son - The spirit of the Lord Jesus; the spirit which
animated him, or which he evinced. The idea is, that as the Lord Jesus
was enabled to approach God with the language of endearment and love, so
they would be. He, being the true and exalted Son of God, had the spirit
appropriate to such a relation; they being adopted, and made like him,
have the same spirit. The "spirit" here referred to does not mean, as I
suppose: the Holy Spirit as such; nor the miraculous endowments of the
Holy Spirit, but the spirit which made them like the Lord Jesus; the
spirit by which they were enabled to approach God as his children, and
use the reverent, and tender, and affectionate language of a child
addressing a father. It is that language used by Christians when they
have evidence of adoption; the expression of the warm, and elevated, and
glowing emotions which they have when they can approach God as their
God, and address him as their Father.

Crying - That is, the spirit thus cries, Πνεῦμα Pneuma - κράζον krazon).
Compare the notes, [Rom 8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). In
[Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md) it is, "wherewith we cry."

Abba, Father - See the note at [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md). It is said in the Babylonian
Gemara, a Jewish work, that it was not permitted slaves to use the title
of Abba in addressing the master of the family to which they belonged.
If so, then the language which Christians are here represented as using
is the language of freemen, and denotes that they are not under the
servitude of sin.

[Galatians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 4:7</span></span>

Wherefore - In consequence of this privilege of addressing God as your
Father.

Thou art no more - You who are Christians.

A servant - In the servitude of sin; or treated as a servant by being
bound under the oppressive rites and ceremonies of the Law; compare the
note at [Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)

But a son - A child of God, adopted into his family, and to be treated
as a son.

And if a son ... - Entitled to all the privileges of a son, and of
course to be regarded as an heir through the Redeemer, and with him. See
the sentiment here expressed explained in the the note at [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).

[Galatians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 4:8</span></span>

Howbeit - But, ἀλλὰ alla. The address in this verse and the following is
evidently to the portion of the Galatians who had been pagan. This is
probably indicated by the particle ἀλλὰ alla, but denoting a transition.
In the previous verses Paul had evidently had the Jewish converts more
particularly in his eye, and had described their former condition as one
of servitude to the Mosaic rites and customs, and had shown the
inconveniences of that condition, compared with the freedom imparted by
the gospel. To complete the description, he refers also to the Gentiles,
as a condition of worse servitude still, and shows [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md) the absurdity of their turning
back to a state of bondage of any kind, after the glorious deliverance
which they had obtained from the degrading servitude of pagan rites. The
sense is, "If the Jews were in such a state of servitude, how much more
galling and severe was that of those who had been pagans. Yet fron that
servitude the gospel had delivered them, and made them freemen. How
absurd now to go back to a state of vassalage, and to become servants
under the oppressive rites of the Jewish law!"

When ye knew not God - In your state of paganism, when you had no
knowledge of the true God and of his service. The object is not to
apologize for what they did, because they did not know God; it is to
state the fact that they were in a state of gross and galling servitude.

Ye did service - This does not express the force of the original. The
meaning is, "Ye were "slaves" to (ἐδουλεύσατε edouleusate); you were in
a condition of servitude, as opposed to the freedom of the gospel;"
compare [Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md), where the same word
is used to describe the state of the Jews. The drift of the apostle is,
to show that the Jews and Gentiles, before their conversion to
Christianity, were in a state of vassalage or servitude, and that it was
absurd in the highest degree to return to that condition again.

Unto them which by nature are no gods - Idols, or false gods. The
expression "by nature," φύσει phusei, according to Grotius, means, "in
fact, re ipsa." The sense is, that they really had no pretensions to
divinity. Many of them were imaginary beings; many were the objects of
creation, as the sun, and winds, and streams; and many were departed
heroes that had been exalted to be objects of worship. Yet the servitude
was real. It fettered their faculties; controlled their powers; bound
their imagination, and commanded their time and property, and made them
slaves. Idolatry is always slavery; and the servitude of sinners to
their passions and appetites, to lust and gold, and ambition, is not
less galling and severe than was the servitude to the pagan gods or the
Jewish rites, or than is the servitude of the African now to a harsh and
cruel master. Of all Christians it may be said that before their
conversion they "did service," or were slaves to harsh and cruel
masters; and nothing but the gospel has made them free. It may be added,
that the chains of idolatry all over the world are as fast riveted and
as galling as they were in Galatia, and that nothing but the same gospel
which Paul preached there can break those chains and restore man to
freedom.

[Galatians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 4:9</span></span>

But now ... - The sense is, that since they had been made free from
their ignoble servitude in the worship of false gods, and had been
admitted to the freedom found in the worship of the true God, it was
absurd that they should return again to that which was truly slavery or
bondage, the observance of the rites of the Jewish law.

That ye have known God - The true God, and the ease and freedom of his
service in the gospel.

Or rather are known of God - The sense is, "Or, to speak more accurately
or precisely, are known by God." The object of this correction is to
avoid the impression which might be derived from the former phrase that
their acquaintance with God was owing to themselves. He therefore
states, that it was rather that they were known of God; that it was all
owing to him that they had been brought to an acquaintance with himself.
Perhaps, also, he means to bring into view the idea that it was a favor
and privilege to be known by God, and that therefore it was the more
absurd to turn back to the weak and beggarly elements.

How turn ye again - Margin, "Back." "How is it that you are returning to
such a bondage?" The question implies surprise and indignation that they
should do it.

To the weak and beggarly elements - To the rites and ceremonies of the
Jewish law, imposing a servitude really not less severe than the customs
of paganism. On the word elements, see the note at [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md). They are called "weak" because
they had no power to save the soul; no power to justify the sinner
before God. They are called "beggarly" (Greek πτωχὰ ptōcha, poor),
because they could not impart spiritual riches. They really could confer
few benefits on man. Or it may be, as Locke supposes, because the Law
kept people in the poor estate of pupils from the full enjoyment of the
inheritance; [Gal 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md).

Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage - As if you had a wish to be
under servitude. The absurdity is as great as it would be for a man who
had been freed from slavery to desire his chains again. They had been
freed by the gospel from the galling servitude of paganism, and they now
again had sunk into the Jewish observances, as if they preferred slavery
to freedom, and were willing to go from one form of it to another. The
main idea is, that it is absurd for people who have been made free by
the gospel to go back again into any kind of servitude or bondage. We
may apply it to Christians now. Many sink into a kind of servitude not
less galling than was that to sin before their conversion. Some become
the slaves of mere ceremonies and forms in religion. Some are slaves to
fashion, and the world still rules them with the hand of a tyrant. They
have escaped, it may be, from the galling chains of ambition, and
degrading vice, and low sensuality; but they became slaves to the love
of money, or of dress, or of the fashions of the world, as if they loved
slavery and chains; and they seem no more able to break loose than the
slave is to break the bonds which bind him. And some are slaves to some
expensive and foolish habit. Professed Christians, and Christian
ministers too, become slaves to the disgusting and loathsome habit of
using tobacco, bound by a servitude as galling and as firm as that which
ever shackled the limbs of an African. I grieve to add also that many
professed Christians are slaves to the habit of "sitting long at the
wine" and indulging in it freely. O that such knew the liberty of
Christian freedom, and would break away from all such shackles, and show
how the gospel frees people from all foolish and absurd customs!

[Galatians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 4:10</span></span>

Ye observe - The object of this verse is to specify some of the things
to which they had become enslaved.

Days - The days here referred to are doubtless the days of the Jewish
festivals. They had numerous days of such observances, and in addition
to those specified in the Old Testament, the Jews had added many others
as days commemorative of the destruction and rebuilding of the temple,
and of other important events in their history. It is not a fair
interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the
Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue; and
was observed by the Saviour himself, and by the apostles also. It is a
fair interpretation to apply it to all those days which are not
commanded to be kept holy in the Scriptures; and hence, the passage is
as applicable to the observance of saints' days, and days in honor of
particular events in sacred history, as to the days observed by the
Galatians. There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous
festivals, and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant
churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish
ecclesiastical calendar, and for anything that I can see, such
observances are as inconsistent now with the freedom of the gospel as
they were in the time of Paul. We should observe as seasons of holy time
what it can be proved God has commanded us, and no more.

And months - The festivals of the new moon, kept by the Jews. [Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md); [Num
28:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011.md). On this festival, in
addition to the daily sacrifice, two bullocks, a ram, and seven sheep of
a year old were offered in sacrifice. The appearance of the new-moon was
announced by the sound of trumpets. See Jahn, Archae. 352.

And times - Stated times; festivals returning periodically, as the
Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. See
Jahn, Archae. chap. 3. 346-360.

And years - The sabbatical year, or the year of jubilee. See Jahn as
above.

[Galatians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 4:11</span></span>

I am afraid of you ... - I have fears respecting you. His fears were
that they had no genuine Christian principle. They had been so easily
perverted and turned back to the servitude of ceremonies and rites, that
he was apprehensive that there could be no real Christian principle in
the case. What pastor has not often had such fears of his people, when
he sees them turn to the weak and beggarly elements of the world, or
when, after having "run well," he sees them become the slaves of
fashion, or of some habit inconsistent with the simplicity of the
gospel?

[Galatians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 4:12</span></span>

Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am ... - There is great brevity in this
passage, and no little obscurity, and a great many different
interpretations have been given of it by commentators. The various views
expressed may be seen in Bloomfield's Crit. Dig. Locke renders it, "Let
you and I be as if we were all one, Think yourselves to be very me; as I
in my own mind put no difference at all between you and myself." Koppe
explains it thus: Imitate my example; for I, though a Jew by birth, care
no more for Jewish rites than you." Rosenmuller explains it, "Imitate my
manner of life in rejecting the Jewish rites; as I, having renounced the
Jewish rites, was much like you when I preached the gospel to you."
Other interpretations may be seen in Chandler, Doddridge, Calvin, etc.
In our version there seems to be an impropriety of expression; for if he
was as they were it would seem to be a matter of course that they would
be like him, or would resemble him. The sense of the passage, however,
it seems to me cannot be difficult. The reference is doubtless to the
Jewish rites and customs, and to the question whether they were binding
on Christians. Paul's object is to persuade them to abandon them. He
appeals to them, therefore, by his own example. And it means evidently,
"Imitate me in this thing. Follow my example, and yield no conformity to
those rites and customs." The ground on which he asks them to imitate
him may be either:

\(1\) That he had abandoned them or,

\(2\) Because he asks them to yield a point to him.

He had done so in many instances for their welfare, and had made many
sacrifices for their salvation, and he now asks them to yield this one
point, and to become as he was, and to cease these Jewish observances,
as he had done.

For I am as ye are - Greek "For I as ye." This means, I suppose, "For I
have conformed to your customs in many things. I have abandoned my own
peculiarities; given up my customs as far as possible; conformed to you
as Gentiles as far as I could do, in order to benefit and save you. I
have laid aside the uniqueness of the Jew on the principle of becoming
all things to all men (Notes, [Co1
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020).md), in order that I might save
you. I ask in return only the slight sacrifice that you will now become
like me in the matter under consideration."

Ye have not injured me at all - "It is not a personal matter. I have no
cause of complaint. You have done me no personal wrong. There is no
variance between us; no unkind feeling; no injury done as individuals. I
may, therefore, with the more freedom, ask you to yield this point, when
I assure you that I do not feel personally injured. I have no wrong to
complain of, and I ask it on higher grounds than would be an individual
request: it is for your good, and the good of the great cause." When
Christians turn away from the truth, and disregard the instructions and
exhortations of pastors, and become conformed to the world, it is not a
personal matter, or a matter of personal offence to them, painful as it
may be to them. They have no special reason to say that they are
personally injured. It is a higher matter. The cause suffers. The
interests of religion are injured. The church at large is offended, and
the Saviour is "wounded in the house of his friends." Conformity to the
world, or a lapse into some sin, is a public offence, and should be
regarded as an injury done to the cause of the Redeemer. It shows the
magnanimity of Paul, that though they had abandoned his doctrines, and
forgotten his love and his toils in their welfare, he did not regard it
as a personal offence, and did not consider himself personally injured.
An ambitious man or an impostor would have made that the main, if not
the only thing.

[Galatians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 4:13</span></span>

Ye know how - To show them the folly of their embracing the new views
which they had adopted, he reminds them of past times, and particularly
of the strength of the attachment which they had evinced for him in
former days.

Through infirmity of the flesh - Greek "Weakness" (ἀσθένειαν
astheneian); compare the [Co1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md)
note; [Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md) notes.

[Galatians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 4:14</span></span>

And my temptation - "My trial," the thing which was to me a trial and
calamity. The meaning is, that he was afflicted with various calamities
and infirmities, but that this did not hinder their receiving him as an
angel from heaven. There is, however, a considerable variety in the mss.
on this verse. Many mss., instead of "my temptation," read "your
temptation;" and Mill maintains that this is the true reading. Griesbach
hesitates between the two. But it is not very important to determine
which is the true reading. If it should be "your," then it means that
they were tempted by his infirmities to reject him; and so it amounts to
about the same thing. The general sense is, that he had some bodily
infirmity, perhaps some periodically returning disease, that was a great
trial to him, which they bore with, with great patience and affection.
What that was, he has not informed us, and conjecture is vain.

But received me as an angel of God - With the utmost respect, as if I
had been an angel sent from God.

Even as Christ Jesus - As you would have done the Redeemer himself.
Learn hence:

\(1\) That the Lord Jesus is superior to an angel of God.

\(2\) that the highest proof of attachment to a minister, is to receive
him as the Saviour would be received.

\(3\) it showed their attachment to the Lord Jesus, that they received
his apostle as they would have received the Saviour himself; compare
[Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md).

[Galatians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 4:15</span></span>

Where is then the blessedness - Margin, "What was" - in accordance with
the Greek. The words "ye spake of" are not in the Greek, and should have
been printed in italics. But they obscure the sense at any rate. This is
not to be regarded as a question, asking what had become of the
blessedness, implying that it had departed; but it is rather to be
regarded as an exclamation, referring to the happiness of that moment,
and their affection and joy when they thus received him. "What
blessedness you had then! How happy was that moment! What tenderness of
affection! What overflowing joy!" It was a time full of joy, and love,
and affectionate confidence. So Tyndale well renders it, "How happy were
ye then!" In this interpretation, Doddridge, Rosenmuller, Bloomfield,
Koppe, Chandler, and others concur. Locke renders it, "What benedictions
did you then pour out on me!"

For I bear you record - I testify.

Ye would have plucked out your own eyes ... - No higher proof of
attachment could have been given. They loved him so much, that they
would have given to him anything, however dear; they would have done
anything to contribute to his welfare. How changed, now that they had
abandoned his doctrines, and yielded themselves to the guidance of those
who taught a wholly different doctrine!

[Galatians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 4:16</span></span>

Am I therefore become your enemy ... - Is my telling you the truth in
regard to the tendency of the doctrines which you have embraced, and the
character of those who have led you astray, and your own error, a proof
that I have ceased to be your friend? How apt are we to feel that the
man who tells us of our faults is our enemy! How apt are we to treat him
coldly, and to "cut his acquaintance," and to regard him with dislike!
The reason is, he gives us pain; and we cannot have pain given to us,
even by the stone against which we stumble, or by any of the brute
creation, without momentary indignation, or regarding them for a time as
our enemies. Besides, we do not like to have another person acquainted
with our faults and our follies; and we naturally avoid the society of
those who are thus acquainted with us. Such is human nature; and it
requires no little grace for us to overcome this. and to regard the man
who tells us of our faults, or the faults of our families, as our
friend.

We love to be flattered, and to have our friends flattered; and we
shrink with pain from any exposure, or any necessity for repentance.
Hence, we become alienated from him who is faithful in reproving us for
our faults. Hence, people become offended with their ministers when they
reprove them for their sins. Hence, they become offended at the truth.
Hence, they resist the influences of the Holy Spirit, whose office it is
to bring the truth to the heart, and to reprove men for their sins.
There is nothing more difficult than to regard with steady and
unwavering affection the man who faithfully tells us the truth at all
times, when that truth is painful. Yet he is our best friend. "Faithful
are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful,"
[Pro 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md). If I am in danger of
falling down a precipice, he shows to me the purest friendship who tells
me of it; if I am in danger of breathing the air of the pestilence, and
it can be avoided, he shows to me pure kindness who tells me of it. So
still more, if I am indulging in a course of conduct that may ruin me,
or cherishing error that may endanger my salvation, he shows me the
purest friendship who is most faithful in warning me, and apprising me
of what must be the termination of my course.

[Galatians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 4:17</span></span>

They zealously affect you - See [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031) (Greek.md); [Co1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039.md). The word used here (Ζηλόω
Zēloō), means to be "zealous" toward, that is, for or against any person
or thing; usually, in a good sense, to be eager for. Here it means, that
the false teachers made a show of zeal toward the Galatians, or
professed affection for them in order to gain them as their followers.
They were full of ardor, and professed an extraordinary concern for
their welfare - as people always do who are demagogues, or who seek to
gain proselytes. The object of the apostle in this is, probably, to say,
that it was not wholly owing to themselves that they had become
alienated from the doctrines which he had taught. Great pains had been
taken to do it; and there had been a show of zeal which would be likely
to endanger any person.

But not well - Not with good motives, or with good designs.

Yea, they would exclude you - Margin, "Us." A few printed editions of
the New Testament have ἡμᾶς hēmas, "us," instead of ὑμᾶς humas, "you" -
Mill. The word "exclude" here probably means, that they endeavored to
exclude the Galatians from the love and affection of Paul. They would
shut them out from that, in order that they might secure them for their
own purposes. If the reading in the margin, however, should be retained,
the sense would be clearer. "They wish to exclude us, that is, me, the
apostle, in order that they may have you wholly to themselves. If they
can once get rid of your attachment to me, then they will have no
difficulty in securing you for themselves." This reading, says
Rosenmuller, is found "in many of the best codices, and versions, and
fathers." It is adopted by Doddridge, Locke, and others. The main idea
is clear: Paul stood in the way of their designs. The Galatians were
truly attached to him, and it was necessary, in order to accomplish
their ends, to withdraw their affections from him. When false teachers
have designs on a people, they begin by alienating their confidence and
affections from their pastors and teachers. They can hope for no success
until this is done; and hence, the efforts of errorists, and of
infidels, and of scorners, is to undermine the confidence of a people in
the ministry, and when this is done there is little difficulty in
drawing them over to their own purposes.

That ye might affect them - The same word as in the former part of the
verse, "that ye might zealously affect them" - that is, that ye might
show ardent attachment to them. Their first work is to manifest special
interest for your welfare; their second, to alienate you from him who
had first preached the gospel to you; their object, not your salvation,
or your real good, but to secure your zealous love for themselves.

[Galatians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 4:18</span></span>

But it is good to be, zealously affected - The meaning of this is,
"Understand me: I do not speak against zeal. I have not a word to say in
its disparagement. In itself, it is good; and their zeal would be good
if it were in a good cause." Probably, they relied much on their zeal;
perhaps they maintained, as errorists and deceivers are very apt to do,
that zeal was sufficient evidence of the goodness of their cause, and
that persons who are so very zealous could not possibly be bad men. How
often is this plea set up by the friends of errorists and deceivers!

And not only when I am present with you - It seems to me that there is
great adroitness and great delicacy of irony in this remark; and that
the apostle intends to remind them as gently as possible, that it would
have been as well for them to have shown their zeal in a good cause when
he was absent, as well as when he was with them. The sense may be, "You
were exceedingly zealous in a good cause when I was with you. You loved
the truth; you loved me. Since I left you, and as soon almost as I was
out of your sight, your zeal died away, and your ardent love for me was
transferred to others. Allow me to remind you, that it would be well to
be zealous of good when I am away, as well as when I am with you. There
is not much true affection in that which dies away as soon as a man's
back is turned." The doctrine is, that true zeal or love will live alike
when the object is near and when it is removed; when our friends are
present with us, and when they leave us; when their eye is upon us, and
when it is turned away.

[Galatians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 4:19</span></span>

My little children - The language of tender affection, such as a parent
would use toward his own offspring; see the note at [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); compare [Mat
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md); [Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), [Jo1
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md). The idea here is, that Paul felt
that he sustained toward them the relation of a father, and he had for
them the deep and tender feelings of a parent.

Of whom I travail in birth again - For whose welfare I am deeply
anxious: and for whom I endure deep anguish; compare [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md). His anxiety for them he compares
to the deepest sufferings which human nature endures; and his language
here is a striking illustration of what ministers of the gospel should
feel, and do sometimes feel, in regard to their people.

Until Christ be formed in you - The name Christ is often used to denote
his religion, or the principles of his gospel; see the note at [Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md). Here it means, until Christ
reigns wholly in your hearts; until you wholly and entirely embrace his
doctrines; and until you become wholly imbued with his spirit; see [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md).

[Galatians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 4:20</span></span>

I desire to be present with you now - They had lost much by his absence;
they had changed their views; they had in some measure become alienated
from him; and he wishes that he might be again with them, as he was
before. He would hope to accomplish much more by his personal presence
than he could by letter.

And to change my voice - That is, from complaint and censure, to tones
of entire confidence.

For I stand in doubt of you - Margin, "I am perplexed for you." On the
meaning of the word used here, see the note at [Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md). The sense is plain. Paul had much
reason to doubt the sincerity and the solidity of their Christian
principles, and he was deeply anxious on that account.

[Galatians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 4:21</span></span>

Tell me ... - In order to show fully the nature and the effect of the
Law, Paul here introduces an illustration from an important fact in the
Jewish history. This allegory has given great perplexity to expositors,
and, in some respects, it is attended with real difficulty. An
examination of the difficulties will be found in the larger
commentaries. My object, without examining the expositions which have
been proposed, will be to state, in as few words as possible, the simple
meaning and design of the allegory. The design it is not difficult to
understand. It is to show the effect of being under the bondage or
servitude of the Jewish law, compared with the freedom which the gospel
imparts. Paul had addressed the Galatians as having a real desire to be
under bondage, or to be servants; the note at [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md). He had represented Christianity
as a state of freedom, and Christians as the sons of God - not servants,
but freemen.

To show the difference of the two conditions, he appeals to two cases
which would furnish a striking illustration of them. The one was the
case of Hagar and her son. The effect of bondage was well illustrated
there. She and her son were treated with severity, and were cast out and
persecuted. This was a fair illustration of bondage under the Law; of
the servitude to the laws of Moses; and was a fit representation of
Jerusalem as it was in the time of Paul. The other case was that of
Isaac. He was the son of a free woman, and was treated accordingly. He
was regarded as a son, not as a servant. And he was a fair illustration
of the case of those who were made free by the gospel. They enjoyed a
similar freedom and sonship, and should not seek a state of servitude or
bondage. The condition of Isaac was a fit illustration of the New
Jerusalem; the heavenly city; the true kingdom of God. But Paul does not
mean to say, as I suppose, that the history of the son of Hagar and of
the son of Rebecca was mere allegory, or that the narrative by Moses was
designed to represent the different condition of those who were under
the Law and under the gospel.

He uses it simply, as showing the difference between servitude and
freedom, and as a striking illustration of the nature of the bondage to
the Jewish law, and of the freedom of the gospel, just as anyone may use
a striking historical fact to illustrate a principle. These general
remarks will constitute the basis of my interpretation of this
celebrated allegory. The expression "tell me," is one of affectionate
remonstrance and reasoning; see [Luk
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#042.md), "Tell me, therefore, which of
these will love him most?" Compare [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md), "Come, now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord."

Ye that desire to be under the law - See the note at [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md). You who wish to yield obedience
to the laws of Moses. You who maintain that conformity to those laws is
necessary to justification.

Do ye not hear the law? - Do you not understand what the Law says? Will
you not listen to its own admonitions, and the instruction which may be
derived from the Law on the subject? The word "law" here refers not to
the commands that were uttered on Mount Sinai, but to the book of the
Law. The passage to which reference is made is in the Book of Genesis;
but; all the five books of Moses were by the Jews classed under the
general name of the Law; see the note at [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md). The sense is, "Will you not
listen to a narrative found in one of the books of the Law itself, fully
illustrating the nature of that servitude which you wish?"

[Galatians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 4:22</span></span>

For it is written - Gen. 16; 21.

Abraham had two sons - Ishmael and Isaac. Abraham subsequently had
several sons by Keturah after the death of Sarah; [Gen
26:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md). But the two sons by Hagar and
Sarah were the most prominent, and the events of their lives furnished
the particular illustration which Paul desired.

The one by a bond-maid - Ishmael, the son of Hagar. Hagar was an
Egyptian slave, whom Sarah gave to Abraham in order that he might not be
wholly without posterity; [Gen 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#003.md).

The other by a free woman - Isaac, the son of Sarah; [Gen
21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md).

[Galatians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 4:23</span></span>

But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh - In the
ordinary course of nature, without any special promise, or any unusual
divine interposition, as in the case of Isaac.

But he of the free woman ... - The birth of Isaac was in accordance with
a special promise, and by a remarkable divine interposition; see [Gen
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md); [Gen
21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md); [Heb
11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md); compare the notes at [Rom
4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md). The idea here of Paul is,
that the son of the slave was in a humble and inferior condition from
his very birth. There was no special promise attending him. He was born
into a state of inferiority and servitude which attended him through his
whole life. Isaac, however, was met with promises as soon as he was
born, and was under the benefit of those promises as long as he lived.
The object of Paul is, to state the truth in regard to a condition of
servitude and slavery. It is attended with evils from beginning to end;
from the birth to the grave. By this illustration he means to show them
the folly of becoming the voluntary slaves of the Law after they had
once been made free.

[Galatians 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 4:24</span></span>

Which things - The different accounts of Ishmael and Isaac.

Are an allegory - May be regarded allegorically, or as illustrating
great principles in regard to the condition of slaves and freemen; and
may therefore be used to illustrate the effect of servitude to the Law
of Moses compared with the freedom of the gospel. He does not mean to
say that the historical record of Moses was not true, or was merely
allegorical; nor does he mean to say that Moses meant this to be an
allegory, or that he intended that it should be applied to the exact
purpose to which Paul applied it. No such design is apparent in the
narrative of Moses, and it is evident that he had no such intention. Nor
can it be shown that Paul means to be understood as saying that Moses
had any such design, or that his account was not a record of a plain
historical fact. Paul uses it as he would any other historical fact that
would illustrate the same principle, and he makes no more use of it than
the Saviour did in his parables of real or fictitious narratives to
illustrate an important truth, or than we always do of real history to
illustrate an important principle.

The word which is used here by Paul (ἀλληγορέω allēgoreō) is derived
from ἄλλος allos, another, and ἀγορεύω agoreuō, to speak, to speak
openly or in public - Passow. It properly means to speak anything
otherwise than it is understood (Passow); to speak allegorically; to
allegorize. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, nor
is it found in the Septuagint, though it occurs often in the classic
writers. An allegory is a continued metaphor; see Blair's Lectures, xv.
It is a figurative sentence or discourse, in which the principal object
is described by another subject resembling it in its properties and
circumstances - Webster. Allegories are in words what hieroglyphics are
in painting. The distinction between a parable and an allegory is said
to be, that a parable is a supposed history to illustrate some important
truth, as the parable of the good Samaritan, etc.; an allegory is based
on real facts.

It is not probable, however, that this distinction is always carefully
observed. Sometimes the allegory is based on the resemblance to some
inanimate object, as in the beautiful allegory in Ps. 80. Allegories,
parables, and metaphors abound in the writings of the East. Truth was
more easily treasured up in this way, and could be better preserved and
transmitted when it was connected with an interesting story. The lively
fancy of the people of the East also led them to this mode of
communicating truth; though a love for it is probably founded in human
nature. The best sustained allegory of any considerable length in the
world is, doubtless, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress; and yet this is among
the most popular of all books. The ancient Jews were exceedingly fond of
allegories, and even turned a considerable part of the Old Testament
into allegory. The ancient Greek philosophers also were fond of this
mode of teaching.

Pythagoras instructed his followers in this manner, and this was common
among the Greeks, and was imitated much by the early Christians -
Calmet. Many of the Christian fathers, of the school of Origen, made the
Old Testament almost wholly allegorical, and found mysteries in the
plainest narratives. The Bible became thus with them a book of enigmas,
and exegesis consisted in an ingenious and fanciful accommodation of all
the narratives in the scriptures to events in subsequent times. The most
fanciful, and the most ingenious man, on this principle, was the best
interpreter; and as any man might attach any hidden mystery which he
chose to the scriptures, they became wholly useless as an infallible
guide. Better principles of interpretation now prevail; and the great
truth has gone forth, never more to be recalled, that the Bible is to be
interpreted on the same principle as all other books; that its language
is to be investigated by the same laws as language in all other books;
and that no more liberty is to be taken in allegorizing the scriptures
than may be taken with Herodotus or Livy. It is lawful to use narratives
of real events to illustrate important principles always. Such a use is
often made of history; and such a use, I suppose, the apostle Paul makes
here of an important fact in the history of the Old Testament.

For these are - These may be used to represent the two covenants. The
apostle could not mean that the sons of Sarah and Hagar were literally
the two covenants; for this could not be true, and the declaration would
be unintelligible. In what sense could Ishmael be called a covenant? The
meaning, therefore, must be, that they furnished an apt illustration or
representation of the two covenants; they would show what the nature of
the two covenants was. The words "are" and "is" are often used in this
sense in the Bible, to denote that one thing represents another. Thus in
the institution of the Lord's supper; "Take, eat, this is my body" [Mat
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026.md); that is, this represents my
body. The bread was not the living body that was then before them. So in
[Gal 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md); "This is my blood of the
new covenant;" that is, this represents my blood. The wine in the cup
could not be the living blood of the Redeemer that was then flowing in
his veins; see the note at that place; compare [Gen
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#026.md).

The two covenants - Margin, "Testaments." The word means here, covenants
or compacts; see the note at [Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025.md). The two covenants here referred
to, are the one on Mount Sinai made with the Jews, and the other that
which is made with the people of God in the gospel. The one resembles
the condition of bondage in which Hagar and her son were; the other the
condition of freedom in which Sarah and Isaac were.

The one from the Mount Sinai - Margin, "Sina." The Greek is "Sina,"
though the word may be written either way.

Which gendereth to bondage - Which tends to produce bondage or
servitude. That is, the laws are stern and severe; and the observance of
them costly, and onerous like a state of bondage; see the note at [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md).

Which is Agar - Which Hagar would appropriately represent. The condition
of servitude produced by the Law had a strong resemblance to her
condition as a slave.

[Galatians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 4:25</span></span>

For this Agar is Mount Sinai - This Hagar well represents the Law given
on Mount Sinai. No one can believe that Paul meant to say that Hagar was
literally Mount Sinai. A great deal of perplexity has been felt in
regard to this passage, and Bentley proposed to cancel it altogether as
an interpolation. But there is no good authority for this. Several
manuscripts and versions read it, "For this Sinai is a mountain in
Arabia;" others, "to this Hagar Jerusalem answereth," etc. Griesbach has
placed these readings in the margin, and has marked them as not to be
rejected as certainly false, but as worthy of a more attentive
examination; as sustained by some plausible arguments, though not in the
whole satisfactory. The word Hagar in Arabic is said to signify a rock;
and it has been supposed that the name was appropriately given to Mount
Sinai, because it was a pile of rocks, and that Paul had allusion to
this meaning of the word here. So Chandler, Rosenmuller, and others
interpret it. But I cannot find in Castell or Gesenius that the word
Hagar in Arabic has this signification; still less is there evidence
that the name was ever given to Mount Sinai by the Arabs, or that such a
signification was known to Paul. The plainest and most obvious sense of
a passage is generally the true sense; and the obvious sense here is,
that Hagar was a fair representation of Mount Sinai, and of the Law
given there.

In Arabia - Mount Sinai is situated in Arabia Petraea, or the Rocky.
Rosenmuller says that this means "in the Arabic language;" but probably
in this interpretation he stands alone.

And answereth to Jerusalem - Margin, "Is in the same rank with." The
margin is the better translation. The meaning is, it is just like it, or
corresponds with it. Jerusalem as it is now (that is, in the days of
Paul), is like Mount Sinai. It is subject to laws, and rites, and
customs; bound by a state of servitude, and fear, and trembling, such as
existed when the Law was given on Mount Sinai. There is no freedom;
there are no great and liberal views; there is none of the liberty which
the gospel imparts to men. The word συστοιχεῖ sustoichei, "answereth
to," means properly to advance in order together; to go together with,
as soldiers march along in the same rank; and then to correspond to. It
means here that Mount Sinai and Jerusalem as it then was would be suited
to march together in the same platoon or rank. In marshalling an army,
care is taken to place soldiers of the same height, and size, and skill,
and courage, if possible, together. So here it means that they were
alike. Both were connected with bondage, like Hagar. On the one, a law
was given that led to bondage; and the other was in fact under a
miserable servitude of rites and forms.

Which now is - As it exists now; that is, a slave to rites and forms, as
it was in fact in the time of Paul.

And is in bondage - To laws and customs. She was under hard and
oppressive rites, like slavery. She was also in bondage to sin [Joh
8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md); but this does not seem to be
the idea here.

With her children - Her inhabitants. She is represented as a mother, and
her inhabitants, the Jews, are in the condition of the son of Hagar. On
this passage compare the notes at [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md), for a more full illustration of
the principles involved here.

[Galatians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 4:26</span></span>

But Jerusalem which is above - The spiritual Jerusalem; the true church
of God. Jerusalem was the place where God was worshipped, and hence, it
became synonymous with the word church, or is used to represent the
people of God. The word rendered "above," (ἄνω anō) means properly "up
above," that which is above; and hence, heavenly, celestial; [Col
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md); [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md). Here it means the heavenly or
celestial Jerusalem; [Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md), "And I
John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of
heaven." [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md)," ye are come unto
Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem." Here it is used to denote the church, as being of heavenly
origin.

Is free - The spirit of the gospel is that of freedom. It is freedom
from sin, freedom from the bondage of rites and customs, and it tends to
promote universal freedom; see the note at [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md); compare [Joh
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032.md), [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036.md); and the note at [Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017.md).

Which is the mother of us all - Of all who are true Christians, whether
we are by birth Jews or Gentiles. We should not, therefore, yield
ourselves to any degrading and debasing servitude el any kind; compare
the note at [Co1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012.md).

[Galatians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gal 4:27</span></span>

For it is written - This passage is found in [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md). For an exposition of its meaning
as it occurs there, see my notes at Isaiah. The object of the apostle in
introducing it here seems to be to prove that the Gentiles as well as
the Jews would partake of the privileges connected with the heavenly
Jerusalem. He had in the previous verse spoken of the Jerusalem from
above as the common mother of all, true Christians, whether by birth
Jews or Gentiles. This might be disputed or doubted by the Jews; and he
therefore adduces this proof from the Old Testament. Or if it was not
doubted, still the quotation was pertinent, and would illustrate the
sentiment which he had just uttered. The mention of Jerusalem as a
mother seems to have suggested this text. Isaiah had spoken of Jerusalem
as a female that had been long desolate and childless, now rejoicing by
a large accession from the Gentile world, and increased in numbers like
a female who should have more children than one who had been long
married. To this Paul appropriately refers when he says that the whole
church, Jews and Gentiles, were the children of the heavenly Jerusalem,
represented here as a rejoicing mother. He has not quoted literally from
the Hebrew, but he has used the Septuagint version, and has retained the
sense. The sense is, that the accession from the Gentile world would be
far more numerous than the Jewish people had ever been; a prophecy that
has been already fulfilled.

Rejoice thou barren that bearest not - As a woman who has had no
children would rejoice. This represents probably the pagan world as
having been apparently forsaken and abandoned, and with whom there had
been none of the true children of God.

Break forth and cry - Or "break forth and exclaim;" that is, break out
into loud and glad exclamations at the remarkable accession. The cry
here referred to was to be a joyful cry or shout; the language of
exultation. So the Hebrew word in [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md) צהל tsaahal means.

For the desolate - She who was desolate and apparently forsaken. It
literally refers to a woman who had seemed to be desolate and forsaken,
who was unmarried. In Isaiah it may refer to Jerusalem, long forsaken
and desolate, or as some suppose to the Gentile world; see my note at
[Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md).

Than she which hath an husband - Perhaps referring to the Jewish people
as in covenant with God, and often spoken of as married to him; [Isa
62:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md); [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md).

[Galatians 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gal 4:28</span></span>

Now we, brethren - We who are Christians.

Are the children of the promise - We so far resemble Isaac, that there
are great and precious promises made to us. We are not in the condition
of Ishmael, to whom no promise was made.

[Galatians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 4:29</span></span>

But as then he that was born after the flesh - Ishmael; see [Gal
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md).

Persecuted him that was born after the Spirit - That is, Isaac. The
phrase, "after the Spirit," here, is synonymous with "according to the
promise" in the previous verse. It stands opposed to the phrase "after
the flesh," and means that his birth was by the special or miraculous
agency of God; see Rom. 4. It was not in the ordinary course of events.
The persecution here referred to, was the injurious treatment which
Isaac received from Ishmael, or the opposition which subsisted between
them. The particular reference of Paul is doubtless to [Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md), where it is said that "Sarah saw
the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham,
mocking." It was on account of this, and at the special request of
Sarah, that Hagar and her son were expelled from the house of Abraham;
[Gen 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md).

Even so it is now - That is, Christians, the children of the promise,
are persecuted by the Jews, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "as it now
is," and who are uninterested in the promises, as Ishmael was. For an
illustration of this, see Paley's Hora Paulina, on this Epistle, no. v.
Dr. Paley has remarked that it does not appear that the apostle Paul was
ever set upon by the Gentiles, unless they were first stirred up by the
Jews, except in two instances. One of these was at Philippi, after the
cure of the Pythoness [Act 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md); and
the other at Ephesus, at the instance of Demetrius; [Act
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md). The persecutions of the
Christians arose, therefore, mainly from the Jews, from those who were
in bondage to the Law, and to rites and customs; and Paul's allusion
here to the case of the persecution which Isaac the free-born son
endured, is exceedingly pertinent and happy.

[Galatians 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gal 4:30</span></span>

Nevertheless - But Ἀλλὰ (Alla).

What saith the Scripture? - What does the Scripture teach on the
subject? What lesson does it convey in regard to the bondman?

Cast out the bondwoman and her son - This was the language of Sarah, in
an address to Abraham, requesting him to cast out Hagar and Ishmael;
[Gen 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md). That was done. Paul uses
it here as applicable to the case before him. As used by him the meaning
is, that everything like servitude in the gospel is to be rejected, as
Hagar and Ishmael were driven away. It does not mean, as it seems to me,
that they were to expel the Jewish teachers in Galatia, but that they
were to reject everything like servitude and bondage; they were to
adhere only to that which was free. Paul cannot here mean that the
passage in [Gen 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md), originally had
reference to the gospel, for nothing evidently was further from the mind
of Sarah than any such reference; nor can it be shown that he meant to
approve of or vindicate the conduct of Sarah; but he finds a passage
applicable to his purpose, and he conveys his ideas in that language as
exactly expressing his meaning. We all use language in that way wherever
we find it.

(Yet God confirmed the sentence of Sarah; [Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md). Hence, Mr. Scott thus
paraphrases, "But as the Galatians might read in the Scriptures that God
himself had commanded Hagar and Ishmael to be sent away from Abraham's
family, that the son of the bondwoman might not share the inheritance
with Isaac; even so the Jewish nation would soon be cast out of the
church, and all who continued under the legal covenant excluded from
heaven."

[Galatians 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gal 4:31</span></span>

So then, brethren - It follows from all this. Not from the allegory
regarded as an argument - for Paul does not use it thus - but from the
considerations suggested on the whole subject. Since the Christian
religion is so superior to the Jewish; since we are by it freed from
degrading servitude, and are not in bondage to rites and ceremonies;
since it was designed to make us truly free, and since by that religion
we are admitted to the privileges of sons, and are no longer under laws,
and tutors, and governors, as if we were minors; from all this it
follows, that we should feel and act, not as if we were children of a
bondwoman, and born in slavery, but as if we were children of a
freewoman, and born to liberty. It is the birthright of Christians to
think, and feel, and act like freemen, and they should not allow
themselves to become the slaves of customs, and rites, and ceremonies,
but should feel that they are the adopted children of God.

Thus closes this celebrated allegory - an allegory that has greatly
perplexed most expositors, and most readers of the Bible. In view of it,
and of the exposition above, there are a few remarks which may not
inappropriately be made.

\(1\) it is by no means affirmed, that the history of Hagar and Sarah in
Genesis, had any original reference to the gospel. The account there is
a plain historical narrative, not designed to have any such reference.

\(2\) the narrative contains important principles, that may be used as
illustrating truth, and is so used by the apostle Paul. There are
parallel points between the history and the truths of religion, where
the one may be illustrated by the other.

\(3\) the apostle does not use it at all in the way of argument, or as
if that proved that the Galatians were not to submit to the Jewish rites
and customs. It is an illustration of the comparative nature of
servitude and freedom, and would, therefore, illustrate the difference
between a servile compliance with Jewish rites, and the freedom of the
gospel.

\(4\) this use of an historical fact by the apostle does not make it
proper for us to turn the Old Testament into allegory, or even to make a
very free use of this mode of illustrating truth. That an allegory may
be used sometimes with advantage, no one can doubt while the "Pilgrim's
Progress" shall exist. Nor can anyone doubt that Paul has here derived,
in this manner, an important and striking illustration of truth from the
Old Testament. But no one acquainted with the history of interpretation
can doubt that vast injury has been done by a fanciful mode of
explaining the Old Testament; by making every fact in its history an
allegory; and every pin and pillar of the tabernacle and the temple a
type. Nothing is better suited to bring the whole science of
interpretation into contempt; nothing dishonors the Bible more, than to
make it a book of enigmas, and religion to consist in puerile conceits.
The Bible is a book of sense; and all the doctrines essential to
salvation are plainly revealed. It should be interpreted, not by mere
conceit and by fancy, but by the sober laws according to which are
interpreted other books. It should be explained, not under the influence
of a vivid imagination, but under the influence of a heart imbued with a
love of truth, and by an understanding disciplined to investigate the
meaning of words and phrases, and capable of rendering a reason for the
interpretation which is proposed. People may abundantly use the facts in
the Old Testament to illustrate human nature, as Paul did; but far
distant be the day, when the principles of Origen and of Cocceius shall
again prevail, and when it shall be assumed, that "the Bible means every
thing that it can be made to mean."

(These are excellent remarks, and the caution which the author gives
against extravagant and imaginative systems of interpreting scripture
cannot be too often repeated. It is allowed, however, nearly on all
hands, that this allegory is brought forward by way of illustration
only, and not of argument. This being the case, the question, as to
whether the history in Genesis were originally intended represent the
matter, to which Paul here applies it, is certainly not of very great
importance, notwithstanding the learned labor that has been expended on
it, and to such an extent as to justify the critic's remark. "vexavit
interprets vehementer vexatus ab iis et ipse." Whatever be the original
design of the passage, the apostle has employed it as an illustration of
his subject, and was guided by the Spirit of inspiration in so doing.
But certainly we should not be very far wrong, if since an apostle has
affirmed such spiritual representation, we should suppose it originally
intended by the Spirit; nor are we in great danger of making types of
every pin and pillar, so long as we strictly confine ourselves to the
admission of such only as rest upon apostolic authority. "This
transaction," says the eminently judicious Thomas Scott, "was so
remarkable, the coincidence so exact, and the illustration so
instructive, that we cannot doubt it originally was intended, by the
Holy Spirit, as an allegory and type of those things to which the
inspired apostle referred it.")
