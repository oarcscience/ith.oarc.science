### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 9:1</span></span>

Box - Rather, "flask," or "vial" [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md). Oil and ointment were commonly
kept in open-mouthed jars, vases, or bottles made of glass, alabaster,
or earthen-ware. Many such vessels have been found both in Egypt and
Assyria. The "oil" was the holy oil, compounded after the receipt given
in Exodus [Exo 30:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 9:3</span></span>

Flee, and tarry not - The probable object of these directions was at
once to prevent questioning, and to render the whole thing more
striking.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 9:5</span></span>

The chief officers - the generals - were assembled together in Jehu's
quarters, perhaps holding a council of war. The place of assembly seems
to have been the great court. Hence, Jehu "went into the house" [Kg2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#006.md) entered, that is, one of the rooms
opening into the court.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 9:11</span></span>

This mad fellow - The captains, seeing his excited look, his strange
action, and his extreme haste, call him (as soldiers would) "this wild
fellow."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 9:13</span></span>

Took every man his garment, and put it under him - The outer cloak of
the Jews was a sort of large shawl or blanket, which might well serve
for a carpet of state. Such a carpet is commonly represented on the seat
of an Assyrian throne in the Nineveh sculptures.

The stairs rose against the walI of the house from the pavement of the
court to the level of the upper story, or of the roof. At the top of the
stairs would be a flat platform, and this would form a throne, on which
the new king could exhibit himself to his subjects.

Blew with trumpets - On this recognized part of the ceremony of a
coronation, see [Kg2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014.md); [Sa2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#010.md); [Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 9:14</span></span>

Had kept - Rather, "was keeping watch." The city had been taken: but the
war continuing, and there being a danger of the Syrians recovering it,
Joram and all Israel (i. e., the whole military force) were guarding the
recent conquest, while Hazael threatened it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 9:18</span></span>

What hast thou to do with peace? - i. e., "What does it matter to thee
whether my errand is one of peace or not?"

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 9:20</span></span>

The driving ... furiously - The word translated "driving" means
"leading" or "conducting" a band. The watchman observed that the
"company" (or, multitude) was led forward madly, and associated this
strange procedure with the known character of Jehu. It is curious that
some versions, as well as Josephus, give an opposite sense: "he driveth
quietly."

Jehu was properly "the grandson" of Nimshi, who was probably a more
famous person than Jehoshaphat [Kg2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#002.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 9:21</span></span>

Make ready - literally, (as in margin) "Blind," i. e., "Harness the
horses to the chariot." The king had no suspicion of Jehu's treason.
Probably he imagined that he was bringing him important news from the
seat of war. Ahaziah's accompanying him is significant of the close
friendship which united the uncle and the nephew. They went out not
"against" Jehu, but rather "to meet him."

In the portion of Naboth - This is no longer called a "vineyard" 1 Kings
21:1-18; probably because it had been thrown into the palace garden, and
applied to the purpose for which Ahab originally wanted it. The approach
to the city on this side must have lain either through it, or close by
it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 9:22</span></span>

Joram had asked the usual question, "Is it peace?" - meaning simply, "Is
all well?" In Jehu's reply, by "whoredoms" we are probably to understand
"idolatries," acts of spiritual unfaithfulness; by "witchcrafts,"
dealings with the Baal prophets and oracles. Compare [Kg2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 9:23</span></span>

Turned his hands - The meaning is that Joram ordered his charioteer to
turn round and drive back to the town.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 9:24</span></span>

Jehu drew a bow ... - literally, as in the margin, i. e., "Jehu took a
bow in his hand." The arrow struck Jehoram's back, between his two
shoulders, as he fled.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 9:25</span></span>

Rode together after Ahab - The Assyrian sculptures make it probable that
Josephus was right in interpreting this "rode side by side behind Ahab
in his chariot." The Assyrian monarchs, when they go out to war, are
frequently attended hy two guards, who stand behind them in the same
chariot.

Burden - Compare the use of the same word in Isaiah ([Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md); [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001), etc..md), and in Lamentations [Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md), for a denunciation of woe.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 9:26</span></span>

The passage from "Surely I have seen" to "Saith the Lord," is exegetical
of [Kg2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md), containing the "burden"
there spoken of.

And the blood of his sons - The murder of Naboth's sons is here for the
first time mentioned; but as the removal of the sons was necessary, if
the vineyard was to pass to Ahab, we can well understand that Jezebel
would take care to clear them out of the way.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 9:27</span></span>

By the way of the garden-house - Or "by the way of Beth-Gan," which has
been conjectured to be another name for En-Gannim, "the spring of the
gardens." Both are considered identical with Ginaea, the modern Jenin,
which lies due south of Jezreeh The road from Jezreel (Zerin) to Jenin
passes at first along the plain of Esdraelon, but after a while begins
to rise over the Samaritan hills. Here probably was "the ascent of Gur,
by Ibleam," which may have occupied the site of the modern Jelama.
Whether the soldiers attacked him there or not is uncertain. The words,
"And they did so," are not in the original.

Megiddo - On its situation, see [Jos
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021.md) note; and on the possible
reconcilement of this passage with [Ch2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md), see the note there.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 9:29</span></span>

In the eleventh year - The twelfth according to [Kg2
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#025.md). The discrepancy may be best
explained from two ways of reckoning the accession of Ahaziah, who is
likely to have been regent for his father during at least one year. See
[Ch2 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 9:30</span></span>

Painted her face - literally, "put her eyes in antimony " - i. e., dyed
the upper and under eyelids, a common practice in the East, even at the
present day. The effect is at once to increase the apparent size of the
eye, and to give it unnatural brilliancy. Representations of eyes thus
embellished occur on the Assyrian sculptures, and the practice existed
among the Jews (marginal reference; and [Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030).md).

Tired her head - Dressed (attired) her head, and no doubt put on her
royal robes, that she might die as became a queen, in true royal array.

A window - Rather, "the window." The gate-tower had probably, as many of
those in the Assyrian sculptures, one window only.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 9:34</span></span>

Leaving the mangled body on the bare earth, Jehu went to the banquet. It
was, no doubt, important that he should at once show himself to the
court as king. In calling Jezebel "this cursed one," Jehu means to
remind his hearers that the curse of God had been pronounced upon her by
Elijah [Kg2 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036.md), and so to justify
his own conduct.

A king's daughter - Merely as the widow of Ahab and mother of Jehoram,
Jehu would not have considered Jezebel entitled to buriah. But she was
the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians (marginal reference), and
so a princess born. This would entitle her to greater respect. Wilfully
to have denied her burial would have been regarded as an unpardonable
insult by the reigning Sidonian monarch.
