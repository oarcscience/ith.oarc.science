### [Jeremiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 46:0</span></span>

The prophecies against foreign nations are collected into one scroll
Jer. 46-49. Compare Isa. 13-23; Ezek. 25-32. They are arranged in two
great divisions:

\(a\) Jer. 46-49:33, spoken in connection with Jer. 25; and

\(b\) Jer. 50-51 spoken at a subsequent date against Babylon.

Between them is placed a prophecy against Elam [Jer
49:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md) spoken in the first year of
Zedekiah. The seven earlier prophecies belonging to the fourth year of
Jehoiakim were written at the same time, and arranged as they at present
stand. It is no doubt intentional that these prophecies against the
nations are in number 7 (compare [Amo
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md); [Amo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004).md).

Jer. 46. This prophecy against Egypt consists of two parts,

\(a\) a song of triumph because of her defeat at Carehemish [Jer
46:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md);

\(b\) a prediction that the conqueror would invade Egypt from one end to
the other [Jer 46:14-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md).

Possibly a long delay intervened between these predictions.

[Jeremiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 46:1</span></span>

Against the Gentiles - Or, concerning the nations Jer. 46-49:33.

[Jeremiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 46:2</span></span>

Against ... - i. e., relating to, concerning. So [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md); [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md); see the note at [Jer
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md).

Pharaoh-necho - See [Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md) note.

In - (at) Carchemish - (The Gargamis of the inscriptions, now Jerabis,
on the Euphrates, about 16 miles south of Birejik.)

[Jeremiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 46:3</span></span>

Order ye ... - "i. e., prepare ye, make ready." The buckler was a small
round target carried by the lightly-armed troops: the shield belonged to
the heavily-armed troops, and was large enough to protect the whole
body.

[Jeremiah 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 46:4</span></span>

From the infantry the prophet proceeds to the chariots, in which the
Egyptians placed great confidence.

Get up, ye horsemen - Or, "mount the steeds."

Furbish - i. e., polish, sharpen.

Brigandines - In old times brigand meant a soldier, and we still call a
division of an army a brigade, and a commander a brigadier, i. e., a
brigandier, or captain of brigands. Similarly a brigandine means a
soldier's equipment, and is put here for a coat of mail.

[Jeremiah 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 46:5</span></span>

Literally, "Why have I seen? They are terror-stricken! they are giving
way back!" The Egyptian host feels that the battle is lost, and
overborne by the enemy loses heart, and in despair, yet not without a
struggle, gives way. It is remarkable, that while Jeremiah in his
warning addressed to Jerusalem uses the most simple and unadorned prose,
his language concerning the Gentile nations is, on the contrary, full of
brilliant poetry.

Look not back - turn not back. They make no halt, and no attempt to
rally.

Fear was round about - The prophets watch-word, Magor-missabib (see [Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 46:6</span></span>

Translate it: "The swift shall not flee away, and the hero shall not
escape: in the north on the bank of the river Euphrates they shall
stumble and fall."

[Jeremiah 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 46:7</span></span>

In [Jer 46:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md) we saw only a mighty
army marshalling for battle, and its hasty flight. In [Jer
46:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md) the prophet tells us at whose
defeat we have been present.

A flood - the Nile. The metaphor describing the advance of the Egyptian
army is naturally drawn from the annual overflow of their own sacred
stream.

Whose waters are moved ... - literally, his waters toss to and fro as
the rivers, the natural branches of the Nile in Lower Egypt.

[Jeremiah 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 46:9</span></span>

Rather, Go up, advance, ye horses; and drive furiously, ye chariots; and
let the mighty men go forth. They march out of Egypt, arranged in three
divisions, cavalry, chariots, and infantry, to begin the campaign. The
armies of Egypt were composed chiefly of mercenaries. Cush (see the
margin), the Nubian negro, and Phut, the Libyans of Mauritania, supplied
the heavy-armed soldiers [Jer 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md);
and Ludim, the Hamite Lydians of North Africa (see [Gen
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013) note.md), a weaker race, served as
light-armed troops.

[Jeremiah 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 46:10</span></span>

Rather, But that "day belongeth to the Lord Yahweh of hosts." They march
forth in haughty confidence, but that day, the day to which they are
looking forward in proud hope of victory, is Yahweh's day, a day on
which they will be the victims sacrificed in His honor.

[Jeremiah 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 46:11</span></span>

Balm - i. e., balsam, the usual remedy for wounds [Jer
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md).

In vain shalt ... - Or, in vain hast thou multiplied medicines:
healing-plaster hast thou none. Nothing shall avail to heal the blow.

[Jeremiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 46:12</span></span>

The land - The earth; the world rings with the cry of grief.

Against the mighty - Against the mighty man, i. e., one mighty man
against another. The champions hired to fight Egypt's battle get in one
another's way, and so are slaughtered together.

[Jeremiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 46:13</span></span>

A new prophecy, foretelling the successful invasion of Egypt by
Nebuchadnezzar, has been appended to the hymn of triumph, because they
both relate to the same kingdom. This prophecy was probably spoken in
Egypt to warn the Jews there, that the country which they were so
obstinately determined to make their refuge would share the fate of
their native land.

How ... should come - Or, concerning the coming "of Nebuchadrezzar."

[Jeremiah 46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 46:14</span></span>

The sword shall devour - "The sword" hath devoured "those round about
thee." One after another the nations have been consumed by
Nebuehadnezzar; and now at length Tyre, which so long had withstood him,
has fallen, and his forces are about to fall upon Egypt ([Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016) note.md). Hence, the summons to
arrange themselves in their ranks, and to prepare for battle by putting
on their armor.

[Jeremiah 46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 46:15</span></span>

Translate it: "Why is thy mighty one cast down? He stood not, because
Yahweh thrust him down." The "mighty one" is explained by the Septuagint
to be the bull Apis. Thus:

\(1\) the chief deity of Egypt [Jer
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md);

\(2\) the army of mercenaries [Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md);

\(3\) the king, Pharaoh [Jer 46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017.md),
are the three upon whom the Egyptians trusted.

[Jeremiah 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 46:16</span></span>

Literally, as in the margin, i. e., Yahweh hath made many to stumble.

Arise ... - The Egyptian army being composed of mercenaries, has no
patriotic feeling and immediately that the battle is lost, they propose
to abandon the country which has hired them, and return each to his
native land.

[Jeremiah 46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 46:17</span></span>

Translate it with the versions: "They have called (or, Call ye) the name
of Pharaoh king of Egypt - A noise: he hath overstepped the appointed
time." For this custom of giving prophetic names see [Jer
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003.md); [Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md), ... The words mean that Pharaoh
is a mere empty sound, and that he has allowed the years of prosperity,
which he enjoyed at the beginning of his reign, to pass by; having
misused them, nothing now remains but his ruin.

[Jeremiah 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 46:18</span></span>

As Tabor is - Omit "is." "He shall come like a Tabor among the
mountains, and like a Carmel by the sea." Tabor rises in the form of a
truncated cone to the height of about 1,350 feet above the plain of
Esdraelon, its total height above the sea level being 1,805 feet. Its
shape and the wide extent of the plain around it make it a far more
conspicuous object than other mountains in sight of equal elevation.
Similarly, Carmel is a most commanding mountain, because it rises from
the edge of the wide expanse of the Mediterranean.

[Jeremiah 46:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 46:19</span></span>

Literally, "O thou inhabitant daughter of Egypt," an equivalent here for
Egypt and its whole population.

Furnish thyself ... - literally, make for thee vessels of banishment,
not merely the packages necessary, but their outfit generally.

[Jeremiah 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 46:20</span></span>

Is like - Or, is. Her god was the steer Apis [Jer
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md), and she is the spouse.

But destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north - More probably, "a
gadfly from the north has come upon her." This is a sort of insect which
stings the oxen and drives them to madness. Compare [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md).

[Jeremiah 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 46:21</span></span>

Rather, "Also her hirelings in the midst of her are like calves of the
stall." The mercenaries of Egypt - Nubians, Moors, and Lydians [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md) - were destroyed at the battle of
Carchemish, and their place was taken by hirelings from Asia Minor,
Carians, and Ionians, whom Hophra took into his pay to the number of
30,000 men. These he settled in the midst of Egypt, in the fertile lands
above Bubastis, in the Delta, where, well paid and fed and with great
privileges, they became as calves of the stall. Their mutiny cost Hophra
his crown.

For they also are turned back ... - literally, "for they also have
lurched the back, they flee together, they stand not: for the day of
their destruction is come upon them, the time of their visitations."

[Jeremiah 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 46:22</span></span>

The voice thereof - Her voice, i. e., the voice of Egypt. The word here
probably means the busy sound of life and activity in the towns of
Egypt, the tramping of her hosts, and the turmoil of camp and city. All
this at the approach of the Chaldaean army shall depart, as the snake
flees away when disturbed in its haunts by the wood-cutters.

March with an army - Advance with might.

With axes - The comparison of the Chaldaean warriors to woodcutters
arose from their being armed with axes. As the Israelites did not use
the battle-axe, their imagination would be the more forcibly struck by
this weapon.

[Jeremiah 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 46:23</span></span>

Or, "They have cut down her forest, saith Yahweh, for it is
impenetrable," i. e., just as a pathless forest must be cleared to
assist agriculture and the passage to and fro of men, so must the false
worship and the material prosperity of Egypt be overthrown.

Grasshoppers - The invading host advances as multitudinous as the
locusts which consume the whole vegetation of the land on which they
alight.

[Jeremiah 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 46:24</span></span>

The daughter ... - i. e., the inhabitants "of Egypt shall be disgraced."

[Jeremiah 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 46:25</span></span>

The multitude of No - Rather, Amon of No. Ammon or Jupiter-Ammon was the
first of the supreme triad of Thebes. He was the deity invisible and
unfathomable, whose name signifies "the concealed." No-Amon, is the
sacred city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt. First then Yahweh's
anger falls upon the representatives of the highest divine and human
powers, Amon of No and Pharaoh. It next punishes Egypt generally, and
her gods and her kings, for each city had its special divinity, and
inferior rulers were placed in the several parts of the country.
Finally, Pharaoh is again mentioned, with "all who trust in him," i. e.,
the Jews, who had made Egypt their confidence and not God.

[Jeremiah 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 46:26</span></span>

Afterward ... - The invasion of Nebuchadnezzar is to be a passing
calamity, the severity of which will be felt chiefly by the Jews, but no
subjugation of Egypt is to be attempted, and after the Chaldaean army
has withdrawn things will resume their former course.

[Jeremiah 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 46:27</span></span>

These two verses are a repetition of [Jer
30:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md), with those slight variations
which Jeremiah always makes when quoting himself. Egypt's fall and
restoration have been foretold; but the prophet closes with a word of
exhortation to the many erring Jews who dwelt there. Why should they
flee from their country, and trust in a pagan power, instead of
endeavoring to live in a manner worthy of the noble destiny which was
their true glory and ground of confidence?
