### [Ezekiel Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 29:0</span></span>

In Ezek. 29-32 we read prophecies against Egypt which, uttered (with the
exception of [Eze 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017) to the end.md) in
regular succession, predict the downfall of Pharaoh Hophra and the
desolation of Egypt.

Eze. 29:1-16: the first prophecy against Egypt delivered some months
before the preceding prophecies against Tyre (see [Eze
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001).md), the prophecies against the
nations being given, not in their chronological, but in their
geographical order, according to their nearness to Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 29:1</span></span>

The tenth year - Jerusalem had been besieged, but not taken. Jeremiah
delivered his prophecy against Egypt, about the time when the approach
of Pharaoh Hophra's army caused the Chaldaeans for the time to raise the
siege [Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md). This was the solitary
instance of Egypt meddling with the affairs of Palestine or Syria after
the battle of Carchemish (compare [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md); it met with speedy punishment.

[Ezekiel 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 29:3</span></span>

The king is addressed as the embodiment of the state.

Dragon - Here the crocodile, the great monster of the Nile, which was
regarded very differently in different parts of Egypt. By some it was
worshipped and embalmed after death, and cities were named after it (e.
g., in the Arsinoite nome). Others viewed it with the utmost abhorrence.
An animal so terrible, so venerated, or so abhorred, was an apt image of
the proud Egyptian monarch - the more so, perhaps, because it was in
truth less formidable than it appeared, and often became an easy prey to
such as assailed it with skill and courage.

Lieth in the midst of his rivers - Sais, the royal city, during the
twenty-sixth dynasty was in the Delta, in the very midst of the various
branches and canals of the Nile.

My river is mine own ... - It was the common boast of Hophra (Apries),
that "not even a god could dispossess him of power." The river was at
all times the source of fertility and wealth to Egypt, but especially so
to the Saite kings, who had their royal residence on the river, and
encouraged contact with foreigners, by whose commerce the kingdom was
greatly enriched.

[Ezekiel 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 29:4</span></span>

Hooks in thy jaws - Compare [Job 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002.md).
The crocodile is thus rendered an easy prey.

Fish of thy rivers - i. e., the allies of Egypt shall be involved in her
ruin.

[Ezekiel 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 29:6</span></span>

Staff of reed - The "reed" was especially appropriate to Egypt as the
natural product of its river.

[Ezekiel 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 29:7</span></span>

So Egypt was continually proving to Israel, to Jehoiakim and to
Zedekiah. The tenses are present not past.

To be at a stand - Others, "to totter."

[Ezekiel 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 29:10</span></span>

From the tower of Syene - Or, as in the margin, "Migdol" ("tower") was
about two miles from Suez. "Syene" was the most southern town in Egypt,
on the borders of Ethiopia, in the Thebaid, on the eastern bank of the
Nile. The modern Assvan lies a little to the northeast of the ancient
Syene.

We have no record of the circumstances of the Chaldsaean invasion of
Egypt, but it is possible that it did not take place until after the
fall of Tyre. We gather of what nature it must have been by comparing
the description of the results of Assyrian conquest ([Isa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025) ff.md). Minute fulfillment of every
detail of prophecy is not to be insisted upon, but only the general fact
that Egypt would for a time, described as 40 years, be in a state of
collapse. No great stress is to be laid on the exact number of years.
The number of years passed in the wilderness became to the Hebrews a
significant period of chastisement.

Nebuchadnezzars occupation of Egypt was of no long duration, and his
ravages, though severe, must have been partial. Peace with Babylon was
favorable to the development of home-works, but since the peace was in
truth subjugation, it was hollow and in fact ruinous. Further, it is to
be remembered that God fulfils His decree by a gradual rather than an
immediate process. The ravages of Nebuchadnezzar were the beginning of
the end, and all the desolation which followed may be looked upon as a
continuous fulfillment of God's decree. The savage fury with which
Cambyses swept over Egypt amply realized all that Ezekiel foretold. Many
places recovered some wealth and prosperity, but from the time of
Herodotus the kingdom never again became really independent. Egyptian
rulers gave place to Persian, Persian to the successors of Alexander the
Great, who gave place in turn to Rome. So thoroughly was the prophecy of
Ezekiel fulfilled [Eze 29:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md).

[Ezekiel 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 29:13</span></span>

A similar respite was promised to Moab [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md), to Ammon [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md), and to Tyre [Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md).

[Ezekiel 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 29:14</span></span>

Pathros - The Thebaid or Upper Egypt, the original seat of the kingdom.

The land of their habitation - Rather, as margin, i. e., the home of the
restored exiles.

[Ezekiel 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 29:16</span></span>

The false confidence of the Israelites "brought to remembrance," i. e.,
discovered in the sight of God and man their "iniquity," i. e., their
treachery and perjury to the Chaldaeans; their falsehood being made
evident when they "look after" (turn to) the Egyptians and seek their
aid in rebellion. The ruin of Egypt shall put an end to all this.

[Ezekiel 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 29:17</span></span>

The prophet places this prediction out of chronological order, that he
may point out what had not been stated in the foregoing prophecy,
namely, that the agent who should strike the first blow on Egypt should
be the Chaldaean king, Nebuchadnezzar.

[Eze 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md)

Yet had he no wages - It is not improbable that the Tyrians before they
surrendered their island-citadel managed to remove much of their
treasure; but others exlplain the verse; that the siege and capture of
Tyre is to be regarded as the "work" appointed, and the possession of
Egypt as the "reward or wages" for the work.

[Eze 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#021.md)

Egypt being the antagonist of the people of God, her overthrow
inaugurated the triumph of good over evil.

The horn ... - Or, "an horn to bud forth to the house of Israel."

I will give thee the opening of the mouth - When these things should
begin to come to pass the prophet's mouth should be opened to declare
their meaning, and to make known the end to which all was tending.
