### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 29:0</span></span>

This chapter relates solely to Jerusalem - here called Ariel (see the
note at [Isa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001).md). It is not
immediately connected with the preceding or the following chapters,
though it is not improbable they were delivered about the same time. At
what time this was delivered is not known, though it is evident that it
was before the invasion by Sennacherib, and probably before the time of
Hezekiah. The prophecy in the chapter consists of two parts: (I) The
invasion of Judea by Sennacherib, and its sudden deliverance [Isa
29:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001). (II.md) A reproof of the Jews for
their infidelity and impiety.

I. The invasion of Judea, and the distress that would be brought upon
Jerusalem, and its sudden deliverance [Isa
29:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md).

1\. Ariel would be filled with grief and distress [Isa
29:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md).

2\. Yahweh would encamp against it and besiege it, and it would be
greatly straitened and humbled [Isa
29:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md).

3\. Yet the besieging army would be visited with sudden calamity and
destruction - represented here by thunder, and tempest, and flame [Isa
29:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md).

4\. The enemy would vanish as a dream, and all his hopes would be
disappointed, as the hopes of a hungry and thirsty man are disappointed
who dreams of having satisfied his hunger and thirst [Isa
29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md).

There can be no doubt, I think, that this portion of the prophecy refers
to the sudden and dreadful overthrow of Sennacherib; and the design of
this portion of the prophecy is to give the assurance, that though
Jerusalem would be in imminent danger, yet it would be suddenly
delivered.

II\. The second part consists of reproofs of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem for their infidelity and impiety.

1\. They were full of error, and all classes of people were wandering
from God - reeling under error like a drunken man [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md).

2\. A spirit of blindness and stupidity everywhere prevailed among the
people [Isa 29:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md).

3\. Formality and external regard for the institutions of religion
prevailed, but without its life and power [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md).

4\. They attempted to lay deep and skillful plans to hide their
wickedness from Yahweh [Isa 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md).

5\. They were unjust in their judgments, making a man an offender for a
word, and perverting just judgment [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md).

6\. For all this they should be punished.

\(a\) The wisdom of their wise men should fail [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md).

\(b\) The scorner would be consumed [Isa
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md).

7\. There would be an overturning, and the people would be made
acquainted with the law of God, and the truly pious would be comforted
[Isa 29:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md). Those who had erred
would be reformed, and would come to the true knowledge of God [Isa
29:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md).

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

Wo - (compare the note at [Isa 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md).

To Ariel - There can be no doubt that Jerusalem is here intended. The
declaration that it was the city where David dwelt, as well as the
entire scope of the prophecy, proves this. But still, it is not quiet
clear why the city is here called "Ariel." The margin reads, 'O Ariel,
that is, the lion of God.' The word (אריאל 'ărı̂y'ēl) is compounded of
two words, and is usually supposed to be made up of ארי 'ărı̂y, "a lion,"
and אל 'ēl, God; and if this interpretation is correct, it is equivalent
to a strong, mighty, fierce lion - where the word 'God' is used to
denote greatness in the same way as the lofty cedars of Lebanon are
called cedars of God; that is, lofty cedars. The "lion" is an emblem of
strength, and a strong lion is an emblem of a mighty warrior or hero.
[Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020.md) : 'He slew two "lion-like"
אריאל 'ărı̂y'êl men of Moab' [Ch1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022.md). This use of the word to denote
a hero is common in Arabic (see Bachart, "Hieroz.," i. 3. 1).

If this be the sense in which it is used here, then it is applied to
Jerusalem under the image of a hero, and particularly as the place which
was distinguished under David as the capital of a kingdom that was so
celebrated for its triumphs in war. The word 'Ariel' is, however, used
in another sense in the Scriptures, to denote an "altar" [Eze
43:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015.md), where in the Hebrew the word
is "Ariel." This name is given to the altar, Bachart supposes
("Hieroz.," i. 3. 1), because the altar of burnt-offering "devours" as
it were the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey. Gesenius, however,
has suggested another reason why the word is given to the altar, since
he says that the word ארי 'ărı̂y is the same as one used in Arabic to
denote a fire-hearth, and that the altar was so called because it was
the place of perpetual burnt-offering. The name "Ariel," is, doubtless,
given in Ezekiel to an altar; and it may be given here to Jerusalem
because it was the place of the altar, or of the public worship of God.
The Chaldee renders it, 'Wo to the altar, the altar which was
constructed in the city where David dwelt.' It seems to me that this
view better suits the connection, and particularly [Isa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002) (see Note.md), than to suppose that
the name is given to Jerusalem because it was like a lion. If this be
the true interpretation, then it is so called because Jerusalem was the
place of the burnt-offering, or of the public worship of God; the place
where the fire, as on a hearth, continually burned on the altar.

The city where David dwelt - David took the hill of Zion from the
Jebusites, and made it the capital of his kingdom [Sa2
5:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md). Lowth renders this, 'The city
which David besieged.' So the Septuagint: Ἐπολέμησε Epolemēse; and so
the Vulgate, Expugnavit. The word חנה chânâh properly means "to encamp,
to pitch one's tent" [Gen 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#017.md), "to
station oneself." It is also used in the sense of encamping "against"
anyone, that is, to make war upon or to attack (see [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md), and [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md); [Sa2
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#028).md); and Jerome and others have
supposed that it has this meaning here in accordance with the
interpretation of the Septuagint and the Vulgate. But the more correct
idea is probably that in our translation, that David pitched his tent
there; that is, that he made it his dwelling-place.

Add ye year to year - That is, 'go on year after year, suffer one year
to glide on after another in the course which you are pursuing.' This
seems to be used ironically, and to denote that they were going on one
year after another in the observance of the feasts; walking the round of
external ceremonies as if the fact that David had dwelt there, and that
that was the place of the great altar of worship, constituted perfect
security. One of the sins charged on them in this chapter was
"formality" and "heartlessness" in their devotions [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md), and this seems to be referred
to here.

Let them kill sacrifices - Margin, 'Cut off the heads.' The word here
rendered 'kill' (נקף nâqaph) may mean to smite; to hew; to cut down [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md); [Job
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026.md). But it has also another
signification which better accords with this place. It denotes to make a
circle, to revolve; to go round a place [Jos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003.md), [Jos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#011.md); to surround [Kg1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024.md); [Kg2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#014.md); [Psa
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#009.md); [Psa
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md); [Psa
88:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#018.md). The word rendered 'sacrifices'
(חגים chagiym) may mean a sacrifice [Exo
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md); [Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md); [Mal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#003.md), but it more commonly and properly
denotes feasts or festivals [Exo 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#009.md);
[Exo 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md); [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md); [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010.md), [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md); [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md), [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); [Ch2
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008.md); [Neh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014.md); [Hos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md), [Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013.md). Here the sense is, 'let the
festivals go round;' that is, let them revolve as it were in a
perpetual, unmeaning circle, until the judgments due to such heartless
service shall come upon you. The whole address is evidently ironical,
and designed to denote that all their service was an unvarying
repetition of heartless forms.

[Isaiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 29:2</span></span>

Yet I will distress Ariel - The reference here is doubtless to the siege
which God says [Isa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md) he would
bring upon the guilty and formal city.

And there shall be heaviness and sorrow - This was true of the city in
the siege of Sennacherib, to which this probably refers. Though the city
was delivered in a sudden and remarkable manner (see the note at [Isa
29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007).md), yet it was also true that it
was reduced to great distress (see Isa. 36; 37)

And it shall be unto me as Ariel - This phrase shows that in [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md) Jerusalem is called 'Ariel,'
because it contained the great altar, and was the place of sacrifice.
The word "Ariel" here is to be understood in the sense "of the hearth of
the great altar;" and the meaning is, 'I will indeed make Jerusalem like
the great altar; I will make it the burning place of wrath where my
enemies shall be consumed as if they were on the altar of burnt
sacrifice.' Thus in [Isa 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md), it is
said of Yahweh that his 'fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.'
This is a strong expression, denoting the calamity that was approaching;
and though the main reference in this whole passage is to the distress
that would come upon them in the invasion of Sennacherib, yet there is
no impropriety in supposing that there was presented to the mind of the
prophet in vision the image of the total ruin that would come yet upon
the city by the Chaldeans - when the temple, the palaces, and the
dwellings of the magnificent city of David would be in flames, and like
a vast blazing altar consuming that which was laid upon it.

[Isaiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 29:3</span></span>

And I will camp against thee - That is, I will cause an army to pitch
their tents there for a siege. God regards the armies which he would
employ as under his control, and speaks of them as if he would do it
himself (see the note at [Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

Round about - (כדוּר kadûr). As in a circle; that is, he would encompass
or encircle the city. The word used here דור dûr in [Isa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018.md), means a ball, but here it
evidently means a circle; and the sense is, that the army of the
besiegers would encompass the city. A similar form of expression occurs
in regard to Jerusalem in [Luk 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md) :
'For the days shall come upon thee, than thine enemies shall cast a
trench (χάρακα charaka - "a rampart," a "mound") about thee σοί soi
"against thee"), and "compass thee round" περικυκλώτονσί σε
perikuklōsousi se, "encircle thee").' So also [Luk
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020.md). The Septuagint renders this, 'I
will encompass thee as David did;' evidently reading it as if it were
כדוּד kadûd; and Lowth observes that two manuscripts thus read it, and
he himself adopts it. But the authority for correcting the Hebrew text
in this way is not sufficient, nor is it necessary. The idea in the
present reading is a clear one, and evidently means that the armies of
Sennacherib would encompass the city.

With a mount - A rampart; a fortification. Or, rather, perhaps, the word
מצב mutsâb means a post, a military station, from יצב yâtsab, "to place,
to station." The word in this form occurs nowhere else in the
Scriptures, but the word מצב matsâb occurs in [Sa1
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md); [Sa1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md), [Sa1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004.md); [Sa2
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#014.md), in the sense of a military
post, or garrison.

I will rise forts - That is, ramparts, such as were usually thrown up
against a besieged city, meaning that it should be subjected to the
regular process of a siege. The Septuagint reads, Πύργου Purgou;
'Towers;' and so also two manuscripts by changing the Hebrew letter ד
(d) into the Hebrew letter ר (r). But there is no necessity for altering
the Hebrew text. Lowth prefers the reading of the Septuagint.

[Isaiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 29:4</span></span>

And shalt speak out of the ground - (see the note at [Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md). The sense here is, that
Jerusalem, that had been accustomed to pride itself on its strength I
would be greatly humbled and subdued. Its loud and lofty tone would be
changed. It would use the suppressed language of fear and alarm as if it
spoke from the dust, or in a shrill small voice, like the pretended
conversers with the dead.

And thy speech shall whisper out of the dust - Margin, 'Peep,' or
'Chirp,' (see the note at [Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 29:5</span></span>

Moreover - These verses [Isa 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md),
[Isa 29:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md) contain a beautiful
description of the destruction of the army of Sennacherib. Though they
had laid the plan of a regular siege; though the city, in itself, would
not be able to hold out against them, and all was alarm and conscious
imbecility within; yet in an instant the siege would be raised, and the
advancing hosts of the Assyrians would all be gone.

The multitude of thy strangers - The multitude of the strangers that
shall besiege thee; called 'thy strangers,' because they besieged, or
oppressed thee. The word 'strangers' here, as elsewhere, means
"foreigners" (see the note at [Isa
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md); compare [Isa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md); [Isa
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md); [Isa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001.md); [Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md), [Isa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005.md); [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md); [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010).md).

Shall be like small dust - Light, fine dust that is easily dissipated by
the wind.

Of the terrible ones - Of the invading, besieging army, that is so much
the object of dread.

As chaff that passeth away - (see the note at [Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013).md). This image of chaff driven
before the wind, to denote the sudden and entire discomfiture of
enemies, is common in the Scriptures (see [Job
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md); [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md); [Psa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013).md).

Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly - The forces of Sennacherib were
destroyed in a single night by the angel of the Lord ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md); the note at [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012.md), [Isa
10:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028), note.md), and the siege of
Jerusalem was of course immediately raised.

[Isaiah 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 29:6</span></span>

Thou shalt be visited - This is an address to the mighty army of the
Assyrian. Such transitions are not uncommon in the writings of Isaiah.
His eye seems to have been directed in vision to the hosts of
Sennacherib, and to their sudden dispersion and destruction [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md), and by a sudden, but not
unnatural transition, he turns and addresses the army itself, with the
assurance that it should be punished (compare [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030).md).

With thunder ... - The army of the Assyrian was cut off by an angel sent
forth from God [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md). It is
"possible" that all the agents here referred to may have been employed
in the destruction of the Assyrian host, though they are not
particularly specified in the history. But it is not absolutely.
necessary to understand this verse in this manner. The image of thunder,
earthquakes, and lightning, is an impressive representation of sudden
and awful judgment in any manner. The sense is, that they should be
suddenly destroyed by the direct visitation of God (see [Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md).

And the flame of devouring fire - Lightning, that seems to "devour," or
that suddenly consumes.

[Isaiah 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 29:7</span></span>

And the multitude of all the nations - The Assyrians, and their allied
hosts.

And her munition - Her fortresses, castles, places of strength [Sa2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007.md); [Ecc
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014.md); [Eze
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md).

Shall be as a dream of a night vision - In a dream we seem to see the
objects of which we think as really as when awake, and hence, they are
called visions, and visions of the night [Gen
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#002.md); [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013.md); [Job
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014.md); [Dan
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028.md); [Dan
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#005.md); [Dan
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md), [Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md), [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015.md). The specific idea here is not
that of the "suddenness" with which objects seen in a dream appear and
then vanish, but it is that which occurs in [Isa
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md), of one who dreams of eating and
drinking, but who awakes, and is hungry and thirsty still. So it was
with the Assyrian. He had set his heart on the wealth of Jerusalem. He
had earnestly desired to possess that city - as a hungry man desires to
satisfy the cravings of his appetite. But it would be like the vision of
the night; and on that fatal morning on which he should awake from his
fond dream [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md), he would find
all his hopes dissipated, and the longcherished desire of his soul
unsatisfied still.

[Isaiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 29:8</span></span>

It shall even be ... - This is a most striking figure representing the
earnest desire of the Assyrian to possess the city of Jerusalem, and his
utter disappointment. The comparison is elegant and beautiful in the
highest degree. It is performed up to great perfection; and is perfectly
suited to illustrate the object in view. The same image substantially is
found in the classic writers; and this, says Lowth, may, for beauty and
ingenuity, fairly come in competition with one of the most elegant of
Virgil (greatly improved from Homer, "Iliad" xxii. 119), where he has
applied to a different purpose, but not so happily, the same image of
the ineffectual workings of the imagination in a dream:

Ac veluti in somnis oculos ubi languida pressit

Nocte quies, nequicquam avidos extendere cursus

Velle videmur, et in mediis conatibus aegri

Succidimus; non lingua valet, non corpore notae

Sufficiunt vires; nec, vox, nec verba scquuniur.

AEniad xii. 908.

And as when slumber seals the closing sight,

The sick wild fancy labors in the night,

Some dreadful visionary foe we shun,

With airy strides, but strive in vain to run;

In vain our baffled limbs their powers essay,

We faint, we struggle, sink, and fall away;

Drained of our strength we neither fight nor fly,

And on the tongue the struggling accents die.

Pitt.

See also Lucretius (iv. 10-19), who also expresses the same image as
Isaiah. As the simile of the prophet is drawn from nature, an extract
which describes the actual occurrence of such a circumstance will be
agreeable. 'The scarcity of water,' says Park, 'was greater here at
Bubaker than at Benown. Day and night the wells were crowded with cattle
lowing, and fighting with each other to come at the trough. Excessive
thirst made many of them furious; others being too weak to contend for
the water, endeavored to quench their thirst by devouring the black mud
from the gutters near the wells; which they did with great avidity,
though it was commonly fatal to them. This great scarcity of water was
felt by all the people of the camp; and by none more than myself. I
begged water from the negro slaves that attended the camp, but with very
indifferent success, for though I let no opportunity slip, and was very
urgent in my solicitations both to the Moors and to the negroes, I was
but ill supplied, and frequently passed the night in the situation of
Tantalus. No sooner had I shut my eyes, than fancy would convey me to
the streams and rivera of my native land; there, as I wandered along the
verdant bank, I surveyed the clear stream with transport, and hastened
to swallow the delightful draught; but alas! disappointment awakened me,
and I found myself a lonely captive, perishing of thirst amid the wilds
of Africa.' ("Travels in Africa").

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

Stay yourselves - Thus far the prophet had given a description of the
siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib, and of his sudden overthrow. He now
turns to the Jews, and reproves their stupidity, formality, and
hypocrisy; and the remainder of the chapter is occupied with a statement
of the prevalence of these sins, of the judgments that must follow, and
of the fact that there should yet be an extensive reformation, and
turning to the Lord. The word rendered 'stay yourselves' (התמהמהוּ
hı̂temahemehû) means properly "to linger," tarry, delay [Gen
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016.md); [Gen
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#010.md); [Sa2
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#028.md). Here it seems to denote that
state of mind in which anyone is "fixed in astonishment;" in which one
stops, and stares at some strange and unexpected occurrence. The object
of amazement which the prophet supposes would excite astonishment, was
the stupidity, dulness, and hypocrisy of a people who had been so
signally favored (compare [Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005).md).

Cry ye out, and cry - There is in the original here a paronomasia which
cannot be conveyed in a translation. The word which is used (השׁתעשׁעוּ
hı̂sheta‛ashe‛û) is one form of the verb שׁעע shâ‛a‛, which means,
usually, to make smooth, rub, spread over; hence, in the Hithpael form
which is used here, to be spread over; and hence, is applied to the eyes
[Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md), to denote blindness, as if
they were overspread with something by reason of which they could not
see. Here it probably means, 'be ye dazzled and blinded,' that is, ye be
astonished, as in the former part of the verse. The idea seems to be
that of some object of sudden astonishment that dims the sights and
takes away all the powers of vision. The word is used in the same sense
in [Isa 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003.md); compare [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md); [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019.md). Probably the idea here would be
well expressed by our word "stare," 'stare and look with a stupid
surprise;' denoting the attitude and condition of a man who is amazed at
some remarkable and unlooked for spectacle.

They are drunken, but not with wine - The people of Jerusalem. They reel
and stagger, but the cause is not that they are drunken with wine. It is
a moral and spiritual intoxication and reeling. They err in their
doctrines and practice; and it is with them as it is with a drunken man
that sees nothing clearly or correctly, and cannot walk steadily. They
have perverted all doctrines; they err in their views of God and his
truth, and they are irregular and corrupt in their conduct.

[Isaiah 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 29:10</span></span>

For the Lord hath poured out upon you - The word rendered 'hath poured
out' (נסך nâsak) is usually referred to the act of pouring out a
libation, or drink-offering in worship [Exo
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md); [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md); [Isa
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md). Here it means that Yahweh had,
as it were, "drenched them" (Septuagint, πεπότικε pepotike) with a
spirit of stupefaction. This is traced to God in accordance with the
usual custom in the Bible, by which his providential agency is
recognized in all events (see the notes at [Isa
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md). Compare the notes at [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008).md), where this passage is quoted
from the Septuagint, and is applied to the Jews in the time of the
apostle Paul.

The spirit of deep, sleep - The word rendered 'deep sleep,' is the same
as is used in [Gen 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md), to denote the
sleep that God brought on Adam; and in [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md), to denote the deep sleep that
fell on Abraham, and when a horror of great darkness fell upon him; and
in [Sa1 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#012.md), to denote the deep
sleep that came upon Saul when David approached and took away the spear
and the cruise of water from his bolster. Here it means spiritual
sluggishness, inactivity, stupidity, that prevailed everywhere among the
people in regard to the things of religion.

The seers - Those that see visions, another name for the prophets (see
the note at [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md).

Hath he covered - That is, he has covered their eyes; or they are all
blind.

[Isaiah 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 29:11</span></span>

And the vision of all - The vision of all the prophets; that is, all the
revelations which God has made to you (see the note at [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md). The prophet refers not only to
his own communications, but to those of his contemporaries, and of all
who had gone before him. The sense is, that although they had the
communications which God had made to them, yet they did not understand
them. They were as ignorant of their true nature as a man who can read
is of the contents of a letter that is sealed up, or as a man who cannot
read is of the contents of a book that is handed to him.

As the words of a book - Margin, 'Letter.' The word ספר sêpher may mean
either. It properly means anything which is "written" ([Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md), [Deu
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#003.md); [Jer
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011.md); [Dan
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004).md), but is commonly applied to a
book [Exo 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md); [Jos
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md); [Jos
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#034.md); [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md).

That is sealed - (see the note at [Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 29:12</span></span>

And the book is delivered ... - That is, they are just as ignorant of
the true nature and meaning of the revelations of God as a man is of the
contents of a book who is utterly unable to read.

[Isaiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 29:13</span></span>

Wherefore the Lord said - This verse, with the following, is designed to
denounce the divine judgment on their formality of worship. They kept up
the forms of religion, but they witcheld the affections of their hearts
from God; and he, therefore, says that he will proceed to inflict on
them exemplary and deserved punishment.

This people draw near me - That is, in the temple, and in the forms of
external devotion.

And with their lips do honor me - They professedly celebrate my praise,
and acknowledge me in the forms of devotion.

But have removed their heart - Have witcheld the affections of their
hearts.

And their fear toward me - The worship of God is often represented as
"fear" [Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); [Psa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md); [Psa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md); [Pro
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md).

Is taught by the precept of men - That is, their views, instead of
having been derived from the Scriptures, were drawn from the doctrines
of mankind. Our Saviour referred to this passage, and applied it to the
hypocrites of his own time [Mat
15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md). The latter part of it is,
however, not quoted literally from the Hebrew, nor from the Septuagint,
but retains the sense: 'But in vain do they worship me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men.' He quoted it as strikingly
descriptive of the people when he lived, not as saying that Isaiah
referred directly to his times.

[Isaiah 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 29:14</span></span>

I will proceed to do - Hebrew, 'I will add to do;' that is, I will do
it.

For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish - I will bring calamity
upon them which shall baffle all the skill and wisdom of their wise men.

Shall be hid - That is, shall not appear; shall vanish. It shall not be
sufficient to prevent the calamities that shall come upon the nation.

[Isaiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 29:15</span></span>

Woe unto them that seek deep ... - That is, who attempt to conceal their
"real" intentions under a plausible exterior, and correct outward
deportment. This is most strikingly descriptive of the character of a
hypocrite who seeks to conceal his plans and his purposes from the eyes
of people and of God. His external conduct is fair; his observance of
the duties of religion exemplary; his attendance on the means of grace
and the worship of God regular; his professions loud and constant, but
the whole design is to "conceal" his real sentiments, and to accomplish
some sinister and wicked purpose by it.

From the Lord - This proves that the design of the hypocrite is not
always to attempt to deceive his fellowmen, but that he also aims to
deceive God.

[Isaiah 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 29:16</span></span>

Surely your turning of things upside down - Your perversion of all
things. They had no just views of truth. They deemed mere formality to
be all that was required. They attempted to conceal their plans even
from Yahweh; and everything in the opinions and practice of the nation
had become perverted and erroneous. There has been much diversity in
rendering this phrase. Luther renders it, 'O how perverse ye are.' Lowth
renders it,

'Perverse as ye are! shall the potter be esteemed as the clay?'

Rosenmuller also accords with this interpretation, and renders it, 'O
your perversity,' etc. The sense of the passage seems to be this: 'Your
"changing of things" is just as absurd as it would be for the thing
formed to say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? It is
as absurd for you to find fault with the government of God as it would
be for the clay to complain of want of skill in the potter. You complain
of God's laws, and worship Him according to the commandments of people.
You complain of his requirements, and offer to him the service of the
mouth and the lip, and witchold the heart. You suppose that God does not
see you, and do your deeds in darkness. All this supposes that God is
destitute of wisdom, and cannot see what is done, and it is just as
absurd as it would be in the clay to complain that the potter who
fashions it has no understanding.'

Shall be esteemed ... - The "literal" translation of this passage would
be, 'Your perverseness is as if the potter should be esteemed as the
clay;' that is, as if he was no more qualified to form anything than the
clay itself.

For shall the work ... - This passage is quoted by the apostle Paul [Rom
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md) to show the right which God
has to do with his creatures as shall seem good in his sight, and the
impropriety of complaining of his distinguishing mercy in choosing to
life those whom he pleases. The sense of the passage is, that it would
be absurd for that which is made to complain of the maker as having no
intelligence, and no right to make it as he does. It would be absurd in
the piece of pottery to complain of the potter as if he had no skill;
and it is equally absurd in a man to complain of God, or to regard him
as destitute of wisdom.

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

Is it not yet a very little while - The idea here is, 'you have greatly
perverted things in Jerusalem. The time is at hand when there shall be
"other" overturnings - when the wicked shall be cut off, and when there
shall be poured out upon the nation such judgments that the deaf shall
hear, and the blind see, and when those who have erred in spirit shall
come to understanding' [Isa 29:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md).

And Lebanon shall be tutored into a fruitful field - This is evidently a
proverbial expression, denoting any great revolution of things. It is
probable that in the times of Isaiah the whole chain of Lebanon was
uncultivated, as the word is evidently used here in opposition to a
fruitful field (see the note at [Isa
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013).md). The word which is rendered
'fruitful field' (כרמל karmel) properly denotes "a fruitful field," or a
finely cultivated country (see [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018).md). It is also applied to a
celebrated mountain or promontory on the Mediterranean Sea, on the
southern boundary of the tribe of Asher. It runs northwest of the plain
of Esdraelon, and ends in a promontory or cape, and forms the bay of
Acco. The mountain or promontory is about 1500 feet high; and abounds in
caves or grottoes, and was celebrated as being the residence of the
prophets Elijah and Elisha (see [Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019.md), [Kg1
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042.md); [Kg2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#025.md); [Kg2
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#025.md); [Kg2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023.md); compare the note at [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002).md). More than a thousand caves are
said to exist on the west side of the mountain, which it is said were
formerly inhabited by monks. But the word here is to be taken,
doubtless, as it is in our translation, as denoting a well-cultivated
country. Lebanon, that is now barren and uncultivated, shall soon become
a fertile and productive field. That is, there shall be changes among
the Jews that shall be as great as if Lebanon should become an
extensively cultivated region, abounding in fruits, and vines, and
harvests. The idea is this: 'The nation is now perverse, sinful, formal,
and hypocritical. But the time of change shall come. The wicked shall be
reformed; the number of the pious shall be increased; and the pure
worship of God shall succeed this general formality and hypocrisy. The
prophet does not say when this would be. He simply affirms that it would
be before "a great while" - and it may, perhaps, be referred to the
times succeeding the captivity (compare [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md); [Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md); [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).md).

And the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest - That is, there shall be
great changes in the nation, as if a well-cultivated field should be
allowed to lie waste, and grow up into a forest. Perhaps it means that
that which was then apparently flourishing would be overthrown, and the
land lie waste. Those who were apparently in prosperity, would be
humbled and punished. The effect of this revolution is stated in the
following verses.

[Isaiah 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 29:18</span></span>

Shall the deaf hear the words of the book - They who now have the law
and do not understand it, the people who seem to be deaf to all that God
says, shall hear and understand it.

Shall see out of obscurity ... - That is, the darkness being removed,
they shall see clearly the truth of God, and discern and love its
beauty. Their eyes are now blinded, but then they shall see clearly.

[Isaiah 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 29:19</span></span>

The meek - The word 'meek' usually refers to those who are patient in
the reception of injuries, but the Hebrew word used here (ענוים
‛ănâviym) means properly the oppressed, the afflicted, the unhappy [Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md); [Psa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012.md), [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md); [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md). It involves usually the idea of
humility or "virtuous suffering" (compare [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md); [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md); [Psa
69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033).md). Here it may denote the pious
of the land who were oppressed, and subjected to trials.

Shall increase - Margin, as in Hebrew, 'Add.' It means, that they should
greatly rejoice in the Lord. They should see the evidence of the
fulfillment of his predictions; they should see the oppressors punished
[Isa 29:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md), and Yahweh coming forth
to be their protector and defender [Isa
29:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md).

And the poor among men - The poor people; or the needy. Doubtless the
idea is that of the pious poor; those who feared God, and who had been
subjected to the trials of oppression and poverty.

[Isaiah 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 29:20</span></span>

For the terrible one - The violent one (עריץ ‛ârı̂yts), the oppressor,
who had exercised cruelty over them. This, I suppose, refers to the
haughty among the Jews themselves; to those who held offices of power,
and who abused them to oppress the poor and needy.

And the scorner - (see [Isa 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md),
[Isa 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022).md).

Is consumed - Shall be entirely destroyed.

And all that watch for iniquity - That is, who anxiously seek for
opportunities to commit iniquity.

[Isaiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 29:21</span></span>

That make a man an offender - literally, 'who cause a man to sin'
(מחטיאי machăṭı̂y'ēy); that is, who hold a man to be guilty, or a
criminal. Lowth renders this singularly enough:

'Who bewildered the poor man in speaking.'

Grotius supposes it means, 'Who on account of the word of God, that is,
the true prophecy, treat men as guilty of crime.' Calvin supposes it
means, 'Who bear with impatience the reproofs and denunciation of the
prophets, and who endeavor to pervert and distort their meaning.' Hence,
he supposes, they proposed artful and captious questions by which they
might ensnare them. Others suppose that it refers to the fact that they
led people into sin by their new doctrines and false views. The
connection, however, seems to require that it should be understood of
judicial proceedings, and the sense is probably correctly expressed by
Noyes:

'Who condemned the poor man in his cause.'

This interpretation is also that which is proposed by Rosenmuller and
Gesenius. According to the interpretation above suggested, the word
rendered 'who make an offender,' means the same as who holds one guilty,
that is, condemns.

A man - (אדם 'âdâm). It is well known that this word stands in
contradistinction to אישׁ 'ı̂ysh, and denotes usually a poor man, a man
in humble life, in opposition to one who is rich or of more elevated
rank. This is probably the sense here, and the meaning is, that they
condemned the poor man; that is, that they were partial in their
judgments.

For a word - (בדבר bedâbâr). "In" a word; denoting the same as "a cause"
that is tried before a court of justice. So [Exo
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016.md) : 'When they have "a matter"
(דבר dâbâr "a word"), they come unto me.' So [Exo
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022.md) : 'And it shoji be that every
great "matter" (Hebrew every great "word") that they shall bring unto
me.' So [Exo 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#008.md) (in the English
version 9): 'For all manner of trespass,' Hebrew for every word of
trespass; that is, for every suit concerning a breach of trust. So also
[Exo 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md) : 'If any man have "any
matters" to do,' (Hebrew, 'any "words, '") that is, if anyone has a law
suit.

And lay a snare - To lay a snare is to devise a plan to deceive, or get
into their possession; as birds are caught in snares that are concealed
from their view.

That reproveth - Or rather, that "contended" or "pleaded;" that is, that
had a cause. The word יכח yâkach means often to contend with any one; to
strive; to seek to confute; to attempt to defend or justify, as in a
court of law [Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md); [Job
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#005.md); [Job
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021.md); [Job
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004.md). It is also applied to deciding a
case in law, or pronouncing a decision [Isa
11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003.md); [Gen
31:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#037.md); [Job
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033.md). Here it means one who has
brought a suit, or who is engaged in a legal cause.

In the gate - Gates of cities being places of concourse, were usually
resorted to for transacting business, and courts were usually held in
them [Gen 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#018.md); [Deu
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005.md), [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md); [Deu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#019.md); [Deu
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#015.md); [Deu
25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#006.md); [Rut
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md). The sense is, they endeavored to
pervert justice, and to bring the man who had a cause before them,
completely within their power, so that they might use him for their own
purposes, at the same time that they seemed to be deciding the cause
justly.

And turn aside the just - The man who has a just or righteous cause.

For a thing of nought - Or a decision which is empty, vain (בתהו
batôhû), and which should be regarded as null and void,

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 29:22</span></span>

Therefore - In consequence of the happy change which shall take place in
the nation when the oppressor shall be removed [Isa
29:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md), and when the poor and the
meek shall rejoice [Isa 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md), and the
ignorant shall be instructed [Isa
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md), Jacob shall not be ashamed of
his descendants as he was before, nor have cause to blush in regard to
his posterity.

Who redeemed Abraham - That is, who brought him out of a land of
idolaters, and rescued him from the abominations of idolatry. The word
'redeem,' here (פדה pâdâh), properly denotes "to ransom, that is, to
redeem a captive, or a prisoner with a price paid [Exo
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md); [Exo
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#020.md). But it is also used as meaning
to deliver in general, without reference to a price, to free in any
manner, to recover [Sa2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009.md); [Kg1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#029.md); [Job
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#020.md); [Psa
71:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023.md). It is used in this general
sense here; and means that Yahweh had rescued Abraham from the evils of
idolatry, and made him his friend. The connection, also, would seem to
imply that there was a reference to the promise which was made to
Abraham that he should have a numerous posterity (see [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023).md).

Jacob shall not now be ashamed - This is a poetical introduction of
Jacob as the ancestor of the Jewish people, as if the venerable
patriarch were looking upon his children. Their deportment had been such
as would suffuse a father's cheeks with shame; henceforward in the
reformation that would occur he would "not" be ashamed of them, but
would look on them with approbation.

Neither shall his face wax pale - The face usually becomes pale with
fear: but this may also occur from any strong emotion. Disappointment
may produce paleness as well as fear; and perhaps the idea may be that
the face of Jacob should no more become pallid as "if" he had been
disappointed in regard to the hopes which he had cherished of his sons.

[Isaiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 29:23</span></span>

But when he seeth his children - The sense is, 'he shall not be ashamed
of his sons, for he shall see them henceforward walking in the ways of
piety and virtue.'

The work of my hands - That is, this change [Isa
29:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md) by which the nation will be
reformed, will be produced by the agency of God himself. The sentiment
is in accordance with the doctrines of the Scriptures everywhere, that
people are recovered from sin by the agency of God alone (compare [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md); [Eph
