### [Isaiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 48:0</span></span>

This chapter contains renewed assurances of the deliverance of the exile
Jews from Babylon. It is designed, in the main, to state the causes for
which the captivity would occur, and to furnish the assurance also that,
notwitbstanding the judgment that should come upon them, God would
deliver them from bondage. It contains lamentations that there was a
necessity for bringing these calamities upon them; assurances that God
had loved them; appeals to themselves in proof that all that they had
suffered had been predicted; and a solemn command to go forth out of
Babylon. It is to be regarded as addressed to the exile Jews in Babylon,
though it is not improbable that the prophet designed it to have a
bearing on the Jews of his own time, as given to idolatry, and that he
intended that the former part of the chapter should be an indirect
rebuke to them by showing them the consequences of their proneness to
idolatry. The chapter is exceedingly tender, and full of love, and is an
expression of the kindness which God has for his own people.

It is not very susceptible of division, or of easy analysis, but the
following topics present probably the main points of the chapter.

I. A reproof of the Jews for their idolatrous tendencies, reminding them
that this was the characteristic of the nation, and indirectly
intimating that all their calamitics would come upon them on account of
that [Isa 48:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md). This part contains:

1\. An address to the Jews, as those who professed to worship God,
though in insincerity and hypocrisy [Isa
48:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md).

2\. A solemn declaration of God that he had foretold all these events,
and that they could not be traced in any manner to the power of idols,
and that he, therefore, was God [Isa
48:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md).

3\. Their character had been that of rebellion and treachery, from the
very commencement of their history [Isa
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md).

II\. Promises of deliverance from the evils which their sins had brought
upon them, with expressions of regret that their conduct hurl been such
as to make such judgments necessary [Isa
48:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md).

1\. God says that he would restrain his anger, and would not wholly cut
them of [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md).

2\. The purpose of the calamities brought upon them was to refine and
purify them, as in a furnace [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md).

3\. All his dealings with them had been for his own glory, and so as to
promote his own honor [Isa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md).

4\. An assertion of his power, and his ability to accomplish what he had
purposed [Isa 48:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md).

5\. He had solemnly purposed to destroy Babylon, and the Chaldeans [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md).

6\. He had raised up for that purpose one who should accomplish his
designs [Isa 48:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015.md).

7\. He expresses his deep regret that their conduct had been such as to
make it necessary to bring these heavy judgments on them, and states
what would have been the result if thcy had observed his commandments.
Their peace would have been as a river, their righteousness as the waves
of the sea, and their offspring as the sand [Isa
48:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md).

III\. A command to go forth from Babylon, implying the highest assurance
that they should be delivered from their long and painful captivity [Isa
48:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md).

1\. They should go out with singing and triumph; and the ends of the
earth should see it [Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md).

2\. God would provide for them in the deserts, and cause the waters to
flow for them in their journey through the pathless wilderness [Isa
48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md).

The chapter concludes with a general declaration that the wicked have no
peace, implying that they only have peace and security who put their
trust in God [Isa 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md).

[Isaiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 48:1</span></span>

Hear ye this - This is an address to the Jews regarded as in Babylon,
and is designed to remind them of their origin, and of their privileges
as the descendants of Jacob, and having the name of Israel (compare the
notes at [Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

And are come forth out of the waters of Judah - This metaphor is taken
from a fountain which sends forth its streams of water, and the idea is,
that they owed their origin to Judah, as the streams flowed from a
fountain. A similar figure is used by Balaam in describing the vast
increase of the Jews: Num. 34 'He shall pour the waters out of his
buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters.' So in [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md) : 'The fountain of Jacob shall
be upon a land of corn and wine.' So [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md) :

Bless ye God in the congregations,

Jehovah, ye that are of the fountain of Israel.

Margin

The idea is, that Judah was the fountain, or origin of the people who
were then exiled in Babylon. The ten tribes had revolted, and had been
carried away, and the name of Benjamin had been absorbed in that of
Judah, and this had become the common name of the nation. Perhaps Judah
is mentioned here with honor as the fountain of the nation, because it
was from him that the Messiah was to descend [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md) : and this mention of his name
would serve to bring that promise to view, and would be an assurance
that the nation would not be destroyed, nor the power finally depart
until He should come.

Which swear by the name - Who worship Yahweh, and acknowledge him as the
only true God (see the notes at [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); compare [Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016).md).

And make mention - That is, in your prayers and praises. You acknowledge
him, and profess to worship him.

But not in truth - In a hypocritical manner; not in sincerity. Compare
[Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md) : 'And though they say, The
Lord liveth, surely they swear falsely.'

[Isaiah 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 48:2</span></span>

For they call themselves of the holy city - Of Jerusalem (see [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md); [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md); [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md); [Mat
27:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#053); Rev. 21:2-27.md). The word
rendered 'for' here, (כי kı̂y) means, as it often does, "although"; and
the sense is, although they call themselves of the holy city, they do
not worship God in sincerity and truth. Jerusalem was called 'the holy
city,' because the temple, the ark, and the symbol of the divine
presence were there, and it was the place where God was worshipped. It
was deemed sacred by the Jews, and they regarded it as sufficient proof
of goodness, it would seem, that they had dwelt there. Even in Babylon
they would pride themselves on this, and suppose, perhaps, that it
entitled them to divine protection and favor.

And stay themselves upon the God of Israel - In time of danger and trial
they profess to seek him, and to commit their cause to him.

The Lord of hosts is his name - (See the notes at [Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md). The object of the prophet in
here mentioning his holy name is, probably, to show them the guilt of
their conduct. He was Yahweh, the source of all existence. He was the
God of all the hosts of heaven, and all the armies on earth. How wicked,
therefore, it was to come before him in a false and hypocritical manner,
and while they were professedly worshipping him, to be really offering
their hearts to idols, and to be characteristically inclined to relapse
into idolatry!

[Isaiah 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 48:3</span></span>

I have declared the former things - That is, in former times I have
predicted future events by the prophets, which have come to pass as they
were foretold. Though the fulfillment might have appeared to be long
delayed, yet it came to pass at the very time, showing it to be an exact
fulfillment of the prophecy. The design of thus referring to the former
predictions is, to remind them of their proneness to disregard his
declarations, and to recall to their attention the fact that all that he
said would be certainly accomplished. As a people, they had been prone
to disbelieve his word. He saw that the same thing would take place in
Babylon, and that there also they would disbelieve his prophecies about
raising up Cyrus, and restoring them to their own land. He therefore
endeavors to anticipate this, by reminding them of their former
unbelief, and of the fact that all that he had foretold in former times
had come to pass.

From the beginning - In regard to this, and the meaning of the phrase,
'the former things, see the notes at [Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md); [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md). The phrase. 'former things,'
refers to the things which precede others; the series, or order of
events.

I did them suddenly - They came to pass at an unexpected time; when you
were not looking for them, and when perhaps you were doubting whether
they would occur, or were calling in question the divine veracity. The
idea is, that God in like manner would, certainly, and suddenly,
accomplish his predictions about Babylon, and their release from their
captivity.

[Isaiah 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 48:4</span></span>

Because I knew that thou art obstinate - I made these frequent
predictions, and fulfilled them in this striking manner, because I knew
that as a people, you were prone to unbelief, and in order that you
might have the most full and undoubted demonstration of the truth of
what was declared. As they were disinclined to credit his promises, and
as he saw that in their long captivity they would be prone to disbelieve
what he had said respecting their deliverance under Cyrus, he had,
therefore, given them these numerous evidences of the certainty of the
fulfillment of all his prophecies, in order that their minds might
credit what he said about their return to their own land.

That thou art obstinate - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Hard,' The sense is, that
they were obstinate and intractable - an expression probably taken from
a bullock which refuses to receive the yoke. The word hard, as
expressive of obstinacy, is often combined with others. Thus, in [Exo
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md); [Exo
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009.md), 'hard of neck,' that is,
stiff-necked, stubborn; 'hard of face' [Eze
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004.md); 'hard of heart' [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md). The idea is, that they were, as a
people, obstinate, rebellious, and indisposed to submit to the laws of
God - a charge which is often brought against them by the sacred
writers, and which is abundantly verified by all their history as a
people (compare [Exo 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md); [Exo
33:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#003.md); [Exo
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009.md); [Deu
9:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006.md); [Deu
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027.md); [Ch2
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008.md); [Eze
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

Thy neck is an iron sinew - The word גיד giyd means properly a cord,
thong, or band; then a nerve, sinew, muscle, or tendon. The metaphor is
taken from oxen when they make their neck stiff, and refuse to submit it
to the yoke.

And thy brow brass - Thy forehead is hard and insensible as brass. The
phrase is applied to the shameless brow of a harloi [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md), where there is an utter want of
modesty, and consummate impudence. A brow of brass is an image of
insensibility, or obstinacy (so in [Jer
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028).md).

[Isaiah 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 48:5</span></span>

I have even from the beginning declared it to thee - He had foretold
future events, so that they had abundant demonstration thai he was the
true God, and so that they could not be under a mistake in regard to the
source of their deliverances from danger.

Mine idol hath done them - The idols and molten images had not foretold
these events and when they came to pass, it could not, therefore, be
pretended that they had been produced by idols. By predicting them,
Yahweh kept up the proof that he was the true God, and demonstrated that
he alone was worthy of their confidence and regard.

[Isaiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

Thou hast heard - You are witnesses that the prediction was uttered long
before it was fulfilled.

See all this - Behold how it is all fulfilled. Bear witness that the
event is as it was predicted.

And will ye not declare it? - Will you not bear witness to the entire
fulfillment of the prophecy? God appeals to them as qualified to testify
that what he had declared had come to pass, and calls on them to make
this known as a demonstration that he alone was God (see the notes at
[Isa 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md).

I have showed thee new things from this time - From this time I make
known a thing which has not before occurred, that you may have a similar
demonstration that Yahweh is God. The 'new thing' here referred to, is,
doubtless, the prediction of the deliverance from the captivity at
Babylon - a new thing, in contradistinction from those which had been
before predicted, and which were already fulfilled (see the notes at
[Isa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009.md); [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019).md).

Even hidden things - Events which are so concealed that they could not
be conjectured by any political sagacity, or by any contemplation of
mere natural causes. They are, as it were, laid up in dark
treasurehouses (compare [Isa 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003).md),
and they can be known only by him to whom 'the darkness shineth as the
day,' and to whom the night and the day are both alike [Psa
139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012.md).

[Isaiah 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 48:7</span></span>

They are created now - The Septuagint renders this, Νῦν γίνεται nun
ginetai - 'Done now;' and many expositors interpret it in the sense that
they are now brought into light, as if they were created. Aben Ezra
renders it, 'They are decreed and determined by me.' Rosenmuller
supposes that it refers to the revelation, or making known those things.
Lowth renders it, 'They are produced now, and not of old.' Noyes, 'It is
revealed now, and not long ago.' But the sense is probably this: God is
saying that they did not foresee them, nor were they able to conjecture
them by the contemplation of any natural causes. There were no natural
causes in operation at the time the predictions were made, respecting
the destruction of Babylon, by which it could be conjectured that that
event would take place; and when the event occurred, it was as if it had
been created anew. It was the result of Almighty power and energy, and
was to be traced to him alone. The sense is, that it could no more be
predicted, at the time when the prophecy was uttered, from the operation
of any natural causes, than an act of creation could be predicted, which
depended on the exercise of the divine will alone. It was a case which
God only could understand, in the same way as he alone could understand
the purposes and the time of his own act of creating the world.

And not from the beginning - The events have not been so formed from the
beginning that they could be predicted by the operation of natural
causes, and by political sagacity.

Even before the day when thou heardest them not - The sense of this
probably, 'and before this day thou hast not heard of them;' that is,
these predictions pertain to new events, and are not to be found in
antecedent prophecies. The prophet did not speak now of the deliverance
from Egypt, and of the blessings of the promised land, which had
constituted the burden of many of the former prophecies, but he spoke of
a new thing; of the deliverance from Babylon, and of events which they
could by no natural sagacity anticipate, so that they could claim that
they knew them.

Lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them - The taking of Babylon by
Cyrus, and the deliverance of the exiles from their bondage, are events
which can be foreseen only by God. Yet the prophet says that he had
declared these events, which thus lay entirely beyond the power of human
conjecture, long before they occurred, so that they could not possibly
pretend that they knew them by any natural sagacity, or that an idol had
effected this.

[Isaiah 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 48:8</span></span>

Yea, thou heardest not - This verse is designed to show not only that
these events could not have been foreseen by them, but that when they
were actually made known to them, they were stupid, dull, and
incredulous. It is not only re-affirming what had been said in the
previous verses, but is designed to show that they were
characteristically and constantly a perverse, hardened, and insensible
people. The phrase, 'thou heardest not,' therefore means that they did
not attend to these things when they were uttered, and were prone to
disregard God, and all his predictions and promises.

Yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened - The word 'that'
which is here supplied by our translators, greatly obscures the sense.
The meaning is, 'from the first, thine ear was not open to receive them'
(Lowth); that is, they were stupid, insensible, and uniformly prone to
disregard the messages of God. To open the ear, denotes a prompt and
ready attention to what God says (see [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005).md), and to close the ear denotes an
unwillingness to listen to what is spoken by him.

For I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously - I knew that, as
a people, you are characteristically false and perfidious. This does not
refer to their conduct toward other nations, but to their conduct toward
God. They were false and unfaithful to him, and the sense is, that if
God had not foretold the destruction of Babylon and their deliverance
from it so clearly that there could have been no misunderstanding of it,
and no perversion, they would have also perverted this, and ascribed it
to something else than to him. Perhaps they might, as their forefathers
did, when they came out of Egypt [Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md), have ascribed it to idols
(compare [Isa 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005).md), and the result
might have been a relapse into that very sin, to cure which was the
design of removing them to Babylon.'

And wast called - This was thy appropriate appellation.

From the womb - From the very commencement of your national history;
from the very time when the nation was first organized (see the notes at
[Isa 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 48:9</span></span>

For my name's sake - (See the notes at [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md); compare [Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005).md). It is possible that the design
of this verse may be, to answer an objection. 'If the character of the
nation is such, it might be said, 'why should God desire to restore them
again to their own land? If their sins have been so great as to make
these heavy judgments proper, why not suffer them to remain under the
infliction of the deserved judgment? Why should God interpose? why raise
up Cyrus? why overthrow Babylon? why conduct them across a pathless
wilderness, and provide for them in a sandy desert?' To this the answer
is, that it was not on their account. It was not because they were
deserving of his favor, nor was it primarily and mainly in order that
they might be happy. It was on his own account - in order to show his
covenant faithfulness; his fidelity to the promises made to their
fathers, his mercy, his compassion, his readiness to pardon, and his
unchanging love. And this is the reason why he 'defers his anger,' in
relation to any of the children of people. His own glory, and not their
happiness, is the main object in view. And this is right. The glory, the
honor, and the happiness of God, are of more importance than the welfare
of any of his creatures; because, first, they are in themselves of more
importance, just in proportion as God is more elevated than any of his
creatures; and, secondly, the welfare of any or all of his creatures
depends on the maintaining of the honor of God, and of his government,
and on the manifestation of his perfections to the universe (see the
treatise of President Edwards on The end for which God created the
world, in Works, vol. iii. New York Ed. 1830).

Will I defer mine anger - That is, I will spare you, and restore you
again to your own land (see the note at [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011).md).

And for my praise will I refrain for thee - Will I refrain my anger in
reference to you as a nation. The word used here (חטם châṭam) denotes
properly to muzzle, and is commonly employed with reference to an animal
in order to tame or subdue it. Here it means that God would restrain
himself; He would not put forth His anger in order to destroy them.
Learn hence:

1\. That God acts with reference to his own glory, in order to manifest
his own perfections, and to secure his praise.

2\. That the reason why the wicked are not cut off sooner in their
transgressions is, that He may show his forbearance, and secure praise
by long-suffering.

3\. That the reason why the righteous are kept amidst their frequent
failures in duty, their unfaithfulness, and their many imperfections,
is, that God may get glory by showing his covenant fidelity.

4\. That it is one evidence of piety - and one that is indispensable -
that there should be a willingness thai God should secure his own glory
in his own way, and that there should be a constant desire that his
praise should be promoted, whatever may befall his creatures.

[Isaiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 48:10</span></span>

Behold, I have refined thee - This refers to the Jews in their
afflictions and captivity in Babylon. It states one design which he had
in view in these afflictions - to purify them. The word used here, and
rendered 'refined' (צרף tsâraph), means properly to melt; to smelt
metals; to subject them to the action of fire, in order to remove the
scoria or dross from them (see the notes at [Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025).md). Then it means to purify in any
manner. Here it means that God had used these afflictions for the same
purpose for which fire is used in regard to metals, in order that every
impurity in their moral and religious character might be removed.

But not with silver - Margin, 'For.' Hebrew, בכסף bekâseph. Many
different interpretations of this have been proposed. Jerome renders it,
Non quasi argentum - 'Not as silver.' The Septuagint, Οὐχ ἕνεκεν
ἀργυρίου ouch heneken arguriou - 'Not on account of silver.' Grotius
explains it, 'I have a long time tried thee by afflictions, but nothing
good appears in thee;' that is, I have not found you to be silver, or to
be pure, as when a worker in metals applies the usual heat to a mass of
ore for the purpose of separating the dross, and obtains no silver.
Gesenius explains it to mean, 'I sought to make you better by
afflictions, but the end was not reached; you were not as silver which
is obtained by melting, but as dross.' Rosenmuller supposes it means,
that he had not tried them with that intensity of heat which was
necessary to melt and refine silver; and remarks, that those skilled in
metals observe that gold is easily liquified, but that silver requires a
more intense heat to purify it. Jarchi renders it, 'Not by the fire of
Gehenna as silver is melted by the fire.' Kimchi explains it, 'Not as
one who is smelting silver, and who removes all the scoria from it, and
so consumes it that nothing but pure silver remains. If that had been
done, but few of you would have been left.' Vitringa supposes that it
means, that God had sent them to Babylon to be purified, yet it was not
to be done with silver. It was by the agency of a people who were
wicked, sinful, and unbelieving. Amidst this variety of interpretation,
it is difficult to determine the sense. Probably it may be, I have
melted thee, and found no silver; or the result has not been that you
have been shown to be pure by all your trials; and thus it will agree
with what is said above, that they were perverse, false, and rebellious
as a people.

I have chosen thee - Lowth renders this, 'I have tried thee.' The
Vulgate and the Septuagint, however, render it, 'I have chosen thee.'
The word used here (from בחר bâchar) means, according to Gesenius:

1\. To prove, to try, to examine; and the primary idea, according to
him, is that of rubbing with the lapis Lydius, or touchstone, or else of
cutting in pieces for the purpose of examining.

2\. To approve, choose, or select. This is the most common signification
in the Hebrew Bible [Gen 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011.md); [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md); [Jos
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md); [Job
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014.md); [Job
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005.md); [Job
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025.md).

3\. To delight in [Gen 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md); [Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md). Probably the meaning here is, 'I
have proved or tried thee in the furnace of affliction.' It was true,
however, that God had chosen or selected their nation to be his people
when they were suffering in the furnace of affliction in Egypt; and it
is also true that God chooses sinners now, or converts them, as the
result of heavy affliction. Possibly this may be the idea, that their
affliction had prepared them to embrace his offers and to seek
consolation in him; and he may design to teach that one effect of
affliction is to prepare the mind to embrace the offers of mercy.

In the furnace of affliction - Referring particularly to their trials in
Babylon. Afflictions are often likened to fire - from the fact that fire
is used to purify or try metals, and afflictions have the same object in
reference to the people of God.

[Isaiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 48:11</span></span>

For mine own sake - (See [Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009).md).
The expression here is repeated to denote emphasis. He had thrown them
into the furnace of affliction on his own account, that is, in order
that his own name should not be profaned by their irreligion and
idolatry, and that the glory which was due to him should not be given to
idols.

For how should my name be polluted? - The sense is, that it would be
inconsistent with his perfections to see his name profaned without
endeavoring to correct and prevent it; and in order to this, that he
brought these afflictions upon them. They had profaned his name by their
irreligion and hypocrisy. In order to correct this evil, and to prevent
it in future, he had brought these national judgments on them, and
removed them to Babylon. The doctrine here taught is, that when the
conduct of God's professed people is such as to dishonor God, and to
make his name a subject of reproach with the wicked, he will visit them
with heavy judgments. He cannot indulge them in a course of life which
will reflect dishonor on his own name.

And I will not give my glory unto another - (See the notes at [Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008).md). The sense here is this. The
Jews had, as a nation, been prone to ascribe to idols that which was due
to God alone. To correct this, and to make an effectual reform, he had
removed them to Babylon, and doomed them to a long and painful captivity
there. It may be added that the punishment was effectual, and that their
long trial in Babylon served entirely to correct all their idolatrous
propensities as a nation.

[Isaiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 48:12</span></span>

Hearken unto me - This is a solemn call on the Jews in Babylon to attend
to what he was now about to say. It is the commencement of a new part of
the argument, containing the assurance that he would deliver them, and
utterly destroy the Chaldeans. He begins, therefore, by asserting that
he is the only true God, and that he is able to accomplish all his
purposes.

My called - The people whom I have chosen, or called.

I am he - I am the same; or I am the true and only God.

I am the first - (See the notes at [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md); [Isa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 48:13</span></span>

Mine hand also hath laid ... - I am the Creator of all things, and I
have all power, and am abundantly able to deliver you from all your
foes.

And my right hand hath spanned the heavens - Margin, 'The palm of my
right hand hath spread out.' The sense is, that he by his right hand had
spanned, or measured the heavens. The phrase is designed to show his
greatness and his power (see the notes at [Isa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012).md).

When I call unto them - (See the note at [Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026).md). The sense here is, that he who
had power thus to command the hosts of heaven, and to secure their
perfect obedience by his word, had power also to defend his people, and
to deliver them from their foes, and conduct them in safety to their own
land.

[Isaiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 48:14</span></span>

All ye, assemble yourselves and hear - Ye Jews who are in Babylon,
gather together, and listen to the assurance that God is able to protect
you, and that he will certainly restore you to your own country.

Which among them - Who among the pagan?

Hath declared these things? - The things relating to the destruction of
Babylon, and the rescue of his people. This is an appeal similar to that
which God has often made, that he alone can predict future events. None
of the astrologers, soothsayers, or diviners of Babylon had been able to
foretell the expedition and the conquests of Cyrus, and the capture of
the city. If they had been able to foresee the danger, they might have
guarded against it, and the city might have been saved. But God had
predieted it a hundred and fifty years before it occurred, and this
demonstrated, therefore, that he alone was God.

The Lord hath loved him - Lowth renders this, 'He whom Jehovah hath
loved will execute his will on Babylon.' The Septuagint renders it,
'Loving thee, I will execute thy will against Babylon.' There can be no
doubt that it refers to Cyrus, and that the meaning is, that he whom
Yahweh had loved would accomplish his will on Babylon. It does not
necessarily mean that Yahweh was pleased with his moral character, or
that he was a pious man (compare the notes at [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md); but that he was so well pleased
with him as an instrument to accomplish his purposes, that he chose to
employ him for that end.

He will do his pleasure on Babylon - He will accomplish all his desire
on that city; that is, he will take, and subdue it. The word 'his' here,
may refer either to Cyrus or to Yahweh. Probably it means that Cyrus
would do to Babylon what would be pleasing to Yahweh.

And his arm - The arm is a symbol of strength, and is the instrument by
which we execute our purposes.

[Isaiah 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 48:15</span></span>

I, even I, have spoken - The word 'I' is repeated to give emphasis, and
to furnish the utmost security that it should be certainly accomplished.
It means, that Yahweh, and he alone, had declared this, and that it was
entirely by his power that Cyrus had been raised up, and had been made
prosperous.

Yea, I have called him - (See the note at [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002).md).

I have brought him - I have led him on his way in his conquests.

And he shall make his way prosperous - There is a change of person in
this verse, from the first to the third, which is quite common in the
writings of Isaiah.

[Isaiah 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 48:16</span></span>

Come ye near unto me - (see [Isa
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014).md).

I have not spoken in secret - (See the notes at [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019).md). The idea here is, that he had
foretold the raising up of Cyrus, and his agency in delivering his
people, in terms so plain that it could not be pretended that it was
conjectured, and so clear that there was no ambiguity.

From the time that it was, there am I - From the moment when the purpose
was formed, and when it began to be accomplished, I was present. The
meaning is, that everything in regard to raising up Cyrus, and to the
delivery of his people from Babylon, had been entirely under his
direction.

And now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me - There is evidently a
change in the speaker here. In the former part of the verse, it is God
who is the speaker. But here it is he who is sent to bear the message.
Or, if this should be regarded, as Lowth and many others suppose, as the
Messiah who is speaking to the exiled Jews, then it is an assertion that
he had been sent by the Lord God and his Spirit. There is an ambiguity
in the original, which is not retained in our common translation. The
Hebrew is, 'And now the Lord Yahweh hath sent me, and his Spirit;' and
the meaning may be either, as in our version, that Yahweh and his Spirit
were united in sending the person referred to; or that Yahweh had sent
him, and at the same time had also sent his Spirit to accompany what he
said. Grotius renders it, 'The Lord by his Spirit bas given me these
commands.' Jerome understands the word 'Spirit' as in the nominative
case, and as meaning that the Spirit united with Yahweh in sending the
person referred to - Dominus Deus misit me, et spiritus ejus.

The Septuagint, like the Hebrew, is ambiguous - Νῦν κύριος κύριος
ἀπέστειλέ με, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ Nun kurios kurios apesteile me, kai to
pneuma autou. The Syriac has the same ambiguity. The Targum of Jonathan
renders it, 'And now Jehovah (יי yeyâ) God hath sent me and his word.'
It is perhaps not possible to determine, where there is such ambiguity
in the form of the sentence, what is the exact meaning. As it is not
common, however, in the Scriptures, to speak of the Spirit of God as
sending, or commissioning his servants; and as the object of the speaker
here is evidently to conciliate respect for his message as being
inspired, it is probably to be regarded as meaning that he had been sent
by Yahweh and was accompanied wish the influences of his Spirit. Many of
the reformers, and others since their time have supposed that this
refers to the Messiah, and have endeavored to derive a demonstration
from this verse of the doctrine of the Trinity. The argument which it
has been supposed these words furnish on that subject is, that three
persons are here spoken of, the person who sends, that is, God the
Father; the person who is sent, that is, the Messiah; and the Spirit,
who concurs in sending him, or by whom he is endowed.

But the evidence that this refers to the Messiah is too slight to lay
the foundation for such an argument; and nothing is gained to the cause
of truth by such forced interpretations. "It would require more time,
and toil, and ingenuity to demonstrate that this passage had reference
to the Messiah, than it would to demontstrate the doctrine of the
Trinity, and the divinity of the Redeemer, from the unequivocal
declarations of the New Testament." The remark of Calvin on this verse,
and on this mode of interpretation, is full of good sense: 'This verse
interpreters explain in different ways. Many refer it to Christ, but the
prophet designs no such thing. Cavendoe autem sunt nobis violentoe et
coactoe interpretations - (such forced and violent interpretations are
to be avoided).' The scope of the passage demands, as it seems to me,
that it should be referred to the prophet himself. His object is, to
state that he had not come at his own instance, or without being
commissioned. He had been sent by God, and was attended by the Spirit of
inspiration. He foretold events which the Spirit of God alone could make
known to mankind. It is, therefore, a strong asseveration that his words
demanded their attention, and that they had every ground of consolation,
and every possible evidence that they would be rescued from their
bondage. It is a full claim to divine inspiration, and is one of the
many assertions which are found in the Scriptures where the sacred
writers claim to have been sent by God, and taught by his Spirit.

[Isaiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 48:17</span></span>

Thy Redeemer - (see the notes at [Isa
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

Which teacheth thee to profit - Teaching you what things will most
conduce to your welfare. The reference hero is chiefly to the
afflictions which they suffered in Babylon.

Which leadeth thee - I am thy conductor and guide. God taught them, as
he does his people now, by his Providence, his revealed word, and his
Spirit, the way in which they ought to go. It is one of his
characteristics that he is the guide and director of his people.

[Isaiah 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 48:18</span></span>

O that thou hadst heardened to my commandments! - This expresses the
earnest wish and desire of God. He would greatly have preferred that
they should have kept his law. He had no wish that they should sin, and
that these judgments should come upon them. The doctrine taught here is,
that God greatly prefers that people should keep his laws. He does not
desire that they should be sinners, or that they should be punished. It
was so with regard to the Jews; and it is so with regard to all. In all
cases, at all times, and with reference to all his creatures, he prefers
holiness to sin; he sincerely desires that there should be perfect
obedience to his commandments. It is to be remarked also that this is
not merely prospective, or a declaration in the abstract. It relates to
sin which had been actually committed, and proves that even in regard to
that, God would have preferred that it had not been committed. A
declaration remarkably similar to this, occurs in [Psa
81:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#013.md) :

O that my people had hearkened unto me,

And Israel had walked in my ways;

I should soon have subdued their' enemies,

And turned their hand against their adversaries

The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him:

But their time should have endured forever.

He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat;

And with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

Compare [Deu 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md); [Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md); [Eze
18:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md); [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Luk
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#021.md).

Then had thy peace been as a river - The word 'peace' here (שׁלום
shâlôm) means properly wholeness, soundness, and then health, welfare,
prosperity, good of every kind. It then denotes peace, as opposed to
war, and also concord and friendship. Here it evidently denotes
prosperity in general, as opposed to the calamities which actually came
upon them.

As a river - That is, abundant - like a full, flowing river that fills
the banks, and that conveys fertility and blessedness through a land.
'The pagan, in order to represent the Universal power and beneficence of
Jupiter, used the symbol of a river flowing from his throne; and to this
the Sycophant in Plautus alludes (Trium. Act iv. Sc. 2, v. 98), in his
saying that he had been at the head of that river:

Ad caput amuis, quod de coelo exoritur, sub solio Jovis.

See also Wemyss' Key to the Symbolical Language of Scripture, Art.
River. Rivers are often used by the sacred writers, and particularly by
Isaiah, as symbolic of plenty and prosperity [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md); [Isa
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md); [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md).

And thy righteousness - The holiness and purity of the nation. Religion,
with all its inestimable benefits, would have abounded to the utmost
extent. Instead of the prevailing idolatry and corruption, the hypocrisy
and insincerity which had abounded, and which made it necessary for God
to remote them, they would have been distinguished for sincerity,
purity, love, and holy living. And this proves that God would have
preferred the prevalence of holiness.

As the waves of the sea - What can be a more beautiful or sublime image
than this? What can more strikingly represent the abundance of the
blessings which religion would have conferred on the land? The waves of
the sea are an emblem of plenty. They seem to be boundless. They are
constantly rolling. And so their righteousness would have been without a
limit; and would have rolled unceasingly its rich blessings over the
land. Who can doubt that this would have been a better state, a
condition to have been preferred to that which actually existed?

[Isaiah 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 48:19</span></span>

Thy seed also - Instead of being reduced to a small number by the
calamities incident to war, and being comparatively a small and
powerless people sighing in captivity, you would have been a numerous
and mighty nation. This is another of the blessings which would have
followed from obedience to the commands of God; and it proves that a
people who are virtuous and pious will become numerous and mighty. Vice,
and the diseases, the wars, and the divine judgments consequent on vice,
tend to depopulate a nation, and to make it feeble.

As the sand - This is often used to denote a great and indefinite number
([Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md); [Gen
41:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#049.md); [Jos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004.md); [Jdg
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md); [Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md); [Sa2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011.md); [Kg1
4:20-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md); [Job
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018.md); [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018.md); the note at [Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md); [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); [Rev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008).md).

And the offspring of thy bowels - On the meaning of the word used here,
see the note at [Isa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024.md).

Like the gravel thereof - literally, 'and the offspring of thy bowels
shall be like its bowels,' that is, like the offspring of the sea. The
phrase refers probably rather to the fish of the sea, or the innumerable
multitudes of animals that swim in the sea, than to the gravel. There is
no place where the word means gravel. Jerome, however, renders it, Ut
lapili ejus - 'As its pebbles.' The Septuagint Ὡς ὁ χοῦς τῆς γῆς hōs ho
chous tēs gēs - 'As the dust of the earth.' The Chaldee also renders it,
'As the stones of the sea;' and the Syriac also. The sense is
essentially the same that the number of the people of the nation would
have been vast.

His name should not have been out off - This does not imply of necessity
that they had ceased to be a nation when they were in Babylon, but the
meaning is, that if they had been, and would continue to be, obedient,
their national existence would have been perpetuated to the end of time.
When they ceased to be a distinct nation, and their name was blotted out
among the kingdoms of the earth, it was for national crime and unbelief
[Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 48:20</span></span>

Go ye forth of Babylon - The prophet now directly addresses those who
were in exile in Babylon, and commands them to depart from it. The
design of this is, to furnish the assurance that they should be
delivered, and to show them the duty of leaving the place of their long
captivity when the opportunity of doing it should occur. It is also
designed to show that when it should occur, it would be attended with
great joy and rejoicing.

Flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voice of singing - With the utmost
exultation and joy. They should rejoice that their captivity was ended;
they should exult at the prospect of being restored again to their own
land.

Utter it even to the end of the earth - It is an event so great and
wonderful that all the nations should be made acquainted with it.

The Lord hath redeemed ... - Yahweh has rescued from captivity his
people (see the notes at [Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 48:21</span></span>

And they thirsted not - This is a part of that for which they would be
called to celebrate his name. It was not merely that he had redeemed
them, but that he had abundantly provided for their needs in the desert,
and guided them safe through the pathless wilderness to their own land
(see the notes at [Isa 35:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md); [Isa
41:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017).md).

He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them - The allusion
here is undoubtedly to the fact that God caused the waters to flow out
of the rock that Moses smote in the wilderness [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md); [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md). This is not to be regarded as
literally true that God would, in like manner, smite the rocks and cause
waters to flow by miracle on their return from Babylon. There is no
record that any such event took place, and it is not necessary so to
understand this passage. It is a part of the triumphant song which they
are represented as singing after their return to their own land. In that
song, they celebrate his gracious interposition in language that was
familiar to them, and by illustrations that were well known. They
therefore speak of his mercy to them as if he had smitten the rock in
the desert on their return, and caused the waters to flow; and the sense
is, that his mercy to them then was similar to his goodness to their
fathers when he led them to the land of promise. He met all their
necessities; and his gracious interposition was experienced all the way
as really as though he had smitten the rock, or caused cool and
refreshing fountains to break out in the desert.

[Isaiah 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 48:22</span></span>

There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked - This verse contains
a sentiment whose truth no one can doubt. To the transgressor of the
laws of God there can be no permanent peace, enjoyment, or prosperity.
The word peace is used in the Scriptures in all these senses (see the
note at [Isa 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018).md). There may be the
appearance of joy, and there may be temporary prosperity. But there is
no abiding, substantial, permanent happiness, such as is enjoyed by
those who fear and love God. This sentiment occurs not unfrequently in
Isaiah. It is repeated in [Isa 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021.md);
and in [Isa 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md), he says that 'the
wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast
up mire and dirt.' Of the truth of the declaration here there can be no
doubt; but it is not perfectly apparent why it is introduced here. It is
probably a part of the song with which they would celebrate their
return; and it may have been used for one of the following reasons:

1\. As a general maxim, expressed in view of the joy which they had in
their return to their own land. They had elevated peace and triumph and
joy. This was produced by the fact that they had evidence that they were
the objects of the divine favor and protection. How natural was it in
view of these blessings to say, that the wicked had no such comfort, and
in general, that there was no peace to them of any kind, or from any
quarter. Or,

2\. It may have been uttered in view of the fact that many of their
countrymen may have chosen to remain in Babylon when they returned to
their own land. They probably formed connections there, amassed wealth,
and refused to attend those who returned to Judea to rebuild the temple.
And the meaning may be, that they, amidst all the wealth which they
might have gained, and amidst the idolatries which prevailed in Babylon,
could never enjoy the peace which they now had in their return to the
land of their fathers.

Whatever was the reason why it was used here, it contains a most
important truth which demands the attention of all people. The wicked,
as a matter of sober truth and verity, have no permanent and substantial
peace and joy. They have none:

1\. In the act of wickedness. Sin may be attended with the
gratifications of bad passions, but in the act of sinning, as such,
there can be no substantial happiness.

2\. They have no solid, substantial, elevated peace in the business or
the pleasures of life. This world can furnish no such joys as are
derived from the hope of a life to come. Pleasures 'pall upon the
sense,' riches take wings; disappointment comes; and the highest earthly
and sensual pleasure leaves a sad sense of want - a feeling that there
is something in the capacities and needs of the undying mind which has
not been filled.

3\. They have no peace of conscience; no deep and abiding conviction
that they are right. They are often troubled; and there is nothing which
this world can furnish which will give peace to a bosom that is agitated
with a sense of the guilt of sin.

4\. They have no peace on a deathbed. There may be stupidity,
callousness, insensibility, freedom from much pain or alarm. But that is
not peace, anymore than sterility is fruitfulness; or than death is
life; or than the frost of winter is the verdure of spring; or than a
desert is a fruitful field.

5\. There is often in these circumstances the reverse of peace. There is
not only no positive peace, but there is the opposite. There is often
disappointment, care, anxiety, distress, deep alarm, and the awful
apprehension of eternal wrath. There is no situation in life or death,
where the sinner can certainly calculate on peace, or where he will be
sure to find it. There is every probability that his mind will be often
filled with alarm, and that his deathbed will be one of despair.

6\. There is no peace to the wicked beyond the grave. "A sinner can have
no peace at the judgment bar of God; he can have no peace in hell." In
all the future world there is no place where he can find repose; and
whatever this life may be, even if it be a life of prosperity and
external comfort, yet to him there will be no prosperity in the future
world, and no external or internal peace there.
