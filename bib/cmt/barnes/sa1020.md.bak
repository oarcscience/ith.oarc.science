### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 20:1</span></span>

While Saul was under the constraining influence of the spirit of
prophecy, David escaped from Naioth, and, probably by Samuel's advice,
returned to Saul's court to commune with Jonathan. Nothing could be a
better evidence of his innocence than thus putting himself in Jonathan's
power. Perhaps something passed between Samuel and Saul on the subject,
since it appears from [Sa1 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005.md), [Sa1
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#025.md), [Sa1
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#027.md), that Saul expected David at the
feast of the new moon.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 20:2</span></span>

It is not so - Jonathan's unwillingness to believe evil of his father is
one of the many admirable traits in his character.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 20:3</span></span>

And David sware moreover - Rather, "yet again." He met Jonathan's denial
by repeating his statement and confirming it with an oath.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 20:5</span></span>

The new moon, or beginning of each month, was celebrated with especial
sacrifices and blowing of trumpets (marginal references.) The feast was
kept with great solemnity as "a day of gladness," and we may presume
that the "peace offerings" offered on the occasion furnished the tables
of those that offered.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 20:14</span></span>

The general meaning is: Jonathan had a presentiment, doubtless from God,
that David would be established upon the throne. By God's mercy he had
the comfort, which he well deserved, of knowing that his own posterity
would receive kindness at David's hand (see the marginal references).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 20:19</span></span>

The stone Ezel - It is not mentioned elsewhere, except possibly in [Sa1
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#041.md), where see the note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 20:26</span></span>

He is not clean - The new moon being a religious feast, and the meat to
be eaten being peace-offerings, no one could assist at the feast who had
any ceremonial uncleanness upon him (marginal references).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 20:30</span></span>

The greatest insult and most stinging reproach that can be cast upon an
Oriental is to reproach his parents or ancestors (see [Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008).md). Saul means to intimate that
Jonathan was stubborn from his mother's womb.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 20:41</span></span>

A place toward the south - An unintelligible description; one expects a
repetition of the description of David's hiding-place in [Sa1
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019.md). The Septuagint in both places
has "argab," a word meaning a "heap of stones." If this be the true
reading, David's hiding-place was either a natural cavernous rock which
was called "Argab," or some ruin of an ancient building, equally suited
for a hiding-place.

Bowed himself three times - In token, doubtless, of his unshaken loyalty
to Jonathan as the son of his king, as well as his friend; and in
acknowledgment of Jonathan's power to kill him if he saw fit. (Compare
[Gen 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#003).md).

David exceeded - His affection for Jonathan, coupled with his sense of
Saul's injustice and his own injured innocence, fully accounts for his
strong emotion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 20:42</span></span>

Jonathan went into the city - From which one may infer, what the after
history also indicates, that Jonathan's filial duty and patriotism
prevented a complete rupture with his father. Jonathan's conduct in
this, as in everything, was most admirable.
