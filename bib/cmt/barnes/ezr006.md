### [Ezra Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 6:1</span></span>

A "house of the rolls" was discovered at Koyunjik, the ancient Nineveh,
in 1850 - a set of chambers, i. e., in the palace devoted exclusively to
the storing of public documents. These were in baked clay, and covered
the floor to the depth of more than a foot. Such a "house" was probably
that at Babylon.

[Ezra 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 6:2</span></span>

"Achmetha" is the "Ecbatana," or "Agbatana," of the Greeks, the Persian
name for which, as we find in the Behistun Inscription, was HaGMaTANa.

We must suppose that, when Babylon had been searched in vain, the other
cities which possessed record-offices were visited, and the decree
looked for in them. Ecbatana was the capital of Cyrus.

[Ezra 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 6:3</span></span>

It is difficult to reconcile the dimentions here with expressions in
Zechariah [Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md), Haggai [Hag
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003.md), and even Ezra [Ezr
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012.md), which imply that the second
temple was smaller than the first (compare [Kg1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002).md). Perhaps the dimensions here are
those which Cyrus required the Jews not to exceed.

[Ezra 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 6:4</span></span>

The word translated "row" occurs only in this passage. Some regard it as
a "course," and suppose that after every three courses of stone there
followed a course of timber. Others understand three "storeys" of stone,
with a fourth "storey" of woodwork on the summit (compare [Kg1
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005).md). Others consider that Cyrus
intended to limit the thickness of the walls, which were not to exceed a
breadth of three rows of stone, with an inner wooden wainscotting.

Let the expenses be given out of the king's house - i. e., "out of the
Persian revenue," a portion of the decree which was probably not
observed during the later years of Cyrus and during the reign of
Cambyses, and hence the burthen fell upon the Jews themselves [Ezr
2:68-69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068.md).

[Ezra 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 6:6</span></span>

This verse gives the words of the decree of Darius, which was grounded
upon, and probably recited, the decree of Cyrus.

[Ezra 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 6:11</span></span>

Being set up, let him be hanged thereon - Rather, "let him be lifted up
and crucified upon it." Crucifixion was the most common form of capital
punishment among the Persians.

[Ezra 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 6:12</span></span>

Destroy all - A similar malediction is found at the end of the great
inscription of this same king Darius at Behistun: If anyone injures the
tablet which he has set up, he prays that Ormazd will be their enemy,
and that they may have no offspring, and that whatever they do, Ormazd
may curse it for them.

To alter and to destroy this house - i. e., to alter the decree, and
then proceed to destroy the house.

[Ezra 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 6:14</span></span>

Artaxerxes - The Artaxerxes of marginal reference seems to be meant (i.
e., Longimanus); he was one of those who together with Cyrus and Darius
helped forward the completion of the work.

[Ezra 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 6:15</span></span>

"Adar" was the twelfth or last month of the Jewish year, corresponding
nearly with our March. The sixth year of Darius was 516-515 B.C.

[Ezra 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 6:17</span></span>

Compare with this modest sacrifice, which suits well "the day of small
things" [Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md), the lavish offering
of Solomon (see the marginal reference "n").

[Ezra 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ezr 6:19</span></span>

With this verse the writer resumes the use of the Hebrew language, which
he had discarded for the Chaldee from [Ezr
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#008.md). With the exception of the letter
of Artaxerxes [Ezr 7:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012.md), all the
remainder of the book is in Hebrew.

[Ezra 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ezr 6:20</span></span>

Some render, "And the priests were purified; and the Levites, as one
man, were all of them pure." A contrast is drawn between the universal
purity of the Levites and the merely general purity of the priests [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md); [Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md), which made it fitting that the
former should undertake the slaughter of all the Paschal lambs, even of
those which the priests were to consume. In later times the ordinary
practice was for each head of a family to kill for himself.

[Ezra 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 6:22</span></span>

The king of Assyria - i. e., Darius. Assyria had so long been the great
monarchy of western Asia that the sacred writers continue the title to
those who had inherited the old Assyrian power, as first to the
Babylonians [Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md), and secondly
to the Persians. With similar inexactness we find Herodotus calling
Cyrus "king of the Medes."
