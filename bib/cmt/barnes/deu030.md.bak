### [Deuteronomy Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 30:1</span></span>

The rejection of Israel and the desolation of the promised inheritance
were not to be the end of God's dispensations. The closing words of the
address therefore are words of comfort and promise. Compare marginal
reference and [Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md) ff; [Kg1
8:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md).

The chastisements of God would lead the nation to repent, and thereupon
God would again bless them.

[Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md)

Will turn thy captivity - Will change or put an end to thy state of
captivity or distress (compare [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md); [Psa
85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md); [Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018).md). The rendering of the Greek
version is significant; "the Lord will heal thy sins."

The promises of this and the following verses had no doubt their partial
fulfillment in the days of the Judges; but the fact that various
important features are repeated in [Jer
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037.md) ff, and in [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md) ff, [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md) ff, [Eze
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#024.md) ff, shows us that none of these
was regarded as exhausting the promises. In full analogy with the scheme
of prophecy we may add that the return from the Babylonian captivity has
not exhausted their depth. The New Testament takes up the strain (e. g.
in Rom. 11), and foretells the restoration of Israel to the covenanted
mercies of God. True these mercies shall not be, as before, confined to
that nation. The "turning again of the captivity" will be when Israel is
converted to Him in whom the Law was fulfilled, and who died "not for
that nation only," but also that he might "gather together in one the
children of God that were scattered abroad" [Joh
11:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051.md). Then shall there be "one
fold and one shepherd" [Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md). But
whether the general conversion of the Jews shall be accompanied with any
national restoration, any recovery of their ancient prerogatives as the
chosen people; and further, whether there shall be any local replacement
of them in the land of their fathers, may be regarded as of "the secret
things" which belong unto God [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md); and so indeed our Lord Himself
teaches us [Act 1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md).

[Deu 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md)

Circumcise thine heart - Compare [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md) note; [Jer
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039.md); Ezra 11:19.

[Deuteronomy 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 30:11</span></span>

Ignorance of the requirements of the law cannot be pleaded [Deu
30:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#010.md); hence, [Deu
30:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015.md) life and death, good and
evil, are solemnly set before the people for their own choice; and an
earnest exhortation to choose the better part concludes the address.

[Deu 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md). "The righteousness
which is of faith" is really and truly described in these words of the
Law; and, under Paul's guidance (see marginal references) we affirm was
intended so to be. For the simplicity and accessibility which Moses here
attributes to the Law of God neither is nor can be experimentally found
in it except through the medium of faith; even though outwardly and in
the letter that Law be written out for us so "that he may run that
readeth," and be set forth in its duties and its sanctions as plainly as
it was before the Jews by Moses. The seeming ease of the commandment,
and yet its real impossibility to the natural man, form part of the
qualifications of the Law to be our schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ.

[Deu 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md)

Not hidden from thee - Rather, not too hard for thee, as in [Deu
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md).

Neither is it far off - Compare [Luk
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md).

[Deu 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#013.md)

The paraphrase of this verse in the Jerusalem Targum is noteworthy, and
should be compared with Paul's rendering in [Rom
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007.md) : "Neither is the law beyond the
great sea, that thou shouldest say, Oh that we had one like Jonah the
prophet who could descend into the depths of the sea and bring it to
us!"

[Deu 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#014.md)

In thy mouth, and in, thy heart - Compare [Deu
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md); [Deu
11:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018.md).

[Deu 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#020.md)

That thou mayest love the Lord - Compare [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md). Love stands first as the
essential and only source of obedience.

He is thy life - Or, "that" (i. e., "to love the Lord") "is thy life;"
i. e., the condition of thy life and of its prolongation in the promised
land. Compare [Deu 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040.md); [Deu
32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047.md).
