### [Romans Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 16:0</span></span>

The Epistle concludes with various salutations. The "names" which occur
in this chapter are chiefly "Greek;" and the persons designated had been
probably inhabitants of Greece, but had removed to Rome for purposes of
commerce, etc. Possibly some of them had been converted under the
ministry of the apostle himself during his preaching in Corinth and
other parts of Greece. It is remarkable that the name of "Peter" does
not occur in this catalogue; which is conclusive evidence, contrary to
the Papists, that Peter was not then known by Paul to be in Rome.

[Romans 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 16:1</span></span>

I commend - It was common then, as now, to bear letters of introduction
to strangers, commending the person thus introduced to the favorable
regards and attentions of those to whom the letters were addressed; [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md); [Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027.md). This Epistle, with the
apostle's commendation, was designed thus to introduce its bearer to the
Roman Christians. The mention of Phebe in this manner leaves it beyond a
doubt that she was either the bearer of this Epistle, or accompanied
those who bore it to Rome. The Epistle was therefore written, probably,
at Corinth. (See Introduction.)

Our sister - A member of the Christian church.

Which is a servant - Greek," Who is a deaconess." It is clear from the
New Testament that there was an order of women in the church known as
"deaconesses." Reference is made to a class of females whose duty it was
to "teach" other females, and to take the general superintendence of
that part of the church, in various places in the New Testament; and
their existence is expressly affirmed in early ecclesiastical history.
They appear to have been commonly aged and experienced widows,
sustaining fair reputation, and suited to guide and instruct those who
were young and inexperienced; compare [Ti1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md), [Ti1
5:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md); [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md). The Apostolical Constitutions,
book iii. say, "Ordain a deaconess who is faithful and holy, for the
ministries toward the women." Pliny in his celebrated letter to Trajan,
says, when speaking of the efforts which he made to obtain information
respecting the opinions and practices of Christians, "I deemed it
necessary to put two maidservants who are called "ministrae" (that is
"deaconesses") to the torture, in order to ascertain what is the truth."
The reasons of their appointment among the Gentiles were these:

\(1\) The females were usually separate from the men. They were kept
secluded, for the most part, and not permitted to mingle in society with
men as is the custom now.

\(2\) it became necessary, therefore, to appoint aged and experienced
females to instruct the young, to visit the sick, to provide for them,
and to perform for them the services which male deacons performed for
the whole church. It is evident, however, that they were confined to
these offices, and that they were never regarded as an order of
ministers, or suffered "to preach" to congregations; [Ti1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012.md); [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md).

Of the church ... - This is the only mention which occurs of a church at
that place. It was probably collected by the labors of Paul.

At Cenchrea - This was the "sea-port" of Corinth. Corinth was situated
on the middle of the isthmus, and had "two" harbors, or ports:
"Cenchrea" on the east, about eight or nine miles from the city; and
"Lechaeum" on the west. Cenchrea opened into the AEgean sea, and was the
principal port. It was on this "isthmus," between these two ports, that
the "Isthmian" games were celebrated, to which the apostle refers so
often in his epistles.

[Romans 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 16:2</span></span>

That ye receive her ... - That you acknowledge her as being in the Lord,
or as being a servant of the Lord; that is, as a Christian; compare [Rom
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003.md); [Phi
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md).

As becometh saints - As it is proper that Christians should treat their
brethren.

She hath been a succourer of many - The word used here προστάτις
prostatis, means properly "a patron, a help," and was applied by the
Greeks to one who "presided" over an assembly; to one who became "a
patron" of others; who aided or defended them in their cause; and
especially to one who undertook to manage the cause of "strangers" and
foreigners before the courts. It was, therefore, an honorable
appellation. Applied to Phebe, it means probably that she had shown
great kindness in various ways to the apostle, and to other Christians;
probably by receiving them into her house; by administering to the sick,
etc. Such persons have a claim on the respect and Christian attentions
of others.

[Romans 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 16:3</span></span>

Greet Priscilla and Aquila - Salute; implying the apostle's kind
remembrance of them, and his wishes for their welfare.

Priscilla - Priscilla was the wife of Aquila. They are mentioned in [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md), [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md). Paul at first found them at
Corinth. Aquila was a Jew, born in Pontus, who had resided at Rome, and
who had left Rome, and come to Corinth, when Claudius expelled the Jews
from Rome; see the notes at [Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md).
It is probable that they were converted under the preaching of Paul.
Paul lived with them, and they had the advantage of his private
instruction; [Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md); compare [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md). At the death of Claudius, or
whenever the decree for the expulsion of the Jews was repealed, it is
probable that they returned to Rome.

My helpers - My fellow-workers. They had aided him in his work. A
particular instance is mentioned in [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md). They are mentioned as having
been with Paul when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md).

In Christ Jesus - In the Christian cause.

[Romans 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 16:4</span></span>

Who have for my life - In order to save my life.

Laid down their own necks - To "lay down the neck" is to lay the head on
a block to be cut off with the axe; or to bow down the head as when the
neck was exposed to be cut off by the sword of the executioner. The
meaning is, that they had hazarded their lives, had exposed themselves
to imminent danger, to save the life of Paul. On what occasion this was
done, is not known, as it is not referred to in the New Testament
elsewhere. As Paul, however, lived with them [Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md), and as he was often persecuted
by the Jews, it is probable that he refers to some such period when he
was persecuted, when Aquila and Priscilla took him into their house at
the imminent hazard of their lives.

All the churches of the Gentiles - All the churches that had been
founded by the apostles. They "felt" their deep obligation to them for
having saved the life of him who had been their founder, and who was
their spiritual father.

[Romans 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 16:5</span></span>

The church that is in their house - Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned
[Act 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md) as having received
"Apollos" into their family, to instruct him more perfectly. The church
in their house is also mentioned [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md). This may mean either the church
that was accustomed to assemble for worship at their hospitable mansion;
or it may mean their own family with their guests, regarded as a
"church." In those times Christians had no houses erected for public
worship, and were therefore compelled to meet in their private
dwellings.

Salute - The same word before translated "greet."

Who is the first-fruits - One who first embraced Christianity under my
preaching in Achaia. The "first-fruits" were a small part of the
harvest, which was first gathered and offered to the Lord; [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md); [Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md); [Lev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012.md); [Deu
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md). In allusion to this, Paul calls
Epenetus the first-fruits of the great spiritual harvest which had been
gathered in Achaia.

Achaia - See the note at [Rom 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md).
This name and those which follow are chiefly "Greek," but we know little
of the persons mentioned, except what is here recorded.

[Romans 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 16:6</span></span>

Who bestowed much labour on us - Who labored much for us. Nothing more
is known of her but this honorable mention of her name. It is probable
that these persons were formerly residents in Greece, and that the
apostle had there become acquainted with them, but that they had now
removed to Rome.

[Romans 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 16:7</span></span>

My kinsmen - In [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md), the apostle
calls "all" the Jews "his kinsmen," and it has been doubted whether he
means anything more here than that they were "fellow Jews." But as many
others who were Jews are mentioned here without this appellation, and as
he especially designates these persons, and Herodian [Rom
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011.md), it seems probable that they
were remote relatives of the apostle.

My fellow-prisoners - Paul was often in prison; and it is probable that
on some of those occasions they had been confined with him; compare [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md), "In prisons more frequent."

Who are of note - The word translated "of note" ἐπίσημοι episēmoi,
denotes properly those who are "marked," designated, or distinguished in
any way, used either in a good or bad sense; compare [Mat
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#016.md). Here it is used in a good
sense.

Among the apostles - This does not mean that they "were" apostles, as
has been sometimes supposed. For,

\(1\) There is no account of their having been appointed as such.

\(2\) the expression is not one which would have been used if they "had"
been. It would have been "who were distinguished apostles;" compare [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md).

\(3\) it by no means implies that they were apostles All that the
expression fairly implies is, that they were known to the other
apostles; that they were regarded by them as worthy of their affection
and confidence; that they had been known by them, as Paul immediately
adds, before "he" was himself converted. They had been converted
"before" he was, and were distinguished in Jerusalem among the early
Christians, and honored with the friendship of the other apostles.

\(4\) the design of the office of "apostles" was to bear "witness" to
the life, death, resurrection, doctrines, and miracles of Christ;
compare Matt. 10; [Act 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026.md); [Act
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015.md). As there is no evidence that
they had been "witnesses" of these things; or appointed to it, it is
improbable that they were set apart to the apostolic office.

\(5\) the word "apostles" is used sometimes to designate "messengers" of
churches; or those who were "sent" from one church to another on some
important business, and "if" this expression meant that they "were"
apostles, it could only be in some such sense as having obtained
deserved credit and eminence in that business; see [Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md); [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md).

Who were in Christ ... - Who were "converted" before I was. The meaning
is clear. The expression, "in Christ," means to be united to him, to be
interested in his religion, to be Christians.

[Romans 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 16:10</span></span>

Approved in Christ - An approved or tried Christian; approved and
beloved by Christ.

[Romans 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 16:12</span></span>

Tryphena and Tryphosa - These names, with the participle rendered "who
labor," are in the feminine gender, and these were probably two holy
women, who performed the function of deaconesses, or who ministered to
the sick, and who with Persia, thus by example, and perhaps by
instruction, labored to promote the spread of Christianity. Pious
females, then, as now, were able to do much in their proper sphere to
extend the truths and blessings of the gospel.

[Romans 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 16:13</span></span>

Chosen in the Lord - "Elect" in the Lord; that is, a chosen follower of
Christ.

And his mother and mine - "His mother in a literal sense, and mine in a
figurative one." An instance of the delicacy and tenderness of Paul; of
his love for this disciple and his mother, as if he were of the same
family. Religion binds the hearts of all who embrace it tenderly
together. It makes them feel that they are one great family, united by
tender ties, and joined by special attachments. See what the Lord Jesus
declared in [Mat 12:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#047.md), and his
tender address to John when he was on the cross; [Joh
19:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026.md).

[Romans 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 16:16</span></span>

Salute one another - Greet one another in an affectionate mannner; that
is, treat each other with kindness and love, and evince all proper marks
of affection.

With an holy kiss - This mode of salutation has been practiced at all
times; and particularly in eastern nations. It was even practiced by
"men;" see the note at [Luk 22:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047.md).
The use of the word "holy" here serves to denote that Paul intended it
as an expression of "Christian" affection; and to guard against all
improper familiarity and scandal. It was common, according to Justin
Martyr (Apology), for the early Christians to practice it in their
religious assemblies.

The churches of Christ - That is, the churches in the vicinity of the
place where the apostle wrote this Epistle; probably the churches
particularly in Achaia.

[Romans 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 16:17</span></span>

Now I beseech you - One great object of this Epistle had been to promote
"peace" between the Jewish and Gentile converts. So much did this
subject press upon the mind of the apostle, that he seems unwilling so
leave it. He returns to it again and again; and even after the Epistle
is apparently concluded, he returns to it, to give them a new charge on
the subject.

Mark them - Observe attentively, cautiously, and faithfully [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md); be on your guard against them.
Ascertain "who are" the real causes of the divisions that spring up, and
avoid them.

Which cause - Who make. Probably he refers here to "Jewish" teachers, or
those who insisted strenuously on the observance of the rites of Moses,
and who set up a claim for greater purity and orthodoxy than those
possessed who received the Gentile converts as Christian brethren. The
Jews were perpetually thus recalling the Christian converts to the Law
of Moses; insisting on the observance of those rites; troubling the
churches, and producing dissensions and strifes; [Gal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md); [Gal
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md); [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md), [Act
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024.md).

Divisions - Dissensions; parties; factions; [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md); [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md). The very "attempt" to form such
parties was evil, no matter what the pretence. They who attempt to form
parties in the churches are commonly actuated by some evil or ambitious
design.

And offences - Scandals; or that give occasion for others to fall into
sin. These two things are different. The first means parties; the other
denotes such a course of life as would lead others into sin. The "Jew"
would form parties, on the pretence of superior holiness; the Gentiles,
or some hold Gentile convert might deride the scrupulous feelings of the
Jew, and might thus lead him into "sin" in regard to what his conscience
really forbade; see [Rom 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md). These
persons on both sides were to he avoided, and they were to refuse to
follow them, and to cultivate the spirit of unity and peace.

Contrary to the doctrine - To the "teaching" which you have received in
this Epistle and elsewhere; the teaching that these divisions should
cease; that the Jewish ceremonies are not binding; that all should lay
aside their causes of former difference, and be united in one family;
see Rom. 14; 15.

And avoid them - Give them no countenance or approbation. Do not follow
them; compare [Ti1 6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Jo2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md); [Gal
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md). That is, avoid them as
"teachers;" do not follow them. It does not mean that they were to be
treated harshly; but that they were to be avoided in their
"instructions." They were to disregard all that they could say tending
to produce alienation and strife; and resolve to cultivate the spirit of
peace and union. This would be an admirable rule if always followed. Let
people make "peace" their prime object; resolve to love all who "are"
Christians, and it will be an infallible guage by which to measure the
arguments of those who seek to promote alienations and contentions.

[Romans 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 16:18</span></span>

Serve not - Obey not. Though they are professedly, yet they are not his
real friends and followers.

But their own belly - Their own "lusts;" their own private interests;
they do this to obtain support. The authors of parties and divisions, in
church and state, have this usually in view. It is for the indulgence of
some earthly appetite; to obtain function or property; or to gratify the
love of dominion.

And by good words - Mild, fair, plausible speeches; with an appearance
of great sincerity, and regard for the truth; compare [Col
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md); [Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md). People who cause divisions
commonly make great pretensions to peculiar love of truth and orthodoxy;
and put on the appearance of great sincerity, sanctity, and humility.

And fair speeches - Greek εὐλογίας eulogias, eulogy, praise, flattery.
This is another very common art. "Flattery" is one of the most powerful
means of forming parties in the church; and "a little special
attention," or promise of an office, or commendation for talents or
acquirements, will secure "many" to the purposes of party whom no regard
for truth or orthodoxy could influence a moment.

Deceive the hearts of the simple - The minds of the unsuspecting, or
those who are without guile τῶν ἀκάκων tōn akakōn. The apostle means to
designate those who are simple-hearted, without any disposition to
deceive others themselves, and of course without any suspicions of the
"designs" of others. He has thus drawn the art of making parties with
the hand of a master. First, there are smooth, plausible pretences, as
of great love for truth. Then, an artful mingling of attentions and
flatteries; and all this practiced on the minds of the unsuspecting,
drawing their "hearts" and "affections" toward themselves. Happy would
it have been if the art had been confined to his own times.

[Romans 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 16:19</span></span>

For your obedience ... - [Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md).
Your mild, obedient disposition to learn, and to obey the precepts of
the teachers of religion.

I am glad ... - I rejoice that you evince such a disposition. But he
immediately adds, that "this" was just the temper to be imposed upon,
and cautions them against that danger.

Wise unto that which is good - Evince understanding of what is adapted
to promote good and worthy ends.

Simple concerning evil - Greek, "harmless." Not disposed to do wrong;
having no plan and yielding to none of the allurements of evil. You have
shown your wisdom in "obeying" the gospel. I would have you still evince
wisdom toward "every good" design; but to be unacquainted with "any"
plan of evil. Do not yield to those plans, or follow those who would
lead you into them.

[Romans 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 16:20</span></span>

And the God of peace - The God who promotes peace; [Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md).

Will bruise - The "language" here refers to the prediction in [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md). It here means to "subdue, to
gain the victory over." It denotes Paul's confidence that they "would"
gain the victory, and would be able to overcome all the arts of those
who were endeavoring to sow discord and contention among them.

Satan - The word "Satan" is Hebrew, meaning originally "an accuser, a
calumniator," and then "an enemy." It is given to the prince of evil
spirits from this enmity to God and human beings. He is here regarded as
the "author" of all attempts to promote discord in the church, by
whomsoever those attempts were made. Hence, they who attempt to produce
divisions are called "his ministers;" [Co2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015.md). God would disappoint their
malignant purposes, and promote the prevalence of peace.

The grace - The favor; the mercy, etc. The Lord Jesus is the Prince of
peace ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); compare [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md); [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027).md), and this expression is "a
prayer" to him, or an earnest wish expressed, that the design of his
coming might be accomplished in promoting the prevalence of order and
peace; compare [Co1 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023.md); [Rev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021.md).

[Romans 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 16:21</span></span>

Timotheus - Timothy; to whom the Epistles which bear his name were
written. He was long the companion of Paul in his labors; [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md), [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md); [Phi
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md); [Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md); [Heb
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md).

And Lucius - He is mentioned in [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md), as a prophet and teacher, a
native of Cyrene. Nothing more is known of him.

My kinsmen - [Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md).

[Romans 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 16:22</span></span>

I Tertius - Of Tertius nothing more is known than is mentioned here.

Who wrote this - It is evident that Paul employed an amanuensis to write
this Epistle, and perhaps he commonly did it. Tertius, who thus wrote
it, joins with the apostle in affectionate salutations to the brethren
at Rome. To the Epistle, Paul signed his own name, and added a
salutation in his own hand-writing. [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018.md), "The salutation by the hand of
me Paul;" and in [Th2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017.md), he says
that this was done in every epistle, [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021.md).

In the Lord - As Christian brethren.

[Romans 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 16:23</span></span>

Gaius mine host - Who has received me into his house, and shown me
hospitality. The word "host" means one who entertains another at his own
house without reward.

And of the whole church - Who has opened his house to entertain "all"
Christians; or to show hospitality to them all. He was baptized by Paul
himself at Corinth [Co1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md); and was
so highly esteemed by the church that John wrote an epistle to him; [Jo3
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md). He was probably a wealthy citizen
of Corinth, who freely opened his house to entertain Christians, and for
the purpose of religious worship.

Erastus - Erastus is mentioned [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md) as having been sent by Paul with
Timothy into Macedonia. He is also mentioned [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md) as having resided at Corinth.

The chamberlain - A chamberlain is properly an officer who has charge of
a chamber, or of chambers. In England, the lord chamberlain is the sixth
officer of the crown, and has charge of the king's lodgings, and
wardrobe, etc. He has also an important rank on days of public
solemnities, as the coronation day, etc. The word used here is commonly
in the New Testament translated "steward." It properly means one who has
charge of domestic affairs, to provide for a family, to pay the
servants, etc. In this place it means one who presided over the
pecuniary affairs of the "city," and should have been translated "the
treasurer; the city treasurer;" an once of trust and of some importance,
showing that, "all" who were converted at Corinth were not of the lowest
rank. This is implied in [Co1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md),
"Not many wise men, not many mighty, not many noble, are called,"
implying that there were some such.

Quartus a brother - A fellow-Christian.

[Romans 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 16:25</span></span>

Now to him - This and the two following verses are found in many
manuscripts at the close of Rom. 14. Its proper place, however, is here;
and the apostle thus concludes the whole Epistle with an ascription of
praise.

To him ... - To God; be glory; [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

Is of power - Greek, Is able; who has power; [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024.md), "Now unto him that is able to
keep you from falling," etc. God only can keep Christians in the path of
salvation; and it was well to bring that truth prominently into view at
the close of the Epistle.

To establish you - To strengthen and confirm you.

According to my gospel - According to the gospel which I preach; the
doctrines which I have been defending in this Epistle. It is called
"his" gospel, not because he was the author of it, or because others did
not preach it also, but because he had been "particularly" defending it
in this Epistle. The doctrines which he had advanced were just those
which were suited to strengthen and confirm them, - the doctrine of
justification, of election, of perseverance, and of the protection and
favor of God to both Jews and Gentiles. These were the doctrines which
he had defended; and it might easily be shown that "these" are the
doctrines that give stability to the Christian faith, hope, and love.

And the preaching of Jesus Christ - Not his "personal" preaching; but
according to that preaching of which Christ is the author and the
subject; and particularly, as the following clause shows, to the
doctrines by which the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles was
broken down, and by which they were admitted to the same privileges and
hopes.

According to the revelation - According to the communication of what has
been so long concealed, but which is now made manifest. The word
"revelation" refers to the "publication" of the plan by the gospel.

Of the mystery - The word "mystery" means properly what is "hidden" or
"concealed," and is thus applied to any doctrine which was not before
known. It does not mean necessarily what is "unintelligible;" but what
had not been before revealed; see the note at [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md). The word here seems to refer to
the principal doctrines of the gospel; its main truths, which had been
concealed, especially from the entire Gentile world, but which were now
made known.

Which was kept secret - Which were kept in "silence" (Greek, σεσιγημένου
sesigēmenou), were not divulged or proclaimed.

Since the world began - In all past times. This refers particularly to
the Gentiles. The Jews had some obscure intimations of these truths, but
they were now made known to all the world. The phrase "since the world
began" is in Greek, "in eternal times;" that is, in all past times; or,
as we should say, they have been "always" concealed.

[Romans 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 16:26</span></span>

But now is made manifest - Is revealed, or made known; that which was so
long concealed is now divulged, that is, God's plan of saving people is
now made known to all nations.

And by the Scriptures ... - By the "writings" of the prophets. The
prophetic writings contained the doctrines, obscurely indeed, but so as
to be an important means of disseminating and confirming the truth that
the Gentiles should be made acquainted with the gospel. To those
writings the apostle had repeatedly appealed in his defense of the
proposition that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentile word; Rom.
10; 11; 15. The prophetic writings; moreover, were extensively scattered
among the Gentile nations, and thus were readily appealed to in defense
of this position. Their writings being thus translated, and read, were
an important means of propagating the truths of the Christian religion.

According to the commandment ... - By his command through Jesus Christ;
made known in the gospel of his Son.

The everlasting God - God who is eternal, and therefore unchanged. He
who has indeed concealed this truth, but who has always intended that it
should be revealed.

To all nations - [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md); compare
[Col 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md).

For the obedience of faith - To produce obedience to the requirements of
the gospel; see the note at [Rom 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md).

[Romans 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 16:27</span></span>

To God only wise - The apostle here resumes the doxology which had been
interrupted by the parenthesis. The attribute of "wisdom" is here
brought into view, because it had been particularly displayed in this
plan which was now revealed. It evinced, in an eminent degree, the
"wisdom" of God. That wisdom was evinced in devising the plan; in
adapting it to the renewing of the heart; the justification of the
sinner; his preservation, guidance, and sanctification; and in the
manner in which the divine attributes had all been seen to harmonize.
All this the apostle had illustrated in the previous parts of the
Epistle; and now, full of the convictions of this wisdom, he desires
that all the praise and honor should be to God. The "tendency" of the
plan is to promote his glory. The "obligation" on all who are benefitted
by it is to give him praise.

Be glory - Praise; honor.

Through Jesus Christ - By means of the work which Jesus Christ has
performed; through him now as mediator and intercessor in the heavens.

The subscription, "written to the Romans," etc. is evidently added by
some other hand, but by whom is unknown. Paul assuredly would not write
this to inform the Romans that it was sent by Phebe, whom he had just
commended to their kindness. It has been shown, moreover, that no
reliance is to be placed on any of the subscriptions to the Epistles.
Some of them are known to be false. By whom they were added is unknown.
In this case, however, the fact which it states is correct, that it was
written from Corinth and sent by Phoebe.
