### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 25:1</span></span>

In the ninth year ... - As the final catastrophe approaches, the
historian becomes more close and exact in his dates, marking not only
the year, but the month and the day, on which the siege began, no less
than those on which it closed [Kg2
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003.md). From [Eze
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md) we find that on the very day when
the host of Nebuchadnezzar made its appearance before Jerusalem the fact
was revealed to Ezekiel in Babylonia, and the fate of the city announced
to him [Eze 24:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md). The army seems to
have at first spread itself over all Judaea. It fought, not only against
Jerusalem, but especially against Lachish and Azekah [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007.md), two cities of the south [Ch2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009.md), which had probably been strongly
garrisoned in order to maintain the communication with Egypt. This
division of the Babylonian forces encouraged Hophra to put his troops in
motion and advance to the relief of his Jewish allies [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md). On hearing this, Nebuchadnezzar
broke up from before Jerusalem and marched probably to Azekah and
Lachish. The Egyptians shrank back, returned into their own country [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md); [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017.md), and took no further part in the
war. Nebuchadnezzar then led back his army, and once more invested the
city. (It is uncertain whether the date at the beginning of this verse
refers to the first or to the second investment.)

Forts - Probably moveable towers, sometimes provided with
battering-rams, which the besiegers advanced against the walls, thus
bringing their fighting men on a level with their antagonists. Such
towers are seen in the Assyrian sculptures.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 25:2</span></span>

The siege lasted almost exactly a year and a half. Its calamities -
famine, pestilence, and intense suffering - are best understood from the
Lamentations of Jeremiah, written probably almost immediately after the
capture.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 25:4</span></span>

The city was broken up - Rather, "broken into," i. e., A breach was made
about midnight in the northern wall [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md), and an entry effected into the
second or lower city (see the [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014) note.md), which was protected by
the wall of Manasseh [Ch2 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md).

Precipitate flight followed on the advance of the Babylonians to the
"middle gate," or gate of communication between the upper and the lower
cities. This position was only a little north of the royal palace, which
the king therefore quitted. He escaped by the royal garden at the
junction of the Hinnom and Kidron valleys, passing between the two walls
which skirted on either side the valley of the Tyropoeon.

Toward the plain - "The Arabah" or the great depression which bounds
Palestine Proper on the east ([Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004) note.md). The "way toward the
Arabah" is here the road leading eastward over Olivet to Bethany and
Jericho.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 25:5</span></span>

Jeremiah [Jer 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md) and Ezekiel [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md) had prophesied this capture; and
the latter had also prophesied the dispersion of the troops [Kg2
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#014.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 25:6</span></span>

To Riblah - See [Kg2 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md) note. A
position from where Nebuchadnezzar could most conveniently superintend
the operations against Tyre and Jerusalem. In the absence of the
monarch, the siege of Jerusalem was conducted by a number of his
officers, the chief of whom were Nebuzar-adan, the captain of the guard,
and Nergal-shar-ezer (Neriglissar), the Rab-mag [Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), [Jer
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 25:7</span></span>

Before his eyes - This refinement of cruelty seems to have especially
shocked the Jews, whose manners were less barbarous than those of most
Orientals. It is noted by Jeremiah in two places [Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006.md); [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md).

And put out the eyes of Zedekiah - Blinding has always been among the
most common of secondary punishments in the East (compare [Jdg
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#002) l.md). The blinding of Zedekiah
reconciled in a very remarkable way prophecies, apparently
contradictory, which had been made concerning him. Jeremiah had
prophesied distinctly that he would be carried to Babylon [Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005.md); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md). Ezekiel had said that he should
not "see Babylon" [Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md). His
deprivation of sight before he was carried to the conqueror's capital
fulfilled the predictions of both prophets.

With fetters of brass - literally, (see [Jer
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007) margin.md), "with two chains of
brass." The Assyrians' captives are usually represented as bound hand
and foot - the two hands secured by one chain, the two feet by another.
According to Jewish tradition Zedekiah was, like other slaves, forced to
work in a mill at Babylon. Jeremiah tells us that he was kept in prison
until he died [Jer 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 25:8</span></span>

The nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar - 586 B.C., if we count from
the real date of his accession (604 B.C.); but 587 B.C., if, with the
Jews, we regard him as beginning to reign when he was sent by his father
to recover Syria and gained the battle of Carchemish (in 605 B.C.).

Captain of the guard - literally, "the chief of the executioners" [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 25:9</span></span>

He burnt the house of the Lord - Compare the prophecies of Jeremiah [Jer
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010.md); [Jer
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#002.md); [Jer
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#018.md), [Jer
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md). [Psa
79:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md) is thought to have been
written soon after this destruction of the temple.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 25:11</span></span>

The fugitives ... - It was from a fear of the treatment which he would
receive at the hands of these deserters that Zedekiah persisted in
defending the city to the last [Jer
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 25:12</span></span>

There was probably an intention of seating colonists into the country
from some other part of the Empire, as the Assyrians had done in Samaria
[Kg2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 25:13</span></span>

The pillars of brass ... - All the more precious treasures had been
already removed from the temple [Kg2
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013.md). But there still remained many
things, the list of which is given in [Jer
52:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md) much more fully than in this
place. Objects in brass, or rather bronze, were frequently carried off
by the Assyrians from the conquered nations. Bronze was highly valued,
being the chief material both for arms and implements. The breaking up
of the pillars, bases, etc., shows that it was for the material, and not
for the workmanship, that they were valued. On the various articles
consult the marginal references.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 25:16</span></span>

Without weight - The Babylonians did not take the trouble to weigh the
brass as they did the gold and silver. In the Assyrian monuments there
are representations of the weighing of captured articles in gold and
silver in the presence of the royal scribes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 25:17</span></span>

Compare with this description the accounts in marginal references. The
height of the capital ("three cubits") must be corrected, in accordance
with those passages, to "five cubits."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 25:18</span></span>

It devolved on Nebuzaradan to select for exemplary punishment the
persons whom he regarded as most guilty, either in respect of the
original rebellion or of the protracted resistance. Instead of taking
indiscriminately the first comers, he first selected those who by their
offices would be likely to have had most authority - the high priest;
the second priest ([Kg2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004) note.md);
three of the temple Levites; the commandant of the city; five members of
the king's Privy Council (or seven, see [Kg2
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019) note.md); and the secretary (or
adjutant) of the captain of the host. To these he added sixty others,
who were accounted "princes." Compared with the many occasions on which
Assyrian and Persian conquerers put to death hundreds or thousands after
taking a revolted town, Nebuzaradan (and Nebuchadnezzar) must be
regarded as moderate, or even merciful, in their vengeance. Compare [Jer
40:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002.md).

The three keepers of the door - Rather, "three keepers." The Hebrew has
no article. The temple "door-keepers" in the time of Solomon numbered
twenty-four [Ch1 26:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#017.md), who were
probably under six chiefs. After the captivity the chiefs are either six
[Ezr 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#042.md); [Neh
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#045.md) or four [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 25:19</span></span>

Out of the city - This clause shows that the five persons mentioned in
[Kg2 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md) were taken out of the
temple.

Five men - Or, "seven men," according to [Jer
52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025.md). It is impossible to say which
of the two numbers is correct.

Of them that were in the king's presence - See the margin. A mode of
speech arising from the custom of Eastern rulers to withdraw themselves
as much as possible from the view of their subjects.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 25:21</span></span>

So Judah was carried away - The kingdom of the two tribes was at an end;
and the task of the historian might seem to be accomplished. He still,
however, desires to notice two things:

\(1\) the fate of the remnant [Kg2
25:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md) left in the land by
Nebuzaradan; and

\(2\) the fate of Johoiachin, who, of all those led into captivity, was
the least to blame [Kg2 25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 25:22</span></span>

We may be allowed to conjecture that Jeremiah, in gratitude for Ahikam's
service to himself [Jer 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024.md),
recommended his son Gedaliah to Nebuzaradan, and through him to
Nebuchadnezzar, for the office of governor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 25:23</span></span>

The captains of the armies - i. e., the officers of the troops who had
fled from Jerusalem with Zedekiah [Kg2
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md), and had then dispersed and gone
into hiding [Kg2 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005.md).

For Mizpah, see [Jos 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026.md) note.

The Netophathite - Netophah, the city of Ephai (compare [Jer
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008).md), appears to have been in the
neighborhood of Bethlehem [Neh 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#026.md);
[Ezr 2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021.md). The name is perhaps
continued in the modern Antubeh, about 2 12 miles S. S. E. of Jerusalem.

A Maachathite - Maachah lay in the stony country east of the upper
Jordan, bordering upon Bashan [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 25:24</span></span>

As rebels against the Babylonian king, their lives were forfeit.
Gedaliah pledged himself to them by oath, that, if they gave no further
cause of complaint, their past offences should be forgiven.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 25:25</span></span>

Jeremiah gives this history with much fullness of detail Jer. 41-43.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 25:27</span></span>

The captivity of Jehoiachin commenced in the year 597 B.C. - the eighth
year of Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated 561 B.C. - the first year of
Evil-merodach, the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar. He reigned only
two years, being murdered by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar, or
Nergal-shar-ezer. He is said to have provoked his fate by lawless
government and intemperance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 25:28</span></span>

The kings that were with him - Probably captive kings, like Jehoiachin
himself. Compare [Jdg 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 25:29</span></span>

Evil-merodach gave him garments befitting his rank. To dress a man
suitably to his position was the first thought of an Oriental [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md); [Est
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015.md); [Dan
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029.md); [Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md). So again, Oriental kings
regarded it as a part of their greatness to feed daily a vast multitude
of persons at their courts (see [Kg1
4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022).md). Of these, as here, a certain
number had the special privilege of sitting actually at the royal board,
while the others ate separately, generally at a lower level. See [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md); [Sa2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#013.md); [Kg1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007.md); [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 25:30</span></span>

Allowance - From the treasury, in order to enable him to maintain the
state proper to his rank, and in addition to his food at the royal
table. Jehoiachin, to the day of his death, lived in peace and comfort
at the court of Babylon (compare [Jer
52:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#034).md).
