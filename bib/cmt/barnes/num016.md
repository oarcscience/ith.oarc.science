### [Numbers Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 16:0</span></span>

The date of this rebellion cannot be determined, but [Num
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#013) probably point to a period
not much later than that of the rebellion at Kadesh.

[Numbers 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 16:1</span></span>

Amram and Izhar were brothers (compare [Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018)), and thus Korah, the "son," i.
e. descendant of Izhar, was connected by distant cousinship with Moses
and Aaron. Though being a Kohathite, he was of that division of the
Levites which had the most honorable charge, yet as Elizaphan, who had
been made "chief of the families of the Kohathites" [Num
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#030), belonged to the youngest branch
descended from Uzziel [Num 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027), Korah
probably regarded himself as injured; and therefore took the lead in
this rebellion. Of the others, On is not again mentioned. He probably
withdrew from the conspiracy. Dathan, Abiram, and On were Reubenites;
and were probably discontented because the birthright had been taken
away from their ancestor [Gen 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003),
and with it the primacy of their own tribe among the tribes of Israel.
The Reubenites encamped near to the Kohathites (compare [Num
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025) and plan), and thus the two
families were conveniently situated for taking counsel together. One
pretext of the insurrection probably was to assert the rights of
primogeniture - on the part of the Reubenites against Moses, on the part
of Korah against the appointment of Uzziel.

[Numbers 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 16:2</span></span>

The "princes" appear to have belonged to the other tribes (compare [Num
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#003)).

[Numbers 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 16:3</span></span>

All the congregation are holy - Compare the marginal reference. Korah's
object was not to abolish the distinction between the Levites and the
people, but to win priestly dignity for himself and his kinsmen [Num
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#010). This ultimate design is masked
for the present in order to win support from the Reubenites by putting
forward claims to spiritual equality on behalf of every Israelite.

[Numbers 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 16:9</span></span>

"Seemeth" is not in the original. Render it as: Is it too little for
you, i. e. "is it less than your dignity demands?"

[Numbers 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 16:11</span></span>

The words of Moses in his wrath are broken. The Aaronic priesthood was
of divine appointment; and thus in rejecting it, the conspirators were
really rebelling against God.

[Numbers 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 16:13</span></span>

With perverse contempt for the promises, Dathan and Abiram designate
Egypt by the terms appropriated elsewhere to the land of Canaan.

[Numbers 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 16:14</span></span>

Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? - i. e. "blind them to the fact
that you keep none of your promises;" "throw dust in their eyes."

[Numbers 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 16:24</span></span>

The tent, "the tabernacle" of Korah, as a Kohathite, stood on the south
side of the tabernacle of the Lord; and those of Dathan and Abiram, as
Reubenites, in the outer line of encampment on the same side. Yet though
the tents of these three were thus contiguous, they did not share the
same fate. Korah and his company who dared to intrude themselves on the
priestly office were destroyed by fire from the Lord at the door of the
tabernacle of the Lord [Num 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035); the
Reubenites, who had reviled Moses for the failure of the promises about
the pleasant land, were suddenly engulfed while standing at their own
tent-doors in the barren wilderness [Num
16:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#031).

[Numbers 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 16:27</span></span>

Stood in the door of their tents - Apparently in contumacious defiance.

[Numbers 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 16:32</span></span>

All the men ... - Not his sons (see [Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011)), but all belonging to him who
had associated themselves with him in this rebellion.

[Numbers 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 16:35</span></span>

Compare the marginal references The fire came out from the sanctuary or
the altar.

[Numbers 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 16:37</span></span>

Aaron as High Priest and as one of those that offered incense [Num
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#017), could not be defiled by going
among the dead.

The censers were not to be used again for censers, nor the coals on them
for kindling the incense to be offered before the Lord. Yet neither of
them could fittingly be employed for common purposes. The censers
therefore were beaten into plates for the altar; the coals were
scattered at a distance.

[Numbers 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 16:38</span></span>

These sinners against their own souls - That is, "against their own
lives." By their sin they had brought destruction upon themselves.

[Numbers 16:45](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">num 16:45</span></span>

They fell upon their faces - In intercession for the people; compare
[Num 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022); [Num
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005).

[Numbers 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">num 16:46</span></span>

A censer - Rather, the censer. i. e. that of the high priest which was
used by him on the great Day of Atonement: compare [Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012); [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).

[Numbers 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 16:47</span></span>

A striking proof of the efficacy of that very Aaronic priesthood which
the rebels had presumed to reject. The incense offering which had
brought down destruction when presented by unauthorised hands, now in
the hand of the true priest is the medium of instant salvation to the
whole people. Aaron by his acceptable ministration and his personal
self-devotion foreshadows emphatically in this transaction the perfect
mediation and sacrifice of Himself made by Christ.
