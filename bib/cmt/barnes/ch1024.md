### [1 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 24:3</span></span>

Zadok and Ahimelech (rather Abiathar, see [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006)) assisted David in drawing up the
priestly courses, as the "captains of the host" assisted him in making
the divisions of the singers [Ch1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 24:5</span></span>

One sort with another - i. e., "the assignment of their order in the
courses was made by lot to the families belonging to Eleazar, and to the
families belonging to Ithamar, equally." Both houses had furnished
functionaries of the highest class, and therefore no preference was now
given to either over the other.

[1 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 24:6</span></span>

Wrote them before the king - i. e., "wrote down their names as the lots
were drawn forth."

Ahimelech the son of Abiathar - A wrong reading. It should be "Abiathar,
the son of Ahimelech." See the [Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017) note.

[1 Chronicles 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 24:19</span></span>

These were the orderings ... - i. e., "this was the numerical order
fixed for their ministerial attendance in the house of the Lord - an
attendance which was after the manner determined for them by their
forefather Aaron, according to instructions which he received from God."

[1 Chronicles 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 24:20</span></span>

The object of this second enumeration of the Levitical families (compare
1 Chr. 23:7-23) seems to be the designation of the heads of the families
in David's time. The omission of the Gershonites is curious, and can
only be accounted for by supposing that the author did not find any
account of their heads in his authorities. The addition to the Merarites
[Ch1 24:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026) is also curious. It
brings the number of families up to twenty-five, which is one more than
we should have expected.

[1 Chronicles 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 24:23</span></span>

Neither "Hebron" nor "the first" is found in the present Hebrew text;
but they seem to have been rightly supplied by our translators from [Ch1
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#019). The four persons named appear
to have been contemporaries of David, the heads of the Hebronite houses
in his time (compare [Ch1 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#031)).

[1 Chronicles 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 24:26</span></span>

The sons of Jaaziah, Beno - Beno is not really a name. It is the Hebrew
for "his son," and is to be attached to Jaaziah. Translate [Ch1
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#027), "and the sons of Merari by
Jaaziah his son (were) Shoham and Zaccur, and Ibri." The meaning of the
whole passage [Ch1 24:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#026) seems to
be that there were three branches of the Merarites the Beni-Mahli, the
Beni-Mushi, and the Beni-Jaaziah.

[1 Chronicles 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 24:31</span></span>

The principal fathers over against their younger brethren - i. e., "all
the Levitical houses enumerated drew lots in their courses on equal
terms, the older families having no advantage over the younger ones." As
there were 24 courses of the priests, so we must suppose that there were
24 of the Levites, though the number of the families as given in the
text 1 Chr. 23:7-23; [Ch1 24:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020) is
25.
