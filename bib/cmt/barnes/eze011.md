### [Ezekiel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 11:1</span></span>

The gate - The gate of the templecourt. The gate was the place of
judgment.

Five and twenty men - Not the same men as in [Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md). There they were representatives
of the "priests," here of the "princes." The number is, no doubt,
symbolic, made up, probably, of 24 men and the king. The number 24
points to the tribes of undivided Israel.

Jaazaniah ... Pelatiah - We know nothing more of these men. The former
name was probably common at that time [Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md). In these two names there is an
allusion to the false hopes which they upheld. "Jaazaniah" (Yah (weh)
listeneth) "son of Azur" (the Helper); "Pelatiah" (Yah (weh) rescues)
"son of Benaiah" (Yah (weh) builds). In the latter case, death [Eze
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013.md) turned the allusion into bitter
irony.

[Ezekiel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 11:3</span></span>

It is not near - In contradiction to [Eze
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002.md).

Let us build houses - "To build houses" implies a sense of security.
Jeremiah bade the exiles "build houses" in a foreign land because they
would not soon quit it [Jer 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005.md); [Jer
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007.md). These false counselors promised
to their countrymen a sure and permanent abode in the city which God had
doomed to destruction. No need, they said, to go far for safety; you are
perfectly safe at home. The Hebrew, however, is, difficult: literally it
means, "It is not near to build houses," which may be explained as
spoken in mockery of such counsel as that of Jeremiah: matters have not
gone so far as to necessitate "house-building" in a foreign land. The
same idea is expressed by the image of the "caldron:" whatever
devastation may rage around the city, we are safe within its walls, as
flesh within a caldron is unburned by the surrounding fire (compare [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 11:7</span></span>

All that shall remain in the city are the buried dead. Bloodshed and
murder were at this time rife in Jerusalem, and these were among the
chief crimes that were bringing down judgment upon the city. All the
inhabitants that should yet survive were destined to be carried away
into exile.

[Ezekiel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 11:10</span></span>

In the border of Israel - Hamath was the northern border of Israel
(margin reference). At Riblah in Hamath the king of Babylon judged and
condemned Zedekiah and the princes of Judah [Jer
52:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md).

[Ezekiel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 11:13</span></span>

The death of Pelatiah was communicated in this vision, which represented
ideally the idolatry in which Pelatiah had actually been foremost.

[Ezekiel 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 11:15</span></span>

Thy kindred - The original word is derived from a root, suggesting the
ideas of "redeeming" and "avenging" as connected with the bond of
"kindred." The word, therefore, conveys here a special reproach to the
proud Jews, who have been so ready to cast off the claims of
blood-relationship, and at the same time a hope of restoration to those
who have been rudely thrown aside.

[Ezekiel 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 11:16</span></span>

As a little sanctuary - Rather, I will be to them for a little while a
sanctuary. The blessing was provisional, they were to look forward to a
blessing more complete. For a little while they were to be satisfied
with God's special presence in a foreign land, but they were to look
forward to a renewal of His presence in the restored temple of
Jerusalem. "sanctuary" means here strictly the holy place, the
tabernacle of the Most High: Yahweh will Himself be to the exiles in the
place of the local sanctuary, in which the Jews of Jerusalem so much
prided themselves (compare the margin reference). Here is the germ from
which is developed Ezek. 40-48, the picture of the kingdom of God in its
new form.

[Ezekiel 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 11:19</span></span>

Compare Rev. 21. The identity of thought and language in Ezekiel,
predicting the new kingdom of Israel, and in John, foretelling the
kingdom of heaven, forces upon us the conclusion that the prophecy of
Ezekiel has an ultimate reference to that climax which John plainly
indicates.

[Eze 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md)

One heart - So long as the Israelites were distracted by the service of
many gods, such unity was impossible; but now, when they shall have
taken away the "abominations" from the land, they shall be united in
heart to serve the true God.

Stony heart ... heart of flesh - The heart unnaturally hardened, and the
heart reawakened to feelings proper to man.

[Ezekiel 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 11:23</span></span>

The mountain which is on the east side of the city - The Mount of
Olives. The rabbis commenting on this passage said the Shechinah retired
to this Mount, and there for three years called in vain to the people
with human voice that they should repent. On that mountain, Christ
stood, when He wept over the fair city so soon to be utterly destroyed.
From that mountain he descended, amid loud Hosannas, to enter the city
and temple as a Judge.
