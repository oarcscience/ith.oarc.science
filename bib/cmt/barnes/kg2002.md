### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 2:1</span></span>

The events of this chapter are related out of their chronological order.
Elijah's translation did not take place until after the accession of
Jehoram in Judah [Ch2 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012), which was
not until the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016). The writer of Kings, having
concluded his notices of the ministry of Elijah in chapter 1, and being
about to pass in 2 Kings 3 to the ministry of Elisha, thought it best to
insert at this point the final scene of Elijah's life, though it did not
occur until several years later.

Gilgal - The modern Jiljilieh, on the highland between Nablous and
Beitin (Bethel), about eight and a half miles from the latter, is now
commonly supposed to be the Gilgal here mentioned. Some regard it as the
ordinary residence of Elisha [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 2:2</span></span>

Tarry here - Elijah's motive in making this request is not clear.
Perhaps he thought that so awful and sacred a scene as that which he was
led to expect [Kg2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#009), should be kept
as secret as possible.

The Lord hath sent me to Bethel - Elijah may have been directed to
Bethel, because of the "School of the prophets" there, that the sight of
him - if not his words - might console and encourage them before they
lost him forever.

As the Lord liveth ... - This double oath, repeated three times [Kg2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#004), [Kg2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#006), is very remarkable. The two
clauses of it are separately used with some frequency (see [Jdg
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019); [Rut
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#013); [Sa1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#026), etc.), but it is comparatively
seldom that they are united (see the marginal references).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 2:3</span></span>

Came forth to Elisha - It does not appear that any interchange of speech
took place between "the sons of the prophets" (see the marginal
reference note) and Elijah; but independent revelations had been made to
the two "schools" at Bethel and Jericho [Kg2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005), and also to Elisha, with respect
to Elijah's coming removal.

From thy head - i. e. from his position as teacher and master. The
teacher sat on an elevated seat, so that his feet were level with the
heads of his pupils (compare [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003)).

Hold ye your peace - i. e. "Say nothing - disturb us not. The matter is
too sacred for words."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 2:7</span></span>

Fifty men of the sons of the prophets - We see by this how large were
the prophetical schools. It is implied that the "fifty" were only a
portion of the school of Jericho. They ascended the abrupt heights
behind the town, from where they would command a view of the whole
course of the river and of the opposite bank for many miles.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 2:8</span></span>

They were divided ... - The attestation to the divine mission of Elijah
furnished by this miracle would tend to place him upon a par in the
thoughts of men with the two great leaders of the nation named in the
marginal references.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 2:9</span></span>

Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me - Like Solomon, Elisha
asks for no worldly advantage, but for spiritual power to discharge his
office aright. The "double portion" is that which denotes the proportion
of a father's property which was the right of an eldest son [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017). Elisha therefore asked for
twice as much of Elijah's spirit as should be inherited by any other of
the "sons of the prophets." He simply claimed, i. e., to be acknowledged
as Elijah's firstborn spiritual son.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 2:10</span></span>

It would be better to omit the words "when I am," which are not in the
original. The sign was to be Elisha's seeing the actual translation,
which he did [Kg2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 2:11</span></span>

Elijah went up ... - No honest exegesis can explain this passage in any
other sense than as teaching the translation of Elijah, who was taken
from the earth, like Enoch [Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024),
without dying. Compare Ecclesiasticus 48:9.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 2:12</span></span>

The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof - These difficult words
are probably said of Elijah, whom Elisha addresses as "the true defense
of Israel, better than either the chariots or horsemen" which he saw.
Hence, his rending his clothes in token of his grief.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 2:14</span></span>

Where ... - Some prefer, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah, even he? And
when he had smitten, etc." Or, according to others, "now when he, etc."
Elisha's smiting of the waters seems to have been tentative. He was not
sure of its result. Hence, the form of his invocation - "Where is the
Lord God of Elijah? Is He here - i. e. - with me, or is He not?"
Answered by the event, he appears never subsequently to have doubted.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 2:16</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. The words "cast him upon some
mountain," rather imply that they expected to find the prophet alive.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 2:17</span></span>

Till he was ashamed - i. e. to refuse them any longer.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 2:19</span></span>

The water is naught - i. e. "bad."

And the ground barren - Translate "and the land apt to miscarry." The
stream was thought to be the cause of untimely births, abortions, and
the like, among the cattle, perhaps also among the people, that drank of
it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 2:20</span></span>

The "new cruse" and the "salt" are evidently chosen from a regard to
symbolizm. The foul stream represents sin, and to cleanse it emblems of
purity must he taken. Hence, the clean "new" dish previously unused, and
thus untainted; and the salt, a common Scriptural symbol of incorruption
(see [Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013); [Eze
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024); [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013), etc.).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 2:21</span></span>

The spring of the waters - The spring intended is probably that now
called Ain-es-Sultan, which is not much more than a mile from the site
of the ancient town. It is described as a large and beautiful fountain
of sweet and pleasant water. The springs issuing from the eastern base
of the highlands of Judah and Benjamin are to this day generally
brackish.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 2:23</span></span>

As Beth-el was the older seat of the calf-worship [Kg1
12:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032); 13:1-32, a prophet of Yahweh
was not unlikely to meet with insult there.

By the way - i. e. "by the usual road," probably that which winds up the
Wady Suweinit, under hills even now retaining some trees, and in
Elisha's time covered with a dense forest, the haunt of savage animals.
Compare [Kg1 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#024); and for the
general prevalence of beasts of prey in the country, both earlier and
later than this, see [Jdg 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005); [Sa1
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#031); [Kg2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025); [Amo
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019), etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 2:24</span></span>

On this occasion only do we find Elisha a minister of vengeance. Perhaps
it was necessary to show, at the outset of his career as a prophet, that
he too, so mild and peaceful could, like Elijah, wield the terrors of
God's judgments ([Kg1 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019) note). The
persons really punished were, not so much the children, as the wicked
parents [Kg2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023), whose mouth-pieces
the children were, and who justly lost the gift of offspring of which
they had shown themselves unworthy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 2:25</span></span>

Carmel - Where Elisha held gatherings for religious purposes [Kg2
4:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023) during one period of his life,
if he did not actually reside there.
