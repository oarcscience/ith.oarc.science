### [Leviticus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 12:0</span></span>

Lev 12-15. Ceremonial Purifications

The Purifications of the Law fall under three heads;

(1). Those for defilement arising from secretions;

(2). Those for the leprosy;

(3). Those for pollution from corpses.

The first and second classes are described in these chapters; the last,
as relates to human corpses, in [Num
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md), etc., and as relates to the
bodies of dead animals, in [Lev
11:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024.md), [Lev
11:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#031.md).

[Leviticus 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 12:1</span></span>

This chapter would more naturally follow the 15th chapter of Leviticus.
See the note to [Lev 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md).

[Leviticus 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 12:3</span></span>

On circumcision, see [Gen 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md) note.

[Leviticus 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 12:4</span></span>

The Levitical law ascribed impurity exclusively to the mother, in no
degree to the Child.

[Leviticus 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 12:5</span></span>

Some have thought that this doubling of each of the two periods was
intended to remind the people of the fact that woman represents the
lower side of human nature, and was the first to fall into temptation.
[Ti1 2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013.md); [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). The ancients had a notion that
the mother suffers for a longer time after the birth of a girl than
after the birth of a boy. The period required for the restoration of her
health in the one case was thirty days, and in the other, it was 40 or
42 days. This notion may have been connected with a general custom of
observing the distinction as early as the time of Moses.

[Leviticus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 12:6</span></span>

The sacrificial act expressed an acknowledgment of sin and a dedication
of herself to Yahweh. See [Lev 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014.md).

[Lev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md)

Of the first year - literally, as in the margin, "a son of his year."
This expression is supposed to mean one less than a year old, while the
"son of a year" is one that has just completed its first year.

[Lev 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008.md)

A lamb - Rather, one of the flock; either a sheep or a goat; it is not
the same word as in [Lev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md).

Two turtles, or two young pigeons - See the note at [Lev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014.md). The Virgin Mary availed herself
of the liberty which the Law allowed to the poor, and offered the
inferior burnt-offering [Luk 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024.md).
