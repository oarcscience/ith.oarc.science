### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 5:0</span></span>

Analysis Of The Chapter

This chapter consists of two parts:

I. The continuation of the subject of the coming of the Lord; [Th1
5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md); and,

II\. Various practical exhortations.

I. In the first part, the apostle states:

\(1\) that it was well understood by the Thessalonians that the coming
of the Lord would be sudden, and at an unexpected moment, [Th1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md);

\(2\) he refers to the effect of his coming on the wicked and the
righteous, and says that it would be attended with the sudden and
inevitable destruction of the former, [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md); but that the result of his coming
would be far different on the righteous; [Th1
5:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md).

The prospect of his coming was fitted to make them watchful and sober,
[Th1 5:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md); and his advent would be
attended with their certain salvation; [Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md).

II\. In the second part of the chapter, he exhorts them to show proper
respect for their spiritual teachers and rulers, [Th1
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md); to endeavor to restrain the
unruly, to support the feeble, and to evince toward all the spirit of
patience and forbearance, [Th1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md);
to manifest a meek and benevolent manner of life, [Th1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md); to rejoice always, [Th1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016.md); to pray constantly, [Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md); to render thanks to God in every
situation, [Th1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md); to cherish the
influences of the Holy Ghost on their souls, [Th1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md); to show respect for all the
divine prophetic communications, [Th1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020.md); to consider and examine
carefully everything submitted to them for belief; to adhere steadfastly
to all that was good and true, [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md); and to avoid the very appearance
of evil, [Th1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md). The Epistle closes
with a fervent prayer that God would sanctify them entirely; with an
earnest entreaty that they would pray for him; with a command that the
Epistle should be read to all the churches, and with the benediction;
[Th1 5:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

But of the times and the seasons - See the notes, [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md). The reference here is to the
coming of the Lord Jesus, and to the various events connected with his
advent; see the close of 1 Thes. 4.

Ye have no need that I write unto you - That is, they had received all
the information on the particular point to which he refers, which it was
necessary they should have. He seems to refer particularly to the
suddenness of his coming. It is evident from this, as well as from other
parts of this Epistle, that this had been, from some cause, a prominent
topic which he had dwelt on when he was with them; see the notes on [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 5:2</span></span>

For yourselves know perfectly - That is, they had been fully taught
this. There could be no doubt in their minds respecting it.

The day of the Lord so cometh - Of the Lord Jesus - for so the word
"Lord" in the New Testament commonly means; see the notes, [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md). The "day of the Lord" means that
day in which he will be manifested, or in which he will be the prominent
object in view of the assembled universe.

As a thief in the night - Suddenly and unexpectedly, as a robber breaks
into a dwelling. A thief comes without giving any warning, or any
indications of his approach. He not only gives none, but he is careful
that none shall be given. It is a point with him that, if possible, the
man whose house he is about to rob shall have no means of ascertaining
his approach until he comes suddenly upon him; compare [Mat
24:37-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md) notes; [Luk
12:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039.md) notes. In this way the Lord
Jesus will return to judgment; and this proves that all the attempts to
determine the day, the year, or the century when he will come, must be
fallacious. He intends that his coming to this world shall be sudden and
unexpected, "like that of a thief in the night;" that there shall be no
such indications of his approach that it shall not be sudden and
unexpected; and that no warning of it shall be given so that people may
know the time of his appearing. If this be not the point of the
comparison in expressions like this, what is it? Is there anything else
in which his coming will resemble that of a thief? And if this be the
true point of comparison, how can it be true that people can ascertain
when that is to occur? Assuredly, if they can, his coming will not be
like that of a thief; comp. notes on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 5:3</span></span>

For when they shall say, Peace and safety - That is, when the wicked
shall say this, for the apostle here refers only to those on whom
"sudden destruction" will come; compare [Mat
24:36-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036.md) notes; [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md) notes. It is clear from this:

\(1\) that when the Lord Jesus shall come the world will not all be
converted. There will be some to be "destroyed." How large this
proportion will be, it is impossible now to ascertain. This supposition,
however, is not inconsistent with the belief that there will be a
general prevalence of the gospel before that period.

\(2\) the impenitent and wicked world will be sunk in carnal security
when he comes. They will regard themselves as safe. They will see no
danger. They will give no heed to warning. They will be unprepared for
his advent. So it has always been. it seems to be a universal truth in
regard to all the visitations of God to wicked people for punishment,
that he comes upon them at a time when they are not expecting him, and
that they have no faith in the predictions of his advent. So it was in
the time of the flood; in the destruction of Sodom Gomorrah, and
Jerusalem; in the overthrow of Babylon: so it is when the sinner dies,
and so it will be when the Lord Jesus shall return to judge the world.
One of the most remarkable facts about the history of man is, that he
takes no warning from his Maker; he never changes his plans, or feels
any emotion, because his Creator "thunders damnation along his path,"
and threatens to destroy him in hell.

Sudden destruction - Destruction that was unforeseen (αἰφνίδιος
aiphnidios) or unexpected. The word here rendered "sudden," occurs
nowhere else in the New Testament, except in [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md), "Lest that day come upon you
unawares." The word rendered "destruction" - ὄλεθρος olethros - occurs
in the New Testament only here and in [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md); [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md); [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), in all of which places it is
correctly translated destruction. The word destruction is familiar to
us. It means, properly, demolition; pulling down; the annihilation of
the form of anything, or that form of parts which constitutes it what it
is; as the destruction of grass by eating; of a forest by cutting down
the trees; of life by murder; of the soul by consigning it to misery. It
does not necessarily mean annihilation - for a house or city is not
annihilated which is pulled down or burnt; a forest is not annihilated
which is cut down; and a man is not annihilated whose character and
happiness are destroyed. In regard to the destruction here referred to,
we may remark:

\(1\) it will be after the return of the Lord Jesus to judgment; and
hence it is not true that the wicked experience all the punishment which
they ever will in the present life;

\(2\) that it seems fairly implied that the destruction which they will
then suffer will not be annihilation, but will be connected with
conscious existence; and,

\(3\) that they will then be cut off from life and hope and salvation.

How can the solemn affirmation that they will be "destroyed suddenly,"
be consistent with the belief that all people will be saved? Is it the
same thing to be destroyed and to be saved? Does the Lord Jesus, when he
speaks of the salvation of his people, say that he comes to destroy
them?

As travail upon a woman with child - This expression is sometimes used
to denote great consternation, as in [Psa
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md); [Mic
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md); great pain, as [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Jer
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md); [Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021.md); or the suddenness with which
anything occurs; [Jer 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md). It seems
here to be used to denote two things; first, that the coming of the Lord
to a wicked world will be sudden; and, secondly, that it will be an
event of the most distressing and overwhelming nature.

And they shall not escape - That is, the destruction, or punishment.
They calculated on impunity, but now the time will have come when none
of these refuges will avail them, and no rocks will cover them from the
"wrath to come."

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you
as a thief - The allusion here is to the manner in which a thief or
robber accomplishes his purpose. He comes in the night, when people are
asleep. So, says the apostle, the Lord will come to the wicked. They are
like those who are asleep when the thief comes upon them. But it is not
so with Christians. They are, in relation to the coming of the day of
the Lord, as people are who are awake when the robber comes. They could
see his approach, and could prepare for it, so that it would not take
them by surprise.

[1 Thessalonians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 5:5</span></span>

Ye are all the children of light - All who are Christians. The phrase"
children of light" is a Hebraism, meaning that they were the enlightened
children of God.

And the children of the day - Who live as if light always shone round
about them. The meaning is, that in reference to the coming of the Lord
they are as people would be in reference to the coming of a thief, if
there were no night and no necessity of slumber. They would always be
wakeful and active, and it would be impossible to come upon them by
surprise. Christians are always to be wakeful and vigilant; they are so
to expect the coming of the Redeemer, that he will not find them off
their guard, and will not come upon them by surprise.

[1 Thessalonians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 5:6</span></span>

Therefore let us no sleep, as do others - As the wicked world does;
compare notes, [Mat 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005.md).

But let us watch - That is, for the coming of the Lord. Let us regard it
as an event which is certainly to occur, and which may occur at any
moment; notes, [Mat 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013.md).

And be sober - The word here used (νήφω nēphō) is rendered sober in [Th1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md), [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md); [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md); and watch in [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md), and [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md). It does not elsewhere occur in
the New Testament. It properly means, to be temperate or abstinent,
especially in respect to wine. Joseph. Jewish Wars, 5. 5, 7; Xenophon,
Cyr. 7. 5, 20; and then it is used in a more general sense, as meaning
to be sober-minded, watchful, circumspect. In this passage there is an
allusion to the fact that persons not only sleep in the night, but that
they are frequently drunken in the night also. The idea is, that the
Lord Jesus, when he comes, will find the wicked sunk not only in carnal
security, but in sinful indulgences, and that those who are Christians
ought not only to be awake and to watch as in the day-time, but to be
temperate. They ought to be like persons engaged in the sober, honest,
and appropriate employments of the day, and not like those who waste
their days in sleep, and their nights in revelry.

A man who expects soon to see the Son of God coming to judgment, ought
to be a sober man. No one would wish to be summoned from a scene of
dissipation to his bar. And who would wish to be called there from the
ball-room; from the theater; from the scene of brilliant worldly
amusemet? The most frivolous votary of the world; the most accomplished
and flattered and joyous patron of the ball-room; the most
richly-dressed and admired daughter of vanity, would tremble at the
thought of being summoned from those brilliant halls, where pleasure is
now found, to the judgment bar. They would wish to have at least a
little time that they might prepare for so solemn a scene. But if so, as
this event may at any moment occur, why should they not be habitually
sober-minded? Why should they not aim to be always in that state of mind
which they know would be appropriate to meet him? Especially should
Christians live with such vigilance and soberness as to be always
prepared to meet the Son of God. What Christian can think it appropriate
for him to go up to meet his Saviour from the theater, the ballroom, or
the brilliant worldly party? A Christian ought always so to live that
the coming of the Son of God in the clouds of heaven would not excite
the least alarm.

[1 Thessalonians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 5:7</span></span>

For they that sleep, sleep in the night - Night is the time for sleep.
The day is the time for action, and in the light of day people should be
employed. Night and sleep are made for each other, and so are the day
and active employment. The meaning here is, that it is in accordance
with the character of those who are of the night, that is, sinners, to
be sunk in stupidity and carnal security, as if they were asleep; but
for the children of the day, that is, for Christians, it is no more
appropriate to be inactive than it is for people to sleep in the
daytime. "It is not to be wondered at that wicked people are negligent
and are given to vice, for they are ignorant of the will of God.
Negligence in doing right, and corrupt morals, usually accompany
ignorance." Rosenmuller.

And they that be drunken, are drunken in the night - The night is
devoted by them to revelry and dissipation. It is in accordance with the
usual custom in all lands and times, that the night is the usual season
for riot and revelry. The leisure, the darkness, the security from
observation, and the freedom from the usual toils and cares of life,
have caused those hours usually to be selected for indulgence in
intemperate eating and drinking. This was probably more particularly the
case among the ancients than with us, and much as drunkenness abounded,
it was much more rare to see a man intoxicated in the day-time than it
is now. To be drunk then in the day-time was regarded as the greatest
disgrace. See Polyb. Exc. Leg. 8, and Apul. viii., as quoted by
Wetstein; compare [Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md) note; [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md) note. The object of the apostle
here is, to exhort Christians to be sober and temperate, and the meaning
is, that it is as disgraceful for them to indulge in habits of revelry,
as for a man to be drunk in the day-time. The propriety of this
exhortation, addressed to Christians, is based on the fact that
intoxication was hardly regarded as a crime, and, surrounded as they
were with those who freely indulged in drinking to excess, they were
then, as they are now, exposed to the danger of disgracing their
religion. The actions of Christians ought always to be such that they
may be performed in open day and in the view of all the world. Other
people seek the cover of the night to perform their deeds; the Christian
should do nothing which may not be done under the full blaze of day.

[1 Thessalonians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 5:8</span></span>

But let us, who are of the day, be sober - Temperate, as people usually
are in the daytime.

Putting on the breast-plate of faith and love - This is a favorite
comparison of the apostle Paul; see it explained at length in the notes
on [Eph 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md).

And for an helmet, the hope of salvation - See the notes at [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 5:9</span></span>

For God hath not appointed us to wrath - This is designed as an
encouragement to effort to secure our salvation. The wish of God is to
save us, and therefore we should watch and be sober; we should take to
ourselves the whole of the Christian armor, and strive for victory. If
he had appointed us to wrath, effort would have been in vain, for we
could do nothing but yield to our inevitable destiny. The hope of a
final triumph should animate us in our efforts, and cheer us in our
struggles with our foes. How much does the hope of victory animate the
soldier in battle! When morally certain of success, how his arm is
nerved! When everything conspires to favor him, and when he seems to
feel that God fights for him, and intends to give him the victory, how
his heart exults, and how strong is he in battle! Hence, it was a great
point among the ancients, when about entering into battle, to secure
evidence that the gods favored them, and meant to give them the victory.

For this purpose they offered sacrifices, and consulted the flight of
birds and the entrails of animals; and for this armies were accompanied
by soothsayers and priests, that they might interpret any signs which
might occur that would be favorable, or to propitiate the favor of the
gods by sacrifice. See Homer, passim; Arrian's Expedition of Alexander,
and the classic writers generally. The apostle alludes to something of
this kind here. He would excite us to maintain the Christian warfare
manfully, by the assurance that God intends that we shall be triumphant.
This we are to learn by no conjectures of soothsayers; by no observation
of the flight of birds; by no sacrifice which we can make to propitiate
his favor, but by the unerring assurance of his holy word. If we are
Christians, we know that he intends our salvation, and that victory will
be ours; if we are willing to become Christians, we know that the
Almighty arm will be stretched out to aid us, and that the "gates of
hell" cannot prevent it.

[1 Thessalonians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 5:10</span></span>

Who died for us - That is, to redeem us. He designed by his death that
we should ultimately live with him; and this effect of his death could
be secured only as it was an atoning sacrifice.

Whether we wake or sleep - Whether we are found among the living or the
dead when he comes. The object here is to show that the one class would
have no advantage over the other. This was designed to calm their minds
in their trials, and to correct an error which seems to have prevailed
in the belief that those who were found alive when he should return
would have some priority over those who were dead; see the notes on [Th1
4:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md).

Should live together with him - See the notes at [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md). The word rendered "together"
(ἁμα hama) is not to be regarded as connected with the phrase "with him"
- as meaning that he and they would be "together," but it refers to
those who "wake and those who sleep" - those who are alive and those who
are dead - meaning that they would be "together" or would be with the
Lord "at the same time;" there would be no priority or precedence.
Rosenmuller.

[1 Thessalonians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 5:11</span></span>

Wherefore comfort yourselves - notes, [Th1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018.md).

And edify one another - Strive to build up each other, or to establish
each other in the faith by these truths; notes, [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md).

Even as also ye do - Continue to do it. Let nothing intervene to disturb
the harmony and consolation which you have been accustomed to derive
from these high and holy doctrines.

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you - Who
they were is not mentioned. It is evident, however, that the church was
not left without appointed persons to minister to it when its founders
should be away. We know that there were presbyters ordained over the
church at Ephesus, and over the churches in Crete ([Act
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017); Titus i. 5.md), and that there
were bishops and deacons at Philippi [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), and there is every reason to
believe that similar officers would be appointed in every newly
organized church, The word "know" seems to mean that they were not to
make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them -
to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them. While a
people are not obtrusively to intermeddle with the business of a
minister, anymore than they are with that of any other man, yet there
are things in regard to him with which they should be acquainted. They
should seek to be personally acquainted with him, and make him their
confidant and counselor in their spiritual troubles. They should seek
his friendship, and endeavor to maintain all proper contact with him.
They should not regard him as a distant man, or as a stranger among
them. They should so far understand his circumstances as to know what is
requisite to make him comfortable, and should be on such terms that they
may readily and cheerfully furnish what he needs. And they are to "know"
or regard him as their spiritual teacher and ruler; not to be strangers
to the place where he preaches the word of life, and not to listen to
his admonitions and reproofs as those of a stranger, but as those of a
pastor and friend.

Which labour among you - There is no reason to suppose, as many have
done, that the apostle here refers to different classes of ministers. He
rather refers to different parts of the work which the same ministers
perform. The first is, that they "labor" - that is, evidently, in
preaching the gospel. For the use of the word, see [Joh
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#038.md), where it occurs twice; [Co1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010.md); [Co1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016.md). The word is one which properly
expresses wearisome toil, and implies that the office of preaching is
one that demands constant industry.

And are over you in the Lord - That is, by the appointment of the Lord,
or under his direction. They are not absolute sovereigns, but are
themselves subject to one who is over them - the Lord Jesus. On the word
here rendered "are over you" (προΐσταμένους proistamenous) see the notes
on [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md), where it is translated
"ruleth."

And admonish you - The word here used (νουθετέω noutheteō) is rendered
"admonish," and "admonished," in [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md); [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md); [Th2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015.md); and warn, and warning, [Co1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014.md); [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md); [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md). It does not elsewhere occur in
the New Testament. It means, to put in mind; and then to warn, entreat,
exhort. It is a part of the duty of a minister to put his people in mind
of the truth; to warn them of danger; to exhort them to perform their
duty; to admonish them if they go astray.

[1 Thessalonians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 5:13</span></span>

And to esteem them very highly in love - To cherish for them an
affectionate regard. The office of a minister of religion demands
respect. They who are faithful in that office have a claim on the kind
regards of their fellow-men. The very nature of the office requires them
to do good to others, and there is no benefactor who should be treated
with more affectionate regard than he who endeavors to save us from
ruin; to impart to us the consolations of the gospel in affliction; and
to bring us and our families to heaven.

For their work's sake - Not primarily as a personal matter, or on their
own account, but on account of the work in which they are engaged. It is
a work whose only tendency, when rightly performed, is to do good. It
injures no man, but contributes to the happiness of all. It promotes
intelligence, industry, order, neatness, economy, temperance, chastity,
charity, and kindness in this world, and leads to eternal blessedness in
the world to come. A man who sincerely devotes himself to such a work
has a claim on the kind regards of his fellow-men.

And be at peace among yourselves - See the [Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050.md) note; [Rom
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018.md); [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md) notes.

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

Now we exhort you, brethren - Margin, "beseech." This earnest entreaty
is evidently addressed to the whole church, and not to the ministers of
the gospel only. The duties here enjoined are such as pertain to all
Christians in their appropriate spheres, and should not be left to be
performed by ministers only.

Warn them - The same word which in [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md) is rendered "admonish." It is the
duty of every church member, as well as of the ministers of the gospel,
affectionately to admonish those whom they know to be living contrary to
the requirements of the gospel. One reason why there is so little piety
in the church, and why so many professors of religion go astray, is,
that the great mass of church members feel no responsibility on this
subject. They suppose that it is the duty only of the officers of the
church to admonish an erring brother, and hence many become careless and
cold and worldly, and no one utters a kind word to them to recall them
to a holy walk with God.

That are unruly - Margin, "disorderly." The word here used (ἄτακτος
ataktos), is one which properly means "not keeping the ranks," as of
soldiers; and then irregular, confused, neglectful of duty, disorderly.
The reference here is to the members of the church who were irregular in
their Christian walk. It is not difficult, in an army, when soldiers get
out of the line, or leave their places in the ranks, or are thrown into
confusion, to see that little can be accomplished in such a state of
irregularity and confusion. As little difficult is it, when the members
of a church are out of their places, to see that little can be
accomplished in such a state. Many a church is like an army where half
the soldiers are out of the line; where there is entire insubordination
in the ranks, and where not half of them could be depended on for
efficient service in a campaign. Indeed, an army would accomplish little
if as large a proportion of it were irregular, idle, remiss, or pursuing
their own aims to the neglect of the public interest, as there are
members of the church who can never be depended on in accomplishing the
great purpose for which it was organized.

Comfort the feeble-minded - The dispirited; the disheartened; the
downcast. To do this is also the duty of each church member. There are
almost always those who are in this condition, and it is not easy to
appreciate the value of a kind word to one in that state. Christians are
assailed by temptation; in making efforts to do good they are opposed
and become disheartened; in their contests with their spiritual foes
they are almost overcome; they walk through shades of spiritual night,
and find no comfort. In such circumstances, how consoling is the voice
of a friend! How comforting is it to feel that they are not alone! How
supporting to be addressed by one who has had the same conflicts, and
has triumphed! Every Christian - especially every one who has been long
in the service of his Master - has a fund of experience which is the
property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those
who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian
way. He who has that experience should help a weak and sinking brother;
he should make his own experience of the efficacy of religion in his
trials and conflicts, the means of sustaining others in their struggles.
There is no one who would not reach out his hand to save a child borne
down rapid stream; yet how often do experienced and strong men in the
Christian faith pass by those who are struggling in the "deep waters,
where the proud waves have come over their souls!"

Support the weak - See the notes at [Rom
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md).

Be patient toward all men - See the Greek word here used, explained in
the notes on [Co1 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004.md); compare [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md); [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 5:15</span></span>

See that none render evil for evil - See the notes on [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md), [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md). The meaning here is, that we are
not to take vengeance; compare notes on [Rom
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md), [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md). This law is positive, and is
universally binding. The moment we feel ourselves acting from a desire
to "return evil for evil," that moment we are acting wrong. It may be
right to defend our lives and the lives of our friends; to seek the
protection of the law for our persons, reputation, or property, against
those who would wrong us; to repel the assaults of calumniators and
slanderers, but in no case should the motive be to do them wrong for the
evil which they have done us.

But ever follow that which is good - Which is benevolent, kind, just,
generous; see the notes, [Rom
12:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md).

Both among yourselves, and to all men - The phrase "to all men," seems
to have been added to avoid the possibility of misconstruction. Some
might possibly suppose that this was a good rule to be observed toward
those of their own number, but that a greater latitude in avenging
injuries might be allowable toward their enemies out of the church. The
apostle, therefore, says that the rule is universal. It relates to the
pagan, to infidels, sceptics, and persecutors, as well as to the members
of the church. To every man we are to do good as we are able - no matter
what they do to us. This is the rule which God himself observes toward
the evil and unthankful (notes, [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045).md), and is one of the original and
beautiful laws of our holy religion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 5:16</span></span>

Rejoice evermore - See the notes on [Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md); [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 5:17</span></span>

Pray without ceasing - See the notes on [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md). The direction here may be
fairly construed as meaning:

\(1\) That we are to be regular and constant in the observance of the
stated seasons of prayer. We are to observe the duty of prayer in the
closet, in the family, and in the assembly convened to call on the name
of the Lord. We are not to allow this duty to be interrupted or
intermitted by any trifling cause. We are so to act that it may be said
we pray regularly in the closet, in the family, and at the usual seasons
when the church prays to which we belong.

\(2\) we are to maintain an uninterrupted and constant spirit of prayer.
We are to be in such a frame of mind as to be ready to pray publicly if
requested; and when alone, to improve any moment of leisure which we may
have when we feel ourselves strongly inclined to pray. That Christian is
in a bad state of mind who has suffered himself, by attention to worldly
cares, or by light conversation, or by gaiety and vanity, or by reading
an improper book, or by eating or drinking too much, or by late hours at
night among the thoughtless and the vain, to be brought into such a
condition that he cannot engage in prayer with proper feelings. There
has been evil done to the soul if it is not prepared for communion with
God at all times, and if it would not find pleasure in approaching his
holy throne.

[1 Thessalonians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 5:18</span></span>

In every thing give thanks - See the [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md) note; [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md) note. We can always find something
to be thankful for, and there may be reasons why we ought to be thankful
for even those dispensations which appear dark and frowning. Chrysostom,
once the archbishop of Constantinople, and then driven into exile,
persecuted, and despised, died far away form all the splendors of the
capital, and all the comforts and honors which he had enjoyed, uttering
his favorite motto - δόξα τῷ Θεῷ πάντων ἕνεκεν doxa tō Theō pantōn
heneken - "glory to God for all things." Bibliotheca Sacra, 1:700. So we
may praise God for everything that happens to us under his government. A
man owes a debt of obligation to him for anything which will recall him
from his wanderings, and which will prepare him for heaven. Are there
any dealings of God toward people which do not contemplate such an end?
Is a man ever made to drink the cup of affliction when no drop of mercy
is intermingled? Is he ever visited with calamity which does not in some
way contemplate his own temporal or eternal good! Could we see all, we
should see that we are never placed in circumstances in which there is
not much for which we should thank God. And when, in his dealings, a
cloud seems to cover his face, let us remember the good things without
number which we have received, and especially remember that we are in
the world of redeeming love, and we shall find enough for which to be
thankful.

For this is the will of God - That is, that you should be grateful. This
is what God is pleased to require you to perform in the name of the Lord
Jesus. In the gift of that Saviour he has laid the foundation for that
claim, and he requires that you should not be unmindful of the
obligation; see the notes, [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 5:19</span></span>

Quench not the Spirit - This language is taken from the way of putting
out a fire, and the sense is, we are not to extinguish the influences of
the Holy Spirit in our hearts. Possibly there may be an allusion here to
fire on an altar, which was to be kept constantly burning. This fire may
have been regarded as emblematic of devotion, and as denoting that that
devotion was never to become extinct. The Holy Spirit is the source of
true devotion, and hence the enkindlings of piety in the heart, by the
Spirit, are never to be quenched. Fire may be put out by pouring on
water; or by covering it with any incombustible substance; or by
neglecting to supply fuel. If it is to be made to burn, it must be
nourished with proper care and attention. The Holy Spirit, in his
influences on the soul, is here compared with fire that might be made to
burn more intensely, or that might be extinguished.

In a similar manner the apostle gives this direction to Timothy, "I put
thee in remembrance that thou stir up ἀναζωπυρεῖν anazōpurein, kindle
up, cause to burn) the gift of God;" [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md). Anything that will tend to damp
the ardor of piety in the soul; to chill our feelings; to render us cold
and lifeless in the service of God, may be regarded as "quenching the
Spirit." Neglect of cultivating the Christian graces, or of prayer, of
the Bible, of the sanctuary, of a careful watchfulness over the heart,
will do it. Worldliness, vanity, levity, ambition, pride, the love of
dress, or indulgence in an improper train of thought, will do it. It is
a great rule in religion that all the piety which there is in the soul
is the fair result of culture. A man has no more religion than he
intends to have; he has no graces of the Spirit which he does not seek;
he has no deadness to the world which is not the object of his sincere
desire, and which he does not aim to have. Any one, if he will, may make
elevated attainments in the divine life; or he may make his religion
merely a religion of form, and know little of its power and its
consolations.

[1 Thessalonians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">th1 5:20</span></span>

Despise not prophesyings - On the subject of prophesyings in the early
Christian church, see the notes on [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md) ff1 ff. The reference here seems
to be to preaching. They were not to undervalue it in comparison with
other things. It is possible that in Thessalonica, as appears to have
been the case subsequently in Corinth (compare [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019).md), there were those who regarded
the power of working miracles, or of speaking in unknown tongues, as a
much more eminent endowment than that of stating the truths of religion
in language easily understood. It would not be unnatural that
comparisons should be made between these two classes of endowments, much
to the disadvantage of the latter; and hence may have arisen this solemn
caution not to disregard or despise the ability to make known divine
truth in intelligible language. A similar counsel may not be
inapplicable to us now. The office of setting forth the truth of God is
to be the permanent office in the church; that of speaking foreign
languages by miraculous endowment, was to be temporary. But the office
of addressing mankind on the great duties of religion, and of publishing
salvation, is to be God's great ordinance for converting the world. It
should not be despised, and no man commends his own wisdom who contemns
it - for:

\(1\) it is God's appointment - the means which he has designated for
saving people.

\(2\) it has too much to entitle it to respect to make it proper to
despise or contemn it. There is nothing else that has so much power over
mankind as the preaching of the gospel; there is no other institution of
heaven or earth among people that is destined to exert so wide and
permanent an influence as the Christian ministry.

\(3\) it is an influence which is wholly good. No man is made the
poorer, or the less respectable, or more miserable in life or in death,
by following the counsels of a minister of Christ when he makes known
the gospel.

\(4\) he who despises it contemns that which is designed to promote his
own welfare, and which is indispensable for his salvation. It remains
yet to be shown that any man has promoted his own happiness, or the
welfare of his family, by affecting to treat with contempt the
instructions of the Christian ministry.

[1 Thessalonians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">th1 5:21</span></span>

Prove all things - Subject everything submitted to you to be believed to
the proper test. The word here used (δοκιμάζετε dokimazete), is one that
is properly applicable to metals, referring to the art of the assayer,
by which the true nature and value of the metal is tested; see notes,
[Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md). This trial was usually made
by fire. The meaning here is, that they were carefully to examine
everything proposed for their belief. They were not to receive it on
trust; to take it on assertion; to believe it because it was urged with
vehemence, zeal, or plausibility. In the various opinions and doctrines
which were submitted to them for adoption, they were to apply the
appropriate tests from reason and the word of God, and what they found
to be true they were to embrace; what was false they were to reject.
Christianity does not require people to disregard their reason, or to be
credulous. It does not expect them to believe anything because others
say it is so. It does not make it a duty to receive as undoubted truth
all that synods and councils have decreed; or all that is advanced by
the ministers of religion. It is, more than any other form of religion,
the friend of free inquiry, and would lead people everywhere to
understand the reason of the opinions which they entertain; compare [Act
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011.md); [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md).

Hold fast that which is good - Which is in accordance with reason and
the word of God; which is adapted to promote the salvation of the soul
and the welfare of society. This is just as much a duty as it is to
"prove all things." A man who has applied the proper tests, and has
found out what is truth, is bound to embrace it and to hold it fast. He
is not at liberty to throw it away, as if it were valueless; or to treat
truth and falsehood alike. It is a duty which he owes to himself and to
God to adhere to it firmly, and to suffer the loss of all things rather
than to abandon it. There are few more important rules in the New
Testament than the one in this passage. It shows what is the true nature
of Christianity, and it is a rule whose practical value cannot but be
felt constantly in our lives. Other religions require their votaries to
receive everything upon trust; Christianity asks us to examine
everything.

Error, superstition, bigotry, and fanaticism attempt to repress free
discussion, by saying that there are certain things which are too sacred
in their nature, or which have been too long held, or which are
sanctioned by too many great and holy names, to permit their being
subjected to the scrutiny of common eyes, or to be handled by common
hands. In opposition to all this, Christianity requires us to examine
everything - no matter by whom held; by what councils ordained; by what
venerableness of antiquity sustained; or by what sacredness it may be
invested. We are to receive no opinion until we are convinced that it is
true; we are to be subjected to no pains or penalties for not believing
what we do not perceive to be true; we are to be prohibited from
examining no opinion which our fellow-men regard as true, and which they
seek to make others believe. No popular current in favor of any
doctrine; no influence which name and rank and learning can give it, is
to commend it to us as certainly worthy of our belief. By whomsoever
held, we are to examine it freely before we embrace it; but when we are
convinced that it is true, it is to be held, no matter what current of
popular opinion or prejudice maybe against it; no matter what ridicule
may be poured upon it; and no matter though the belief of it may require
us to die a martyr's death.

[1 Thessalonians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">th1 5:22</span></span>

Abstain from all appearance of evil - Not only from evil itself, but
from that which seems to be wrong. There are many things which are known
to be wrong. They are positively forbidden by the laws of heaven, and
the world concurs in the sentiment that they are wicked. But there are
also many things about which there may be some reasonable doubt. It is
not quite easy to determine in the case what is right or wrong. The
subject has not been fully examined, or the question of its morality may
be so difficult to settle, that the mind may be nearly or quite balanced
in regard to it. There are many things which, in themselves, may not
appear to us to be positively wrong, but which are so considered by
large and respectable portions of the community; and for us to do them
would be regarded as inconsistent and improper. There are many things,
also, in respect to which there is great variety of sentiment among
mankind - where one portion would regard them as proper, and another as
improper.

There are things, also, where, whatever may be our motive, we may be
certain that our conduct will be regarded as improper. A great variety
of subjects, such as those pertaining to dress, amusements, the opera,
the ball-room, games of chance and hazard, and various practices in the
transaction of business, come under this general class; which, though on
the supposition that they cannot be proved to be in themselves
positively wrong or forbidden, have much the "appearance" of evil, and
will be so interpreted by others. The safe and proper rule is to lean
always to the side of virtue. In these instances it may be certain that
there will be no sin committed by abstaining; there may be by
indulgence. No command of God, or of propriety, will be violated if we
decline complying with these customs; but on the other hand we may wound
the cause of religion by yielding to what possibly is a mere temptation.
No one ever does injury or wrong by abstaining from the pleasures of the
ball-room, the theater, or a glass of wine; who can indulge in them
without, in the view of large and respectable portions of the community,
doing that which has the "appearance" at least of "evil?"

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

And the very God of peace - The God who gives peace or happiness;
compare notes, [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md).

Sanctify you - See the notes at [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md).

Wholly - ὁλοτελεῖς holoteleis. In every part; completely. It is always
proper to pray that God would make his people entirely holy. A prayer
for perfect sanctification, however, should not be adduced as a proof
that it is in fact attained in the present life.

Your whole spirit and soul and body - There is an allusion here,
doubtless, to the popular opinion in regard to what constitutes man. We
have a body; we have animal life and instincts in common with the
inferior creation; and we have also a rational and immortal soul. This
distinction is one that appears to the mass of people to be true, and
the apostle speaks of it in the language commonly employed by mankind.
At the same time, no one can demonstrate that it is not founded in
truth. The body we see, and there can be no difference of opinion in
regard to its existence. The "soul" (ἡ ψυκὴ hē psuchē - psyche), the
vital principle, the animal life, or the seat of the senses, desires,
affections, appetites, we have in common with other animals. It pertains
to the nature of the animal creation, though more perfect in some
animals than in others, but is in all distinct from the soul as the seat
of conscience, and as capable of moral agency.

See the use of the word in [Mat 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md);
[Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md); [Luk
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md); [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md); [Act
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md); [Rev
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009.md), et al. In the Pythagorean and
Platonic philosophy this was distinguished from the higher rational
nature ὁ νοῦς, τὸ πνεῦμα ho nous, to pneuma as this last belonged to man
alone. This "psyche" (ψυχὴ psuchē) "soul." or life, it is commonly
supposed, becomes extinct at death. It is so connected with the bodily
organization, that when the tissues of the animal frame cease their
functions, this ceases also. This was not, however, the opinion of the
ancient Greeks. Homer uses the term to denote that which leaves the body
with the breath, as escaping from the ἕρκος ὀδοντων herkos odontōn -
"the fence or sept of thy teeth" - and as also passing out through a
wound. - This ψυχή psuchē - "psyche" - continued to exist in Hades, and
was supposed to have a definite form there, but could not be seized by
the hands.

Ody. 2:207. See "Passow," 2; compare Prof. Bush, Anasta. pp. 72, 73.
Though this word, however, denotes the vital principle or the animal
life, in man it may be connected with morals - just as the body may be -
for it is a part of himself in his present organization, and whatever
may be true in regard to the inferior creation, it is his duty to bring
his whole nature under law, or so to control it that it may not be an
occasion of sin. Hence the apostle prays that the "whole body and soul"
- or animal nature - may be made holy. This distinction between the
animal life and the mind of man (the "anima" and "animus," the ψυχὴ
psuchē and the πνεῦμα pneuma), was often made by the ancient
philosophers. See Plato, Timae. p. 1048, A. Nemesius, de Nat. Hom. 1
Cited Glyca, p. 70; Lucretius, 3:94; 116, 131; Juvenal, 15:146; Cicero,
de Divinat. 129, as quoted by Wetstein in loc. A similar view prevailed
also among the Jews. rabbi Isaac (Zohar in Lev. fol. 29, 2), says,
"Worthy are the righteous in this world and the world to come, for lo,
they are all holy; their body is holy, their soul is holy, their spirit
and their breath is holy." Whether the apostle meant to sanction this
view, or merely to speak in common and popular language, may indeed be
questioned, but there seems to be a foundation for the language in the
nature of man. The word here rendered "spirit" (πνεῦμα pneuma), refers
to the intellectual or higher nature of man; that which is the seat of
reason, of conscience, and of responsibility. This is immortal. It has
no necessary connection with the body, as animal life or the psyche
(ψυχὴ psuchē) has, and consequently will be unaffected by death. It is
this which distinguishes man from the brute creation; this which allies
him with higher intelligences around the throne of God.

Be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ - The
apostle does not intimate here that either the body or the vital
principle will be admitted to heaven, or will be found in a future state
of being, whatever may be the truth on that subject. The prayer is, that
they might be entirely holy, and be kept from transgression, until the
Lord Jesus should come; that is, until he should come either to remove
them by death, or to wind up the affairs of this lower world; see the
notes on [Th1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md). By his praying
that the "body and the soul" - meaning here the animal nature, the seat
of the affections and passions - might be kept holy, there is reference
to the fact that, connected as they are with a rational and accountable
soul, they may be the occasion of sin. The same natural propensities;
the same excitability of passion; the same affections which in a brute
would involve no responsibility, and have nothing moral in their
character, may be a very different thing in man, who is placed under a
moral law, and who is bound to restrain and govern all his passions by a
reference to that law, and to his higher nature. For a cur to snarl and
growl; for a lion to roar and rage; for a hyena to be fierce and
untameable; for a serpent to hiss and bite, and for the ostrich to leave
her eggs without concern [Job 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014.md),
involves no blame, no guilt for them, for they are not accountable; but
for man to evince the same temper, and the same want of affection, does
involve guilt, for he has a higher nature, and all these things should
be subject to the law which God has imposed on him as a moral and
accountable being. As these things may, therefore, in man be the
occasion of sin, and ought to be subdued, there was a fitness in praying
that they might be "preserved blameless" to the coming of the Saviour;
compare the notes on [Co1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md).

Brethren, pray for us - A request which the apostle often makes; notes
on [Heb 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md). He was a man of like
passions as others: liable to the same temptations; engaged in an
arduous work; often called to meet with opposition, and exposed to peril
and want, and he especially needed the prayers of the people of God. A
minister, surrounded as he is by temptations, is in great danger if he
has not the prayers of his people. Without those prayers, he will be
likely to accomplish little in the cause of his Master. His own
devotions in the sanctuary will be formal and frigid, and the word which
he preaches will be likely to come from a cold and heavy heart, and to
fall also on cold and heavy hearts. There is no way in which a people
can better advance the cause of piety in their own hearts, than by
praying much for their minister.

Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss - see the notes on [Rom

[1 Thessalonians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">th1 5:27</span></span>

I charge you by the Lord - Margin, "adjure." Greek, "I put you under
oath by the Lord" - ενορκίζω ὑμᾶς τὸν Κύριον enorkizō humas ton Kurion.
It is equivalent to binding persons by an oath; see the notes on [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md); compare [Gen
21:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#023.md); [Gen
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003.md), [Gen
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#037.md).

That this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren - To all the
church; compare notes on [Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016.md).
The meaning is, that the Epistle was to be read to the whole church on
some occasion. on which it was assembled together. It was not merely
designed for the individual or individuals into whose hands it might
happen to fall, but as it contained matters of common interest, and was
designed for the whole body of believers at Thessalonica, the apostle
gives a solemn charge that it should not be suppressed or kept from
them. Injunctions of this kind occurring in the Epistles, look as if the
apostles regarded themselves as under the influence of inspiration, and
as having authority to give infallible instructions to the churches.

[1 Thessalonians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">th1 5:28</span></span>

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, ... - notes, [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md).

In regard to the subscription at the close of the Epistle, purporting
that it was written from Athens, see the introduction, section 3. These
subscriptions are of no authority, and the one here, like several
others, is probably wrong.

From the solemn charge in [Th1 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027.md)
that "this epistle should be read to all the holy brethren," that is, to
the church at large, we may infer that it is in accordance with the will
of God that all Christians should have free access to the Holy
Scriptures. What was the particular reason for this injunction in
Thessalonica, is not known, but it is possible that an opinion had begun
to prevail even then that the Scriptures were designed to be kept in the
hands of the ministers of religion, and that their common perusal was to
be prohibited. At all events, whether this opinion prevailed then or
not, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the Holy Spirit, by whom
this Epistle was dictated, foresaw that the time would come when this
doctrine would be defended by cardinals and popes and councils; and that
it would be one of the means by which the monstrous fabric of the Papacy
would be sustained and perpetuated. It is worthy of remark, also, that
the apostle Paul, in his epistles to the Thessalonians, has dwelt more
fully on the fact that the great apostasy would occur under the Papacy,
and on the characteristics of that grand usurpation over the rights of
people, than he has anywhere else in his Epistle; see [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md). It is no improbable supposition
that with reference to that, and to counteract one of its leading
dogmas, his mind was supernaturally directed to give this solemn
injunction, that the contents of the Epistle which he had written should
be communicated without reserve to all the Christian brethren in
Thessalonica. In view of this injunction, therefore, at the close of
this Epistle, we may remark:

\(1\) that it is a subject of express divine command that the people
should have access to the Holy Scriptures. So important was this
considered, that it was deemed necessary to enjoin those who should
receive the word of God, under the solemnities of an oath, and by all
the force of apostolic authority, to communicate what they had received
to others.

\(2\) this injunction had reference to all the members of the church,
for they were all to be made acquainted with the word of God. The
command is, indeed, that it he "read" to them, but by parity of
reasoning it would follow that it was to be in their hands; that it was
to be accessible to them; that it was in no manner to be withheld from
them. Probably many of them could not read, but in some way the contents
of revelation were to be made known to them - and not by preaching only,
but by reading the words of inspiration. No part was to be kept back;
nor were they to be denied such access that they could fully understand
it; nor was it to be insisted on that there should be an authorized
expounder of it. It was presumed that all the members of the church were
qualified to understand what had been written to them, and to profit by
it. It follows therefore,

\(3\) that there is great iniquity in all those decisions and laws which
are designed to keep the Scriptures from the common people. This is
true:

\(a\) in reference to the Papal communion, and to all the ordinances
there which prohibit the free circulation of the Sacred Volume among the
people;

\(b\) it is true of all those laws in slave-holding communities which
prohibit slaves from being taught to read the Scriptures; and,

\(c\) it is true of all the opinions and dogmas which prevail in any
community where the right of "private judgment" is denied, and where
free access to the volume of inspiration is forbidden.

The richest blessing of heaven to mankind is the Bible; and there is no
book ever written so admirably adapted to the common mind, and so fitted
to elevate the sunken, the ignorant, and the degraded. There is no more
decided enemy of the progress of the human race in intelligence, purity,
and freedom, than he who prevents the free circulation of this holy
volume; and there is no sincerer friend of the species than he who
"causes it to be read by all," and who contributes to make it accessible
to all the families and all the inhabitants of the world.
