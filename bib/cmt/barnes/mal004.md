### [Malachi Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 4:1</span></span>

For, behold, the day cometh, which shall burn as an oven - He had
declared the great severance of the God-fearing and the God-blaspheming,
those who served and those who did not serve God; the righteous and the
wicked; now he declares the way and time of the severance, the Day of
Judgment. Daniel had described the fire of that day, [Dan
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md), "The throne (of the Ancient of
days) was a fiery flame; his wheels a burning fire: a fiery stream
issued and came forth from Him: the judgment was set and the books were
opened." Fire is ever spoken of, as accompanying the judgment [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md). "Our God shall come, and shall
not keep silence, a fire shall devour before Him [Isa
66:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md). Behold the Lord will come
with fire: for by fire and by the sword will the Lord plead with all
flesh: [Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md) every man's work
shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall
be revealed by fire: and the fire shall try every man's work, of what
sort it is." Peter tells us that fire will be of this burning world;
[Pe2 3:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md). "the heavens and the
earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto
fire against the day of judgment and perdition of' ungodly men; in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up."

The oven, or furnace, pictures the intensity of the heat, which is white
from its intensity, and darts forth, fiercely, shooting up like a living
creature, and destroying life, as the flame of the fire of
Nebuchadnezzars [Dan 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#022.md) "burning
fiery furnace slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego." The whole world shall be one burning furnace.

And all the proud and all that do wickedly - All those, whom those
complainers pronounced "blessed," [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md), yea and all who should
thereafter be like them (he insists on the universality of the
judgment), "every doer of wickedness," up to that day and those who
should then be, shall be stubble." The proud and mighty, who in this
life were strong as iron and brass, so that no one dared resist them,
but they dared to fight with God, these, in the Day of Judgment, shall
be most powerless, as stubble cannot resist the fire, in an ever-living
death."

That shall leave them neither root nor branch - "i. e. they shall have
no hope of shooting up again to life; that life, I mean, which is worthy
of love, and in glory with God, in holiness and bliss. For when the root
has not been wholly cut away, nor the shoot torn up as from the depth,
some hope is retained, that it may again shoot up. For, as it is written
[Job 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#004.md) :7, 'There is hope of a
tree, if it be cut down, that it will sproul again, and that the tender
branch thereof will not cease.' But if it be wholly torn up from below
and from its very roots, and its shoots be fiercely cut away, all hope,
that it can again shoot up to life, will perish also. So, he saith, will
all hope of the lovers of sin perish. For so the divine Isaiah clearly
announces [Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), "their worm
shall not die and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an
abhorring to all flesh."

[Malachi 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 4:2</span></span>

But (And) unto you, who fear My Name, shall the Sun of Righteousness
arise - It is said of God [Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md),
"The Lord God is a sun and a shield, and [Isa
60:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md), The Lord shall be to thee an
everlasting light, and thy God thy glory; thy sun shall no more go down,
for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light;" and Zacharias, speaking
of the office of John the Baptist in the words of Malachi, "thou shalt
go before the face of the Lord to prepare His way, speaks of [Luk
1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md), [Luk
1:78-79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md). the tender mercy of our God,
whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us, to give light to
them that sit in darkness." "He who is often called Lord and God, and
Angel and Captain of the Lord's host, and Christ and priest and Word and
Wisdom of God and Image, is now called the Sun of Righteousness. He, the
Father promises, will arise, not to all, but to those only who fear His
Name, giving them the light of the Sun of Righteousness, as the reward
of their fear toward Him. This is God the Word Who saith, 'I am the
Light of the world,' Who was 'the Light of every one who cometh into the
world."' Primarily, Malachi speaks of our Lord's second Coming, when
[Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md). "to them that look for Him
shall He appear, a second time unto salvation."

126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005.md); [Psa
149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009)..md) the Old Testament exhibits the
opposite lots of the righteous and the wicked, so here the prophet
speaks of the Day of Judgment, in reference to the two opposite classes,
of which he had before spoken, the proud and evil doers, and the fearers
of God. The title, "the Sun of Righteousness," belongs to both comings ,
"in the first, lie diffused rays of righteousness, whereby He justified
and daily justifies any sinners whatever, who will look to Him, i. e.,
believe in Him and obey Him, as the sun imparts light; joy and life to
all who turn toward it." In the second, the righteousness which He gave,
lie will own and exhibit, cleared from all the misjudgment of the world,
before men and Angels. Yet more, healing is, throughout Holy Scripture,
used of the removal of sickness or curing of wounds, in the individual
or state or Church, and, as to the individual, bodily or spiritual.

So David thanks God, first for the forgiveness [Psa
103:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md), "Who forgiveth all thine
iniquities;" then for healing of his soul, "Who healeth all thy
diseases;" then for salvation, "Who redeemeth thy life from
destruction;" then for the crown laid up for him, "Who crowneth thee
with loving-kindness and tender mercies;" then, with the abiding
sustenance and satisfying joy, "Who satisfieth thy mouth with good
things." Healing then primarily belongs to thin life, in which we are
still encompassed with infirmities, and even His elect and His saints
have still, whereof to be healed. The full then and complete healing of
the soul, the integrity of all its powers will be in the life to come.
There, will be "understanding without error, memory without
forgetfulness, thought without distraction, love without simulation,
sensation without offence, satisfying without satiety, universal health
without sickness." "For through Adam's sin the soul was wounded in
understanding, through obscurity and ignorance; in will, through the
leaning to perishing goods; as concupiscent, through infirmity and
manifold concupiscence. In heaven Christ will heal all these, giving to
the understanding light and knowledge; to the will, constancy in good;
to the desire, that it should desire nothing but what is right and good.
Then too the healing of the seal will be the light of glory, the vision
and fruition of God, and the glorious endowments consequent thereon,
overstreaming all the powers of the soul and therefrom to the body."
"God has made the soul of a nature so mighty, that from its most full
beatitude, which at the end of time is promised to the saints, there
shall overflow to the inferior nature, the body, not bliss, which
belongs to the soul as intelligent and capable of fruition, but the
fullness of health that is, the vigorousness of incorruption."

And ye shall go forth - , as from a prison-house, from the miseries of
this lifeless life, and grow up, or perhaps more probably, bound as the
animal, which has been confined, exults in its regained freedom, itself
full of life and exuberance of delight. So the Psalmist [Psa
149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005.md), "The saints shall exult in
glory." And our Lord uses the like word , as to the way, with which they
should greet persecution to the utmost, for His Name's sake. Swiftness
of motion is one of the endowments of the spiritual body, after the
resurrection; as the angels, to whom the righteous shall be like, [Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md), [Eze
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#014.md) ran and returned as the
appearance of a flash of lightning."

[Malachi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 4:3</span></span>

And ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the
soles of your feet. It shall be a great reversal. He that exalteth
himself shall be abased, and he, that humbleth himself shall be exalted
- Here the wicked often have the pre-eminence. This was the complaint of
the murmurers among the Jews; in the morning of the Resurrection [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md), "the upright shall have
dominion over them." The wicked, he had said, shall be as stubble, and
that day [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md), "shall burn them
up;" here, then, they are as the ashes, the only remnant of the stubble,
as the dust under the feet. "The elect shall rejoice, that they have, in
mercy, escaped such misery. Therefore they shall be kindled
inconceivably with the divine love, and shall from their inmost heart
give thanks unto God." And being thus of one mind with God, and seeing
all things as He seeth, they will rejoice in His judgments, because they
are His. For they cannot have one slightest velleity, other than the
all-perfect Will of God. So Isaiah closes his prophecy [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md), "And they shall go forth, and
look upon the carcases of the men, that have transgressed against Me,
for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and
they shall be an abhorring to all flesh. So [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md). The righteous shall rejoice,
when he seeth the vengeance;" and another Psalmist [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md), "The righteous shall see and
rejoice; and all wickedness shall stop her mouth; and Job [Job
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019.md). The righteous see and are glad,
and the innocent laugh them to scorn."

[Malachi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 4:4</span></span>

Remember ye the law of Moses, My servant - [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md). "The law was our schoolmaster to
bring us unto Christ." They then who were most faithful to the law,
would be most prepared for Christ. But for those of his own day, too,
who were negligent both of the ceremonial and moral law, he says "Since
the judgment of God will be so fearful, remember now unceasingly and
observe the law of God given by Moses."

Which I commanded - o

Unto him for - (literally upon, incumbent upon) all Israel Not Moses
commanded them, but God by His servant Moses; therefore He "would in the
day of judgment take strict account of each, whether they had or had not
kept them. He would glorify those who obeyed, He would condemn those who
disobeyed them." They had asked, "Where is the God of judgment? What
profit, that we have kept the ordinance?" He tells them of the judgment
to come, and bids them take heed, that they did indeed keep them, for
there was a day of account to be held for all.

The statutes and judgments - Better, "statutes and judgments," i. e.,
consisting in them; it seems added as an explanation of the word, law,
individualizing them. Duty is fulfilled, not in a general acknowledgment
of law, or an arbitrary selection of some favorite commandments, which
cost the human will less; as, in our Lord's time, they minutely observed
the law of tithes, but [Mat 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md) :
"omitted weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith." It
is in obedience to the commandments, one by one, one and all. Moses
exhorted to the keeping of the law, under these same words: [Deu
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md), [Deu
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005.md), [Deu
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md), [Deu
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014.md), "Now, therefore hearken, O
Israel, unto the statutes and judgments which I teach you, to do them,
that ye may live. Ye shall not add unto the word that I command you,
neither shall ye diminish it. Behold, I have taught you statutes and
judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me. What nation so great,
that hath statutes and judgments, righteous as all this law, which I set
before you this day? The Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you
statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land, whither ye go
to possess it."

[Malachi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 4:5</span></span>

Behold I will send (I send, as a future, proximate in the prophet's
mind) you Elijah the prophet - The Archangel Gabriel interprets this for
us, to include the sending of John the Immerser. For he not only says
[Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md). that he shall "go before"
the Lord "in the spirit and power of Elias," but describes his mission
in the characteristic words of Malachi, "to turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children:" and those other words also, "and the
disobedient to the wisdom of the just," perhaps represent the sequel in
Malachi, "and the hearts of the children to the fathers;" for their
hearts could only be so turned by conversion to God, whom the fathers,
patriarchs and prophets, knew, loved and served; and whom they served in
name only. John the Immerser, in denying that he was Elias, [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md) denied only, that he was that
great prophet himself. Our Lord, in saying [Mat
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014.md), "This is Elias, which was for
to come [Mat 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#012.md) that Elias is come
already and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they
listed," met the error of the scribes, that He could not be the Christ,
because Elias was not yet come. When He says [Mat
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011.md), "Elias truly shall first come
and restore all things," He implies a coming of Elijah, other than that
of John the Immerser, since he was already martyred, and all things were
not yet restored. This must also be the fullest fulfillment. "For the
great and terrible Day of the Lord" is the Day of Judgment, of which all
earthly judgments, however desolating, (as the destruction of Jerusalem)
are but shadows and earnests. Before our Lord's coming all things looked
on to His first coming, and, since that coming, all looks on to the
second, which is the completion of the first and of all things in time.

Our Lord's words, "Elias truly shall first come and restore all things,"
seem to me to leave no question, that, as John the Immerser came, in the
spirit and power of Elias, before His first coming, so, before the
second coming, Elijah should come in person, as Jews and Christians have
alike expected. This has been the Christian expectation from the first.
Justin Martyr asked his opponent "Shall we not conceive that the Word of
God has proclaimed Elias to be the forerunner of the great and terrible
day of His second Coming?" "Certainly," was Trypho's reply. Justin
continues, "Our Lord Himself taught us in His own teaching that this
very thing shall be, when the said that 'Elias also shall come;' and we
know that this shall be fulfilled, when He is about to come from heaven
in glory." Tertullian says "Elias is to come again, not after a
departure from life, but after a translation; not to be restored to the
body, from which he was never taken; but to be restored to the world,
from which he was translated; not by way of restoration to life, but for
the completion of prophecy; one and the same in name and in person."
"Enoch and Elias were translated, and their death is not recorded, as
being deferred; but they are reserved as to die, that they may vanquish
Antichrist by their blood."

And, in proof that the end was not yet , "No one has yet received Elias;
no one has yet fled from Antichrist." And the ancient author of the
verses against Marcion; , "Elias who has not yet tasted the debt of
death, because he is again to come into the world." Origen says simply
in one place, that the Saviour answered the question as to the objection
of the Scribes, "not annulling what had been handed down concerning
Elias, but affirming that there was another coming of Elias before
Christ, unknown to the scribes, according to which, not knowing him,
and, being in a manner, accomplices in his being cast into prison by
Herod and slain by him, they had done to him what they listed."
Hippolytus has , "As two Comings of our Lord and Saviour were indicated
by the Scriptures, the first in the flesh, in dishonor, that He might be
set at naught - the second in glory, when He shall come from heaven with
the heavenly host and the glory of the Father - so two forerunners were
pointed out, the first, John, the son of Zacharias, and again - since He
is manifested as Judge at the end of the world, His forerunners must
first appear, as He says through Malachi, 'I will send to you Elias the
Tishbite before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come. '"

Hilary , "The Apostles inquire in anxiety about the times of Elias. To
whom He answereth, that "Elias will come and restore all things," that
is, will recall to the knowledge of God, what he shall find of Israel;
but he signifies that John came "in the spirit and power of Elias," to
whom they had shown all severe and harsh dealings, that, foreannouncing
the Coming of the Lord, he might be a forerunner of the Passion also by
an example of wrong and harass." "We understand that those same prophets
(Moses and Elias) will come before His Coming, who, the Apocalypse of
John says, will be slain by Antichrist, although there are various
opinions of very many, as to Enoch or Jeremiah, that one of them is to
die, as Elias."

Hilary the Deacon, 355 a.d., has on the words, "I suppose God hath set
forth us the Apostles last;" "He therefore applies these to his own
person, because he was always in distress, suffering, beyond the rest,
persecutions and distresses, as Enoch and Elias will suffer, who will be
Apostles at the last time. For they have to be sent before Christ, to
make ready the people of God, and fortify all the Churches to resist
Antichrist, of whom the Apocalypse attests, that they will suffer
persecutions and be slain." "When the faithless shall be secure of the
kingdom of the devil, the saints, i. e., Enoch and Elias being slain,
rejoicing in the victory, and 'sending gifts, one to another' as the
Apocalypse says [Rev 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md) sudden
destruction shall come upon them. For Christ at His Coming, shall
destroy them all." Gregory of Nyssa quotes the prophecy under the
heading, that "before the second Coming of our Lord, Elias should come."

Ambrose , "Because the Lord was to come down from heaven, and to ascend
to heaven, He raised Elias to heaven, to bring him back to the earth at
the time He should please." "The beast, Antichrist, ascends from the
abyss to fight against Elias and Enoch and John, who are restored to the
earth for the testimony to the Lord Jesus, as we read in the Apocalypse
of John."

Jerome gives here the mystical meaning; "God will send, in Elias (which
is interpreted 'My God' and wire is of the town Thisbe, which signifies
'conversion' or 'penitence') the whole choir of the prophets, "to
convert the heart of the fathers to the sons," namely, Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob and all the patriarchs, that their posterity may believe in
the Lord the Saviour, in whom themselves believed: 'for Abraham saw the
day of the Lord and was glad.'" Here, he speaks of the "coming of Elias
before their anointed," as a supposition of Jews and Judaizing heretics.
But in commenting on our Lord's words in Matthew, he adheres twice to
the literal meaning. On [Mat 11:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014.md),
"Some think that John is therefore called Elias, because, as, according
to Malachi, at the second coming of the Saviour. On [Mat
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011.md), Elias will precede and
announce the Judge to come, so did John at His first coming, and each is
a messenger, of the first or second coming of the Lord:" and again
concisely, On [Mat 17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011.md), "He who
is to come in the second Coining of the Saviour in the actual body, now
comes through John in spirit and power;" and he speaks of Enoch and
Elias as "the two witnesses in the Revelation, since, according to the
Apocalypse of John, Enoch and Elias are spoken of, as having to die."

Chrysostom , "When He saith that Elias "cometh and shall restore all
things," He means Elias himself, and the conversion of the Jews, which
shall then be; but when He saith, "which was to come," He calls John,
Elias, according to the manner of his ministry."

In Augustine's time it was the universal belief. , "When he (Malachi)
had admonished them to remember the law of Moses, because he foresaw,
that they would for a long time not receive it spiritually, as it ought,
he added immediately; "And I will send you Elias the Thisbite" etc. That
when, through this Elias, the great and wonderful prophet, at the last
time before the judgment, the law shall have been expounded to them, the
Jews shall believe in the true Christ, i. e., in our Christ, is
everywhere in the mouths and hearts of the faithful. For not without
reason is it hoped, that he shall come before the Coming of the Saviour,
as Judge, because not without reason is it believed that he still lives.
For he was carried in a chariot of fire from things below; which
Scripture most evidently attests. When he shall come then, by expounding
the law spiritually, which the Jews now understand carnally, he shall
turn the heart of the fathers to the children."

Cyril of Alexandria, his antagonist "Theodoret, and Theodore" of
Mopsuestia, who was loose from all tradition, had the same clear belief.
Cyril; "It is demonstrative of the gentleness and long-suffering of God,
that Elias also the Tishbite shall shine upon us, to foreannounce when
the Judge shall come to those in the whole world. For the Son shall come
down, as Judge, in the glory of the Father, attended by the angels, and
shall 'sit on the throne of His glory, judging the world in
righteousness, and shall reward every man according to his works.' But
since we are in many sins, well is it for us, that the divine prophet
goes before Him, bringing all those on earth to one mind; that all,
being brought to the unity through the faith, and ceasing from evil
intents, may fulfill that which is good, and so be saved when the Judge
cometh down. The blessed John the Baptist came before Him "in the spirit
and power of Elias." But, as he preached saying, 'Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make His paths straight,' so also the divine Elias proclaims
His then being near and all-but-present, that He may 'judge the world in
righteousness.'" Theodoret; , "Malachi teaches us how, when Antichrist
shall presume on these things, the great Elias shall appear, preaching
to the Jews the coming of Christ: and he shall convert many, for this is
the meaning of, "he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the
children," i. e., the Jews (for these he calls fathers, as being older
in knowledge) to those who believed from the Gentiles. They who shall
believe through the preaching of the great Elias, and shall join
themselves to the Gentiles who seized the salvation sent to them, shall
become one church.

He hints, how when these things are done by Antichrist, Michael the
Archangel will set all in motion, that Elias should come and
foreannounce the coming of the Lord that the then Jews may obtain
salvation." And on this place, "Knowing well, that they would neither
obey the law, nor receive Him when He came, but would deliver Him to be
crucified, He promises them, in His unspeakable love for man, that He
will again send Elias as a herald of salvation, 'Lo, I will send you
Elias the Tishbite.' And signifying the time, He added, 'Before the
great and terrible day of the Lord shall come:' He named the Day of His
Second Coming. But He teaches us, what the great Elias shall do, when he
comes, 'Who shall bring back the heart of the father to the son' etc.
And pointing out the end, for which Elias should first come, 'Lest I
come and smite the earth utterly.' For lest, finding you all in
unbelief, I send you all to that endless punishment, Elias will first
come, and will persuade you, O Jews, to unite you indissolubly with
those, who from the Gentiles believe in Me, and to be united to My one
Church."

Theodore of Mopsuestia paraphrases: "In addition to all which I have
said, I give you this last commandment, to remember My law, which I gave
to all Israel through Moses, plainly declaring what they ought to do in
each thing, and as the first token of obedience, to receive the Lord
Christ when He cometh, appearing for the salvation of all men: Who will
end the law, but show His own perfection. It had been well, had you
immediately believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses
and all the prophets signified, Who should put an end to the law, and
reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to
all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of
the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great
goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He
manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed
Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He
will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated
from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the
fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all
men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness,
shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with
the godly thence ensuing."

"The African author of the work on the promises and predictions of God."
(between 450 and 455 a.d.)

, "Against Antichrist shall be sent two witnesses, the prophets Enoch
and Elijah, against whom shall arise three false prophets of
Antichrist."

Isidore of Seville 595 a.d.; , "Elias, borne in a chariot of fire,
ascended to heaven, to come according to the prophet Malachi at the end
of the world, and to precede Christ, to announce His last coming, with
great deeds and wondrous signs, so that, on earth too, Antichrist will
war against him, be against him, or him who is to come with him, and
will slay them; their bodies also will lie unburied in the streets.
Then, raised by the Lord, they will smite the kingdom of Antichrist with
a great blow. After this, the Lord will come, and will slay Antichrist
with the word of His mouth, and those who worshiped him." , "This will
be in the last times, when, on the preaching of Elias, Judah will be
converted to Christ."

To add one more, for his great gifts, Gregory the Great. , "It is
promised, that when Elias shall come, he shall bring back the hearts of
the sons to their fathers, that the doctrine of the old, which is now
taken from the hearts of the Jews, may, in the mercy of God, return,
when the sons shall begin to understand of the Lord God, what the
fathers taught." , "Although Elias is related to have been carried to
heaven, he deferred, he did not escape, death. For it is said of him by
the mouth of the Truth Himself, 'Elias shall come and restore all
things.' He shall come to 'restore all things;' for to this end is he
restored to this world, that he may both fulfill the office of
preaching, and pay the debt of the flesh." , "The holy Church, although
it now loses many through the shock of temptation, yet, at the end of
the world, it receives its own double, when, having received the
Gentiles to the full, all Judaea too, which shall then be, agrees to
hasten to its faith. For hence it is written, "Until the fullness of the
Gentiles shall come, and so all Israel shall be saved."

Hence, in the Gospel the Truth says, "Elias shall come and shall restore
all things." For now the Church has lost the Israelites, whom it could
not convert by preaching; but then, at the preaching of Elias, while it
collects all which it shall find, it receives in a manner more fully
what it has lost." , "John is spoken of as to come in the spirit and
power of Elias, because, as Elias shall precede the second Coming of the
Lord, so John preceded His first. For as Elias will come, as precursor
of the Judge, so John was made the precursor of the Redeemer. John then
was Elias in spirit; he was not Elias in person. What then the Lord
owned as to spirit, that John denies as to the person."

Whether Elijah is one of the two witnesses spoken of in the Apocalypse,
is obviously a distinct question. Of commentators on the Apocalypse,
Arethas remarks that as to Elijah, there is clear testimony from Holy
Scripture, this of Malachi; but that, with regard to Enoch, we have only
the fact of his being freed from death by translation, and the tradition
of the Church. John Damascene fixed the belief in the Eastern Church. In
the West, Bede e. g., who speaks of the belief that the two witnesses
were Elijah and Enoch, as what was said by "some doctors," takes our
Lord's declaration, that Elijah shall return, in its simple meaning. (on
[Mat 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011); Mark 9..md) Yet it was no
matter of faith. When the belief as to a personal Antichrist was changed
by Luther and Calvin, the belief of a personal forerunner of Christ gave
way also.

[Malachi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 4:6</span></span>

And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children - Now they
were unlike, and severed by that unlikeness from each other. Yet not on
earth, for on earth parents and children were alike alienated from God,
and united between themselves in wickedness or worldliness. The common
love of the world or of worldly pursuits, or gain or self-exaltation, or
making a fortune or securing it, is, so far, a common bond of interest
to those of one family, through a common selfishness, though that
selfishness is the parent of general discord, of fraud, violence, and
other misdeeds. Nay, conversion of children or parents becomes rather a
source of discord, embittering the unconverted. Whence our Lord says,
"Think not, that I [Mat 10:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md). am
come to send peace on the earth. I came not to send peace on earth, but
a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law: and a man's foes shall be they of his own household;" a
prophecy fulfilled continually in the early persecutions, even to the
extent of those other words of our Lord [Mat
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#021.md), "the brother shall deliver up
the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall
rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death."

It is fulfilled also in the intense hatred of the Jews at this day, to
any who are converted to Christ; a hatred which seems to have no
parallel in the world. Nor do the words seem to mean that fathers and
children should be united in one common conversion to God, as one says
Ibn Ezra. The Jews, although mostly agreed, that Elijah will come, are
disagreed as to the end of his coming. By some he is spoken of as a
Redeemer. Tanchuma (f. 31. 1), "God said to Israel, In this world I sent
an angel to east out the nations before you, but in the future (or, in
the world to come, Yalkut Shim'oni f. 98-29) myself will lead you and
will 'send you Elijah the prophet.'" Pesikta rabbathi (in Yalkut
Shim'oni ii. f. 32. 4)" Both redeemed Israel: Moses in Egypt, and Elias
in that which is to come." (Id. ib. f. 53. 2), "I send you a redeemer."
Midrash Shocher tof Ibid. f. 884, "Israel said, 'It is written of the
first redemption, 'He sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had chosen;
send me two like them.' God answered; 'I will send you Elijah the
prophet: this is one, the other is he, of whom Isaiah spoke [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). Behold, my servant whom I have
chosen.'" "Shemoth Rabba (Sect. 3. col. 108. 2. ad loc.) 'In the second
redemption, ye shall be healed and redeemed by the word I, i. e., I will
send." Or, as a comforter, "I will send you Elias, he shall come and
comfort you." Debarim rabba sect. 3. fin. Or to pronounce some things
clean, others unclean. Shir hashirim rabba f. 27. 3. (all the above in
Schottgen ad loc.) Others, in different ways, to settle, to Which tribe
each belongs. Kimchi on Ezek. 47 and this with differcut explanations as
to strictness. (See Edaioth fin. Mishnah T. iv. p. 362. Surenhus.)
"Rabbi Simeon says, 'To remove controversies.' And the wise and doctors
say, To make peace in the world, as is said, "Behold I send." Rabbi
Abraham ben David explains the peace to be "from the nations," and adds,
"to announce to them the coming of the redeemer, and this in one day
before the coming of the Messiah;" and to "turn the hearts etc." he
explains "the hearts of the fathers and children (on whom softness had
fallen from fear, and they fled, some here, some there, from their
distresses) on that day they shall return to their might and to one
another and shall comfort each other." Abarbanel says, that Elijah shall
be the instrument of the resurrection, and that, through those who rise,
the race of man shall be directed in the recognition of God and the true
faith." Ibn. Ezra, "that he shall come at the collection of the
captives, as Moses at the redemption of Egypt, not for the
resurrection." (These are collected by Frischmuth de Elite adventu.
Thes. Theol. Phil. V. T. T. i. pp. 1070ff) R. Tanehum, from Maimonides,
says, "This is without doubt a promise of the appearance of a prophet in
Israel, a little before the coming of the Messiah; and some of the wise
think that it is Elias the Tishbite himself, and this is found in most
of the Midrashoth, and some think that it is a prophet like him in rank,
occupying his place in the knowledge of God and the manifesting His Name
and that so he is called Elijah. And so explained the great Gaon, Rab
Mosheh ben Matmon, at the end of his great book on jurisprudence, called
'Mishneh Torah.' And, perhaps he (the person sent) may be Messiah ben
Joseph, as he says again - And the exactness of the matter in these
promises will only be known, when they appear: and no one has therein
any accredited account, but each of them says what he says, according to
what appears to him, and what preponderates in his mind of the
explanation of the truth." "The turning of the heart of the father to
the children," he explains to be, "the restoration of religion, until
all should be of one heart in the obedience to God.") "All shall be one
heart to return to the Lord, both fathers and children;" for he speaks
primarily of their mutual conversion to one another, not to God.

The form of the expression seems to imply that the effect of the
preaching of Elijah shall be, to bring back the children, the Jews then
in being, to the faith and love which their fathers, the patriarchs,
had; that [Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md) "as these
believed, hoped for, longed exceedingly for, and loved Christ to come,
so their sons should believe, hope in, long exceedingly for and love
Christ, Who was come, yea is present; and so the heart of fathers, which
before was turned from their unbelieving children, he should turn to
them, now believing, and cause the patriarchs to own and love the Jews
believing in Christ, as indeed their children, for 'your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day; he saw it and was glad, Christ saith. '"

Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse - , i. e., with an utter
destruction, from which there should be no redemption. In the end, God
will so smite the earth, and all, not converted to Him. The prayer and
zeal of Elijah will gain a reprieve, in which God will spare the world
for the gathering of His own elect, the full conversion of the Jews,
which shall fulfill the Apostle's words [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), "So shall all Israel be saved."

After the glad tidings, Malachi, and the Old Testament in him, ends with
words of awe, telling us of the consequence of the final hardening of
the heart; the eternal severance, when the unending end of the
everlasting Gospel itself shall be accomplished, and its last grain
shall be gathered into the garner of the Lord. The Jews, who would be
wiser than the prophet, repeat the previous verse , because Malachi
closes so awfully. The Maker of the heart of man knew better the hearts
which He had made, and taught their authors to end the books of Isaiah
and Ecclesiastes with words of awe, from which man's heart so struggles
to escape. To turn to God here, or everlasting destruction from His
presence there, is the only choice open to thee." "Think of this, when
lust goads thee, or ambition solicits thee, or anger convulses thee, or
the flesh blandishes thee, or the world allures thee, or the devil
displays his deceitful pomp and enticement. In thy hand and thy choice
are life and death, heaven and hell, salvation and damnation, bliss or
misery everlasting. Choose which thou willest. Think, 'A moment which
delighteth, eternity which tortureth;' on the other hand, 'a moment
which tortureth, eternity which delighteth.'"

"I see that all things come to an end:

Thy commandment is exceeding broad."

[Psa 119:96](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#096.md)

"As the hart panteth after the water brooks,

So panteth my soul after Thee, O God."
